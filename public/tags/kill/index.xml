killing bugs such as bed bugs
. But�does the dryer kill <a href="/posts/how-long-does-it-take-for-steam-to-kill-fleas/">fleas</a>?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well, in summary, YES, the high temperatures in a dryer do <a href="/posts/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/">kill</a> fleas plus all their babies including eggs and flea larvae on your clothes, curtains, and bedding.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>So, launder the clothing and other fabrics 10 minutes at temperatures of ~ 95F (35C). Finally, undertake the garment drying (at the highest temperature) to kill the fleas and other bugs.�</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-does-the-dryer-kill-fleas">Details: Does The Dryer Kill Fleas?</h2>
<p>Besides killing the adult fleas,
dryers will also exterminate flea eggs (on your fabric, clothes, stuffed animals, and bedding) prior to the hatching.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas will largely get into your home via those pets -treat these while controlling the fleas. The bugs will largely hide around your bedding, carpet, and various soft surfaces.
To effectively control the fleas in your spaces, you&rsquo;ll require to wash and dry the washable items, plus flea-treat the pets and floors. Fleas will jump from the washed items into that hot dryer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-tokill-fleas-using-a-dryer">How to�Kill Fleas Using a Dryer?</h2>
<h3 id="1-machine-wash-the-clothes">1. Machine Wash the Clothes</h3>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to machine-wash the clothes with the hottest allowable water for that fabric.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, ensure to only use the regular detergent.
Such a process will remove many of the flea eggs plus the adult fleas</li>
<li>this is before you take the fabrics into your dryer. Therefore, the flea-killing process will be easier since there will be the preliminary killing off the bugs using machine washing and detergent.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-dry-the-fabrics-at-high-heat">2. Dry the Fabrics at High Heat</h3>
<p>Load the damp clothes, bedding, or fabric onto your
dryer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, set the temperature of the dryer to the highest allowablefor the clothes or fabric loaded.
Caution, drying the fabrics at that temperature will imply that the cloths may shrink.
However, using the hot dryer is a critical step as the high temperature is what will kill the flea eggs and adult fleas.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UYQ4rbwsEM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UYQ4rbwsEM</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-full-cycle-dryer-running---kill-fleas">3. Full Cycle Dryer Running - Kill Fleas</h3>
<p>So, simply, YES, fleas will be killed by the high heat and ( extremely high temperatures) in the dryer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note, you must run that fabric dryer through a full cycle.
This will ensure that the clothes and fabrics in the dryer are fully dried - this will exterminate fleas &amp; adult fleas.
To remove the fleas from your apartment and home, you&rsquo;ll require to flea-treat the washable items, pets, and flooring.</li>
<li>Fleas will die at high dryer temperatures - above 35C (95F ) and also in colder temperatures - under 8C (46.4F).
Fi
nally, the flea larvae and flea eggs (all immature fleas) will very sensitive to cold temperatures under 13C (55.4F).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-that-clothes-dryer">In that Clothes Dryer</h2>
<p>As noted, the dryer heat will kill fleas - you&rsquo;ll eject the
fleas from their hiding places
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laundering your clothes &amp; fabric with detergent plus water will wash off (after drowning) the fleas.
The heat and the drying will make the flea (plus flea eggs) desiccate and finally die.
Fleas will
die from drowning
, washer detergent, dryer heat - the bugs will be dehydrated but also the dryers&rsquo; intense movements will cause physical harm to the fleas.
So, when you find some of these fleas or their eggs lurking around your house, ensure to put the bed sheets, clothes, fabrics, cushion covers, and bedding into that hot dryer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hot-water-will-kill-fleas"><strong>Hot Water Will Kill fleas</strong>!</h2>
<p>Hot water either in the washing machine or basin will kill the fleas - particularly when its temperature is over 95F.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you can throw those flea-infested clothes, bedding, and fabric into some hot water to exterminate the fleas.
For
the flea larvae
, flea eggs, and eggs will drown and die in water - even better if the water is hot.
But ensure you clean the pet&rsquo;s clothes and then bathe your pets for fleas - in addition to using these methods to kill the fleas on those pets.
<strong>a. Washer with Soapy Hot Water�</strong>
Use some effective bleach and detergent to exterminate those flea larvae, flea eggs, and adult fleas too.</li>
<li>Further, the dryer will produce turbulence to kill those fleasalso combined with its hot water.
Therefore, the clothes washer won&rsquo;t exterminate the fleas without using the dryer - as the latter will produce extreme heat and turbulence.
<strong>b. Use Dish Soap + Water�</strong>
Next, use
dawn dish soap
to exterminate the remaining fleas - the fleas will drown due to the dish soap - these bugs are lightweight, and their body size is small.</li>
<li>Further, the fleas will drown in the soapy water - due to a broken down surface tension.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="launder-or-dry-the-fabric-having-fleas">Launder or Dry the Fabric Having Fleas</h2>
<p>Drying and laundering will help you exterminate those flea larvae,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-flea-dirt/">flea dirt</a>
, and flea eggs. So, here&rsquo;s how to launder and dry those
clothes, and beddings.
<strong>a.</strong>
First, wash those fabrics you have for about ten minutes. Make sure the temperature at washing is around 140F - clean all the attire and beddings.
<strong>b.</strong>
Next, ensure to re-wash &amp;�re-wash the garments, fabrics, and bedding - this should be redone roughly 3 times - ensure the washer machine temperature is around 140F - wash for roughly 3-10 minutes.</p>
<p>The repeated washing will help clean the bugs and their eggs from the bedding and clothes before you kick start the drying process.
<strong>c.</strong>
For the white fabrics and garments, you&rsquo;ll require to use some bleaching agent. The chlorine will poison or erode the skin of those bugs including fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put those beddings and garments in that dryer - and ensure to set the dryer at its highest heat.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Will flea eggs, larvae, and adult fleas die in that dryer? Well, yes, at the highest allowable heat setting on the dryer, you&rsquo;ll kill those fleas in the fabric, cloth, stuffed animals, clothes, and bedding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, exposing the fleas to soap and heat will exterminate the bugs in all their life stages.</li>
<li>So, combined with using the dyer, soap, and heat will kill those fleas.
Before drying, launder the fabrics at
140F for roughly 10 minutes - and finally dry those clothes at that highest heat.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually, the first line of defense against ants is some sort of poison that will kill them and keep them from coming back.</p>
<p>But you can also make an ant trap with borax, or you could use some bait like sugar and honey. So, how long does it take for
<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Kill-Ants-Using-Borax">borax to work</a>
?</p>
<p>Some people prefer
Borax Flea Killer
for its natural properties. How long does it take for borax to kill ants?</p>
<ul>
<li>**Simple answer, 24-48 hours. The ****ingredient in the borax ****bait damages the ants&rsquo; digestive system and it&rsquo;ll kill the ant in <strong><strong>24-48 hours</strong></strong>. **</li>
<li>**Borax is an effective ant poison is because it takes a long time for the chemicals in the borax to kill ants. **</li>
<li>**Within 24-48 hours, often ants will eat the borax bait and share it (especially the <strong><strong>worker ants</strong></strong>) with the queen and other ants in the colony. **
That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll be exploring in this article!

</ul>
<h2 id="details-how-long-does-it-take-for-borax-to-kill-ants">Details: How Long Does It Take For Borax to Kill Ants?</h2>
<p>For an ant, it can take anywhere from 24-48 hours to die after eating borax or boric acid bait.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax can kill ants, but the ants do their work for you. Forager or worker ants will carry the borax bait back to their nests and share it with other ants.
Though it may take anywhere from 24-48 hours, the ants will feed and share the borax amongst themselves; this will gradually kill off an entire colony of ants, eventually killing their queen.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="does-sprinkling-borax-help-kill-ants">Does Sprinkling Borax Help Kill Ants?</h2>
<p><strong>NO</strong>
. Sprinkling borax around your home won&rsquo;t kill ants. If you want to get rid of ants using borax, the insects have to eat it! That&rsquo;s where the borax ant bait comes in.</p>
<p>People often wonder if sprinkling borax on their lawn will get rid of ants. Sprinkle the borax powder around your yard, near ant mounds and other places where ants are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle borax or mix honey in the mixture with borax and then sprinkle in places where ants will find it.</li>
<li>Sprinkling borax may be a quick fix for ants but when sprinkled on the ground, it can also kill grass and plants.
<em>Entry points for ants include;</em></li>
<li>Utility Lines</li>
<li>Flooring Holes</li>
<li>Doors and windows</li>
<li>Exhaust Fans and Dryer Vents</li>

There are a few signs that can help you determine whether or not ants have invaded your home.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Look for ant mounds: Ants will make small, dome-shaped hills out of the dirt in order to live. As time goes on these mounds become more frequent and larger; they may also be close together as the colony grows over time.</li>
<li>Look for ant trails: If you see long lines of tiny insects wandering aimlessly around your house then that&rsquo;s a big sign an infestation is underway - and something needs to be done! These trails will sometimes lead up walls or seem like they&rsquo;re going nowhere at all these ants might be looking for food or nesting areas; other times theres actually nothing going on, and the ants are just exploring.</li>
<li>If you think your home is infested with ants: You&rsquo;ll need to look for any sources of food or water that might be attracting them - like crumbs from a forgotten piece of toast, sugar stuck in small crevices around counters, or sipping some spilled milk. The best way to tackle an ant invasion is by eliminating these temptations first before applying other methods (like sprinkling borax).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget about traps! Setting up bait stations near entrances can help stop new invaders from coming inside which will ultimately make things much easier down the road. Ants also don&rsquo;t seem to recognize many scents as dangerous so using peppermint oil may not work; you can also use cinnamon oil, which has been proven to be very effective.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re done inspecting and bait-setting up, it&rsquo;s time to start the borax treatment plan by sprinkling some on every surface that ants are known to crawl: Your kitchen countertops and floors, windowsills, window ledges (make sure not do this if your home is in a high rise because they&rsquo;ll just walk right off), under furniture legs where pets like to sleep or eat; anywhere there might be crumbs for them to feast on.

<h2 id="how-to-do-ant-baiting">How to Do Ant Baiting</h2>
<p>On ant baiting, here are a few tips for getting ants to take your bait back to the colony, which will help ensure that you dont have any ants come back.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid ant sprays - Sprays are an effective insecticide for killing any type of pest, but should not be used around ant baits. Spraying near your ants&rsquo; bait usually deters or repels them from eating it.</li>
<li>Positions baits on trails - To work successfully, ant bait must be situated near trails. Ants often forage in groups or &ldquo;trails.&rdquo; If you can locate where the ants are trailing, this is an ideal location to place and best bait.</li>
<li>Remove Harborage places - Ants will nest in dark places where they are well hidden, like in the yard or leaf piles. So, frequently clean up and make sure your house is not cluttered.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t disturb - Don&rsquo;t kill ants that come around the borax bait. These are scouts who help find food for their colonies - they will carry the bait on their back to their nest.</li>
<li>Remove food sources - Keep your home as clean as possible in order to help prevent ants from coming into contact with any food sources. Also, store all of your food inside containers that have tight-fitting lids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-borax-kill-the-queen-ant">Will borax kill the queen ant?</h2>
<p>Borax or boric acid combined with a sugary substance to make a liquid bait will kill adult�ants including the queen.</p>
<ul>
<li>But to kill ant larvae, create a borax bait with white sugar and borax (at a ratio of 1:1) and mix these ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed.</li>
<li>The larvae are more sensitive than adult ants so this mixture is lethal for them and also kills some insects such as termites.</li>
<li>Place baits on ant trails. This includes any surfaces where ants are found, such as railings, sidewalks, and walls.
For best results use this method during the late evening when all types of ants are present and feeding but before midnight because that is when most immature stages die off naturally.</li>
<li>Also, leave out baits containing sugar after sunset since these become ineffective at night unless you add another attractant (such as sugary aphid honeydew) which will only work for ants that are attracted to sweet substances.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="does-20-mule-team-borax-kill-ants">Does 20 Mule Team Borax kill ants?</h2>
<p>Mixing 20 Mule Team Borax with sugar in a ratio as close to your count (for example if you have 50 ants then make it half sugar and half Borax) so each ant eats its share and dies.</p>
<p>20 Mule Team Borax is very good at controlling a wide variety of insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Or perhaps it might be easier just to use borax, which you can find in stores.

<h2 id="how-does-terro-ant-baits-kill-ants">How Does TERRO Ant Baits Kill Ants?</h2>
<p>TERRO liquid ant baits are pesticide-free bait that will attract and kill ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alkaline borax is an ingredient found in many different products, but its safe to assume that having water close to boiling temperature will quickly solve any household ants coming into contact with your cereal, oatmeal or spices.
The poison causes the ant&rsquo;s stomach to burst, killing almost instantly. Ants soon starve from lack of energy and die as their digestive tract shuts down due to this persistent source of alkaloid poison (borate).</li>
</ul>
<p>The borax in the bait will eventually kill the worker ants. However, it works slowly enough to allow for a few trips by a foraging ant before the effect is lethal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the course of a few days, you will likely start to see lower numbers of ants in your home or around the bait.
When using an ant bait station, it is important not to disturb the bait until the ants are fully fed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On how long does it take for borax to kill ants: BORAX WORKS! Will Borax Kill The Queen Ant?</p>
<p>Yes! It Works Slow Enough That Allows For Trips By A Foraging Ant Before Effect Is Lethal.</p>

      <description>Fleas will attack your</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/best-steam-cleaner-for-fleas/">Fleas</a> will attack your
carpets, furniture, and clothing
in your home - quickly growing into a major problem. Many homeowners turn to pesticides to remove fleas, but some may be harmful to humans and pets. However, hot &amp; pressurized <a href="/posts/does-steam-cleaning-kill-fleas/">steam</a> is a suitable, non-chemical method to kill fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>But on the question of how long that steam will take to kill the fleas depends on different factors such as the duration of exposure and the steam temperature - you may still need to vacuum.
So, in this post, I&rsquo;ll outline the time steam requires to kill these fleas. Further, I&rsquo;ll recommend the most
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-steam-cleaner-for-fleas/">suitable steam cleaner</a>
that I&rsquo;ve found so far for removing fleas and cleaning.
<strong>Typically, exposing fleas to steam at a temperature of 203F (95C) for a minimum of 30 seconds can kill both adult fleas and their eggs. But positing the steam hose for a long time such as 2 minutes on an area that has fleas will kill all these bugs.�</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="review-how-long-does-it-take-for-steam-to-kill-fleas"><strong>Review: How Long Does It Take For Steam to Kill Fleas</strong></h2>
<p>Steam at 203F (95C) will kill both adult fleas and fleas eggs in about 30 seconds.� However, exterminators recommend that you vacuum the spaces to be steamed - this should be done prior to and after the flea steaming process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, you should use natural repellents such as peppermint or eucalyptus, flea insecticides, andvacuuming- which will help thwart a re-infestation of the area with the bugs.</li>
<li>I also recommend that you steam-treat the areas or surfaces in 2-3 weeks&rsquo; time - this will assist in exterminating any adult fleas or fleas eggs that may not have been killed in the first treatment.
To get the best out of the steam cleaners, ensure to pick one that has many cleaning accessories to ensure you get the many hidden areas of your house - which fleas tend to hide.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-steam-to-kill-fleas-step-by-step"><strong>Using Steam to Kill Fleas: Step by Step</strong></h2>
<p>Steam will be super effective in killing fleas as it&rsquo;ll readily penetrate the fibers on your bedding materials, furniture, and carpets. Exposing the fleas to the high-temperate steam will dehydrate the bug&rsquo;s body while also denaturing its proteins.</p>
<p>Besides, steam will kill flea larvae and flea eggs - these life stages are quite challenging to exterminate using other methods. Below I outline the steps you&rsquo;ll require to take while using Steam to attempt to kill fleas.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-vacuuming-thoroughly"><strong>Step 1: Vacuuming thoroughly�</strong></h3>
<p>First, before you begin steaming, I recommend you undertake a thorough vacuuming of the spaces that are affected. Unlike steaming, vacuuming will be more thorough in killing all flea lifecycle from the surfaces such as furniture and carpets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides killing the flea&rsquo;s eggs and adult fleas, vacuuming will also loosen all the flea larvae that may have plowed itself deed into the fibers of the upholstery or carpet.
Get a filter with high efficiency and make sure the vacuum machine has strong suction - this will help in removing flea eggs and adult fleas. After vacuuming, ensure to empty the machine&rsquo;s canister as this will dispose of the flea eggs and adult fleas that would escape and hide in various locations in the house.</li>
<li>Once vacuuming is done for the various surfaces, you may now cross over to using steam to remove any remaining fleas eggs, adult fleas, or flea larvae.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-pump-up-your-steam-cleaner"><strong>Step 2: Pump up your Steam Cleaner�</strong></h3>
<p>After you&rsquo;re done with the vacuuming, it&rsquo;s now time to pump up that steam cleaner to remove any of the flea eggs. Adult fleas, or larvae that may be remaining.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by checking the machine&rsquo;s instructions - for example, you&rsquo;ll need to examine the level of water to use - some of these instructions will ensure you don&rsquo;t injure anyone or also damage the steam cleaner.
The steamer requires you to use some distilled water since this kind of water has minimal impurities and minerals. Such impurities, mainly found in tap water, will clog and damage the machine. So, using distilled water will ensure the steam cleaner will last longer compared to using tap water.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest you use some containers as measuring cups to fill the steamer with the distilled water - but ensure you won&rsquo;t overfill the steamer&rsquo;s water tank since you don&rsquo;t want to have leakages.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-applying-steam-on-surfaces"><strong>Step 3: Applying Steam on Surfaces�</strong></h3>
<p>Next, its now time to steam the surfaces to deal with the fleas, odors, and stains. Ensure to have a nozzle that&rsquo;s high-pressure and that the steamer has a powerful motor.</p>
<p>Apply the high-pressure steam beginning with locations that are very far from the room&rsquo;s entrance - target the bedding, furniture, and carpet too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to point the steam nozzle onto the targeted areas for about 5 seconds - allowing adequate time for the hot steam to enter the fibers. Give special steaming attention to areas where pets love to sleep such as a chair, or bed.
The steam will remove fleas and dirt on various surfaces including furniture - you may need to use an upholstery attachment for this. Finally, undertake effective cleaning and wipe the surfaces of all the moisture left.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you can also remove fleas and dirt from the fibers of your bedding. The method will remove the odors and stains effectively.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Steam cleaning is an effective method to remove fleas, odor, and dust. The hot, pressured steam is a non-chemical and eco-friendly techniques that&rsquo;s inexpensive, DIY and easy alternative for homeowners.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bermuda grass (<a href="https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/cynodon-dactylon/">Cynodon dactylon</a>) is a warm-season grass highly valued in some regions for its heat and drought tolerance, and its ability to create a tough, dense lawn. However, for many homeowners, especially those in cooler climates or attempting to grow cool-season grasses like fescue, Bermuda grass is a tenacious and unwelcome weed. Its aggressive growth habit, deep roots, and prolific seed production make it notoriously difficult to eradicate. If you&rsquo;re battling a Bermuda grass invasion, prepare for a persistent effort, as it often requires multiple methods and applications to achieve control.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-bermuda-grass-is-so-difficult-to-kill">Why Bermuda Grass is So Difficult to Kill</h2>
<p>Understanding what makes Bermuda grass so resilient is the first step in devising an effective eradication plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggressive Spreading:</strong> It spreads rapidly via three main mechanisms:
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhizomes:</strong> Underground stems that send up new shoots and roots.</li>
<li><strong>Stolons:</strong> Above-ground runners that root at nodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/%5Blawn-care%5D(/posts/how-to-control-bermuda-grass/)/understanding-grass-spreading-habits">Learn more about grass spreading habits like rhizomes and stolons from Oregon State University Extension.</a></li>
<li><strong>Seeds:</strong> It produces abundant seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deep Root System:</strong> Its extensive root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and difficult to remove manually.</li>
<li><strong>High Resilience:</strong> It can regenerate from even small fragments of rhizomes or stolons left behind.</li>
<li><strong>Herbicide Tolerance:</strong> Many common broadleaf weed killers have little to no effect on Bermuda grass.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="methods-for-killing-bermuda-grass">Methods for Killing Bermuda Grass</h2>
<p>Killing Bermuda grass effectively often involves a combination of strategies and a great deal of patience.</p>
<h3 id="1-chemical-control-non-selective-herbicides">1. Chemical Control (Non-Selective Herbicides)</h3>
<p>This is often the most effective method for complete removal of Bermuda grass, especially in large areas where you plan to reseed with a different type of grass.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product Type:</strong> Use a non-selective herbicide containing <strong>glyphosate</strong> as the active ingredient. Glyphosate works by being absorbed through the plant&rsquo;s foliage and translocated throughout the plant, including its root system (rhizomes and stolons), killing it from the inside out.</li>
<li><strong>Application Steps:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mow Low:</strong> Mow the Bermuda grass as short as possible a few days before application.</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Lightly water the area 24 hours before application. This encourages active growth, making the plant more receptive to the herbicide.</li>
<li><strong>Apply:</strong> Spray the herbicide evenly over the entire Bermuda grass area. Read and follow product instructions carefully regarding dilution rates, application methods, and safety.</li>
<li><strong>Wait:</strong> Allow 7-14 days for the herbicide to take full effect and the grass to yellow and die completely.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Bermuda grass is very tough. Expect to make <strong>2-3 applications</strong>, waiting 2-3 weeks between each, to ensure all rhizomes and stolons are dead. New growth indicates another application is needed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Safety Precautions:</strong> Always wear appropriate <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-worker-safety/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-pesticide-handlers">Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</a>, including gloves, long sleeves, long pants, and eye protection. Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift onto desirable plants. Check the forecast for rain, as rain can wash away the product before it&rsquo;s absorbed.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Non-selective herbicides <a href="/posts/does-the-dryer-kill-fleas/">kill</a> <em>all</em> vegetation they contact, so use with extreme caution near desired plants, trees, or shrubs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-chemical-control-selective-herbicides">2. Chemical Control (Selective Herbicides)</h3>
<p>These are specific grass-killing herbicides that can control Bermuda grass without harming certain broadleaf plants or some desirable turf types (like fescue).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product Type:</strong> Look for products specifically labeled for Bermuda grass control in cool-season lawns. Active ingredients like <strong>fluazifop-p-butyl</strong> or <strong>sethoxydim</strong> target grasses without significantly harming broadleaf plants. Some newer products containing <strong>mesotrione</strong> (like Tenacity) can also be used in specific cool-season turf types.</li>
<li><strong>Application:</strong> These usually require multiple applications over several weeks, as they are less aggressive than glyphosate.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Less effective for complete eradication compared to non-selective methods. Always confirm the herbicide is safe for your desirable turfgrass type before applying.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-solarization">3. Solarization</h3>
<p>This organic method uses the sun&rsquo;s heat to &ldquo;cook&rdquo; the Bermuda grass and its seeds in the soil.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it Works:</strong> Clear plastic sheeting traps solar radiation, raising soil temperatures to lethal levels for Bermuda grass and other weeds.</li>
<li><strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mow Low:</strong> Cut the Bermuda grass as short as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Water the area thoroughly to a depth of 6-12 inches. Moist soil conducts heat better.</li>
<li><strong>Cover:</strong> Lay clear (not black) plastic sheeting (4-6 mil thick) directly over the entire Bermuda grass area. Ensure it extends at least 1 foot beyond the infested area on all sides.</li>
<li><strong>Secure:</strong> Bury the edges of the plastic with soil, rocks, or other heavy objects to create an airtight seal, trapping the heat and moisture.</li>
<li><strong>Wait:</strong> Leave the plastic in place for <strong>6-8 weeks</strong> during the hottest, sunniest part of the year. The hotter and sunnier it is, the more effective this method will be.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/SM/soil_solarization.html">Learn more about the process of soil solarization from the University of California IPM.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Organic, kills seeds, also controls other weeds and some soil pathogens.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Takes a long time, the area is unusable and unsightly during the process, and it may not be 100% effective in cooler climates or during cloudy periods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-smotheringdeprivation-sheet-mulchingcardboard-method">4. Smothering/Deprivation (Sheet Mulching/Cardboard Method)</h3>
<p>This organic method deprives Bermuda grass of sunlight, eventually killing it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it Works:</strong> Layers of organic material block sunlight, preventing photosynthesis, while also adding organic matter to the soil.</li>
<li><strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mow Low:</strong> Cut the Bermuda grass as short as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Lightly water the area.</li>
<li><strong>Lay Barriers:</strong> Lay down a thick layer (at least 2-3 layers, overlapping edges) of cardboard or newspaper directly over the grass. Remove any tape or labels from cardboard.</li>
<li><strong>Cover with Mulch:</strong> Cover the cardboard/newspaper with at least 6-12 inches of organic material such as wood chips, straw, compost, or a mixture.</li>
<li><strong>Wait:</strong> This method can take <strong>several months to a full growing season</strong> for complete eradication, as the grass slowly starves.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/sheet-mulching-easy-way-kill-weeds-build-soil">Explore sheet mulching techniques from Oregon State University Extension.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Organic, improves soil health, good for creating new garden beds.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Takes a long time, the area is unusable for planting until the grass is dead, and the appearance might be less desirable during the process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-manual-removal-digging">5. Manual Removal (Digging)</h3>
<p>Best suited for very small, isolated patches of Bermuda grass or for targeting individual runners.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it Works:</strong> Physically removing all parts of the plant.</li>
<li><strong>Steps:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dig Deep:</strong> Using a spade or garden fork, dig out the Bermuda grass, ensuring you go deep enough to get all the rhizomes (they can be several inches deep) and wide enough to get all stolons.</li>
<li><strong>Inspect:</strong> Carefully inspect the dug-up soil and the surrounding area for any remaining fragments of roots or runners. Even a small piece can regenerate.</li>
<li><strong>Dispose:</strong> Do NOT put Bermuda grass clippings or rhizomes in your compost pile unless you&rsquo;re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill them. Bag them for disposal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Chemical-free.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Extremely labor-intensive, very difficult to be 100% effective, high chance of regrowth from missed fragments.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="important-considerations-before-you-start">Important Considerations Before You Start</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patience is Paramount:</strong> Killing Bermuda grass is rarely a quick fix. Choose a method (or combination) and be prepared for a multi-week or even multi-month battle.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Your Grass:</strong> Double-check that what you&rsquo;re fighting is indeed Bermuda grass. Misidentification can lead to ineffective treatments.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare the Area:</strong> Regardless of the method, mowing low and clearing debris helps with effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Follow Instructions:</strong> Always read and strictly adhere to the instructions on any herbicide product, including safety precautions, application rates, and re-entry intervals.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Eradication Plan:</strong> Once the Bermuda grass is dead, be ready to replant quickly with your desired turfgrass or landscape plants to prevent new weed seeds from germinating or any missed Bermuda grass from re-establishing. Overseeding with a desired grass type immediately after eradication is crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Vigilance:</strong> Even after successful eradication, monitor the area regularly for new sprouts and address them immediately. Bermuda grass seeds can lay dormant for years.</li>
</ul>
<p>By choosing the right method for your situation and committing to a diligent approach, you can successfully reclaim your lawn or garden from invasive Bermuda grass.</p>

      <description>Let&amp;#39;s discuss what kills flea eggs in your yard or in</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss what kills flea eggs in your yard or in
indoor spaces
. Honestly, there aren&rsquo;t many things that&rsquo;ll kill flea eggs� - they&rsquo;re supper hardy.
<a href="/posts/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">Fleas</a> will jump off from the cats and dogs to lays their eggs on pet bedding or even house carpeting. Any unattended fleas eggs will hatch to a major <a href="/posts/what-kills-fleas-in-the-yard-naturally/">flea</a> infestation within a month.
<em>In summary, here&rsquo;s how to kill flea eggs; vacuuming carpets, rugs and floors will remove the flea eggs dropped by your cats or dogs.�Vacuuming will clean up flea larvae and their food (flea dirt). In addition, vacuuming makes the fleas to emerge from the insecticide-resistant cocoons - exposing them to treatment.��</em></p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-kill-flea-eggs">Details: How to Kill Flea Eggs?</h2>
<p>Flea eggs are translucent, oval-shaped objected that measure about 0.5 mm (0.02 inches). Females fleas lay average of 40 eggs daily in your yard or home - they&rsquo;ll
hatch within 2 weeks into larvae
.</p>
<h3 id="1-vacuum-carpets-rugs-and-floors"><strong>1. Vacuum Carpets, Rugs and Floors�</strong></h3>
<p>The surest way to control fleas eggs and adult fleas is vacuuming your rugs and carpeted areas - maintain a tidy and clean home. The
flea vacuum
machine will ruck all the flea eggs, cocoons, and larvae.
Flea eggs tend to hatch in 2 to 3 days after they&rsquo;re laid. Therefore, the vacuuming daily will allow extermination of the eggs and thus prevent�them from hatching a new flea generation.
Also, lifting your carpet nap during the vacuuming process ensures that the insecticides will penetrate deeper into the fibers of your carpets where eggs and larvae hide.
In addition, you must vacuum the couches and carpets using a water-based vacuum as it&rsquo;ll remove flea eggs plus
flea dirt
. Therefore, removing flea dirt will deny the flea larvae some of their food.
Thoroughly vacuum places that your cats and dogs sleep and rest. Further, vacuum the throw rugs, beds, cushions, under furniture, and room edges. Finally, seal and dispose your vacuum bag into the outdoor garbage can.</p>
<h3 id="2-spray-igr-prodcuts-like-frontline-plus-has-s-methoprene">2. Spray IGR Prodcuts like Frontline Plus (Has S Methoprene)</h3>
<p>Get a flea control product that has an
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/ptype/igr.html">Insect Growth Regulator (IGR)</a>
such as S Methoprene and pyriproxyfen that&rsquo;ll help kill the fleas eggs and flea larvae. Consult veterinarian first to ensure the product is safe for your pets, their bedding, and carpeting in the house.
Not many product will kill and prevent flea eggs. However, you&rsquo;ll succeed if you prevent the flea eggs from hatching. I recommend you use Frontline Plus as it contains and IGR - S Methoprene.
The S Methoprene will hinder the flea from eggs and equally prevent the fleas eggs from hatching. Therefore, this will definitely break down the flea life cycle.
Frontline Plus is an excellent flea control product because it&rsquo;ll exterminate both adult fleas (5 percent of flea population), larvae and flea eggs.
IGRs may be applied on your cats or dogs as food additives, tablets, or sprays - this may be monthly or any other approved regular cycle. For example, products with Lufenuron may be given like an injection, food additive, or pill.
Further, Sentinel has lufenuron that&rsquo;ll also prevent infestation and growth of heart-worms. These will highly helpful for your indoor pets.
However, with these IGR products, you&rsquo;ll need to wait for 4 to 6 weeks for notable decline in fleas. This is because IGRs will only kill flea larvae, flea eggs and not adults fleas.
PT Ultracide is another favorable product for controlling flea eggs. The aerosol will kill the fleas immediately - has a quick kill effect - which also deterring the formation of new larvae, flea eggs and adults. Luckily, it has a long (7 months) residue effect.</p>
<h3 id="3-launder-at-140f--dry-bedding-and-clothes">3. L*aunder (at 140F) &amp; Dry *Bedding and Clothes</h3>
<p>Dryer heat will kill the flea eggs and larvae plus adults in your clothes, curtains and bedding. Launder fabrics at 140F for ~ 10 minutes before drying them at the highest temperature setting in your dryer - consider the fabric material too.
Washing your bedding and clothes with hot water will help kill the fleas and their eggs. Further, an effective washing machine helps dislodge the flea eggs and thus exterminate a flea offspring. Ensure you add some soap in the washing soap.
Fleas won&rsquo;t survive the heat in your dryer. The bugs will die at
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7288833">temperatures that go over 35C (95F)</a>
. Further, flea larvae and fleas eggs die at temperatures over 38C (100.4F).
Despite that some of the flea eggs could still hatch at 35C, the temperature won&rsquo;t allow the larvae to mature. But about a third of the larvae population could still develop to spin their cocoons and molt - but all will die in their cocoon.</p>
<h3 id="4-boric-acid-insecticide-powder">4. Boric Acid Insecticide Powder</h3>
<p>Despite that spraying fleas, their larvae and eggs comes second to vacuuming in terms effectiveness, using insecticides powders can also work great in exterminating the flea eggs.
Flea powders are less toxic compared sprays but they won&rsquo;t cause an instant killing effect on the eggs. But the powders function well will carpets. The flea powders have boric acid that&rsquo;s deadly to fleas but safe to humans and pets.
Boric acid plus the included sodium salts will kill fleas and their eggs. They&rsquo;ll abrade the creature&rsquo;s exoskeletons or act like stomach poison to kill the fleas. Further, boric acid will also kill ants, termites, and roaches.</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase boric acid that&rsquo;s EPA-registered. Flea larvae that&rsquo;ll be scavenging for a meal around the carpet will feed on the boric acid.</li>
<li>Boric acid will penetrate the carpet fibers, upholstered furniture, crevices and cracks. However, avoid using boric acid powder in the outdoor spaces as it won&rsquo;t be effective against fleas when it gets wet.</li>
<li>Caution: Don&rsquo;t apply the boric acid directly on your cats, dogs or any other pets. Also, if possible, you can use<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-flea-collars-work/">flea collars against cats and dogs</a>.</li>
<li>Pay special attention, when applying the powder, to your pet&rsquo;s sleeping areas including under beds or chairs. But vacuum the concrete, tile or hardwood floors for best results against flea eggs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The� main control method for flea eggs definitely vacuuming, followed by using IGR sprays, laundering and drying, and finally boric acid powder.
However, be sure that flea eggs hatch within a very short time - about 2 weeks. So, be quick and precise in controlling the flea eggs.</p>

But, I know you might have used flea control chemicals such as NexGard, Advantage, flea collars,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-%5Bfleas%5D(/posts/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/)/">flea bombs</a>
, Frontline,
dog flea shampoo
, etc.
Chemicals aside, today we discuss step by step process to control fleas on your dog naturally.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Fleas Killers on Dogs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-4-quick-steps">How to Kill Fleas on Dogs Naturally (4 Quick Steps)</h2>
<h3 id="1-flea-combing">1. Flea combing</h3>
<p>To ease the scratching and itching caused by flea, flea combs will weed out fleas of all sizes from your dogs fur. A flea comb has finely spaced teeth/ tines to physically trap and eject the flea &ldquo;dirt,&rdquo; fleas, larvae, and flea eggs. Luckily, the
flea combing process leaves your dog
well-groomed, too, and happy.
Use the
flea comb
when your dogs fur is not tangled, thick, and extended to increase effectiveness and reduce pain. Remove the fur tangles by brushing using a regular
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OIOB90E/?tag=p-policy-20">pet comb or brush</a>
as it has widely-spaced tines.
Mix
dish soap
with hot water in a deep bucket (half full)  thus, fleas wont jump out quickly. While combing, youll use the liquid to rinse your
flea comb
and hold the fleas combed from the dog&rsquo;s fur.
Position white clothing or a newspaper under your bucket and dog. This will hold the
flea dirt
, fleas, and eggs thatll be dropping off.
Start the
flea combing process
with the dogs head, neck, and shoulders, and finally to the back and tail.
Comb gently and slowly in the direction where the dogs fur is growing. This will remove the dead hair, flea dirt, eggs, and adult fleas. Frequently push the flea comb to the soapy water as itll be filling with fur, fleas, and debris.
Next, comb the dogs belly, sides, chest, and back. The last portion will be to comb the tail, paws, and legs. Repeat the combing all over the dogs body to catch any flea that could have escaped.
Finally, after completing the flea combing process, allow the soapy water to remain in the bucket for about 15 minutes to drown the fleas. Ultimately, dispose of the clothing, newspaper, and bucket water that you used to flea comb. Also,
vacuum the whole room where you
were cleaning the dog.</p>
<h3 id="2-use-apple-cider-vinegar---bathing-and-drinking">2. Use Apple Cider vinegar - Bathing and Drinking</h3>
<dl>
<dt>First things first:</dt>
<dt>apple cider vinegar</dt>
<dt>(ACV) will not kill fleas but will create an unfriendly atmosphere (both taste and smell) that will repel the fleas from your dog. According to the FDA, apple cider vinegar has antibacterial and antioxidant features.</dt>
<dt>The</dt>
<dt>essential oil</dt>
<dt>from Alaskan yellow cedar causes lethal effects on the fleas. So much with the description; to</dt>
<dt>control fleas</dt>
<dt>for your dog using ACV, use sleeping mats (cedar-filled), cedar oil, and cedar spray or shampoo.</dt>
<dt><strong>Caution</strong></dt>
<dd>Do not pour the Apple cedar vinegar on your dogs skin as itll irritate the areas with broken skin. On the contract, use the ACV on the dogs spray, baths, and drinking water. However, contact your vet for direction on how ACV is appropriate for your dog, depending on its body weight.
For baths, pour the Apple cedar vinegar onto the dogs bathing water to prevent or treat any flea infestation.
For drinking, add a teaspoon of the apple cider vinegar (fermented) to a bowl of water (
<em>quarter-liter</em>
) and give the dog to drink. The treatment will make the dogs skin to become acidic and hence repel fleas and ticks.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="3-use-borax-powder">3. Use borax powder</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Borax, named Sodium Tetraborate or Disodium Tetraborate, is a direct natural mineral (looks like table salt) like a complex boron compound combined with sodium elements.</dt>
<dt>In its powdered form, borax is regularly employed in many cleaning agents. My readers tell me that theyve found borax, like me, to be less-smelly, less-toxic, and more</dt>
<dt>effective in flea control</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>Borax will kill fleas</dt>
<dt>by incising the bugs exoskeleton and dehydrating their body hence killing them. Despite that, borax is great in killing flea larvae, too; it does not</dt>
<dt>eliminate flea eggs on cats and dogs</dt>
<dt>but�can be</dt>
<dt>mixed to create a spray for yard flea spray</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt><strong>Caution</strong></dt>
<dd>Borax containing substances must not be used near pregnant women. Further,
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/boricgen.html">keep borax away from food substances</a>
and cats, leading to poisoning and breathing problems, respectively. Also, do not use borax on wet carpets, and it can discolor them and destroy their fiber.
Apply borax on an area that has humidity being more significant than 50 percent. Further, review the warning area of the borax wrapping.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Now, sprinkle the borax powder in the sections having
fleas such as the Kernel and even the carpet
.</li>
<li>Use a rigid broom or brush to brush the carpet. The process will help you get the borax to the areas that the
fleas are hiding, significantly below the rug
and the dark sections.</li>
<li>Wait for about 1-2 days or longer after sprinkling the borax powder. Finally, vacuum the treated areas to remove the borax, flea, and flea debris.
<strong>Note</strong>
: Dont use borax to treat your dog. However, check these articles on

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using pesticide sprays, among other
<a href="https://extension.tennessee.edu/publications/Documents/PB1596.pdf">chemical flea control methods</a>
, is considered the best way to control <a href="/posts/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/">fleas</a> in every Yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>But other home remedies are equally effective for someone who would like to try a DIY approach.
So,
what kills fleas in the yard naturally?
So, check the below home remedies:
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best <a href="/posts/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">Flea</a> Spray for Yard&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth">1. Diatomaceous earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth (DE) for fleas
has silica shards that&rsquo;ll cut through the fleas&rsquo; waxy exoskeleton causing dehydration and eventual death of the bugs and the flea larvae.
Luckily, the Food-grade DE will be safe to use around human beings and animals. Avoid the DE that&rsquo;s used in charcoal filters or swimming pools.
The razor-sharp edges of the crushed Diatomaceous Earth will kill the fleas through dehydration. However, ensure to wear kitchen or garden gloves to avoid drying the hands.
The next step will be sprinkling DE on soft furniture, dog beds, and carpet. Allow DE to settle and do its magic for about three days.
Vacuum the surfaces thoroughly to kill fleas
, their eggs, and also larvae.</p>
<h3 id="2-dawn-dish-soap">2. Dawn Dish soap</h3>
<p>Dawn dish soap
is an excellent non-chemical solution to kill fleas. It damages the exoskeletons of fleas and thus kills them.
It&rsquo;ll break the waxy layer in the bug&rsquo;s respiratory system allowing water to enter and, therefore, suffocation.
Further, the dawn dish soap reduces the surface tension in water and thus causing the fleas to drown after sinking - and thus functions as a surfactant.</p>
<h3 id="3-fine-salt">3. Fine salt</h3>
<p>Next,
sea salt or household salt will kill fleas
if it is finely ground. You&rsquo;ll simply need to sprinkle the fine salt on the infested areas such as furniture or carpets - allow 12 to 48 hours.
Sprinkling the finely-ground salt and spraying some water over it makes a recipe for killing fleas. You can use this process in pens of poultry, hogs, or horses.
Also, as the saltwater continues drying, it&rsquo;ll absorb water and moisture from the surroundings and thus kill the bugs through desiccation.</p>
<h2 id="whether-it-uses-natural-or-chemical-ingredients">Whether it uses natural or chemical ingredients?</h2>
<p>Generally,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">flea sprays for yards</a>
that contain chemicals are more effective. But there are a few good, non-toxic solutions available too.
Remember: always follow all instructions carefully. Not onl
y is this important for safety reasons, but it will also ensure you get the best results.
<em>Is it safe to use around your pets?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Always read the ingredi
ents, instructions, and warning labels carefully. Some sprays are made with natural ingredients and may be safe to use around your pets.
With other sprays, you&rsquo;ll need to remove your pet first before spraying and also wait until it dries completely before bringing pets back into the Yard.
Whether it&rsquo;s also effective before the adult stage:�For the best results, you want to use sprays that get to the source of the problem: flea eggs, larvae, and pupae.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-fleas-infest-my-yard">Can Fleas Infest My Yard?</h2>
<p>Definitely, Yes! Fleas will readily infest and multiply in your yards or lawns as they have a favorable environment. But you can effectively cut down on the number and frequency of flea attacks in the Yard by trimming vegetation, tree branches, and grass.
Trimming the excessive foliage will cut down on the available dark areas that you&rsquo;ll see in your garden or lawn. This significantly cuts down on the favorable shady conditions needed by fleas larvae to survive. In the short term, I recommend using chemical flea treatment as some may not exterminate the flea larvae and eggs.
Therefore, for long-term control of these bugs, you&rsquo;ll need to consider various
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef602">methods of bug control</a>
that are readily available.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-will-fleas-live-in-my-yard">How Long will Fleas Live in my Yard?</h2>
<p><a href="https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/insects/flea.html">Adult Fleas and different pests</a>
will mainly be lying on the underside, neck, and back of dogs and cats.
However, in cases of massive flea attacks, you may find the bugs lying or jumping around your bedroom, on the carpet, or the pet&rsquo;s bedding.
However, the fleas must be coming from another area before they land on your way to the house. This is the place where we consider the Yard as the breeding and feeding ground for the bugs.
The Yard provides a shady, humid, and moist environment that is favorable for the breeding and growth of fleas.
This will be even better if there are tall grasses or woodpiles lying around the Yard. Check the public parks and dog houses for evidence of flea infestations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These chemical sprays are more expensive but far more effective. On the flip side, these sprays are less toxic to adult fleas  so you&rsquo;ll either have to wait longer (8-10 days) before they die, or combine with other showers for faster results.</p>

?</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ve detailed the answer to this question. There are many flea-killing products like medicated drops, shampoos, repellents, and sprays - but they take time to work.
<strong>But what kills fleas on contact? Well, rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) will kill adult fleas on contact - it&rsquo;s best applied on flea-infested bedding or yard. Also,</strong>
<strong>�dawn dish soap kills flea eggs (via suffocation); thus, they won&rsquo;t reproduce, infest, or hatch.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>*NB: Large % of alcohol may be toxic to your pets and other animals - particularly if ingested but it may also be absorbed via the skin. *Related:Where do Fleas Come From?

<p>Isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) is popular as a disinfectant or germ-killing product.
But as a pet owner, you&rsquo;ll better love rubbing alcohol for its flea-killing ability - kills fleas on contact to finish that
flea infestation in your house - fast
.</p>
<p>But should I use rubbing alcohol on my pet? Well, plucking the fleas from the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s fur and dropping them into a rubbing alcohol bowl will kill the bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, washing the pet with some soapy hot water would still kill the fleas (and their eggs) but it won&rsquo;t endanger the health of your pet or the home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="danger1-rubbing-alcohol-isopropyl-alcohol-may-be-toxic-to-pets">Danger1: Rubbing alcohol (Isopropyl alcohol) May be Toxic to pets</h2>
<p>Avoid pouring the rubbing alcohol on the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s skin in an effort to examine the fleas as it can be toxic.�Isopropyl alcohol will be toxic to the pets if absorbed into their skins in large amounts.</p>
<p>However, it is critical to realize that some commercial flea killers also have a little percentage of alcohol. Therefore, over-spraying with such alcohol-
containing products may lead to pet poisoning too.

In addition, ingesting the rubbing alcohol could also be toxic to the cat or dog. You&rsquo;ll not the poisoning within 1/2 an hour after ingesting - under5take emergency treatment to avoid fatal outcomes.
The
<a href="https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/top-10-animal-toxins-2017">ASPCA</a>
outlines that from 2016, accidental swallowing of cleaning products ranked top 10 among the pet toxins reported. But how would you know that the cat or dog (pet) ingested rubbing alcohol?</p>
<ul>
<li>Stumbling</li>
<li>Shaking</li>
<li>Shortness of Breath</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Disorientation
Therefore, if your pet has any or most of these signs, it&rsquo;s highly likely they&rsquo;ve ingested rubbing alcohol, and so you should contact your veterinarian or
<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control">APSCA</a>
for an emergency pet assessment and treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="danger-2-pure-rubbing-alcohol-is-very-flammable">Danger 2: Pure Rubbing Alcohol is Very flammable</h2>
<p>In its pure form, rubbing alcohol (or isopropyl) is not just toxic to pets but is
also very flammable - if there is an open fire flame, sparks, or heat. This is especially when sprayed on fabrics, pet bedding, and furnishings.
The fire hazard will increase if there are
open flames, fireplaces, incense burners, cigarettes, or candles around the pure isopropyl. The vapor and fumes from the
alcohol may reach the flame - but may dry fast too.
For example, some
home flea spra
y that contains isopropanol or isopropyl alcohol requires that you adhere to usage guidelines. Some of them include using the insecticide in a non-occupied space.</p>
<p>While rubbing alcohol will control fleas from your home. It&rsquo;s critical to act fast since fleas may transmit diseases and organisms like tapeworm and heartworm or typhus and plague to pets and humans.</p>
<h2 id="5-alternative-flea-treatment-methods">5 Alternative Flea-Treatment Methods?</h2>
<p>Therefore, if the rubbing alcohol isn&rsquo;t safe for the situation or it&rsquo;s not available for flea treatment, here are the 5 alternative methods to rid your pet or home of these bugs.</p>
<h3 id="method-1-wash-pets-with-flea-shampoo">Method 1: Wash Pets with Flea Shampoo</h3>
<p>First, most pet parents consider
dish soap for fleas control
as its readily available. Dawn dish soap suffocates (or drowns) the fleas by reducing the surface tension of water.
But flea shampoo for
dogs
or
cats
contains flea-killing ingredients like dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and permethrin or IGRs ( such as methoprene or pyriproxyfen) that&rsquo;ll be lethal to adults fleas, and eggs + larvae respectively.</p>
<p>Further, washing pets with dish soap may be less effective as you&rsquo;ll require massive pet scrubbing using a flea comb. Besides, you must read the flea-shampoo usage instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember don&rsquo;t use do shampoomust neverbe used in washing the cats while you must also avoid using a shampoo meant for adult pets on puppies and kittens.
So, ensure to talk to the pet veterinarian while considering using the flea-treatment products available online or on Amazon - use
<a href="https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/getting-rid-fleas-kittens-and-puppies">age-appropriate flea killers</a>
. Use the recommended treatment since over-treatment may be toxic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, combing the pet&rsquo;s hair or fur helps remove dead skin and adult fleas for better health. Comb keenly around the pet&rsquo;s backside, belly., and neck as these are areas that fleas gather and hide.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re combing the pets for fleas, place a bowl with soapy and warm water nearby where you&rsquo;ll be dipping the flea comb - this will remove and drown the bugs from the comb.</p>
<h3 id="method-2-install-flea-traps"><strong>Method 2: Install Flea Traps</strong></h3>
<p>You can also combine the flea shampoo, dish soap with a flea trap for better effectiveness. The traps may be
light or glue traps that use light or lovely scents to lure the fleas to be electrocuted or caught.
So, where should you put or position the flea trap? Well, place the flea trap near your bed or pet bed and bedding as this is where fleas frequent. But avoid placing flea traps near
flammable objects, drapery, or walls.
But, do they really work? How effective are the flea traps?�Well, flea traps will attract and help reduce massive flea
infestations but the fleas may still move
jump onto another host like dogs or cats
.
The veterinarians will recommend pet-appropriate flea killers for your cat or dog. For instance, some of the insecticides might not be appropriate (
<a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/fact-sheet-pet-owners-and-veterinarians-about-potential-adverse-events-associated-isoxazoline-flea">causing adverse effects</a>
) on the health of pregnant animals, or small
dogs.</p>
<p>Re-application within approved intervals will work great. Ensure to read the product instructions particularly of the isoxazoline class as they may cause neurological reactions and seizures. Some of the products in this class are
Revolution Plus,
Simparica,
Nexgard,
Credelio, and
Bravecto.
The products approved for
kittens and
puppies include
Lufenuron (killing eggs preventing their maturing) and the
Nitenpyram (great for little pets that&rsquo;s under 2 pounds). Using such age-appropriate pesticides will reduce the chances of damaging the pet&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<h2 id="what-kills-fleas-on-contact-in-yard">What Kills Fleas on Contact in Yard?</h2>
<h3 id="1-pyrethrin-based-and-igr-sprays">1. Pyrethrin-Based and IGR Sprays</h3>
<p>Chemical treatments that have pyrethrin will exterminate the adult fleas in your yard. Equally important is that you exterminate the
other flea stages
including the pupal, larval, and eggs of the fleas.</p>
<p>For this, I recommend using the IGRs (Insect growth regulators) like methoprene and pyriproxyfen as they&rsquo;ll exterminate the larval flea stages preventing these bugs from maturing into adults.</p>
<p>Therefore, combining the pyrethrin-based and IGR sprays to flea-treat your yard will help control the bugs in a fast way. For these efforts in the yard, the target also the doghouses as these are areas that the dogs and other pets will frequent.</p>
<p>Related:
Removing Fleas in the Carpet</p>
<h3 id="2-diatomaceous-earth">2. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>DE or Diatomaceous earth will naturally exterminate the yard fleas without using harmful toxins - fossilized algae (fine dust) referred to as diatoms.
Therefore, DE is safe for your pets and mammals as it&rsquo;s a natural pesticide for
flea treatment - a great alternative for rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>To use
diatomaceous earth in treating fleas in your yard, undertake the application during a calm day. But first, dampen the
plants, flowers, and grass
using some
garden hose to allow DE to stick.
But how long will the
diatomaceous earth
take to kill those fleas? Well, after getting contact with the DE, fleas tend to die within just 4 hours but I would say to leave the powder for 48 hours for better outcomes.</p>
<p>DE is a
non-toxic, effective, and safe flea killer that you can apply on your lawn but you must adhere to the outline precautions.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on the question of &ldquo;What Kills Fleas on Contact?&rdquo;, I recommend using rubbing alcohol, flea-shampoo, and IGR foggers to exterminate flea larvae, eggs, and adult fleas.</p>
<p>Further, washing pets with dish soap can help suffocate (or drown) some of the adult fleas while flea traps can assist in reducing the flea population. Alternative me5thods include using diatomaceous earth as it&rsquo;ll kill fleas in many stages.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs are notorious for being resilient pests that can infest your home without you even noticing. One of the most effective ways to eliminate them is by using <a href="/posts/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/">temperature</a> to your advantage. Bed bugs cant survive extreme temperatures, and applying either heat or cold is an effective strategy to eradicate them.</p>
<h2 id="how-heat-can-kill-bed-bugs">How Heat Can <a href="/posts/does-the-dryer-kill-fleas/">Kill</a> Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are sensitive to heat, and exposing them to temperatures above 113F (45C) for several minutes can kill them at all life stages, from eggs to adults. The heat needs to be sustained for at least 90 minutes to be effective, so using heat treatment methods like steam cleaning or using a heat chamber can be highly beneficial. However, it is important to monitor the temperature carefully, as exceeding 120F (49C) can damage your furniture and belongings.</p>
<h2 id="cold-temperatures-for-bed-bug-control">Cold Temperatures for Bed Bug Control</h2>
<p>Cold temperatures are another effective way to kill bed bugs. Freezing bed bugs at temperatures below 0F (-18C) for several days will also kill them. Placing smaller items like bedding or clothing in the freezer for several days can be an effective method to eliminate these pests. However, freezing is generally less effective for larger items, such as furniture or mattresses, where heat treatments tend to be more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="why-temperature-based-methods-work">Why Temperature-Based Methods Work</h2>
<p>Both heat and cold disrupt the physiological processes of bed bugs. When exposed to high heat, their proteins and enzymes begin to break down, and they are unable to survive. On the other hand, freezing temperatures can cause ice crystals to form in their bodies, leading to cellular damage and death. By understanding these principles, you can use temperature-based methods to help eliminate bed bugs from your home.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-using-temperature-to-kill-bed-bugs">Tips for Using Temperature to Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>**Use a professional heat treatment:**If you have a large infestation, hiring a professional pest control service that offers heat treatment may be necessary. They can apply the heat uniformly and safely to kill bed bugs.</li>
<li>**Monitor temperature levels:**Ensure that the temperature remains consistent for the required time when using heat treatments. Inadequate exposure time can lead to ineffective results.</li>
<li>**Seal items before freezing:**If freezing items to kill bed bugs, make sure to place them in sealed plastic bags to prevent reinfestation from other sources.</li>
<li>**Combine methods:**A combination of heat, cold, and chemical treatments may be required for severe infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Temperature treatments are an effective way to kill bed bugs and prevent future infestations. Whether you choose heat or cold, it is essential to understand how to apply these methods correctly. For severe cases, seeking professional pest control services is highly recommended to ensure thorough and lasting elimination of bed bugs from your home.</p>
