<h2 id="how-to-stain-a-playset--details">How to Stain a Playset  Details</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-ensure-the-weather-is-sunny">Step 1: Ensure the Weather is Sunny</h3>
<p>Before you embark on your staining project check the weather and ensure its sunny. Avoid staining your playset during the rainy season.</p>
<p>We recommend doing the staining during sunny days. The sun aids in the quick drying of the playset after youve cleaned up with water.</p>
<p>After applying the stain, you also need to let it dry. Once the stain has dried you might want to add a sealant which is optional. Therefore, warm weather is crucial for a successful staining project.</p>
<p>Tip: staining on damp wood will not bring you the desired results. Damp wood doesnt absorb the stain properly.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-remove-everything-except-the-wood">Step 2: Remove Everything except the Wood</h3>
<p>Playsets usually feature various plastic accessories that provide additional play activities for the kids for a fun-filled playing experience. These accessories may include swings, slides, telescopes, and steering wheels among others.</p>
<p>You should remove all these accessories. You can also remove the canopy roof.� Just eliminate Anything that is not wood from the playset.</p>
<p>Removing all these things from the playset will make staining less difficult. Youll also know what needs to be repaired or replaced. In addition, you protect them from being messed up with the stain.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-clean-the-playset">Step 3: Clean the Playset</h3>
<p>Once you have removed all the plastic accessories, clean them up and store them properly. Start cleaning the playset to remove bacteria, dirt, and mold.</p>
<p>Never stain your playset before cleaning it up. Cleaning the playset provides you a perfect opportunity to inspect it closely.</p>
<p>Thus, you get to understand whether you need just normal cleaning with soap and detergent or power wash.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-clean-the-playset">How to Clean the Playset</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mix bleach and water (half-and-half)</li>
<li>Pour the solution into a pump sprayer</li>
<li>Attach the sprayer into the hose</li>
<li>Clean the playset thoroughly to remove all the dirt, mildew, or bacteria. Use a large sponge or just a rag to scrub the surface of the swing set.
However, if youve got a garden thats close by and youre afraid of the bleach effects on the plants get an environmentally friendly cleaner for your swing set. I recommend Genesis Natural, Non-Toxic, Enzyme Solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-allow-24-hours-for-the-playset-to-dry">Step 4: Allow 24 Hours for the Playset to Dry</h3>
<p>After youre through with the washing allow the playset to dry. Its important that the playset dries up well. So when the 24 hours lapses and its not well dried let it sit for a few more days.</p>
<p>Allowing the swing set to dry up will help to yield the desired results during and after staining. Dried wood absorbs stain better.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-inspect-the-playset-carefully-and-fill-up-any-cracks">Step 5: Inspect the Playset Carefully and Fill Up Any Cracks</h3>
<p>Once youve confirmed that your playset has dried up completely. Its time to inspect it closely. Check for any holes, cracks, or damaged areas.</p>
<p>If there are, any cracks or holes fill them up with wood putty. Putty will blend well with your wooden playset.</p>
<p>In addition, a careful review of the playset will enhance the overall safety of the structure for your children. Youll be able to notice any rough or pointed edges and take appropriate action.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-sand-where-necessary">Step 6: Sand Where Necessary</h3>
<p>Using sandpaper, work on all those rough and pointed edges.</p>
<p>If youre covering a bigger area consider using an electric sander to speed up your project. I recommend
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018Z8D64/?tag=p-policy-20">BOSCH Palm Sander</a>
.</p>
<p>The good thing with buying a sander is that youll use it anytime youll be doing any project with wood structures.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-cover-the-surface-underneath-the-playset">Step 7: Cover the Surface underneath the Playset</h3>
<p>Drop a rug or cover below the swing set to prevent messing up the place.</p>
<p>Cover nearby plants to protect them from the stain.</p>
<p>Cover yourself wear protective add-ons like gloves or eye protectors. Otherwise, you can just wear overalls or old clothes that you dont mind disposing of after the project is over.</p>
