      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you come
across pantry bugs in your house
? You probably have many questions about them. Maybe, you are even wondering if <a href="/posts/how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live/">pantry</a> bugs are harmful if eaten.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are likely to find these pantry bugs in the food storage areas, kitchen cabinets among other areas in your house. They<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-pantry-bugs/">like hiding in</a>pasta, powdered milk, bread, dried fruits and herbs, nuts, and crackers.
If not careful, there are higher chances of eating them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-pantry-bugs-harmful-if-eaten-can-pantry-moths-make-me-sick">**Are Pantry Bugs Harmful If Eaten?-�**Can Pantry Moths Make Me Sick?</h2>
<p>No. If you have accidentally eaten a pantry bug, there is not much need to worry since most of them are not harmful.
But since its hard to tell the difference between good and harmful bugs. It is better not to eat them at all. Some bugs may have the potential to transmit diseases that could a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live/">long-term effect on you</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like other insects, most pantry bugs have three life cycles-egg, larvae/pupa, and adult stage.</li>
<li>At adult stages, these pantry bugs will either turn into beetles, moths, or weevils. In this stage, you are more likely to find them in rice, maize, and other types of cereals.
Below is a list of identification of some pantry bugs for easier verification and general knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-maize-and-rice-weevils">**1. **<strong>Maize and rice weevils</strong></h3>
<p>These are very common in granaries where you have
stored up your maize, rice, and other cereals
.� They are also known to attack other crops like oats, wheat, barley, peas, sorghum, and cottonseed among others.
They bore holes into grains, cereals, and legumes making. Below is their life cycle and how to identify them.
<strong>Life-cycle</strong>
A grain weevil has a life span of 5-8 months. This happens if the temperature and the humidity are constantly constant. For temperatures are between 15-34 C and humidity of 40 percent.
The life cycle of the weevil begins when a mature female lays its egg inside the grain. It can lay 300-400 eggs per lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female weevil lays one egg per gain after which she seals off the holes with some wax. The wax released to seal the entry dries off forming a raised mark on the seed.</li>
<li>When the egg hatches, a white larva is released that is without legs. This larva stays in the grain while feeding on it until it develops into a pupa.
When the pupa transforms into an adult, it bores a hole to exit the grain.�It takes approximately 36 days for a weevil to fully mature and be ready to hatch an egg.
Immediately after leaving the grain, the female releases pheromones insinuating readiness to mate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-drugstore-beetle-">**2. ****Drugstore beetle **</h3>
<p>This is another pantry bug that you are likely to find in your household. They are a common pest in warmer areas and environments.
This pantry bug is normally very destructive on dried plant products and fruits. In the pantry, you are also likely to find them in bread, floor, sweets, spices, cookies among others.
**Life-cycle **
A drugstore beetle has a lifespan of 13-65 days but some can live up to seven months. Their life cycle and life span highly depend on some factors like food and temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its life cycle begins when a female drugstore beetle lays its eggs. It can lay about 75 eggs in its life span.</li>
<li>It has three life stages egg, larvae/pupa, and adult stage. This beetle can survive in its larvae stage for a period of 5-20 weeks. The larvae feed on the grains as it develops.
In the final stages of its larvae stage, it builds a cocoon where the pupa stays dormant for 12-18 days.
The adult breaks out of the cocoon into a beetle that has a life span of 13-65 days. It is at this stage that they mate and lay eggs as the cycle continues.
They need a temperature of 30C and a humidity of 60-90 % for growth and mating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-idianmeal-moths-">**3. ****Idianmeal moths **</h3>
<p>They compromise the largest population of pantry bugs. They are very destructive and are found in grains and cereals, plants, nuts, pasta, fruits, rice, spices, and bread among others.
**Life cycle **
It has 4 life stages-egg, larvae, pupa, and adult.</p>
<ul>
<li>A single female can lay between 100-400 eggs in its life span. It can lay these eggs as a single unit or in clusters of 12-30.</li>
<li>With a temperature of 30C eggs takes 3-4 days to hatch while with a temperature of 20 C they take 7-8 days to hatch.</li>
<li>This larvae also have a web that it leaves behind which can be seen. These larvae also produce a cocoon that houses the dormant pupa stage of this beetle.
The pupa stays in this stage for 15-20 days before transforming into an adult moth.
It takes about 3 days for the adults to mate and lay eggs and the cycle continues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="can-drugstore-store-beetle-harm-you-when-eaten"><strong>Can drugstore store beetle harm you when eaten?</strong></h3>
<p>Like most pantry bugs, the drugstore beetle is harmless if eaten accidentally.� However, there are ways of reducing their infestation into your food and grains.
Keeping your foodstuffs below a temperature of 20 C will keep these bugs since they cannot survive in such an environment.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-eliminate-pantry-bugs"><strong>How to eliminate pantry bugs</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Check the food at the store</strong>
-before buying food at the store always make sure you cross-check well. Dont buy food that is not properly sealed or poorly packaged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check packaging dates as most likely the older products are more likely to be infested or even have eggs that later hatch into bugs.
<strong>Proper transportation-</strong>
check your products after transportation just in case the packaging is damaged. Any damaged packaging is prone to pantry bugs and should therefore be used first in your household or properly sealed before storage.
<strong>Using traps-</strong>
if you have noticed some pantry bugs in your kitchen or store, you can use traps to get rid of them. There are baits with sticky traps and some even with sex pheromones that attract bugs and stop them from further multiplication.
<strong>Storage-</strong>
On storage, you also need to check on the opened products and tight seal them to minimize entry of the bugs.
<strong>Grain and cereals Treatment-</strong>
if you find grain weevil, there are some insecticides that can be used to treat your grains and cereals against such.
<strong>Disposing of -</strong>
when the infestation is too much, there can be no better way than disposing of the produce. Instead of risking further multiplication of bugs trashing it is also a good option.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Are pantry bugs harmful if eaten? Though most of them are not harmful, it is good to avoid eating them. On the contrary, controlling their infestation would do more good than even allowing them in your grains, cereals, and other consumables.
That said and done, it is also not healthy to eat the pantry bags. Proper storage, treatment, and other good practices can be useful in getting rid of the bugs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Could be, you have spotted a beetle, a moth, a grain weevil. All these and others are the common pantry bugs we expect to find in kitchens, stores, and warehouses.
After noting several pantry bugs in my kitchen, this prompted me to know more about these bugs and how long they live.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live---pantry-bugs-life-cycle">How long do pantry bugs live? - Pantry Bugs Life Cycle</h2>
<p>The life span of pantry bugs totally depends on their species. If you want to know how long a pantry <a href="/posts/bed-bugs-vs-other-pests/">bug</a> live, you first need to know its species.</p>
<p>The most common pantry bugs in our kitchen and stores are moths. But which moths are they exactly? I have analyzed some of these common bugs and for easy identification and listed their life cycles.</p>
<h3 id="1-warehouse-beetle">**1. **<strong>Warehouse Beetle</strong></h3>
<p>This warehouse beetle is a very common pantry bug in your food store and kitchen. In most cases, you will find it in cereals, flour, cookies, nuts, cornmeal, dried peas, and beans among others.</p>
<p>This beetle is oval in shape and has a reddish-brown color with a yellow pattern on its wings.
**Life cycle **
The warehouse beetle has a life span of approximately 3-6 months. But its life cycle from egg to adult can take approximately 30-45 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its life cycle begins when a female beetle lays her eggs on the infested food. The female beetle can lay about 90 eggs in its lifespan. These fertilized eggs hatch into larvae after about 6 days.</li>
<li>The larvae stage is the most active stage and also very destructive. When they grow, the larvae develop hair and the abdomen also elongates. They also develop setae which they later shed and leave on the food.</li>
<li>Consuming this seta is very irritating and unhealthy too. If your food is infested by setae, it is advisable to dispose of it.
The larvae later turn into a pupa which takes about 6 days to turn into an adult. After this metamorphosis, the adult mates and can easily be spotted on light bulbs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-indianmeal-moths-">**2. ****Indianmeal Moths **</h3>
<p>This is the most common pantry bug in the kitchen. They are commonly found in North America, Europe among other areas. Their common scientific name is
<em>Plodia Interpuctella</em>
You are likely to spot them in your homestead in foods like cereals, rice, dried vegetables and fruits, flour, nuts, candies, and chocolates among others.
**Life cycle **
This moth has 4 growth stages-egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. The full life cycle takes between 30-300 days from egg to an adult moth.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female Indian meal moth can lay an average of 60-400 eggs in its life span. A female moth lays all the eggs within a span of 18 days. These eggs are laid on the food surface and take about 4-10 days for them to hatch into larvae.</li>
<li>This larvae stage is the most destructive and takes about 2-3 months. It consumes the food while excreting the waste (frass) and webbing which contaminates the whole package making it inconsumable.</li>
<li>The number of days on this stage is also dependent on so many other factors like food and temperatures and some larvae can live up to 210 days.
The larvae then transform into a pupa which is dormant and the non-feeding stage. The larvae make cocoons and live there.</li>
<li>Within 15-10 days, the pupae transform into an adult pantry moth. The adults break from the cocoon and can be easily spotted as they fly over the lights and walls.</li>
<li>The adult stage takes between 5-25 days and its major purpose is mating. Surprisingly, the adult moths do not have mouths and are not able to feed.
In general, the Idianmeal moth has a life span of 27-300 days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-red-and-confused-flour-beetle-">**3. ****Red and Confused Flour Beetle **</h3>
<p>These are two species of small beetle that are very similar and are reddish-brown in color. The red flour beetle and the confused flour beetle.</p>
<ul>
<li>To differentiate them the red flour beetle has the last 4 segments enlarged while the confused flour beetle has the last 3 segments enlarged towards the tail.
These are a common pantry bug in the United States and mostly attack grains, nuts, and milled cereals.
**Life cycle **
The red and the confused flour beetles have an average life span of 1-2 years. Their life cycle begins when a female lays eggs with sticky secretion on the grains and cereals. Its life cycle has 3 cycles-egg, larvae, and adult.</li>
<li>The females lay about 200-500 eggs in their life span. These eggs are small, clear, and white and hatch in a span of 5-12 days.</li>
<li>The larvae take about 30-120 days to mature but this depends on the temperature and food. These larvae feed grain kernels and slowly turn into white pupae. As the pupae grow it slowly turns yellow.</li>
<li>As it turns into an adult beetle, the pupae change color into reddish-brown.
This life cycle from eggs to adults takes about 6 weeks. However, the life cycle of the red flour beetle is shorter than that of the confused flour beetle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adult stage feeds and mates and the cycle continues.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-control-pantry-bugs">How to Control Pantry Bugs</h2>
<p>Most pantry bugs have a very fast multiplication rate-they lay eggs in hundreds and have a very short to average life span. Moreover, some bugs can survive for many days without feeding making it a challenge to control them.</p>
<h3 id="1-use-of-pheromone-traps-">**1. Use of Pheromone Traps. **</h3>
<p>The pheromone stick traps are some of the best ways to control pantry bugs. They are useful if there is already an infestation in your kitchen and food store.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have already spotted moths and beetles in your stores, it&rsquo;s a clear indication that there is a high infestation that needs to be stopped.</li>
<li>Pheromone traps play an important role in stopping any further reproduction and multiplication of the bugs.
It is also chemical-free and also safe for use in your household. You can find these traps in the local retailers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-proper-sealing-and-sanitation">2. Proper Sealing and Sanitation</h3>
<p>Most pantry bugs enter the foods and drugs because of the poor and open packaging. The moment they get inside they get a good chance to feed and multiply.</p>
<p>By keeping your foods tightly sealed and in a properly sanitized area, you are able to control any infestation of your food.</p>
<h3 id="3-disposing-of-the-already-infested-foods-">**3. Disposing of the already infested foods **</h3>
<p>If your food is already infested with pantry bugs, sometimes the best way to prevent any further infestation is through disposing of it.</p>
<p>Disposing of will also prevent any risk of consuming the pantry bugs which could pose a health risk.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>How long do pantry bugs live? Well, there are different kinds of pantry bugs and their life span depends on the species and their life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some bugs are destructive at certain stages of the life cycle-say larvae and others at another stage-say adult.</li>
<li>If you spot these pantry bugs in your home, you can also take a physical action and employ the control measures listed above to stop their further spread.</li>
<li>Most importantly, nobody wants bugs in their home, and proper sanitation and proper and constantly checking your store and foods could minimize the potential of infestation.
Lastly, ensure your food product is tightly sealed at all times.</li>

<strong>So, on how to get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">rid</a> of pantry moths; remove/clear everything from your pantry, wipe the shelves with a mixture of warm water, vinegar &amp; peppermint oil, or dispose of non-airtight storage cans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove and clean shelf liners, scrub pantry with soap and hot water, dry pantry &amp; washed storage containers thoroughly, and vacuum your pantry sufficiently before disinfecting the surface with vinegar.</strong></li>
<li>**Storage jars or containers should be washed with plenty of soap &amp; hot water (this helps kill moth&rsquo;s eggs), while infested or contaminated food substances should be disposed of whatsoever. **
<em>Consider changing the current storage method as well and avoid re-stocking your pantry immediately upon cleaning as this may lead to the moth&rsquo;s re-occurrence. Importantly, take thorough measures in your house to prevent future re-infestation.�To gain in-depth insight, let us get into the discussion.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-pantry-moths">How to Get Rid of Pantry Moths</h2>
<h3 id="1-removeclear-everything-from-pantry">1. Remove/Clear everything from Pantry</h3>
<p>Remove and clear all dry food on the shelves or pantry. Whether contaminated or not, you need to clear your pantry sufficiently and inspect the presence of pantry moths.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful to check the larvae too  this can be done using a hand lens or convex lens.</li>
<li>Consider removing crockeries, open cans, and closed items as well before actual cleaning is undertaken. The idea of items removal encompasses opening up space for direct observation of moths and their life cycle.
Further, this approach scares moths from their hideouts, thus making it easier to capture and fumigate them to death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-wipe-pantry-with-a-mixture-of-warm-water-vinegar-and-peppermint-oil">2. Wipe pantry with a Mixture of Warm water, Vinegar, and Peppermint oil</h3>
<p>The mixture of vinegar, water, and
peppermint oil repels moths
away and prevents future infestation.
Further vinegar inhibits moths eggs hatching into larvae, while the solvent disinfects the surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Soak a piece of cloth into a mixture of vinegar, warm water, and peppermint oil. Wipe your pantry gently. Wash your shelves using the solution and clean storage containers in this solvent as well before rinsing them in hot water.
Leave the cleaned surface to dry to touch before restocking your pantry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-remove-and-clean-all-shelf-liners">3. Remove and Clean all Shelf liners</h3>
<p>Carefully, remove all shelf liners. Clean the liners with soap and hot water - to remove and kill moths eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can opt to vacuum underneath liners or dust appropriately.
For old shelf liners, its advisable to remove and replace them with new ones. In case you arent willing to remove your shelf liners, you can opt to wipe the surface with moist clothe soaked in a disinfectant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-dispose-of-non-airtight-storage-cans">4. Dispose of non-airtight Storage Cans</h3>
<p>Loose or non-tight storage containers should be disposed of accordingly - the gap left offers a pathway for pantry moth to access stored dry food.</p>
<ul>
<li>More so, internal threading and folds that come with loose storage cans provide a breeding ground for pantry moths - their eggs hatch and mature without disturbance in such areas.
Those storage containers that have pronounced gaps and holes should be disposed of first as you fix containers with tiny gaps (use seal) instead of disposing of them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-thoroughly-dry-pantry-plus-washed-storage-containers">5. Thoroughly Dry Pantry plus Washed Storage Containers</h3>
<p>Upon cleaning, your pantry should be dried perfectly - this act reduces the chances of re-infestation or further contamination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pantry Moth&rsquo;s eggs may cling on the surface upon cleaning thus hatching later and resulting in a new colony in the process.</li>
<li>Moreover, washed storage containers/plastic bags should be dried in sun or wiped sufficiently with a dry piece of cloth.
Moisture traces will not only attract pantry moths back but also initiate mold formation, which leads to food contamination.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-vacuum-pantry-area-thoroughly---wipe-with-vinegar-and-water">6. Vacuum Pantry Area Thoroughly - wipe with vinegar and water</h3>
<p>By
vacuuming your pantry
, you will not only eliminate adult moths, but youll also get rid of their eggs and larvae. Further, the vacuum cleaner also clears cocoons effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the vacuum cleaner to a power source and turn it on. Gently, vacuum pantry surface, cupboard, shelves, pinholes, cracks, joints, corners, and storage container.</li>
<li>Empty the waste and inspect the presence of pantry moths  this enables you to make the decision whether to discard stored dry food.
Avoid using the very powerful vacuum cleaner as it may destroy the storage containers or your pantry. Upon vacuuming, wipe the shelves and pantry using a piece of cloth soaked in a mixture of water and vinegar.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-change-the-current-storage-method">7. Change the Current Storage Method</h3>
<p>Perhaps your current storage method isn&rsquo;t secure enough and thus ends up allowing pantry moths infestation - alternative methods such as the use of new plastic bags and tightly sealed tins would shield dry food sufficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, you can opt to store nuts and dried grains in a refrigerator/freezer entirely rather than in a cupboard or pantry.</li>
<li>Food items such as groceries should be kept far away from the pantry - they are a key attractant to fruit flies and other insects as well.
Adversely, food bought from the market should be stored separately and monitored for a week to ensure that no traces of moths are present.
Storing dry food together with a tray of eggs is an amazing preventive method since eggs smell repel Pantry moths from the vicinity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-scrub-pantry-thoroughly-with-soap-and-hot-water">8. Scrub Pantry Thoroughly with Soap and Hot water</h3>
<p>Dip a sponge or a piece of cloth in hot water and apply soap. Scrub doors, floor, wall, and liners of your pantry gentry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that door hinges are thoroughly cleaned - try to clean every possible area where moths, larvae, and eggs may be found.</li>
<li>Hot water kills moth&rsquo;s eggsplus its larvae instantly upon contact. Adult moths are scared away from their hideouts by hot water.
NB: Be careful when handling hot water lest you burn yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-wash-storage-jars-or-containers-in-the-pantry-with-soapy-and-hot-water">9. Wash Storage Jars or Containers in the Pantry with soapy and Hot water</h3>
<p>If your store dries food in plastic containers or jars; then, you need to clean them thoroughly in soapy warm water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often, these storage containers may have come into contact with pantry moths. Chances of pantry moths laying eggs in storage containers are high - therefore, you need to presoak all storage items before actual cleaning is undertaken.
Then, scrub the jars/containers with soap and hot water and rinse with clean water before leaving them to dry to touch.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-avoid-re-stocking-your-pantry-immediately---wait">10. Avoid Re-stocking your Pantry Immediately - wait</h3>
<p>By not restocking your pantry immediately after cleaning, you will prevent cases of pantry moths re-infestation. Often, pantry moths eggs may remain in the storage containers, especially if thorough cleaning was not undertaken.</p>
<ul>
<li>If keen measures are not put into place, these eggs hatch and infest the entire storage containers.</li>
<li>By delaying restocking, you will be taking cautious attention towards diagnosing possible occurrences of pantry moths into your storage containers/jars.
Also, larvae may be left in the containers upon which they mature and become adults if not removed before restocking.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-get-rid-of-infested-or-contaminated-food-substances">11. Get Rid of Infested or Contaminated food Substances</h3>
<p>Any contaminated or moth-infested food should be discarded or thrown away. The food may include either recently opened dry food or moth-infested dry food. Its difficult to observe moths eggs with naked eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you need to get rid of the entire container as soon as you notice a single moth.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can opt to store the infested food in a freezer for 7 days.
Then, sieve the dry food before cooking  low temperature inactivates
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live/">the live moths</a>
and kills their egg/larvae. For easier identification, you will notice tiny holes on the packaging container/sack that you never saw previously.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-signs-of-pantry-moths-infestation-in-your-place">What are Signs of Pantry Moths Infestation in Your Place?</h2>
<p>Pantry moths may not be identified easily, especially if the infestation is big enough to form a swam. Therefore, it&rsquo;s always advisable to be keen in looking for other possible signs that are highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-presence-of-adult-moths-or-larvae">1. Presence of adult moths or larvae</h3>
<p>Search for larvae or adult pantry moths in your cupboard or pantry. To do this, you will need to look for gray-colored insects with either white or red strips/patches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly, adult pantry moth measures approximately 1/2 an inch long. Pantry moth larvae (which is about 1.25cm long) appear like a worm with 5 pairs of legs.</li>
<li>You will easily spot adult pantry month flying in your pantry at night often than in day time.
During the inspection, check dry food such as rice, grains, cereals, and even flour - turn the grains thoroughly since some of these pantry moths hide deep inside.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-presence-of-holes-in-dry-food-packaging">2. Presence of Holes in Dry food packaging</h3>
<p>While undertaking your routine inspection in your pantry, the presence of small holes on packaging bags/containers for dry food is a clear indicator of pantry moths infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though other insects such as termites may pierce and make holes on packaging containers, chances are low that they reached your pantry.</li>
<li>Observing two or three holes is too much to let go of before opening the entire containers to inspect if there is any sign of pantry moth contamination. Also, inspect plastic wrapping and boxes as well.
When purchasing sealed dry food, check if there are tiny holes on the surface - such food may be contaminated with pantry moths right from the source.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-visible-cocoon-webbing">3. Visible Cocoon webbing</h3>
<p>By observation, check the presence of cocoon webbing in your pantry or storage containers. For boxes and cupboards, take a keen look at corners and edges.</p>
<ul>
<li>The stringy and clumpy network is left by pantry moths as they crawl along. These insects also build cocoons in which they lay hundreds of eggs.
If you are keen, you will observe webbed cocoons beneath shelves, or at the folds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-brings-pantry-moths-in-your-house">What Brings Pantry Moths In Your House?</h2>
<p>Often, pantry moths come to your home through food substances bought from outside. This may be cereals, grains, or any other type of dry food, which these insects feed on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, infestation or pantry moths contamination occurs during the processing or packaging of dry food.</li>
<li>Eggs, larvae, or adult pantry moths could be packed together with dry food and ends up in your house once you purchase such food items.
Once these contaminated food are stored in your pantry, the adult pantry moths or larvae spreads and multiplies numerously causing serious food poisoning.</li>
<li>Normally, pantry moths exclusively feed/depend on dry food substances.
The presence of high temperatures favors their breeding. Therefore, it&rsquo;s advisable to store your dry food in a freezer or low-temperature zones in order to keep off pantry moths infestation or further breeding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-pantry-moths-from-infestation">How to prevent Pantry Moths from Infestation</h2>
<p>Due to the adverse effects of pantry moths towards stored dried food, its advisable to consider the following preventive measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The store recently purchased dry foods in airtight containers</li>
<li>Place bunches bay leaves in your pantry or shelves  they repel pantry moths</li>
<li>Freezing new dry goods or food for 7 days - prevents pantry moths re-infestation</li>
<li>Store dry goods in glass or plastic cans that are tightly sealed  air-free.</li>
<li>Inspecting your cabinets, shelves, and pantry often</li>
<li>Fumigating your House with pantry moth repellants</li>
<li>Using peppermint leaves, cider, or mint chips in your pantry - sachet</li>
<li>Switching off lights at night  light attracts pantry moths</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on how to get rid of pantry moths, you can start by removing/clearing everything from your pantry, then wipe the shelves with a mixture of warm water, vinegar &amp; peppermint oil, or opt to dispose of non-airtight storage cans appropriately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, you need to remove and clean shelf liners, thoroughly scrub the pantry with soap and hot water, precisely dry the pantry &amp; washed storage containers as well as vacuum your pantry sufficiently before disinfecting the surfaces with vinegar.</li>
<li>For the case of storage jars or containers, they should be washed with plenty of soap &amp; hot water (kills moth&rsquo;s eggs), while contaminated/infested food substances should be disposed of accordingly.
Alternatively, change the current storage method and avoid re-stocking your pantry immediately upon cleaning (this may lead to moth re-occurrence). Notably, take preventive measures highlighted in this article to eliminate cases of future re-infestation in your house.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flour weevils are common insects that attack cereals and flour. The breeding rate could be adverse if the matter is not corrected in time. Perhaps you have a similar problem; what do you do?
<strong>Well, should I throw out flour with weevils? The direct answer is NO. Lightly weevil-infested flour is actually safe for human consumption. You won&rsquo;t get food poisoning or other stomach upset cases.</strong>
**However, for densely weevil-infested flour, it&rsquo;s advisable to get rid of it completely. Normally, weevils will feed on starch content in the flour, thus rendering it unsafe for consumption. **</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moreover, the flour is prone to poisoning in case of expiration. You will note, upon cooking, that the final flour meal has an unpleasant taste.</strong>
In this regard, it&rsquo;s advisable to consider the degree of weevil invasion and where possible treat the flour using methods highlighted in this article before using.

<h2 id="details-should-i-throw-out-flour-with-weevils">Details: Should I Throw Out Flour With Weevils</h2>
<h3 id="a-lightly-weevil-infested-flour">a. Lightly Weevil Infested Flour</h3>
<p>Lightly infested flour is suitable for human consumption (no need of throwing it out). The presence of weevils should be countable in the storage container or packet - count of 10 to 20 weevils at a glance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, cooked weevils have no historical cases of sickness/infection to humanity.
However, it should dawn on you that, a few weevil infestations are just an onset of the massive population - in a couple of days, the entire container will be full of hatched weevils.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s, therefore, necessary to consume the flour soonest possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-densely-weevil-infested-flour">b. Densely Weevil Infested Flour</h3>
<p>Densely weevil-infested flour should not be used whatsoever. The flour meal has an unpleasant taste upon cooking. Usually, the weevil infestation multiplies rapidly - they end up colonizing the entire flour package.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice tiny brown insects pacing in the container - the movement is fast but haphazard.
Moreover, the quality of flour fineness will deteriorate due to continue starch depravation - as weevils continue to feed on starch in the flour.

</ul>
<h3 id="c-action-to-take">c. Action to Take</h3>
<p>Upon discovery that you have flour weevil infestation, you need to ascertain the degree/extent of the infestation. For light weevil infestation, you may opt to use the flour directly without any problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, storing that particular flour (weevil infested) will only lead to further mess as the weevils breed further.
You need to control weevils immediately. This can be done by either placing the flour in a freezer for over 5 days - low temperature kills the live weevils and their eggs- or heating up the flour gently.

</ul>
<h3 id="d-dangers-of-eating-weevils-infected-flour">d. Dangers of Eating Weevils Infected Flour</h3>
<p>Though weevils are not known to lead to direct food poisoning or any food-related sickness upon consumption (when cooked), their infestation eliminates flour favors and additives in the package.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the weevils deprive flour of its original taste leading to unpleasant meals upon cooking - this is a clear indicator that the flour is stale and unsuitable for human consumption.
Furthermore, weevils infested flour is highly susceptible to external food poisoning agents, and preservatives added are weakened as starch is reduced through feeding, thus causing fastened expiration.
NB: Expired flour is dangerous and should in whatsoever case be disposed of safely. Weevil infestation accelerates the rate of flour expiration - flour may expire earlier than the indicated date.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-tell-flour-has-weevil-infestation">How to Tell Flour has Weevil Infestation</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to tell whether flour has weevils at the beginning until the infestation tends to rise. This is usually because of their size - these insects are tiny, thus at times impossible to see with one&rsquo;s naked eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the weevil&rsquo;s eggs are invisible and camouflage with flour color before hatching takes place.
However, if you are careful enough, you will note that the first mature weevils move about the flour, especially when you stir or turn the flour in the container.</li>
<li>The weevils appear as tiny brown bugs/insects - consider using a hand lens in order to improve overall visibility.
Alternatively, fetch a little flour with a spoon and spread it in over plane mirror - observe if you will notice any weevil move about.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-flour-get-weevil-infestation">How does Flour Get Weevil Infestation?</h2>
<p>Weevils originate from the source point, which is usually either the seller, granary, or millers. When wheat or maize is being milled, the weevil&rsquo;s eggs are rarely affected in whatever way unless treated.</p>
<ul>
<li>These eggs are then transferred to the package, which eventually finds itself into your house, where they hatch into mature weevils finally.
Failure of millers to treat wheat or maize before milling takes place is a key reason for weevil infestation in the flour  this particular cause can only be controlled through freezing as explained further in this article.
Alternatively, your flour may get weevils if stored with infested grains and cereals such as rice.

<h2 id="ways-to-prevent-flour-weevil-infestation">Ways to Prevent Flour Weevil Infestation</h2>
<p>The following are the best ways of preventing weevil flour infestation:</p>
<h3 id="1-freeze-flour-before-use">1. Freeze flour before use</h3>
<p>Once purchased, the flour should be stored in a freezer for over 5 days.
The low temperature in the freezer inactivates adult weevils leading to death. Further, the temperature prevents eggs from hatching, thus the entire life cycle of weevils is terminated.</p>
<h3 id="2-proper-flour-storage">2. Proper Flour Storage</h3>
<p>Your flour should be stored in an airtight container - this prevents adult weevils from accessing the flour from outside.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, this method may not prevent weevil infestation from the millers (source).
Alternatively, you can put your flour in a sealed bag. Avoid using polyethylene bags as a storage option whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-weevils-treated-label">3. Weevils Treated Label</h3>
<p>Always go for flour that has weevil treated label or sticker for authorizing body.
This is usually a diamond mark of quality and consumer protection measure, which guarantees you that the flour is treated against weevil infestation from the source (millers).
Therefore, consider the extent of weevils invasion and if possible treat weevil-infested flour using methods discussed in this article before using.</p>
<ul>
<li>Importantly, practice proper flour storage and healthy weevil prevention measures listed above. Related:Pet Safe Roach Killer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, should I throw out flour with weevils, the direct answer is no. Why because lightly weevil infested flour is actually safe for human consumption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you won&rsquo;t experience food poisoning or other cases of stomach upset. Indeed, cooked weevils have no history of causing sickness to humanity.</li>

? This is the right place for you because we have prepared the right answers to this question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody wants bugs in their homes, but sometimes they are inevitable. There are many pantry bugs common in our kitchen, stores, and other parts of our household.
But today I want to address the small brown insects that are slowly become a menace in our homes.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-small-brown-insects-in-my-kitchen"><strong>What Are Small Brown Insects In My Kitchen?</strong></h3>
<p>The small brown insects in your kitchen could be the
many kinds of pantry bugs
in our houses. There are many bugs that are brown in colour and more likely to be found in our kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of these bugs are harmless but their infestation in our kitchen and particularly in our food is totally unwelcome.</li>
<li>Though most of them cause no damage when consumed, it is highly discouraged since we cannot tell the possible outcome on your health.
I have identified a few of this brownish insects, their life cycle, and other characteristics. This will help you spot the actual insect in your kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-beetle-">**1. Beetle **</h3>
<p>This beetle is very common in our kitchens. Apart from kitchens, they are also found in
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-pantry-bugs-harmful-if-eaten/">food storage areas</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you leave your flour, cereals, spices, vegetables, or even drugs open, dont be surprised to find these beetles enjoying the meal.
They thrive well in temperatures above 23 C reproducing up to 5 times or more per year. However, their reproduction goes down if the temperatures go below 15C.
Keep your flour and packaged food tightly sealed if you really want to keep this pest out of your kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-silverfish-">**2. Silverfish **</h3>
<p>How do you know that brownish insects in your kitchen are silverfish? Well, silverfish has a colour ranging from white to brown-grey and others are bluish-silver in colour.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also identify them by their teardrop shape. And last but not least, you can identify them by their rear 3 long bristles.
Silverfish thrive in dark and also humid areas. Unlike other
pantry bugs, silverfish targets
where there are books and papers.
Due to their love for the humid and moist areas, you are most likely to find them in leaking kitchen sinks and bathrooms among other moist areas.</li>
<li>Toilets are also other areas you can find them as well as wardrobes because of clothes.
Though they dont pose any serious threat to humans, their presence in the kitchen and other home areas is irritating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ticks-">**3. Ticks **</h3>
<p>This is a tiny brown parasite that bugles after sucking blood. You are only likely to find them in your home if you have pets around. This is because they hardly move around unless with the help of a host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other bugs in our homes, ticks are parasites and also harmful. In the event that they suck blood from the host, either humans or pets, they can transmit Lyme disease.
They have 3 life cycles and in each case, they need to suck blood for survival. There are also very many species but in most cases, the adult stage is not so much active as the male dies after mating and the female lays eggs for the next cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-granary-weevil-">**4. Granary weevil **</h3>
<p>This is also another brown insect that you are likely to find in your kitchen. In most cases, this granary weevil is found in food stores and kitchens.
You can also find them in beans, rice, macaroni, and spaghetti, nuts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The egg is laid in the grain where it hatches intolarvae and feeds the inside of the grain. Though most of these weevils are small, their size also highly depends on the grain size.
They are found in almost all parts of the world and their economic significance cannot be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5cockroaches-">5.**Cockroaches **</h3>
<p>These are rather small insects that are reddish-brown in colour. You can also identify them by their oval body that is also flattened.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also have two long antennae and spiny legs.
They are some of the most stubborn pantry bugs in homes. You will literally find them almost in every area in your house, closets, and stores.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-these-bugs-harmful"><strong>Are these bugs harmful?</strong></h2>
<p>It is normal to get scared about the harm that can be caused by these insects. However, it is important to note that most of these bugs are harmless.</p>
<ul>
<li>At some point, you may find yourself eating such bugs without your knowledge. There is no need for getting scared though it should not be entertained.
In the case of ticks, they are parasitic and also harmful because they suck blood and can even cause Lyme disease.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-small-house-brown-bugs"><strong>How do you get rid of small house brown bugs?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-cleaning"><strong>1. Cleaning</strong></h3>
<p>If you have already identified the specific brown insects in your kitchen, the immediate question is how to control them.
Most insects thrive in damp and dirty environments. Keeping your kitchen clean and properly sanitized minimizes the chances of survival for most pests.</p>
<h3 id="2-disposing-of-infected-food-">**2. Disposing of infected food **</h3>
<p>If your feed is infected, one of the best ways of stopping any further multiplication of the pest is through
disposing of the infected feed
.</p>
<h3 id="3-using-traps-">**3. Using traps **</h3>
<p>A UV home trap will be most convenient to use to get rid of the pantry bugs. The insect control KATCHY trap is also very safe for use indoors.
This trap lures the insects through ultraviolet light and though it does not necessarily
kill them it traps
them and also helps reduce their population.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Silverfish</strong>are very tricky bugs to control because of their hideouts and complexity. Despite, the challenges to control it, you can still use insecticides to do it. Of most importance is to watch over kids and pets within your house.
<strong>Ticks</strong>
can be controlled by using acaricides in farms but this cannot be applied in our homes because of its effects and strong smell. Therefore if you have a large infestation of your home, I would recommend contacting a vet officer to deal with the issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-">**Final Thoughts **</h2>
<p>What are small insects in my kitchen? The highest probability is that you are having pantry bugs in your kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>These insects could be beetles, weevils, and silverfish among other bugs that have the same resemblance. A closer look at them and from some description given can tell what they really are.
If indeed these are pantry bugs, you can employ the appropriate control measures given or even others that are favourable to you.</li>

<ul>
<li>This will in a great way help minimize their presence and also<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live/">control any further infestation</a>.
That said and done, this article provides us with necessary information on how to deal with these pantry bugs.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-causes-pantry-bugs-what-you-need-to-know">What Causes Pantry Bugs?-What You Need To Know.</h2>
<p>The most common cause of pantry bugs infestation is brought processed foods and dry foods into your house. This dry food could be, grains, cereals, fruits, vegetables, nuts, bran and others in your store.</p>
<ul>
<li>Processed foods like floor, chocolate, spaghetti, macaroni, bread, cookies, cheese, and candies are also possible attraction points.</li>
<li>Their infestation can occur either at the store or in your kitchen and therefore the need to constantly check on the packaging.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-cereal-and-grains-">**1. Cereal and grains **</h3>
<p>As earlier stated, bugs come into our house because they are looking for food. It is hard to find them if there is nothing to eat. Cereals like maize, rice, barley, wheat among others mostly attract weevils and beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, weevils infest open cereals and grains where they lay eggs and continue in their multiplication.</li>
<li>They feed on these cereals where they lay eggs inside the grains where their life cycle starts. Their larvae stage eats and develops in the grain before the metamorphosis into adults.
Idianmeal moth, rice weevil, beetle, lay hundreds of eggs in the infested food making it inconsumable. The damage by these bugs is more of contamination than the food they consume.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-flour-mix-">**2. Flour mix� **</h3>
<p>Flour mix and other processed foods are very susceptible to attack by
floor weevils, wheat bugs, rice bugs and flour
. They are also visible on pasta, cakes, and any other mixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their destruction of flour and other foods leaves web-like traces, larvae and eggs making them inconsumable.</li>
<li>Some other times, you will also notice tiny brown insects on your floor as a sign of their infestation.
Among the many reasons why these bugs attack your flour is also keeping in humid and moist conditions. The other reason is leaving flour and other foods open and exposed to the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-other-processed-foods-">**3. Other processed foods **</h3>
<p>Spaghetti, noodles, biscuits and cookies, pet food, powder milk, processed chicken and fish among others are also subject to attack by these bugs.
If you have any of them in your house, keeping them open and disposed of is an invitation to the bugs.
Another possible invitation for
pantry bugs is dirt
. Though you may doubt this most pantries will thrive where the kitchen is poorly cleaned.</p>
<ul>
<li>That unemptied litter bin can easily attract the bugs and before you know it, your whole kitchen is full of bugs.
There are favourite foods that will draw them from miles away into your kitchen? Lets have a close look at what each of these foods will attract.

<h3 id="what-are-these-common-pantry-bugs-in-the-kitchen"><strong>What are these common pantry bugs in the kitchen?</strong></h3>
<p>There are certain bugs that you are most likely to find in your kitchen as compared to others. Some of these include beetles, Idianmeal moths, rice/grain weevil among others.</p>
<h3 id="1-bean-and-rice-weevils-">**1. Bean and Rice Weevils **</h3>
<p>Though there are very many weevil species, the most notorious pantry bug weevils are bean and rice weevils.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you find Small holes in the beans or rice grain, its already a sign of infestation by these weevils
One similarity with these weevils is that they both attack cereals and lay their eggs inside the grains and cereals.
<strong>But their differences are;</strong>
Rice weevil attacks, corn, rice cereals, wheat, dried fruits, apples, pears while bean weevil commonly attacks beans and peas.
In size, rice weevils are slightly bigger than bean weevils.
Also, rice weevils have a snout while bean weevil doesnt.
Bean weevils have a light brown colour and are oval-shaped while rice weevils are white and slender in shape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-idianmeal-moth"><strong>2. Idianmeal Moth</strong></h3>
<p>This is most probably the most visible pantry bug in our kitchen.� Unlike the weevils, the moths show up in your kitchen when searching for the best site for mating and lay their eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their most destructive stage is the larvae which are easy to find on flour, cereals, rice, nuts, and dried fruits among others.
The larvae leave behind a trail of webbing, poop and dead skin making it hard to consume the infested food. As the larvae mature and turn into moths that can be easily spotted flying around.
Though the food infested by these moths is not harmful, it is also not good for consumption and should be disposed of immediately.
