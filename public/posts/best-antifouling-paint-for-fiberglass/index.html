<p>Rust-oleum 207000 is an upgraded antifouling paint that features a modified alkyd, which claims to deliver excellent performance without defacing upon application.</p>
<p>The paint is manufactured with special additives that create perfect leveling and protect the fiberglass against UV rays.

The top-quality mixture gives the best flow and rollability when painting and leaves a nice thin skin/coating. Indeed, Rust-oleum 207000 form tough weather and abrasion-resistant coating that will serve you perfectly well without frequent repainting on a single application.
The washable antifoul paint (with water and soap) dries very fast upon application (hardens in 1 - 2 hours) and wont stain your clothes on contact. However, it may cause eye irritation upon touching or stomach upset when swallow (keep away from children).
Rust-oleum has improved gloss retention ability and can be applied directly upon opening without any hassle. Moreover, the paint leaves a classic white impression that makes it look gorgeous after application. Not forgetting, the color has a robust bio-active ingredient that improves stickiness, thus preventing any chipping or peeling of the coat.

nd
one after a week) can give you extra service life on your fiberglass.
Normally, wet areas are affected since excess moisture favors the growth of algae, weeds, slime, barnacles, and zebra mussels, which reduces the quality and overall impression of your item.
