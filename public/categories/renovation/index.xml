      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When embarking on a bathroom renovation, selecting the right vanity is a pivotal decision. It&rsquo;s not just a place for your sink; it&rsquo;s a central design element that dictates the room&rsquo;s style and provides essential storage. For homeowners looking to infuse their bathroom with a fresh, contemporary aesthetic without breaking the bank, <a href="/posts/glacier-bay-power-flush-one-piece-toilet/">Glacier</a> Bay&rsquo;s Everdean Vanity collection has emerged as a popular choice. As Home Depot&rsquo;s house brand for bath fixtures, Glacier Bay aims to deliver accessible style and functionality, and the Everdean series truly embodies this mission with its blend of modern design cues and practical features.</p>
<h2 id="what-defines-contemporary-flair-in-the-everdean-vanity">What Defines Contemporary Flair in the Everdean Vanity?</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;contemporary flair&rdquo; of the Glacier Bay Everdean Vanity is rooted in its adherence to modern design principles, characterized by clean lines, a minimalist approach, and a focus on functionality. It steers clear of overly ornate or traditional details, opting instead for a streamlined look that feels current and uncluttered.</p>
<p>Several key design elements contribute to its contemporary appeal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shaker-Style Doors and Drawers:</strong> The Everdean often features flat-panel or classic Shaker-style door and drawer fronts. This simple, recessed panel design is a hallmark of contemporary and transitional aesthetics, offering clean lines that are both timeless and modern.</li>
<li><strong>Full-Overlay Design:</strong> The doors and drawers typically feature a full-overlay construction, meaning they cover almost the entire face frame of the cabinet, minimizing gaps and creating a sleek, custom-built appearance.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Rectangular Sink:</strong> Many Everdean models come with a white cultured marble top that includes an integrated rectangular sink. The rectangular shape of the basin is a distinctly modern departure from traditional oval or round sinks, contributing to the vanity&rsquo;s crisp, clean lines. The integrated design also means no unsightly caulk lines around the sink rim, further enhancing the seamless look.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral and Modern Finishes:</strong> The collection is available in popular contemporary finishes such as Pearl Gray, Deep Blue, and classic White. These muted, sophisticated colors are versatile and can easily complement a wide range of modern bathroom palettes, from crisp whites and grays to more vibrant accent colors.</li>
<li><strong>Polished Chrome Hardware:</strong> The included polished chrome knobs or pulls offer a subtle shine that complements the contemporary finishes. Chrome is a staple in modern bathrooms, providing a clean and bright accent. While included, these can also be easily swapped out for matte black, brushed nickel, or gold to customize the look further.</li>
<li><strong>Thick Edge Profile Countertop:</strong> The cultured marble vanity tops often feature a 2.25-inch thick edge profile, which provides a substantial and luxurious feel, elevating the overall aesthetic beyond typical thin countertops.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining these elements, the Everdean Vanity creates an inviting and stylish focal point that resonates with current design trends, making it an excellent choice for modern bathroom renovations.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-and-practicality-of-the-everdean-vanity">Key Features and Practicality of the Everdean Vanity</h2>
<p>Beyond its good looks, the Glacier Bay Everdean Vanity is designed with practical functionality in mind, catering to the everyday needs of a busy bathroom.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Construction Materials:</strong> The vanity cabinet is typically constructed from <strong>laminate furniture-board</strong> (which is a form of particle board with a laminate finish). While not solid wood, this material helps keep the vanity&rsquo;s cost down, making it an accessible option. The laminate finish provides a smooth, easy-to-clean surface.</li>
<li><strong>Cultured Marble Vanity Top:</strong> The integrated sink top is made from white cultured marble. This is a man-made material composed of marble dust and resins. It&rsquo;s known for being non-porous, which makes it resistant to bacteria, mold, and mildew ï¿½ a significant advantage in a humid bathroom environment. It&rsquo;s also generally easy to clean. It&rsquo;s worth noting that cultured marble, while durable, can be susceptible to scratches and staining from harsh chemicals or prolonged exposure to certain substances, so proper care is essential. The integrated design means no overflow hole, which is often promoted as a feature that helps maintain a bacteria-free environment.</li>
<li><strong>Varied Storage Configurations:</strong> The Everdean line offers different storage solutions depending on the vanity size.
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrap-Around Drawers:</strong> Smaller models (like 25-inch or 30-inch) often feature a unique full-extension wrap-around drawer positioned above the main cabinet space. This clever design maximizes storage in compact vanities, allowing items to be stored around the plumbing while still being easily accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Cabinets and Drawers:</strong> Larger models (e.g., 49-inch) might feature multiple full-extension drawers and side cabinets with interior fixed shelving, providing ample space for toiletries, towels, and other bathroom essentials.</li>
<li><strong>Open-Back Design:</strong> The cabinets are designed with an open back, facilitating easier plumbing installation and access, which is a significant convenience for both DIYers and professional installers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adjustable Hinges and Full-Extension Drawers:</strong> The doors come with 6-way adjustable hinges, allowing for easy alignment after installation, which is crucial for a polished look. Drawers typically feature full-extension slides, granting complete access to the contents within.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Assembled for Easy Installation:</strong> Most Everdean vanities arrive fully assembled, saving significant time and effort during installation. This is a huge benefit for those undertaking a bathroom refresh on their own. The vanity top is often unattached for easier maneuvering and plumbing setup, with silicone caulking recommended for sealing it after installation.</li>
<li><strong>Faucet Compatibility:</strong> The vanity tops are predrilled for a 4-inch centerset faucet, which is a common and affordable faucet configuration, giving homeowners a wide range of choices for their fixtures (faucet and drain are sold separately).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-value-proposition">The Value Proposition</h2>
<p>The Glacier Bay Everdean Vanity&rsquo;s strength lies in its ability to offer a contemporary look and practical features at a highly competitive price point. It&rsquo;s positioned as an excellent value for budget-conscious homeowners, first-time renovators, or those updating a secondary bathroom or powder room.</p>
<p>While the particle board construction might not offer the same longevity or moisture resistance as solid wood vanities, proper care and attention to spills can mitigate potential issues. Its pre-assembled nature and straightforward installation make it very appealing for DIY projects. For many, the combination of modern aesthetics, clever storage, and affordability makes the Everdean a standout choice in the entry-to-mid-range vanity market, allowing them to achieve a fresh, updated bathroom without a significant financial outlay.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bathroom remodels are among the most popular home renovation projects, offering a significant return on investment and a dramatic improvement in daily living. However, the term &ldquo;bathroom remodel&rdquo; can encompass a wide range of projects, from minor cosmetic updates to a complete overhaul. Two distinct approaches often emerge when planning a bathroom renovation: <strong>wet <a href="/posts/what-is-wet-area-bathroom/">area</a> remodeling</strong> and <strong>full bathroom remodeling</strong>.</p>
<p>Understanding the difference between these two types of renovations is crucial for homeowners, as it impacts budget, timeline, scope of work, and the overall outcome. A <a href="/posts/wet-and-forget-reviews/">wet</a> area remodel focuses specifically on the most moisture-prone section of the bathroom ï¿½ the shower and/or bathtub area ï¿½ while a full bathroom remodel encompasses the entire space, from floor to ceiling. This article will break down what each type of remodel entails, explore their respective pros and cons, and help you determine which approach is the best fit for your home, needs, and budget.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-does-a-wet-area-remodel-entail">What Does a Wet Area Remodel Entail?</h2>
<p>A <strong>wet area remodel</strong> zeroes in on the bathtub, shower, and the immediate surrounding walls and floor that are directly exposed to water. This type of renovation is ideal when the existing layout of the bathroom generally works, but the shower or tub area is outdated, damaged, difficult to clean, or no longer meets functional needs (e.g., needing an accessible shower).</p>
<p><strong>Typical Scope of Work in a Wet Area Remodel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shower/Tub Replacement:</strong> This is the core of the project. It can involve:
<ul>
<li>Replacing an old bathtub with a new one.</li>
<li>Converting a tub to a walk-in shower (often curbless for accessibility).</li>
<li>Replacing an existing shower pan and enclosure.</li>
<li>Installing a new pre-fabricated shower unit or a custom tiled shower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wall Surrounds:</strong> Replacing old tile, fiberglass panels, or other wall materials in the shower/tub area with new tiles (ceramic, porcelain, stone), acrylic panels, or solid surface materials.</li>
<li><strong>Plumbing Fixtures:</strong> Updating the showerhead, shower valve, tub spout, and any body jets. This might involve minor plumbing adjustments within the shower wall.</li>
<li><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> Crucial for wet areas, this involves ensuring proper waterproofing membranes (e.g., Schluter-Kerdi, liquid applied membranes) are installed behind the new wall and floor surfaces to prevent leaks and mold growth. This is particularly vital for custom tiled showers or wet rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Drainage:</strong> Updating or installing a new drain system for the shower or tub.</li>
<li><strong>Shower Enclosure:</strong> Installing new shower doors (frameless, semi-frameless, or framed) or a shower curtain rod.</li>
<li><strong>Localized Flooring:</strong> Sometimes, the flooring immediately surrounding the wet area is replaced to ensure a seamless transition and proper waterproofing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s NOT typically included:</strong> This remodel generally <em>does not</em> involve changing the toilet, vanity, sink, overall bathroom flooring (outside the wet zone), lighting (outside the shower), painting the entire room, or moving walls/fixtures beyond the wet area.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-does-a-full-bathroom-remodel-entail">What Does a Full Bathroom Remodel Entail?</h2>
<p>A <strong>full bathroom remodel</strong> is a comprehensive overhaul of the entire space. This approach is chosen when the bathroom is significantly outdated, has major functional or aesthetic issues, requires a new layout, or when preparing a home for sale to maximize value and appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Typical Scope of Work in a Full Bathroom Remodel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demolition:</strong> Stripping the bathroom down to the studs, including removal of all fixtures, flooring, wall coverings, and sometimes even subflooring.</li>
<li><strong>Layout Changes:</strong> Potentially relocating the toilet, vanity, shower, or tub to create a more functional or aesthetically pleasing layout. This involves significant plumbing and possibly electrical rework.</li>
<li><strong>Plumbing &amp; Electrical:</strong> Upgrading or relocating water supply lines, drain pipes, electrical wiring, outlets, and light fixtures to support the new layout and modern fixtures (e.g., adding recessed lighting, new GFCI outlets, heated towel rails).</li>
<li><strong>New Fixtures:</strong> Installing all new fixtures, including:
<ul>
<li>Toilet (standard or comfort height, smart toilet).</li>
<li>Vanity and countertop (single or double, custom or pre-fabricated).</li>
<li>Sink and faucet.</li>
<li>Bathtub (freestanding, alcove, jetted) and/or shower (custom tiled, walk-in, steam).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Flooring:</strong> Installing entirely new flooring throughout the bathroom (tile, luxury vinyl, engineered wood suitable for bathrooms).</li>
<li><strong>Wall Finishes:</strong> Repairing drywall, installing new wall tiles, painting the entire room, or adding wallpaper.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Upgrading or installing a new exhaust fan to ensure proper ventilation for the entire room.</li>
<li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Installing new overhead lighting, vanity lighting, and potentially accent lighting.</li>
<li><strong>Storage &amp; Accessories:</strong> Adding new cabinetry, shelving, mirrors, towel bars, and other accessories.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Features:</strong> Incorporating universal design elements such as grab bars, wider doorways, or roll-in showers.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-each">Pros and Cons of Each</h2>
<h3 id="wet-area-remodel">Wet Area Remodel</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Significantly less expensive than a full remodel, as it involves fewer materials and less labor. Costs can range from a few hundred dollars for a tub liner to $2,000-$15,000 for a shower conversion, depending on materials.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Completion:</strong> Projects can often be completed in a few days to a week, minimizing disruption to your daily routine.</li>
<li><strong>Less Invasive:</strong> Does not require tearing out the entire bathroom, meaning less dust, debris, and noise.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted Improvement:</strong> Addresses the most critical area for moisture control and common wear-and-tear, often delivering a high impact for a relatively low investment.</li>
<li><strong>Good ROI for Specific Issues:</strong> If your shower/tub is the main eyesore or functional problem, addressing it directly can significantly improve the bathroom&rsquo;s appeal and value without overspending.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Upgrade:</strong> An excellent option for converting a traditional tub into an accessible walk-in or roll-in shower without gutting the entire space.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Aesthetic Change:</strong> While the wet area will look new, the rest of the bathroom remains the same, potentially creating a mismatched look if other elements are very outdated.</li>
<li><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t Solve All Problems:</strong> Won&rsquo;t address issues with old vanities, dated flooring outside the wet area, poor lighting, or inefficient toilets.</li>
<li><strong>Can Look Piecemeal:</strong> If not carefully planned, the new wet area might clash with existing fixtures or finishes.</li>
<li><strong>May Not Significantly Increase Home Value:</strong> While it improves functionality, a partial remodel generally won&rsquo;t boost resale value as much as a cohesive, full renovation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="full-bathroom-remodel">Full Bathroom Remodel</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete Transformation:</strong> Allows for a total redesign and aesthetic update of the entire space, creating a cohesive and modern look.</li>
<li><strong>Maximizes Functionality:</strong> Offers the opportunity to change the layout, add storage, improve lighting, and address all functional shortcomings.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Home Value:</strong> A well-executed full bathroom remodel often provides a strong return on investment (ROI) at resale, as buyers value updated bathrooms.</li>
<li><strong>Addresses Underlying Issues:</strong> Allows for inspection and upgrade of plumbing, electrical, and structural elements behind walls and floors, addressing hidden problems.</li>
<li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Provides the ultimate freedom to customize every aspect of the bathroom to your exact taste and needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Cost:</strong> Significantly more expensive due to extensive demolition, new materials for the entire room, and more complex labor (plumbing, electrical, tiling, carpentry). Average costs can range from $10,000 to $30,000+, or even higher for luxury finishes.</li>
<li><strong>Longer Timeline:</strong> Can take several weeks to a month or more to complete, during which the bathroom will be unusable. This requires alternative arrangements for showering and using the toilet.</li>
<li><strong>More Disruptive:</strong> Involves significant noise, dust, and contractor presence in your home for an extended period.</li>
<li><strong>Decision Fatigue:</strong> Requires making many decisions on materials, fixtures, and finishes for the entire space, which can be overwhelming.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Unexpected Costs:</strong> Opening up walls and floors can reveal unforeseen issues (e.g., water damage, outdated wiring) that add to the budget.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The choice between a wet area remodel and a full bathroom remodel ultimately depends on your specific needs, budget, and renovation goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose a Wet Area Remodel if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your primary concern is an outdated, damaged, or inaccessible shower/tub.</li>
<li>The rest of your bathroom fixtures and finishes are still in good condition or align with your aesthetic.</li>
<li>You have a limited budget or timeline.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re looking for a quick, impactful upgrade without major disruption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose a Full Bathroom Remodel if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your entire bathroom is significantly outdated or dysfunctional.</li>
<li>You want to change the layout or add luxury features.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re aiming for the highest possible return on investment at resale.</li>
<li>Your budget allows for a comprehensive transformation.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re prepared for a longer timeline and more extensive disruption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of your choice, careful planning, setting a realistic budget, and hiring reputable professionals (if not doing it yourself) are key to a successful bathroom renovation. By understanding the distinctions between wet area and full bathroom remodels, you can make an informed decision that perfectly aligns with your vision for a more functional, beautiful, and comfortable home.</p>
