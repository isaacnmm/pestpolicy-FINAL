<h3 id="2-what"><strong>2. What&rsquo;s your budget?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-what">¶</a></h3>
<p>Swing sets range in prices. Small units may cost $500, while more extensive, quality swing set may go up to $5,000 or even more.
You should also consider the cost of installation; if you can&rsquo;t do the building by yourself, you might need to contact a professional. Remember to include this cost into your budget.
If you are operating on a low budget, it is advised that you consider buying the set during the off-season or the end of summer.
Winter can also be a perfect time to purchase since; manufacturers are making new products and would wish to dispose of the old ones.</p>
<h3 id="3-ease-of-installation"><strong>3. Ease of Installation</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-ease-of-installation">¶</a></h3>
<p>The buyer installs almost all swing sets. Therefore, ease of installation should be a vital consideration.
Some sets can take hours to install and other few days. The instruction manual, as well as the quality of accessories or hardware, is a significant determinant of the ease of installation.
With this knowledge, you can select an ideal swing set with appropriate measurements that will fit perfectly in your small backyard.</p>
<h3 id="4-durability"><strong>4. Durability�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-durability">¶</a></h3>
<p>Durability goes hand in hand with the quality of materials used in making the swing set. Some of the material used includes vinyl, wood, and metal.
Always ensure that the set you purchase is made from a material that guarantees the safety of the child. Also, check the one that can withstand extreme weather conditions.
We recommend wooden swing sets, those made of cedar to be exact. Wooden swing sets are durable, reliable, and naturally resist rot or insect damage.</p>
