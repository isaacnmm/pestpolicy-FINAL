      <description>When you get signs of pests in or around the house, it&amp;#39;s critical that you hire a reliable and efficient pest exterminator.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you get signs of pests in or around the house, it&rsquo;s critical that you hire a reliable and efficient pest exterminator.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pest-control-near-me/">Top bug control services</a>
such as
Terminix
and
Orkin
will inspect the house and undertake some appropriate treatment to control the pests.
Below, I have reviewed American Pest for its effectiveness considering factors such as customer ratings, treatment effectiveness, availability, and costs.
Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="details-american-pest-control-service">Details: American Pest Control Service</h2>
<p>American Pest is a Washington-based and family-owned bug control company that has been in existence for 90 + years.
Over those years, the company has received a number of excellence awards including from the EPA (for less environmental release of pesticides) and the Department of States in the United States.
They will also prevent and control ants and ticks in your backyard.
The various pests included in their bug control plans include stink bugs, stinging insects, ringtails spiders, silverfish, rodents, rats, pavement ants, oriental cockroaches, house ants, mosquitoes, millipedes, mice, lone star ticks l, ladybird beetles, meal moths, flies, flies, fleas, drugstore beetles, crickets, cockroaches, clover mites, cigarette beetles, centipedes, carpet beetles carpenter ants brown dog ticks box elder bugs black-legged ticks bed bugs, ants, American dog ticks, and American cockroaches.

The effective viral disinfectant is an additional and attractive service that the company offers (among other extra services) that sets it apart from other <a href="/posts/pest-control-near-me/">exterminators</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this service, American Pest uses materials such as DSV which have been documented to remove SARS-CoV-2 - as approved by EPA.
The additional services have been documented to release tension in the community or households attacked by organisms including SARS-CoV-2.</li>
<li>The wipe-down and disinfecting remedy will help <a href="/posts/southern-pest-control-review/">control</a> or prevent contamination with coronavirus on various services.
Luckily, including these wipe-down and disinfecting services into your vacuuming and deep cleaning plans will help protect large areas with minimal effort.
I would recommend these additional services for areas such as busy households, workplaces, and large buildings.</li>
<li>For the first termite control on your premises, American Pest offers a $125 promotional discount.</li>
<li>Also, you will get free estimates and around $50 on the first bug control
Some customers give positive feedback on the &ldquo;free estimates&rdquo; because the company sends technicians to undertake &ldquo;inspection&rdquo; for just $100.
However, inspections are only recommended for clients that don&rsquo;t understand their pest problem or when the exterminators want to estimate the cost.
I noted that the company is classified as being Green Pro Certified which means they are active in pursuing environmental safety both in the use of products and procedures.</li>
<li>For example, American Pest has a clear plan on how to undertake pest control (while protecting the environment) on premises that have kids or pets.

<p>Upsides</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer protection from different wildlife and bug species</li>
<li>Its pest prevention and management are environmentally friendly</li>
<li>The website has online chat for clients</li>
<li>Qualified entomologists are the ones who create and oversee the bug management programs</li>

Downsides</li>
<li>Frequent errors or issues with free estimates</li>
<li>Billing issues for some clients</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pests-covered-and-plans-offered">Pests Covered and Plans Offered</h2>
<p>American Pest Control provides bug and wildlife control for commercial and residential spaces or premises in the Illinois area.
The companys exterminators and bug technicians use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for the control of various pests including;</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildlife</li>
<li>Moles</li>
<li>Wasps</li>
<li>Birds</li>
<li>Spiders</li>
<li>Bees</li>
<li>Mosquitoes</li>
<li>Flies</li>
<li>Rodents</li>
<li>Bed bugs</li>
<li>Roaches</li>
<li>Ants</li>
<li>Termites
The IPM method of controlling pests involves a toned-down technique for applying chemical pesticides but only using whats critically necessary for your current bug issue.</li>
<li>The aim is to maintain a mindful effect (positive or negative) on the surrounding environment.</li>
<li>For example, the company will use preventative techniques on your house such as removing warm water and food (their access to pests) and sealing bug entry points.
The initial visit by the company to your premises will include the technicians inspecting the home for best and outlining a plan to eliminate and prevent their reoccurrence.
Next, the American Pest technicians will create a bug control plan customized to the needs of your home.</li>
<li>The custom pest control plan will depend on the local climate and the changing seasons since they affect the pest&rsquo;s activity.
Below is an outline of what the American Pest technicians will do for the unique seasons.</li>
<li>Winter - technicians will undertake preventative pest services against wildlife to keep them off the home.</li>
<li>Fall - The strategy will involve prevention methods against rodents and pests - stopping them from getting into the home.</li>
<li>Summer - during summer, the pest technicians focus their pest control on the outdoors aiming to reduce flies, ants, mosquitoes, andfleas in the yard.</li>
<li>Spring - During spring, the American Pest technician will inspect for signs of a growing pest infestation while also treating for regular spring pests.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-locations">Service Locations</h2>
<p>American Pest offers its services to both commercial and residential properties including for birds such as mosquitoes, ticks, ants, termites, and bed bugs in a number of locations including;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sterling</li>
<li>Peoria</li>
<li>Pekin</li>
<li>Lincoln</li>
<li>Greenville</li>
<li>Galesburg</li>
<li>Champaign</li>
<li>Canton</li>
<li>Bloomington
The appropriate way to determine whether American Pest offers its services in your locality would be to call the client service line.</li>
<li>Representatives will check if the company offers their services in that zip code and also assist you to get a quote.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall American pest comes out as a positively reviewed exterminator service that has qualified technicians to handle different pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the company&rsquo;s services are not widespread enough last day and their website does not have enough details on the Pest Management processes.
Other recommendations that I would rate higher than this company include
Rentokil pest control
.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Armored Pest Svc is an Idaho-based bug control company. Other cities it operates include Oklahoma, Columbus, Kansas City, Arizona, Phoenix, and Englewood.</p>
<ul>
<li>The company does not have a storefront but offers door-to-door sales, website booking, and phone appointments.
Armored Pest Svc undertakes preventive and routine treatment for pests like silverfish cockroaches wasps, ants mice, and
spiders
The company does not notably offer specialized control of serious bugs such as that for termites.

</ul>
<h2 id="details-armored-pest-svc-review">Details: Armored Pest SVC Review</h2>
<p>Armored Pest Svc, however, provides their pest control to residential clients only.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can book routine pest control or annual plans for the prevention of pests.
The company claims that its pest control only utilizes non-toxic insecticides or pesticides.
Also, they will use a suitable enclosure when handling household infestations.</li>
<li>For example, Armored Pest Svc uses BLUEguard in its pest prevention mission.
The company does not use traditional marketing but hires contract marketers who use a door-to-door sales strategy.
I noticed that the company&rsquo;s contracts were highly advantageous to most homeowners as they comprehensively cover most common pests.
For example, the technicians offered to remove spider webs and wasp nests that they found in the house during the preventative treatment.</li>
<li>I can report that the preventative treatment (specifically the annual plan) is cheaper compared to using reactive pest treatment.

</ul>
<h2 id="negative-vs-positive-reviews-of-armored-pest-svc">Negative vs Positive Reviews of Armored Pest SVC</h2>
<p>I sought to examine if the claims by armor pest defense matched up to the reviews given by the customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>My conclusion is that there was a negative correlation - where customers reported the Pest Control services as being of poor quality.
However, the positive client reviews were notably many compared to the negative customer feedback.
Celebrity client reviews reported harmful and concerning company operations and practices.
For example, some of the customers reported the other companies&rsquo; door-to-door salespersons used overly aggressive strategies.</li>
<li>Some of the salespersons over-promised on the service quality, they underrepresented the contract&rsquo;s financial obligations, lied about the pest problems, and some even refused to leave customer premises.
Besides, other clients reported the company building services that one under-delivered or even where the <a href="/posts/affordable-pest-llc-review/">exterminators</a> never showed up.
Further, other clients reported that the definitions exterminators sent to their premises were under-trained and thus showed ignorance and negligence leading to property damage.
So it is clear that the salesperson from the company tends to over-promise him by making the client sign the contract documents even when they can&rsquo;t deliver appropriately.
Besides, even the clients that had positive reviews about a company noted that one has to be overly specific on the <a href="/posts/american-pest-review/">pest</a> control tasks to be accomplished under the procedure.
Unlike
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pest-control-near-me/">other exterminators near you</a>
, Armor Pest Defense shrinks the money-back guarantee with the annual plan in the fine print with exceptions and exclusions.</li>
<li>So overall my view is that Armor pest defense has very many negative reviews.
However, the company&rsquo;s annual pest prevention contract may be suitable for households that have ongoing bugs problems including mice ants, and spiders.</li>
<li>But as noted above you need to be overly specific with your requirements and direct exterminators on what must be done.</li>
<li>Also, be sure to carefully read the pest control contract prior to the official signing.
Upsides</li>
<li>Includes reliable cleaning services</li>
<li>Offers a suitable annual contract</li>
<li>Uses pesticides and insecticides that are non-toxic
Downsides</li>
<li>Many negative reviews</li>
<li>Performance and quality are unreliable</li>
<li>Overaggressive marketing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pests-controlled-by-armored-pest-svc">Pests Controlled by Armored Pest SVC</h2>
<p>The pests covered in the annual bug control by armor pest defense include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cockroaches</li>
<li>Crickets</li>
<li>Spiders</li>
<li>Rats</li>
<li>Mice</li>
<li>Ants
A positive Ant Inspection that was done by Armor Pest Defense</li>
<li>Richard from Armored Pest Services was extremely meticulous, and he took the time to explain every detail of his inspection. I would definitely recommend them for a thorough and enlightening Ant inspection.
My aunt refinanced her house using a loan and a requirement for us to undertake an inspection to determine the level of wood destruction.</li>
<li>Armor Pest Defense undertook the anticipation in a professional and satisfactory way producing the required report that satisfies the lender and my aunt (the homeowner).
Another client with a positive review reported that Armor Pest Defense was excellent in exterminating mice and cockroaches at a great price.
The customer noted that the company would send timely postcards with the dates of the next pest control visit.</li>
<li>Also, the exterminator is ready to adjust the date if it is not appropriate or convenient for the homeowner.
The pest control technicians that were dispatched to my home were professional and they discharged quality services.</li>
<li>The technicians are also effective and prompt - such that they will respond to client calls largely within minutes.
Homeowners love the annual bug control contacts that cover a number of their properties.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Armored Pest Services comes among the top 10 best exterminators around but also has its own shortcomings.</p>
<ul>

<p>The Terminix On-Guard Termite plan enables the technicians to block these pests prior to them attacking your structures.
These are the steps that will be involved in this on-guard termite plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exterminators will install termite bait stations at distances of between 10 feet - 15 feet with the aim of creating a protection zone in the home.</li>
<li>The termites will eat the setup bait before going back to the larger colony. Theother termites in hiding will also eat the bait and get poisoned.</li>
<li>The exterminators will undertake annual termite inspections (on your property) by monitoring the stations for any presence of termites.
Luckily, the Terminix exterminator will create a plan that fits the needs of your own during the inspection stage.</li>
<li>You may also get the Nix and fix termite control car guarantee</li>
</ul>
