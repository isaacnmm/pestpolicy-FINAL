<h2 id="understanding-the-flea-life-cycle---7-facts">Understanding the Flea Life Cycle - 7 Facts</h2>
<h3 id="1-flea-eggs">1. Flea Eggs</h3>
<p>The life cycle for a flea typically starts when an adult female will lay their eggs after feeding on blood from a suitable the host, this is mainly cats or dogs.</p>
<p>One half (50%) of the average home&rsquo;s flea population are flea eggs. Without blood, adult fleas cannot reproduce.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female flea can lay up to 40 eggs per day and as many as 2000 in her lifetime!</li>
<li>The eggs are sticky, so they will stick to the fur of your pet. This is called &ldquo;biting&rdquo; or &ldquo;bloodsucking&rdquo;.
On size, flea eggs are about 0.12mm long and they are yellowish-white in color and they&rsquo;ll be laid in batches of 20 eggs on the pet&rsquo;s fur.</li>
</ul>
<p>A female will lay from one to two batches, or 50% of its total offspring&rsquo;s eggs at a time, on your pets fur before moving on to a new host.</p>
<p>Flea eggs fall from your pet as they move, distributing them in the yard or house.</p>

Flea eggs hatch with the right temperature and humidity with 2-14 days. Larvae will emerge if temperatures are warm and humidity levels are high.</p>
<h3 id="2-flea-larvae">2. Flea Larvae</h3>
<p>Flea eggs can remain dormant for up to 18 months until they sense enough heat, which triggers an egg to hatch ( into larvae) within seconds!</p>
<p>Flea larvae constitute about 35-percent of fleas in your house. The newly hatched larvae will start looking for food immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>The larvae will feed on organic debris on the floor or your pet&rsquo;s fur and hair until they pupate, transforming into an adult flea within a few days.
Flea larvae emerge being wormlike and when - while also hiding from light. Larvae will eat
flea dirt (pre-digested blood)
and various organic debris they get in their surrounding.</li>
</ul>
<p>After feeding, the flea larvae will spin themselves into a cocoon and pupate (transform from an insect-like larva to adult). During this stage they are highly vulnerable if disturbed or exposed to light.</p>
<p>The whole process can take just two weeks with very warm temperatures and humidity levels, or more than a year with cold temperatures.</p>
<p>On size, flea larvae measure around a few millimeters (-inch) long, they&rsquo;ll look transparent (somehow white) and have a slightly bent tail.</p>
<p>Flea larvae will be the first thing you&rsquo;ll spot on your pet&rsquo;s fur or skin, and they might look like tiny white worms that wriggle around.</p>
<h3 id="3-flea-pupae">3. Flea Pupae</h3>
<p>Flea pupae will constitute roughly 10-percent of the fleas in your home. They will be dark brown in color and look like a &ldquo;J&rdquo; shape.</p>
<p>Flea pupae are hard to spot because they&rsquo;re not moving much, but they don&rsquo;t flee from light either - which makes them easier targets for you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make your inspection process easy when it&rsquo;s time to take care of fleas once-and-for-all; on color they&rsquo;re white to yellow and to brown.</p>
<p>This is the last stage on flea development before you get adult fleas. Its cocoon safeguards the pupae for up to weeks or months depending on the environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The sticky outer coating on the cocoon allows it to protect and hide the flea larvae deep inside rugs and carpeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you see flea pupae? Yes, if eggs or larvae can be seen, you will probably also see flea pupae. Though its appearance may seem like debris at first, flea pupae are really just a phase in the lifecycle of this fleas.</li>
<li>What kills flea pupae? The only way to kill flea pupae is by treating your home with a household &ldquo;flea&rdquo; treatment. To encourage them to hatch, vacuum the house first. Once they have hatched into adult &ldquo;fleas,&rdquo; they will be killed by the insecticide in your flea treatment.</li>
<li>What triggers make flea pupae hatch? The timing of when a flea will emerge is triggered by vibrations, high carbon dioxide, and heat - these are signs of presence of a host (warm-blooded). Vacuuming can trigger the flea pupae to hatch.
Therefore, flea pupae will only hatch out of their cocoons and into a &ldquo;flea&rdquo; life stage if they sense vibrations, high carbon dioxide, and heat brought by a pet or human being.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-adult-fleas">4. Adult Fleas</h3>
<p>After emerging from their cocoon, adult fleas start feeding (sucking blood) within 1-3 hours and becomes ready to breed and lay eggs in a few days.</p>
<p>Adult fleas constitute about 5-percent of the flea population in your home. Female fleas cannot lay eggs until they have had a blood meal.</p>
<p>On appearance, fleas are black (flat-bodied) and can be seen with the naked eye. Fleas begin life very small but will bulge upon feeding on host&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>Female fleas have a tube-like mouth structure, called a rostrum, which they use to pierce the skin of their host as well as suck blood from them. The saliva that is injected during this process contains an anticoagulant so it&rsquo;s easier for the flea to feed.</p>
<p>The saliva also contains a substance that prevents blood from clotting until they are done feeding which can take several minutes or hours depending on how much time each individual spends between meals.</p>
<p>Fleas do not have teeth to chew food so when their stomachs fill up, they release digestive juices into the host&rsquo;s blood which breaks down the host&rsquo;s cells. This is what gives a flea its red coloration after it has been feeding for some time on one animal or person.</p>
<p>After this process of digestion, the fleas poop out feces and can leave behind droppings in places where they have lived such as bedding, carpets, blankets and furniture.</p>
<p>Adult fleas will live for several weeks up to months on their host such as a
dog
or
cat
or also hiding on carpet edges, cracks, and pet bedding where they get adequate skin and hair.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-break-the-flea-life-cycle">How to Break the Flea Life Cycle</h2>
<p>Fleas take 1 to 2 months before they can develop into an adult flea and be capable of reproducing. As long as flea prevention and control methods are implemented, no new adults will form.</p>
<p>To break the flea life cycle;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a flea treatment on your pet and clean the house.</li>
<li>Wash all your pet&rsquo;s bedding and</li>
<li>Vacuum carpets to remove eggs, larvae, and pupae.
To ensure a flea free environment vacuum carpets, furniture and floors for three weeks. Machine wash toys, bedding and cloth in hot water to kill all flea stages.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can help speed up the hatching of any remaining flea pupae by increasing the temperature and using a humidifier.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-flea-treat-my-cats-and-dogs">How to Flea Treat My Cats and Dogs</h2>
<p>Pets should be treated with a flea treatment including
dog flea shampoo
or an appropriate
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-shampoo-for-cats/">cat flea shampoo</a>
. Fleas can become resistant to certain treatments, so it is important you use the correct one for your pet&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>A topical or oral medication that has an insect growth regulator (IGR) will help break the life cycle of adult fleas and prevent new from developing into an egg laying female for at least six months.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is important that you use pet shampoos with insecticides, as well as other products such, sprays or lotions on the animal&rsquo;s coat.</li>
<li>Products containing permethrin or pyrethrins are also effective in killing fleas and preventing a new generation from hatching eggs.
It is important that you treat your pets at least twice during the summer months with an IGR product to ensure complete protection, especially if they spend time outside.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, the life cycle of the flea is all about eggs, larvae and pupae.</p>
<p>The adult female lays her fertilized eggs on your pet&rsquo;s fur for them to hatch into larva or even pupae which then turn into adults after a couple weeks time.</p>

      <description>By breaking the flea life cycle, you will not only prevent further growth but also terminate breeding progress from that particular stage;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By breaking the flea life <a href="/posts/flea-life-cycle/">cycle</a>, you will not only prevent further growth but also terminate breeding progress from that particular stage;
i.e. eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On how long does it take to break the flea life cycle; the simple answer is about 1 to 6 months;�for the different stages, this is how long it&rsquo;ll take to break the flea cycle; egg stage break period (10-18 days), larvae stage break period (2 to 3 months), pupae stage break period (4 months.), adult stage break (5 months).�</strong>
amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best [Fleas Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Each stage may be broken independently though the elimination time varies from one stage to another.
When breaking the flea life cycle, it is important to identify the size of the infestation,
type of infested items
(is it pets, humans, or furniture), prevailing weather conditions, and possible source of infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-break-the-flea-life-cycle">How Long Does It Take To Break the Flea Life Cycle?</h2>
<p>Select a flea termination method that is environmentally friendly and safe for both pets &amp; human beings. Remember, if you are new to the flea-breaking process; contract a professional exterminator for help.</p>
<h3 id="a-egg-stage-break-period">a. Egg Stage Break Period</h3>
<p>Upon mating, the female flea lays up to 50 eggs per day on the host - this could be your carpet, furniture, dog, cat, or rag. Eggs easily fall from the host and thus end up spreading in different places.</p>
<ul>
<li>These eggs will hatch after 6 to 14 days on average. However, this period decreases in warmer temperatures (warmth favors the hatching process).
To break the fleas life cycle at the egg stage, you need to destroy all eggs laid as soon as they appear. To do this, you can vacuum your flea-infested items or animals sufficiently -this should be done daily for 10 to 18 days.</li>
<li>Vacuuming sucks eggsfrom the host and accelerates the hatching process, which exposes tiny eggs into visible larvae.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use fleas foggers that are specifically manufactured to kill eggs. You need to spray fleas-infested areas as soon as you see fleas&rsquo; eggs (small, tiny, white, and oval-shaped).
Fumigation should be done thrice per week for 3 weeks - this method works best for outdoor fleas elimination. Ensure that the fogger selected is safe for both pets and humans.</li>
<li>Steam indoor up to temperatures above 100 degrees - at this point, no eggs can survive.</li>
<li>On average, breaking fleas&rsquo; eggs takes 14 to 30 days.
This method may not work effectively, especially when adult fleas fail to lay eggs due to lack of food - remember, an adult flea only lays eggs after a blood meal. In addition, you may fumigate the area far before eggs are laid, thus making the method ineffective.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-larvae-stage-break-period">b. Larvae Stage Break Period</h3>
<p>Upon hatching (after about 14 days or so) flea&rsquo;s eggs become larvae. These are generally tiny worms that hide deepest into the host&rsquo;s skin, hair, or furniture  usually, larvae are scared away by the light, and hence difficult to see them during the day.
The larvae stage is the largest in the flea cycle (about 58% of the population). By breaking the larvae stage, you will reduce or eliminate fleas&rsquo; population far (over half) and reduce further breeding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, flea larvae feed on &ldquo;flea dirt&rdquo; or flea excrete and dry blood on the host (if any).</li>
<li>The use of flea larvae sprays works amazingly in killing larva entirely. All you need to do is to spray larvae as soon as they appear - you need to observe the tiny worms crawling on the host.
You can steam -clean your house, furniture, rags, and pet&rsquo;s beddings thoroughly.� Soaking larvae-infested items in concentrated soapy detergent work excellently.
Flea larvae stage stays for 21 to 37 days, after which they change to pupae. Actually, you are advised to continuously undertake larvae elimination at least twice a week for 2 to 3 months at most in order to break the entire link.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-pupae-stage-break-period">c. Pupae Stage Break Period</h3>
<p>The flea pupae stage takes about 2 to 3 weeks to mature into an adult. However, it may take even 6 months while still in its cocoon until it finds a live host - recall that flea feeds on blood and hence needs to get a host for meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though the flea pupa stage is not pronounced as compared to the later ones, this stage is the most cumbersome to break. Why because, most methods tend to fail in killing the live pupae while its still in the cocoon.</li>
<li>By using foggers or sprays, the chemical may fail to penetrate the cocoon layer, thus leaving the pupae alive.
On the other hand, vacuuming will just suck the pupa from the host, while the spinning action may not kill the live pupae as it is in the case of flea eggs.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the pupa (upon changing to adult) can stay in its cocoon for over 5 months without food, thus evading any surface killing action undertaken.</li>
<li>Indeed, the best method for breaking the flea pupa stage is steaming or room heating - you can heat chamber/room with flea pupa infestation to temperatures above 100 degrees - high temperatures kill pupa sufficiently.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can soak pet&rsquo;s beddings, infested items, and rags in steam at 100 degrees for a super killing effect. This method can be done once a week for about 4 months.</li>
<li>NB: Always be keen once you eliminate flea pupa since most play dead but later rise to life.
Normally, you should
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-the-house-fast/">vacuum your home or furniture thoroughly</a>
after steam cleaning - helps pick up dead and live pupae too. The vacuumed waste should be burnt sufficiently during disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-adult-stage-break-period">d. Adult Stage Break Period</h3>
<p>The adult flea plays a vital role in the propagation of the flea life cycle - reproduction. Actually, it&rsquo;s the adult fleas that mate and lay eggs that bring forth a new generation.</p>
<ul>
<li>By breaking the flea adult stage, you will be focusing on the root cause of flea infestation, which is often overlooked.
Adult fleas are highly visible since they move by jumping on their host. They account for about 2% of the entire population. Adult fleas can live for 6 to 12 months, especially when there is plenty of blood meal.</li>
<li>The use of adult flea foggers works sufficiently in breaking the cycle  cuticle disintegration. Actually, the chemical in the fogger kills the live adult flea, thus preventing future infestation.
Using borax powder over flea-infested items also kills them. However, this power should not be used on pets as it may cause discomfort.
Superheated steam (above 100 degrees) kills adult fleas completely. You can opt to soak fleas infested items in soapy water too - the fleas are suffocated to death.
The process of breaking the adult flea life cycle should be undertaken weekly for about 5 months  case of large flea infestation. Keen monitoring should also be carried out after the breaking period to assess any future re-infestation.

<h3 id="e-entire-life-cycle-break-period">e. Entire Life Cycle Break Period</h3>
<p>At times, it may not be possible to eliminate a particular stage of the flea&rsquo;s life cycle. Therefore, it&rsquo;s recommended to have a suitable alternative that breaks its entire stages.
Killing the whole flea life cycle (eggs, larvae, pupae, and adult) guarantees safety and security to both pets and human inhabitants. In fact, such an option works amazingly for a large flea population since the reproduction is continuous, thus making it difficult to separate flea life cycle stages while they are still on their host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Superheated steam is the best option when it comes to killing the entire flea life cycle - the method kills eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults instantly on contact. You will not find any life flea since high heat levels eliminate any chance of flea survival.
The vacuuming method is just sufficient enough in eliminating the entire flea life cycle  sucks and spins. However, upon vacuuming, the sucked fleas plus larvae and eggs should be burnt sufficiently during disposal - this reduces the chances of live flea escaping.
Currently, we have commercial foggers and sprays that are specially manufactured to eliminate the entire flea life cycle. Such products can be used as well. However, you must be keen on the labels that ascertain required properties and safety accrued to areas you intend to use upon.
By the fact that a single flea can lay over 15 times in a year (over 2000 eggs); then, going for a method that would kill the entire life cycle is highly recommendable. Generally, it will take 1 to 6 months to break the entire flea life cycle and 4 months on average.

<h2 id="which-factors-affect-the-flea-life-cycle">Which Factors Affect the Flea Life Cycle?</h2>
<p>Flea&rsquo;s life cycle is affected primarily by some of the following factors:</p>
<h3 id="1-temperature">1. Temperature</h3>
<p>Low temperature (below 50 degrees) inactivates the flea&rsquo;s normal life. Actually, fleas become less active and tend to remain deep underneath the host&rsquo;s skin or infested items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrary, warm temperatures favor fleas infestation - they tend to reproduce more and even become extra active on the surface.
However, too much temperature (above 100 degrees) denatures the active enzymes in the flea body, thus leading to death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-foodmeal">2. Food/meal</h3>
<p>Food (blood meal) is critical to any flea as it determines how many days it lives. As highlighted back in this article, upon changing into an adult, the pupae remain in its cocoon until it finds a host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, the host is meant to provide blood meals.
Fleas will visit your room just to suck your blood for food. Flea infestation in pet&rsquo;s beddings basically is just a waiting room for blood-sucking - as soon as your pet sleeps on it; then, fleas begin to bite and suck the blood.
Without food, fleas will vacate or die eventually.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-hostshelter">3. Host/Shelter</h3>
<p>Fleas look for shelter in any host - this could be your furniture, rug, clothes, pet, or carpet. All fleas want is somewhere they can hide temporarily, as they look for their blood meal in the vicinity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas have a tendency of sucking blood and retreating to the hideouts - this is a trick used by bedbugs too.</li>
<li>Your pet beddings or hair will shield fleas sufficiently such that most of the time you may never see them with your naked eyes.
The shelter is key and plays a great role in fleas&rsquo; life only when it&rsquo;s located near the source of food. Otherwise, they will relocate or die out of starvation with time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-humidity">4. Humidity</h3>
<p>Too much much water content in fleas&rsquo; shelters inhibits their life and survival. Usually, they get drown and die with time.
Eggs laid on the wet or moist ground fail to hatch, while larvae die of extremely humid conditions.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-tell-if-you-have-fleas-in-your-place">How to Tell if You Have Fleas in Your Place</h2>
<p>Below are ways to tell if you have fleas infestation in your place:</p>
<h3 id="a-red-bites-and-inflammation">a. Red bites and Inflammation</h3>
<p>Once you find red bites on your skin or small inflammation, the chance is that you were attacked by fleas. Unlike bedbugs, flea bites form reddish swell or inflammation.
Moreover, the bites are scattered around a particular area</p>
<h3 id="b-dried-blood-stains">b. Dried Blood Stains</h3>
<p>When bitten by fleas, the bloodstain dries on the skin surfaces and forms a reddish scar. At times, you will find a broken bleeding skin that was just mild, especially when you wake up in the morning.</p>
<h3 id="c-continuous-scratch-by-pets">c. Continuous Scratch by Pets</h3>
<p>Flea&rsquo;s bites leave an itching sensation. Usually, youll tend to scratch your skin as soon as you get bitten by a flea.
If you pay close attention to your pet (a dog or a cat), it tends to scratch itself intermittently at different points as soon as it gets bitten. The scratching may last for one minute or so, but not specific.</p>
<h3 id="d-live-jumping-flea">d. Live Jumping Flea</h3>
<p>If you take a keen observation on flea-infested items, you will literally find live fleas jump. The jump could be even a foot wide, depending on where it wants to land.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often, fleas jump from the host when they detect danger - perhaps when there is scratching or disturbance. Some jumps are short and continuous.
You need to intentionally disturb the flea hideouts and make keen observations using your eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e-flea-dirt">e. Flea Dirt</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Flea dirt&rsquo; is actually the excrete that&rsquo;s left behind on their host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, you will see blood life stains or dried blood, which when touched detach easily from the skin surface.
For large flea population (especially on pets), the infested area tend to appear reddish - for the case of dogs, it&rsquo;s around the neck region and ears. The flea dirt may settle on swollen flea bites too.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-flea-in-your-home">How to Prevent Flea in Your Home</h2>
<p>The following are preventive ways of curbing flea infestation in your home:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cleaning/washing all pets beddings, carpets, and rags in hot water (with soap) -plus dawn dish soap</li>
<li>All furniture and pets beddings, as well as cloths, should be vacuumed often and inspected against fleas</li>
<li>Usingfleas preventive foggersis recommended in a kennel where necessary</li>
<li>Fumigate your house often with flea repellant and dispose of dirty items  flea hideouts</li>
<li>Trim bushes and grass in your home to standard height within your home</li>
<li>Always get a flea profession to carry out flea inspection</li>
<li>Frequently take your pets for veterinarian attention  check if they are infested with fleas</li>
<li>Wash all fleas infested items at high temperature - kills entire flea life cycle</li>
<li>Often, vacuum your furniture, carpets, pet beddings, and other items to remove any flea attractants in your home.</li>
<li>Avoid mixing yourpets with others from outside they may be infected</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on how long does it take to break the flea life cycle, the direct answer is 1 to 6 months. However, this period may vary (either decrease or prolong) depending on the stage at which you decide to break the flea life cycle. Flea&rsquo;s life cycle breaking process will not only curb further growth but also inhibit breeding progress sufficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, a flea has four stages in its life cycle, i.e. eggs, larvae, pupae, and adult. You can opt to break flea at a specific stage depending on the termination method you select.</li>
<li>Though each stage may be broken independently, the elimination time needed may vary from one stage to another. In addition, opting for a method that kills the entire flea life cycle would be the best choice.
When undertaking fleas&rsquo; life cycle breaking process, it&rsquo;s wise if you identify the size of the infestation, type of infested items (is it pets, human, or furniture), prevailing weather conditions, and possible source of infestation. More so, go for the flea termination method that&rsquo;s environmentally friendly and safe for both humans &amp; pets.</li>
