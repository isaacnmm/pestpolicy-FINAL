      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/all-american-gutters-reviews/">Gutters</a> are more than just an aesthetic trim on your home; they are a critical component of its defense system against water damage. Designed to channel rainwater and snowmelt away from your roof, siding, and foundation, a properly functioning gutter system protects your most valuable asset from potentially devastating and costly issues. However, like any exterior element, gutters have a lifespan. Over time, exposure to the elements, debris accumulation, and general wear and tear can compromise their integrity.</p>
<p>Many homeowners tend to overlook their gutters until a problem becomes glaringly obvious, often when it&rsquo;s already too late and significant damage has occurred. Recognizing the early warning signs that your gutters are failing and need replacement is crucial for preventing more extensive repairs to your roof, fascia, foundation, and landscaping. Ignoring these indicators can lead to thousands of dollars in water-related damage.</p>
<p>This article will outline the five key signs that signal it&rsquo;s time for <a href="/posts/best-tiller-for-breaking-new-ground/">new</a> gutters, discuss material options for replacement, compare seamless versus sectional gutters, reiterate the importance of maintenance, and offer final thoughts on this essential home improvement.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-cracks-and-holes">1. Cracks and Holes</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious sign of gutter failure, cracks and holes, directly compromise the system&rsquo;s ability to hold and divert water.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it happens:</strong> Small cracks can develop due to age, material fatigue, extreme temperature fluctuations (freeze-thaw cycles), or impact from falling debris. Minor holes often result from rust (especially in steel gutters), corrosion, or a severe impact.</li>
<li><strong>The danger:</strong> Even tiny cracks can allow water to drip continuously onto your fascia board, siding, or foundation, leading to wood rot, mildew growth, and soil erosion over time. Larger holes mean significant water will miss the downspout entirely, concentrating runoff in unwanted areas.</li>
<li><strong>What to look for:</strong> Inspect your gutters, particularly the bottom of the trough and along seams, for visible hairline cracks, larger fissures, or rusted-through holes. If you see drips long after it&rsquo;s stopped raining, or during a light rain, it&rsquo;s a clear indicator.</li>
<li><strong>Repair vs. Replacement:</strong> Very small cracks or holes (dime-sized or smaller) can sometimes be temporarily patched with gutter sealant or a patch kit. However, if you find multiple cracks, long fissures, or a widespread pattern of deterioration, it signals that the gutter material itself is failing and a full replacement is warranted.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-sagging">2. Sagging</h2>
<p>When gutters pull away from the house or visibly dip and buckle, it&rsquo;s a strong indication they are no longer functioning effectively and are likely overloaded or improperly secured.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it happens:</strong> Sagging is usually caused by excessive weight (from clogged debris, standing water, or heavy ice/snow), damaged or insufficient hangers, or rotted fascia boards that no longer provide a solid anchoring point.</li>
<li><strong>The danger:</strong> Sagging gutters create low spots where water collects instead of flowing towards the downspouts. This standing water adds more weight, accelerates corrosion, provides a breeding ground for mosquitoes, and ultimately overflows at the sagged points, defeating the purpose of the gutter system.</li>
<li><strong>What to look for:</strong> Stand back from your home and visually inspect the gutter lines. They should run straight with a slight, consistent pitch towards the downspouts. Any noticeable dips, bellies, or sections pulling away from the roofline are red flags.</li>
<li><strong>Repair vs. Replacement:</strong> If only a small section is sagging due to a few loose hangers and the fascia is sound, you might be able to re-secure or add new hangers. However, if the sagging is widespread, if the gutter material itself is bent or warped, or if the fascia behind it is extensively rotted, replacement of the entire system or at least the compromised sections is the best solution.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-peeling-paint">3. Peeling Paint</h2>
<p>While seemingly cosmetic, peeling paint on your gutters (especially on the fascia board behind them) can be a significant indicator of ongoing water damage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it happens:</strong> Paint peels when it loses adhesion to the surface, often due to persistent moisture saturation or dry rot beneath. If your gutters are regularly overflowing, leaking at seams, or pulling away from the fascia, water will consistently run down and behind them, saturating the wood.</li>
<li><strong>The danger:</strong> Peeling paint on gutters themselves can indicate the metal is corroding underneath or the material is deteriorating. Peeling paint on the fascia or siding <em>behind</em> the gutters is a direct sign that water is escaping the gutter system and damaging your home&rsquo;s trim. This leads to rot, mold, and further structural damage.</li>
<li><strong>What to look for:</strong> Look for blistering, flaking, or peeling paint on the exterior of the gutters, but more critically, on the wooden fascia board directly behind them or on the top edges of your siding below the gutters.</li>
<li><strong>Repair vs. Replacement:</strong> Repainting alone won&rsquo;t fix the underlying moisture problem. If you see peeling paint, it&rsquo;s a strong sign that water is getting where it shouldn&rsquo;t. Investigate the source of the leak or overflow. If the gutters themselves are leaking or repeatedly overflowing, they likely need replacement to prevent continuous damage to your home&rsquo;s structure.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-pooling-water">4. Pooling Water</h2>
<p>If you notice pools of water around your home&rsquo;s foundation after it rains, it&rsquo;s a critical sign that your gutters are failing to direct water away effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it happens:</strong> This can be due to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Clogged Downspouts:</strong> Preventing water from exiting the gutter system.</li>
<li><strong>Sagging Gutters:</strong> Water collects in low spots and overflows.</li>
<li><strong>Improperly Pitched Gutters:</strong> The gutters don&rsquo;t slope adequately towards the downspouts.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Downspout Extensions:</strong> Water exits the downspout but is dumped too close to the foundation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The danger:</strong> Pooling water around the foundation is a direct pathway to basement leaks, crawl space moisture issues, cracked foundations, and severe structural damage. It can also cause soil erosion and damage to landscaping.</li>
<li><strong>What to look for:</strong> Observe your home during or immediately after a rainstorm. Walk around the perimeter and look for puddles or saturated soil directly against the foundation walls. Listen for gushing water over the side of the gutters instead of flowing out the downspout.</li>
<li><strong>Repair vs. Replacement:</strong> While sometimes a thorough cleaning, unclogging downspouts, or adding extensions can fix this, persistent pooling after these basic steps suggests a fundamental problem with the gutter system&rsquo;s design, pitch, or capacity. If the gutters are repeatedly overflowing despite being clean, they may be too small for your roof, or they might be beyond simple repair, necessitating replacement.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-water-damage-around-your-home">5. Water Damage Around Your Home</h2>
<p>Visible signs of water damage on your home&rsquo;s exterior or even interior are undeniable evidence that your gutters are failing and need immediate attention.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it happens:</strong> This is the ultimate consequence of all the previous signs being ignored. Water that&rsquo;s not properly diverted causes rot, mold, staining, and deterioration.</li>
<li><strong>The danger:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fascia and Soffit Rot:</strong> Water continually spilling over or behind gutters will rot the wooden fascia and soffit, leading to expensive structural repairs and pest entry points.</li>
<li><strong>Siding Damage:</strong> Streaks, mildew, peeling paint, or warped/rotted siding panels.</li>
<li><strong>Basement/Crawl Space Flooding:</strong> The most severe outcome, leading to mold, structural damage, and costly remediation.</li>
<li><strong>Interior Leaks:</strong> Water can seep through the roof decking, into the attic, and down walls, causing ceiling stains, ruined drywall, and mold growth inside your living spaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What to look for:</strong> Obvious water stains on your exterior walls, especially below the gutters. Discolored, soft, or spongy wood on your fascia or soffits. Mold or mildew growth on exterior walls. Musty odors in your basement or crawl space. Water stains on interior ceilings or walls near exterior walls.</li>
<li><strong>Repair vs. Replacement:</strong> If you&rsquo;re seeing actual water damage on your home&rsquo;s structure, it means your gutters have been failing for some time. While the specific water damage itself needs to be repaired by a professional, replacing the compromised gutter system is paramount to prevent recurrence. This is no longer a question of patching but of investing in a new, fully functional system.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="gutter-replacement-material-options">Gutter Replacement Material Options</h2>
<p>When considering new gutters, you&rsquo;ll have several material choices, each with its pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aluminum:</strong> Most popular, rust-proof, lightweight, available in many colors, good lifespan (20-30 years).</li>
<li><strong>Steel (Galvanized or Galvalume):</strong> Very strong, ideal for heavy snow/wind, but can rust if coating is scratched. (20-30+ years).</li>
<li><strong>Copper:</strong> Premium choice, beautiful patina, exceptional durability (50-100+ years), does not rust, very expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Vinyl (PVC):</strong> Least expensive, DIY-friendly, but less durable and prone to cracking/warping in extreme temperatures (1-5 years).</li>
<li><strong>Zinc:</strong> High-end, very durable, develops a unique patina, expensive (80-100+ years).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="seamless-vs-sectional-gutters">Seamless Vs. Sectional Gutters</h2>
<p>This choice impacts both the appearance and long-term performance of your new gutters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seamless Gutters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Custom-fabricated on-site from a single piece of metal (usually aluminum) to the exact length of your roofline. Only seams are at corners and downspout outlets.</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Far fewer leaks points (fewer seams), cleaner appearance, less maintenance, longer lifespan.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> More expensive, requires professional installation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sectional Gutters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Come in pre-cut sections (usually 10-20 feet long) that are joined together with connectors and sealed. Commonly made from vinyl or aluminum.</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Less expensive, can be a DIY project, easier to replace small sections.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Many seams mean more potential leak points, require more maintenance over time, less durable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For most homeowners replacing an entire system, seamless aluminum gutters offer the best balance of cost, durability, and performance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-is-gutter-maintenance-important">Why Is Gutter Maintenance Important?</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether you repair or replace, ongoing gutter maintenance is non-negotiable. Regular cleaning, at least twice a year (spring and fall), prevents debris buildup that leads to clogs, sagging, and eventual failure. Inspections allow you to catch small issues before they become major problems. Without consistent maintenance, even brand-new gutters will eventually succumb to the same &ldquo;troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-about-gutter-replacement">Final Thoughts About Gutter Replacement</h2>
<p>Recognizing the signs that you need new gutters is a crucial step in protecting your home from water-related damage. While minor issues can often be repaired, widespread cracking, persistent sagging, or visible water damage to your home&rsquo;s structure are clear indicators that your existing gutters have reached the end of their useful life.</p>
<p>Investing in a new, properly installed gutter system, particularly a seamless one, is a wise decision that will safeguard your foundation, roof, and siding for decades to come. Don&rsquo;t wait until the damage is extensive and expensive; proactively addressing failing gutters is an investment in your home&rsquo;s integrity and your peace of mind.</p>

[suspecting <a href="/posts/cockroach-eggs/">cockroaches</a> in your house](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches-in-apartments/">https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches-in-apartments/</a>)
? One thing you need to know is that roaches are nocturnal pests and are very active during the night.
They are very tactical, as they will also hide in crevices and cracks which complicate things.
<strong>In summary, the signs of a <a href="/posts/cockroach-vs-palmetto-bug/">cockroach</a> infestation are roach droppings, live or dead cockroaches, smear marks, shredded roach skin, strong odor, roach egg capsules, plus furniture and property damage.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Killer for Cockroaches&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
What is annoying is that they will feed on anything in your home from food, clothes, papers, plastics and anything around then hide only for you to find damages.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-a-cockroach-infestation---7-notable-signs-">**Signs of a Cockroach Infestation - 7 Notable Signs **</h2>
<p>There are different signs that you can use to tell if you have an infestation in your home. This is because roaches are hard to spot during the day and they will only come out when the lights are off.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the day, they hide in crevices and cracks and other dark spots where its hard to spot them.</li>
<li>With over 4000 species of cockroaches in the world, there is 2 major type of cockroaches found in the USA. These are the American and the German species.
American cockroaches will mostly be found outdoors and in garbage bins, while German cockroaches are mostly found indoors -
use chemicals such as Harris
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-dropping-">**1. ****Dropping **</h3>
<p>Cockroach droppings are a first and a sure way of telling that the roaches are in the house. When they come out in the night to feed, they will eat anything left in the open and uncovered.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also drop their feces, all over countertops, floors, shelves, and pantry among other areas.</li>
<li>In case you do not know the dropping look like, you will see some things that look specks of black pepper or coffee grounds.
The amount of droppings and how scattered is also a better way to tell on the levels of infestation of the roaches in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-live-or-dead-cockroaches">**2. **<strong>Live or Dead Cockroaches</strong></h3>
<p>Once in a while when you are likely to spot roaches roaming around the house as they move into their hiding places. If you turn off the light for a few minutes and then turn it on, you will see the roaches running back into their hideouts.</p>
<ul>
<li>In some extreme cases where there is an over-infestation, you will even see the cockroaches during the day as they try to get something to eat.
Also, you may also spot them when they are dead due to many factors. These dead roaches mostly appear where there are dropping or eggs around them.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-smear-marks-">**3. ****Smear marks **</h3>
<p>Cockroaches have a tendency to leave dark smear trails on the walls as they crawl along.
These marks are visible where the area is humid and moist. They are also the marks that roaches make to and fro as they get to the source of their food.</p>
<h3 id="4-shredded-skin-">**4. Shredded ****skin **</h3>
<p>Roaches molt their skin 8-13 times in their life cycle as they transition from one life stage into another.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look out for these skins as a sign of an infestation of roaches into your home.</li>
<li>The shredded skin varies in size and shape as they are molted at different stages of a cockroachs life.
If you see them in your house,
its a red alert
to take action against the roaches in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-strong-odor-">**5. ****Strong odor **</h3>
<p>If your house is having a strong odor, chances are that you have a cockroach infestation. This stench increases as the number of roaches in your house increases. The stench could be as a result of the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cockroach dropping</li>
<li>Dropping pheromone</li>
<li>Dead roaches
The odor from the dropping pheromone is even more likely to attract more roaches into the house if you do not take immediate action.
The German cockroaches who like staying indoors are the number one stench producers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-egg-capsules-">**6. ****Egg capsules **</h3>
<p>Cockroaches lay eggs in a capsule that is also called oothecae. One ootheca can contain up to 30 eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though different species have different oothecae, the most common in our houses is the German cockroaches that have 18 segments while American roaches dont have a defined segment.</li>
<li>Some roaches carry the oothecae until before it hatches while others will drop it soon after they land into a new environment.
These oothecae are brown in color and translucent in nature and are normally left behind after the eggs hatch into nymphs.</li>
<li>These capsules can be seen in hidden places like under the furniture, in cabinets, and in other hidden dark places - you can use<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/when-to-use-a-cockroach-bomb/">cockroach Bomb</a>.
When you spot the capsules, its not time to sit down and relax because cockroaches have already settled in your room.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-furniture-and-property-damage-">**7. ****Furniture and Property Damage **</h3>
<p>Cockroaches will feed on anything that they find in the surroundings including, food, fabrics, plastic, and furniture among others.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you make a keen observation within your house and find such damage, the uninvited guests are already in your house.
They destroy food packaging as they look for food for survival. Do not wait any further if you have seen these signs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-i-do-if-i-see-cockroaches-in-my-house"><strong>What do I do if I see cockroaches in my house?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches come to our houses because of many reasons but most importantly to look for food and somewhere to reproduce.
After the notable signs, you should also try to navigate their possible handouts to understand the level of their infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I were you, the best option I would take is to call a pest control expert immediately. The good thing with pest control experts is that they have the necessary experience and expertise to handle any kind of infestation.</li>
<li>Secondly, if you are a DIYer, you can get a pest control product from trusted stores and follow the given instructions to eliminate these stubborn roaches. Cockroaches are stubborn and these may not be as effective as hiring an expert.
Thirdly, observing high standards of cleanliness is also a better way of
keeping the roaches away
.
Cleaning their hideouts, their droppings, eggs, and any other dirt in your house leaves the roaches with nothing to feed or attract them into your house.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Now you know the signs of a cockroach infestation to look for in your house. These are going to help you take
immediate action against the control
of these harmful bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roaches are harmful and cause a lot of damages to our houses and should not be entertained at all cost.
Though home remedies and general cleanliness keep them off from your house, contacting a pest control expert will be the most ideal for the proper elimination of these roaches.</li>

      <title>Signs Of Termites</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>Below Ive outlined signs of termites - these will become evident with rising atmospheric pressure, wind, light intensity, moisture levels, and temperatures...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below Ive outlined signs of termites - these will become evident with rising atmospheric pressure, wind, light intensity, moisture levels, and temperatures - proper termite identiifcation will help you decide on the
appropriatrae control method
.
In summary, you&rsquo;ll know if the structures such as the house or other buildings are infested with termites when you see some of these clues;</p>
<ul>
<li>The presence of termites swarmers (dead or alive) inside the structures.</li>
<li>Check the crawl spaces or on the building walls (externally) up from the foundation for mud shelter tubes</li>
<li>When the structures are damaged by termites.
Other signs of termites will include discarded wings, bubbling or uneven paint, and frass.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-9-signs-of-termites---termite-activity">Details: 9 Signs of Termites - Termite Activity</h2>
<h3 id="1-termite-swarmers">1. Termite Swarmers</h3>
<p>Termite swarms can happen outside or inside the house as the termites leave their nests and set up a new colony.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately after the swarmers begin flying, they&rsquo;ll shed wings.</li>
<li>So the swarmers will leave evidence of wings (small piles) on various surfaces and spiderwebs including on the doors, window sills, and the house foundation.
To
differentiate between termites and ants
; note that the wings of termites have the same size whereas ants&rsquo; wings have different sizes.</li>
<li>The rear pair of wings of an and is smaller</li>
<li>While the front pair of wings of ant is larger
To know that the termites are really swarmers, you&rsquo;ll need to use a magnifying glass and check its colour as it&rsquo;s a common sign.</li>
<li>Carpenter ant swarmers are dark brown, black, or red - comparedCarpenter Ants vs Fire Ants</li>
<li>Swarmers of the dry wood termites will be solid red.</li>
<li>Swarmers of subterranean termites will be solid black.
So you can notice termite swarmers emerge from structures such as the house or even Edwards lying on the window sill or on the floor.
Citing the termite swarmers in the house is enough sign that the structure is infested by termites and will require professional termite control.</li>
<li>I advise scheduling a termite inspection and treatment for the building in question.
Scientists note that termites require a number of years for their colonies to grow large and produce swarmers.
If you see many swarmers coming out of a building, it is a sign that a large termite colony is eating up the structure.
However, killing the termite swarmers only will not solve your termite problem.</li>
<li>After all, the termite&rsquo;s swarmers that leave the building eventually die when they can&rsquo;t get too moist ground to feed and reproduce.
Therefore, killing the termite swarmers will only leave the other termite colony thriving unless you treat them.
NB: Finding a few Formosan termites could be an exception when sighted in a building that is appropriately treated for termites.</li>
<li>This is because the Formosan swarmers will be attracted by light from outside colonies or trees and may enter the house, especially in the swam season.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbFdJQuDAzM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbFdJQuDAzM</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-finding-mud-shelter-tubes">2. Finding mud shelter tubes.</h3>
<p>If you see mud shelter tubes moving up the house plumbing, support piers, enable foundation walls, and outside foundation walls, then there could be a termite colony around.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, termites can build shelter tubes on the exterior side of a slab to enable them to get into the house under the siding.
For verification purposes;</li>
<li>Break a small section of that mud tube and check if you see any termites.</li>
<li>Also, check the broken tube after a few days to see if the termites have repaired that section.
These two will be enough signs that the termites are actively infesting the building or structures.
But destroying the mud tubes only will not get rid of a termite infestation (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">but fumigation can help</a>
). This is because the termites will go around and know how to enter the building anyway.</li>
<li>So after finding the mud shelter tubes, I advise you get professional exterminators to inspect the building for termites.
But any shelter tubes that are inactive and old (especially from a previous termite infestation gross profit must be scraped off or removed to make subsequent inspections easier.
You may also find the mud shelter tubes (especially for the Formosan termite) at higher locations of the building such as on the fascia boards, soffit, exterior wall, ceilings, and internal walls.
Other possible reasons for the entry of the termites (especially the Formosan termites) include the presence of above-ground moisture or roof leak.
I advise you to drill some pinholes on the mud shelter tubes or the dried mud on the structures for treatment of termites.</li>
<li>If the pinholes are repaired using mud, it will be clear that the termites have repaired them to prevent airflow exposure.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-sunken-trails-or-areas-under-the-paint">3. Sunken trails or areas under the paint</h3>
<p>The presence of trails or sunken areas on the surfaces, paint, or wallpaper may signify the presence of termites.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sunken trails or areas under the paint could be resulting from the feeding activity of the termites as they cause damage to the cardboards.
However, termites do not eat gypsum but will feed on the cardboard and wood panelling that is covering it.
The mud may be formed into all shapes on the ceiling and walls particularly during late spring.</li>
<li>For example, the &ldquo;swarm castles&rdquo; of the formosan termites may be 1.5 inches tall and roughly 3 in white.
To identify the presence of the formosan termites, break the mud structures and see if their soldiers will come out defending their colony.
Also, check the foam insulation around the house and see if there are any mud tubes that are traveling through or over it.</li>
<li>The termites really easily tunnel through the foam insulation (particularly if it is sprayed on) but will not eat it.
Some of the termite species that will tunnel through spray-on foam insulation include the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">Eastern subterranean termites</a>
and the formosan termites.</li>
<li>Termite damage in your house may get noticed when you&rsquo;re doing your re-modelling, doing home repairs or replacing old wallpapers.
Despite the fact that termites will leave an area shortly after attacking it, you may still see some of these animals that will denote the presence of an active termite infestation.

</ul>
<h3 id="4-structural-damage-on-the-roof-and-floors">4. Structural damage on the roof and floors.</h3>
<p>If you notice structural damage such as a sagging roof or floor or even a door frame that is broken, you could be sure that they are termites attacking.</p>
<ul>
<li>But also the structural damage could have resulted from factors such as Wood rot.
But if you see excessive dried or live termites on the damaged timber, this could point out that there are termites attacking the structures.
Another sign that will denote the presence of drywood termites is if you find six-sided pallets that are uniformly-sized (small) on the countertop or floor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Termites will wittingly hide themselves in ward and soil especially in crisis and cars that are hidden on the foundation and the structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if there are clear signs of a damaged infestation, then it is clear that their population is very high (since these pests are challenging to detect).
The presence of shelter tubes moving up on the outside of the foundation wall will show the presence of termites.
However, I advise that you get expert
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-inspection-cost/">professional termite inspection</a>
for your structures and the house for effective control.
Also, don&rsquo;t forget to undertake regular or annual termite prevention and control on various structures and the yard.
Cheers!</li>
