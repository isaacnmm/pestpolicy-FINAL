<p>Miracle granite is a unique sealant that has over the years been preferred by most clients due to its durability.</p>
<p>It is estimated to give your granite protection of up to 20 years but on limited conditions.
Its strong adhesiveness and deep penetration play a vital role in protecting your surface against water and oil penetration.
This sealant is also transparent to UV and can be used either indoors or outdoors.
This feature also gives it strong resistance against harsh weather that the surface is predisposed to. You can use it on surfaces like tiles, terrazzo, marbles, granite, and stucco, among others.
Its application is easy, and you can use a brush, roller, or sprayer. Consequently, it has good coverage, and with one quart, you can achieve a surface of about 1000 square ft.
Its strong odour may require you to have adequate ventilation when applying it. Similarly, before application, the surface must also be well prepared for the sealant&rsquo;s better effectiveness.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water and oil resistant</li>
<li>It is durable</li>
<li>Resistant to harsh weather</li>
<li>For use on indoors and outdoors</li>

<p>Dry-treat is a multi-purpose sealer that is mostly preferred by professionals. Unlike other sealants, you get a permanently sealed surface.</p>
<p>Though costly, you only need to apply once, and you are good to go. Dry-treat leaves an impermeable surface that allows the surface to breathe and avoids moisture build up on your surface.
This is a good attribute as it helps avoid damage to the surface by moisture giving it longer shelf life.
Whenever applying this sealer, you will need 2-3 coats to achieve better results that can last your surface for long.
You can apply to include walls, floor, kitchen, fences, and garages among the surface. It also works very well on granite, stones, tiles, bricks, and concrete.
The good thing about this sealer is that it dries very fast, and within 10 minutes, the surface is dry, and you can apply the second coat.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives a permanent finish.</li>
<li>It leaves a breathable finish.</li>
<li>It can be used on multiple surfaces.</li>
<li>Used for both interior and exterior surfaces</li>
<li>Dries fast-ready within 10 minutes</li>
<li>The finish is glossy</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is costly</li>
</ul>

<p>HMK is an excellent choice if you are looking for a solvent-based sealer for granite to maintain the stone&rsquo;s natural appearance when applied.</p>
<p>Designed with deep penetrating features, this sealer takes the lead as compared to water and oil-based sealers.
Though HMK produces a thick finish, this allows semi-permeable moisture penetration to prevent stone damage due to clogged water.
This sealer is tough on the floor but produces a safe surface for the preparation of foodstuffs.
To achieve a good finish, you will need to apply at least two coats on your surface, but it is also good to note that HMK does not produce a shiny finish.
It will take you about 2 to 4 hours for the surface to dry, but you will need approximately 48 hours to cure the surface. The surface is also protected against grease and oil stains, making it durable.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong penetrating effect</li>
<li>Semi-permeable to water</li>
<li>Resistant to oil and grease</li>
<li>It is durable</li>
<li>Safe for food preparation boards</li>
