<p>Many people swear by steaming or heat-treating

I tried this method twice and found that it failed for me because I did not have the time or patience to do it daily for two months. This review focuses on the chemical route with CrossFire, which has proven to be more effective with consistent application.</p>

<p>Bed bugs lay eggs daily in various hidden areas around your home. Even with thorough treatment, there will likely be areas you miss that will have hatching bugs. CrossFire is designed to keep working for long periods, ensuring that bed bugs are continually targeted even after the initial application.</p>
<h3 id="1-remove-clutter-">**1. Remove Clutter **</h3>
<p>The first step is to declutter your home. Get rid of clothes, shoes, books, and other items you can live without. Wash and dry everything on
high heat
, then seal them in plastic bags. This step is crucial to prevent bed bugs from finding new hiding spots and to eliminate any that may be hiding in your belongings.</p>
<p>Another significant issue is identifying the source of the infestation. If you dont figure out where they are coming from, you may find yourself needing to treat your home indefinitely.</p>
<h3 id="2-mix-and-apply-crossfire-">**2. Mix and Apply CrossFire **</h3>
<p>To start, mix  the bottle of CrossFire with  gallon of water in a chemical sprayer. Spray every nook, cranny, baseboard, corner, and crevice in your home. You will need to repeat this process every 10-14 days for 8-12 weeks. It&rsquo;s essential to only mix what you need because once mixed, CrossFire needs to be used within 24 hours.</p>
<p>One quart of CrossFire goes a long way; I was able to treat my 1200 sq ft, three-bedroom apartment with just one quart. Alongside CrossFire, use Cimexa dust, a fine powder that should be lightly applied to outlet covers, light-switch covers, and other voids in your home. Be cautious not to apply too much; a light dusting is sufficient as bed bugs will avoid overly thick layers.</p>
<h3 id="3-launder-your-clothes-thoroughly-">**3. Launder Your Clothes Thoroughly **</h3>
<p>During the first 2-3 weeks, while you may still

, launder your bedclothes every three days and dry them on high heat. Keep your CrossFire spray handy in case you spot any bed bugs crawling around.</p>
<p>Vacuum your home daily, paying special attention to baseboards if you have carpeting. Immediately empty the vacuum, tie up the debris, and remove it from your home to ensure you kill even the

.</p>
<p>Clear out shelves in closets and books on bookcasesno boxes either, as bed bugs love hiding in cardboard. Everything you keep needs to be sealed or tied up in plastic or garbage bags. This leaves bed bugs nowhere to hide.</p>
<h3 id="4-treat-your-car-for-bed-bugs-">**4. Treat Your Car for Bed Bugs **</h3>
<p>Dont forget to treat your car. Bed bugs can hitchhike to your vehicle and eventually infest it. Treat your car with CrossFire every time you treat your home.</p>
<p>The cheapest place Ive found to buy CrossFire is from an online source where its priced at $30 with free shipping if you spend over $45. I suggest buying two bottles upfront, as it will take at least that much to treat every 14 days for 2-3 months, plus youll benefit from free shipping.

By following these stepsdecluttering, correctly mixing and applying CrossFire, laundering your clothes regularly, and not forgetting to treat your caryou can achieve a bedbug-free home.</p>
<p>Although the initial process may seem daunting, the results are well worth the effort. With the right approach and a bit of diligence, you can rid your home of these pests for good.</p>
