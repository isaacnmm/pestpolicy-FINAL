  <div class="post-content"><p>To fix clogged drains,
snakes/)
(also known as augers or plumber&rsquo;s snakes) are a useful and budget-friendly tool.
So, quit experimenting with acidic cleaners, plungers, or coat hangers. So, what&rsquo;s the best drain snake?
If you need a quick answer, I approve of the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NB0729G/?tag=p-policy-20">FlexiSnake</a>
drain snake, especially for hair-clog removal. It has grabbers and small hooks that&rsquo;ll attach to the hair as the auger rotates even around the p-trap.</p>

R-25SM is a small-sized snake that&rsquo;ll break up minor clogs in the bathroom or kitchen sink. So, don&rsquo;t hire a plumber so fast - pick this tool and you&rsquo;ll be done in under 10 minutes.
On design, R-25SM is designed from steel (rust-resistant), has rubber bumpers, and telescoping capability, and a durable 48-inches spring.
R-25SM is excellent for unblocking sinks &amp; urinals. The spring is flexible but equally tough to maneuver tight bends. Further, with the powerful telescope, you&rsquo;ll quickly see down the drains.
The snake&rsquo;s drum is designed from stamped steel - which makes the tool highly durable. Homeowners find this snake to be very budget-friendly but also effective in unblocking clogs.
R-25SM has a 25 feet cable that comes with a crank and suitable grips. With these additions (including the knob and grip handle), it&rsquo;ll be so easy to handle the snake using hand gloves.

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B00K6NEC78&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
RIDGID 46683 is insignificant, but its great for unclogging the difficult toilet blockages. In fact, this is the tool that plumbers dont want you to know  I discovered it the hard way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, this RIDGID 46683 will tear down those clogs &amp; blockages without damaging toilet porcelain and pipes.</li>
<li>Thus, readily prevent toilet backup for cheap and with minimal damages.
Being an electric drain snake, this RIDGID 46683 will make 500 rotations per minute and easily break down those tough clogs quickly.
It has a great ergonomic build for less effort in manual mode. But with a power drill, you can get that great boost. Its c cutter head will tear down the tough clogs by rotating in 2 directions.
Despite being sturdy and durable, RIDGID 46683 is equally lightweight and won&rsquo;t break or bend easily. Thus, try this tool on the heavy-duty blockages in your
shower drains
and urinals.
Its drum auger comes with dual power &amp; an aggressive end allowing the tool to dislodge drain clogs. The telescoping capability allows one to view the blockage sitting deep down the drain.

The Good:</li>
<li>Has a cutter head (c type) thatll tear down the clogs while running in both directions.</li>

<h2 id="heading-2"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019NH0E8S/?tag=p-policy-20">**9. Ryobi P4001 One Plus 18V Drain - 25 ft Snake **<strong>Auger</strong></a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#heading-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B019NH0E8S&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
The 25-foot Ryobi-P4001 is great for unclogging bathtubs, toilets, and sinks. You can unclog  to 2 (width) pipes. The cable wont work kinker since it is highly reinforced.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the reverse and forward power, the snake is effective and easy to use in tearing down clogs.</li>
<li>I note that this snake is an excellent addition to the cordless power tools.
It has cable clamps to hold the snake cable tightly when breaking the difficult clogs. Ryobi-P4001 has a charger or battery and drain port (at the back) thatll hinder water build-up in your drum.
The lock (auto-feed) engages the snakes bearings to avoid pommel squeezing  which reduces your fatigue. Further, for comfort and great grip, Ryobi-P4001 has some GRIP ZONE over-mold.
The tool has an 18 V battery that&rsquo;s interchangeable with any similar battery from Ryobi. It&rsquo;ll even reach speeds of up to 600 RPM, making it a favorite of many plumbers.
The Good:</li>
<li>Its cable is reinforced� (25 feet) - which helps hinder kinking.</li>
<li>Allow both reverse &amp; forward feeding - a system that&rsquo;ll help prevent homeowner fatigue.</li>
<li>Its GRIP ZONE over-mold is effective and thus allows a great snake grip. You won&rsquo;t require professional gloves.</li>
<li>Has an excellent�auto-lock mechanism
The Bad:</li>

<h2 id="buyers-guide---best-drain-snake"><strong>Buyers Guide - Best Drain Snake�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#buyers-guide---best-drain-snake">¶</a></h2>
<p>When shopping for a drain snake, it is common for many customers to become overwhelmed by the many varieties that the market has to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is worth noting that price does not always go with quality. So, be keen not to be fooled by shopkeepers who present the pricey products as the best in quality and performance.</li>
<li>Also, different customers may be interested in different features of a product.
So what you see as the qualifying factor in a product may not be the qualifying factor for another customer. Thus, I find it important to share some of the most important factors to consider when buying a drain snake.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considerationswhen-buying-a-drain-snake">Considerations**�when buying a drain snake**<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#considerationswhen-buying-a-drain-snake">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Cable Length</strong>
Drain cleaners come with varying cable lengths. So, depending on the span of your clogs, the ideal cable should be able to reach them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, your cable length will be determined by theplace you livein. Typically, people who live in a single storied house will require a drain unit with a least 25 ft cable, such as Ridgid 41408.
A 25 ft cable will not be the ideal cable for cleaning a bathroom drain on the second floor. You need a unit with at least 25 ft cable length.
<strong>2. Diameter</strong>
A drain snake should slide freely through the drain piping to reach the clogs. That means the diameter of the cable should always be smaller than that of the drain piping.
Experts usually recommend a difference of at least  to 1 between the snake diameter and the pipe diameter.�If you dont know the pipe diameter, go for a small diameter.
<strong>3. Auger Mechanism</strong>
Every snake needs a means of spinning the cable through the drain. Turning of the cable is what makes it possible to negotiate curves and penetrate clogs.
Avoid units that lack an auger mechanism. The auger mechanism you opt for should be reliable. Otherwise, you might spend a lot of time unclogging your drain or even retrieving the cable from the drain.
<strong>4. Head Type</strong>
Drain cleaners come with either fixed or interchangeable heads. If you opt for a snake with a fixed head, choose one that will tackle your most frequent clogs.
In the case of interchangeable heads, choose those that are easy to change. Below are the most common types of head types used for drain snakes.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Screw head</strong>: Also known as coil head, this type of head allows you to pull the blockage. This is a powerful head for removing blockages such as paper towels and other related products.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting head</strong>: A cutting head is the most preferred head for blockages that require cutting. Most professional plumbers prefer this type of cable head.</li>
<li>**Fixed Head:**This type of head is fixed on the cable and cannot be changed.</li>
<li><strong>Interchangeable Head</strong>: When a drain snake comes with an interchangeable head, it provides you with a way of leveraging different heads to cater to different types of clogs. The good thing is that they are easy to change and do not require special tools to change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-drain-snakes"><strong>How to use the Drain Snakes�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-use-the-drain-snakes">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
We&rsquo;ll take the plumber&rsquo;s snake. Next, I&rsquo;ve loosened the thumbscrew, as this will allow me to pull out the snake.
<strong>2.</strong>
Next, we&rsquo;ll pull out the snake and start pushing it into the drainpipe that&rsquo;s clogged. Continue with this process until you meet so relatively high resistance. This resistance means that you&rsquo;ve reached the drain blockage or a bend in the pipe. Check
flea foggers
.
<strong>3.</strong>
But you need to be about 6 inches from the pipe opening. Once I meet some resistance, I&rsquo;ll tighten up the thumbscrew. Now, I&rsquo;ll spin the auger bit, and it&rsquo;ll drill through the blockage. To do this, I&rsquo;ll hold the handle while pushing forward.
<strong>4.</strong>
Now, hold at the end and loosen the nut, pull out the drain snake more, tighten the nut again and repeat the process to drill through more of the drain blockage.
<strong>5.</strong>
When you feel that you&rsquo;ve drilled through most of the blockage, loosen the thumb screen and pull back the drain snake.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to drain clogs of all types, a drain snake would be an ideal solution rather than paying for a plumber&rsquo;s services be.
And although there are various drain snakes out there, not all of them are suitable for your type of drain clog.
So, it is recommended that you access your kind of drain clog to determine the suitable drain snake for you.
Always go for a drain snake that fits into your drain pipes. Oversize drain snakes will not do a good job or, even worse, will end up damaging your pipes.</p>
