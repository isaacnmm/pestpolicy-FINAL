<h3 id="3-pets-and-children-can-get-stuck">3. Pets and children can get stuck</h3>
<p>Sometimes pets and small children can get stuck to the trap causing injuries to them. Once they are trapped, it will take your time and energy trying to remove them unhurt; the following procedure will be needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take some cooking oil.</li>
<li>Pour the oil on the glue trap at the points where the animal is held.</li>
<li>Then massage the animals skin to work the oil into glue. This may take some few minutes to work.</li>
<li>Once its free from the trap, take some soap and water to clean it the oil.</li>
<li>For a child skin, carefully pull out the trap from the skin surface.</li>
<li>Apply some cooking oil on the affected place and dab the glue remains.</li>
<li>Allow the oil to stay for some few minutes. Using a dry cloth, rub the skin to remove the softened glue.</li>

<ul>
<li>Dust and moisture reduces the efficiency of the trap in these ways;</li>
<li>The dust will cover the glue on the trap board hence the glue will be dry and muddy; it will not be able to hold the animal targeted tightly.</li>
<li>The moisture will make the glue unstuck therefore it cannot hold any animal that comes into contact with it.</li>
</ul>
