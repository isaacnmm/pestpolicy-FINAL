<h3 id="g-contact-a-professional-plumber-to-inspect">g.����� Contact a professional plumber to inspect</h3>
<p>A professional plumber will do great work in cleaning out the clogged drain, especially if you go for a long-serving expert with a track record in a similar task. A plumber also saves you money and time.</p>
<h2 id="what-causes-sink-clogs">What causes sink clogs?</h2>
<p>A sink drain clog can be caused by either of the following:</p>
<h3 id="1hair">1.�Hair</h3>
<p>Hair is stuck along the sink drain lining, especially when there is a soapy mixture. Shaving and making your hair in your bathroom is paramount. Additionally, some strands of hair actually shed unnoticeably for instance when you wash your face.</p>
<h3 id="2-grease">2. Grease</h3>
<p>Over time, with a gradual accumulation of oil and grease on the inner surfaces, your bathroom sink drain may clog or get totally plugged up.</p>
<h3 id="3-toiletry-debris">3. Toiletry debris</h3>
<p>Slow drainage may occur when cotton swabs, paper towels, and other debris from toiletries get trapped in the sink drain.</p>
<h3 id="4-soap-scum">4. Soap scum</h3>
<p>Whenever you bathe with liquid bath soaps, suds are created. Suds have a tendency of sticking on drain pipes, thus clogging them with time.</p>
<h3 id="5-obstructed-sewer-line">5. Obstructed sewer line</h3>
<p>Blocked sewer line, impends smooth flow of sink waste. Stagnation of such debris causes internal drain clogging. In case you encounter a similar problem, contact your area sewer line, or maintenance team.</p>
<h3 id="6damaged-pipes">6.�Damaged pipes</h3>
<p>Slow drainage or clogging on your bathroom sink drain may result from the broken, faulty, or damaged pipe  a broken section traps debris in the sink waste leading to clogging. Contact a plumber to have it fixed immediately.</p>
<h2 id="when-should-you-call-a-plumber">When Should you Call a Plumber?</h2>
<p>Cleaning the showerhead could help fix your low water pressure head at times.
However, the use of DIY methods such as vinegar and baking powder, hot water, or plunger may fail to attain quality results in some cases.
So, its advisable to call a plumber if you encounter instances highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="i-a-rapid-burst-pipe-leak">i. A rapid burst pipe leak</h3>
<p>A pipe or your water line may suffer a major burst causing gallons of water to flood all over your house. Though uncommon, this occasionally happens and when it does, calling a plumber is imminent.
Not only that, but you also have to act promptly to temporarily stop the rapid leak before the plumber gets there.
Locate the intermediary cut-off valves closest to the leak and stop the supply of water to the leaking line. If you cant find any of the cut-off valves, then find and turn off the main water shut-off valve  this will cut-off water supply to the entire house until a plumber rectifies the leak.</p>
<h3 id="ii-no-water-supply-in-the-house">ii. No water supply in the house</h3>
<p>In most cases of this problem, water stops flowing in one or several of the sub-water-lines in your house, for example, bathroom sink, kitchen, or shower.
In very rare cases will you find a total stoppage of water supply to your house  especially if you own an online water backup supply.
It is recommendable to first inspect the affected water outlets and their subsections (those that are not receiving water). For instance, due to a faulty water heater, hot water may not be delivered to your shower outlet despite the cold water supply being fully operational.
Moreover, it is possible that the water supply has stopped because of a massive leak in the sunken pipe feeding your house water line from the street-side water meter.</p>
<h3 id="iii-when-you-have-a-leak-in-the-drainage-line-leak">iii. When you have a leak in the drainage line leak</h3>
<p>Leaking kitchen and bathroom leaks are a common thing for homeowners  its caused by excess internal pressure or pipe breakage.
The leaking sink trap should be replaced  ensure the water supply is turned off first. For leaking lines that you cant be accessed easily or those that are sealed by walls and flooring, you should immediately call a plumber to have them dealt with. This act ensures that your dry walls, paint, and subfloor do not suffer further damage.</p>
<h3 id="iv-gaseous-odors-and-filling-sinks-or-bathtubs">iv. Gaseous odors and filling sinks or bathtubs</h3>
<p>Once you detect a fault with your sewer line, it is recommendable to contact a plumber to undertake the inspection.
The foul stench manifests in form of an odorous smell that fills up your home if not attended to immediately. A similar case occurs in the case where your kitchen/bathroom sinks,
bathtub
, or toilet gets filled with wastewater.</p>
<h2 id="5-major-signs-that-your-slab-is-leaking">5 major Signs that your slab is leaking</h2>
<p>Either of the following can detect slab leaks:</p>
<h3 id="1-when-you-detect-mold-smell">1) When you detect mold smell</h3>
<p>When you notice mold growing on your home foundation, walls, floorboards, or somewhere along an embedded water line, then it is likely that you have a slab leak and that mold is growing from the moisture released. The presence of mold is also accompanied by a musty smell.</p>
<h3 id="2-sound-of-running-water-when-appliances-are-not-in-use">2) Sound of running water when appliances are not in use</h3>
<p>You will notice (hear/see wet areas) water flow or moisture section when none of the appliances or water outlets is in use.
In such as case, the best decision to take is to first turn off the main water supply (for your house) and call a plumber to fix the problem.</p>
<h3 id="3-sunken-floorboards-and-tiles">3) Sunken floorboards and tiles</h3>
<p>When water seeps into floorboards and tiles, they get destabilized causing them to sink in or bulk. Actually, this is a warning sign resulting from leakage - you should call your plumber right away.
Tackling this problem early enough reduces losses due to house foundation damage, which could be quite expensive.</p>
<h3 id="4-dampened-carpets">4) Dampened carpets</h3>
<p>A damp carpet is caused by water, which could be from a leakage somewhere.
To ascertain to troubleshoot the problem, peel back the carpet and check for any wetness on the padding and floorboards. Once you are sure of the leakage, contact a plumber.</p>
<h3 id="5-abnormally-higher-water-bills-but-same-usage">5)����� Abnormally higher water bills, but same usage</h3>
<p>When your water bills are strangely higher than average yet your water usage routine is unchanged, then there might be a leak somewhere in your houses water line.
First, get a technician from your local water company to check for any leaks  once ascertained, then you should go right ahead to call a plumber to correct the leak.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on how to unclog a bathroom sink drain, you can simply use a Zip-It tool, hot water, or hot water.
If the fault is pretty serious; then, go for a plunger or use a vinegar-baking powder solution to attain total removal of clogs, dirt, and residuals in your sink drain.
If the clogging persists even after trying highlighted solutions; then, you may have to contact a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/xionlab-safer-drain-opener-review/">professional plumber</a>
since this may suggest blockage or some other problem with the sewer line. Remember to wear protective gear for your personal safety.</p>

      <title>Sink Not Draining but Pipes Clear</title>

      <description>In this post, I outline how I cleared my sink drain blockage that had persisted even with clear pipes.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I outline how I cleared my sink drain blockage that had persisted even with clear pipes.
<strong>But first, I narrate my sad story.�</strong>
<em>I was almost going insane due to the bathroom sink that had blocked for about a week. My kids and I had already started using a basin to take our shower. ????</em></p>
<ul>
<li>*By this time, I had called my plumber numerous times, but he was not available as it was Christmas times. My plumbing snake, drain cleaners, and hot water, the wet-dry vacuum cleaner was not working. *</li>
<li><em>I had disconnected the u-bend under the sink and tried using a wire coat hanger to clear any drain clog, all with no success.�</em>
**Summary: Assuming that the waste line sits at a small decline, youll need to solve a possible airflow issue�for your vent stack. This will keep neutral air pressure (prevent negative or positive pressure). **
<strong>Thus, wastewater will flow down the drain with the help of gravity. You should know that the toilet waste line and the sink waste lines are connected at their vent stack.�</strong>

</ul>
<h2 id="sink-not-draining-but-pipes-clear">Sink Not Draining But Pipes Clear</h2>
<p>My issue was that maybe I had a more significant problem because, in the previous three months, I had just miraculously
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">unclogged�my stubborn bathtub that had standing water</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-vent-stack-where-is-it-and-how-can-i-checkfix-it">What is vent stack? Where is it, and how can I check/fix it?</h3>
<p>Vent stack blocked? The gurgling sound usually means it is starving for air. Without venting, the flush operation would act as a vacuum and would not properly flush.
The vent stack is usually hidden behind the wall. It is a vertical pipe to which all the <a href="/posts/how-to-unclog-a-bathroom-sink-drain/">drains</a> along with that line tie into. Check the toilet too to make sure there is no partial blockage. Does the sink do anything funny also?
<strong>Check if the vent stack opening up on the roof?�</strong>
Maybe yes? It is a black pipe that extends past the roof and is open at the top allowing rain to enter. So perhaps some rain froze on the lip and is restricting the opening of the pipe.
I have the same problem since installing new efficient flush toilets. If a vacuum created could cause p-traps to dry out or the toilet bowl level to drop when not in use? ( no leaks).
Raps should NEVER be dry!! Sewer gases can enter your home. In general, if there is a vacuum in the line, it can suck the water out of your traps and drop the toilet water level.
