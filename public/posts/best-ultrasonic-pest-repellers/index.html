<p>When you browse through the internet, youll find myriads of ultrasonic pest repellers. Although, all of them utilize the ultrasonic sound technology, they have varying degrees of effectiveness. So, before you make a decision to purchase one, here are a few factors to consider.
<strong>1. Application Frequency</strong>
Pests have sensitive ears that make it possible to hear sounds of very high frequencies. However, some pests may not hear some sounds of certain frequencies. So, you should choose your device depending on the type of pests you have. Normally, the frequency range for most of the household pests is between 60 kHz to 80 kHz.
<strong>2. Area covered</strong>
A device that covers a larger area allows you to repel more pests with little costs. Most of the devices cover between 1000 and 2000 square feet. However, some like the Cleanrth CR008 cover up to 7000 square feet.�Therefore, you should choose your device depending on the area you want to cover.
<strong>3. Repeller Cost</strong>
Ultrasonic pest repellents come with varying costs depending on their quality and brand. Usually, prices range from 10$ to 100$. Cheaper devices cover small areas and will require replacement after a short duration.
Those that cover large areas and last longer come with a higher price tag. Some products come with packs of 2 to 5 items. Buying in packs helps you save on cost than when you buy single products. Further, consider the running costs of the repellent - which brings us to

.
Some products also come with premium features making them cost higher than ordinary devices. The most common inclusion is the nightlight, which adds some light in places where they are plugged in.
**4. Durability and **
<strong>Safety</strong>
A device that works effectively and last longer will keep your house free from pests for a long time. Thus, you wont regularly spend on pest eradication tasks.
Although ultrasonic pest repellers are free from chemicals, they produce high-frequency sounds that may disturb your pets. So, ensure your repellers have been verified to be safe for pets such as dogs, cats, hamsters, among others - what about

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ultrasonic pest repellers provide a convenient and effective method for ejecting pests from your home. They are affordable, safe, and require little or no intervention for them to work. However, they wont provide a permanent solution to your pest infestation.
If youre dealing with a severe infestation or want a permanent solution, you can use UPRs alongside other pest remedies such as pesticides.</p>
