<h3 id="1-tomcat-mole-trap-hands-free-effective-and-innovative">[1. Tomcat Mole <a href="/posts/best-fly-trap/">Trap</a>: hands-free, effective, and Innovative](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043FHXVM/?tag=p-policy-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043FHXVM/?tag=p-policy-20</a>)</h3>
<p>Tomcat is an out-of-the-ordinary mole trap with notable features that make it one of the most popular brands in the market today.</p>
<p>The most selling attribute inherent in this device is the hands-free setup option. It only requires you to step on the yellow lever to set up the device. Plus, once a mole is caught, you don&rsquo;t have to use your hands to release it.
To set the device, locate an active tunnel and press with your heel or hand to make a depression (about one inch deep). There&rsquo;s a depth gauge on the backside of the trap for checking the correct depth. Using a shovel, make two long slots where the jaws can fit and open up freely.
Place the trap on the slots and step down slowly. Press the trigger post down until the trap locks, then release the pedal. I usually recommend using a stick to press the trigger.
The trap is under tension, and the pedal could hit your hand if he traps don&rsquo;t lock when releasing the pedal.
Your trap is now ready for a catch! You will know that a mole has been trapped when the yellow lever springs up.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hands-free operation</li>
<li>No additional setting tools or tongs are required.</li>
<li>Safe and easy to use</li>
<li>Simple to set</li>
<li>Excellent design</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a plastic construction which could break</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy set mole trap created with top-notch craftsmanship to give you an easy and reliable mole trapping experience. With this device, you&rsquo;ll no longer have to use chemicals and poison to eradicate moles.</p>
<p>Setting up this trap is very easy. Unlike other traps, this one requires no digging or setting up sharp prongs that could sometimes be dangerous to the user, children, and pets.
To set up the trap, locate an active mole tunnel and insert the closed jaws in the tunnel, with the base of the trap flushing with the ground.
Once you press down on the lever, the trap is now ready for the catch! Usually, moles have an instinct to reopen their tunnels whenever they collapse.
A will mole travels through the tunnel to find a blind end at the collapsed portion of the tunnel. When it pushes through the tunnel, the trigger is released, clamping the pest between the jaws.
What&rsquo;s more, this is a safe, effective, and environmentally friendly way to eradicate moles. It&rsquo;s ideal for use in nurseries, ranches, and organic farms.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective mole trap</li>
<li>Durable galvanized metal</li>
<li>Easy to set: no digging required</li>
</ul>

<p>It is designed for use along the tunnels used by moles with the trigger pan blocking part of the tunnel. Usually, moles have an instinct to reopen their tunnels whenever they are blocked. When a mole tries to reopen the tunnel, the trigger is pushed, releasing the trap.

Besides, the device is reasonably easy to use. Once you have identified an active tunnel, push down the grass with your hands or heel. Push down the trap until the spears touch the bottom.
Activate the spring by pulling up the handle spring and holding it in place using the small lever. The flat piece is placed on the ground, just enough to keep the trigger arm.
That way, a slight push by the mole releases the trigger, and the plunger pushes down the metal spears. There is a safety pin to ensure you are safe from accidental triggers.

<p>Anyone buying a mole trap will go for one that is simple to use. A good mole trap is easy to set up and simple to use. It does not require you to assemble parts as you relocate the trap from one tunnel to another.
On the other hand, complicated traps waste a lot of your time because of the settings involved.�Also
, the device should also be easy to clean. Not only does cleaning prolong the device&rsquo;s lifespan, but also because moles tend to avoid dirty traps.</p>
<h3 id="2-efficiency"><strong>2. Efficiency</strong></h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to waste your time and money on a trap that misses the target now and then. Always go for a dependable trap to avoid frustrations. Remember that the effectiveness of certain traps may depend on the type of soil they are used in.
Some traps tend to work effectively on certain types of soil. Therefore it is always advisable to know the type traps used by people around.</p>
<h3 id="3-trapping-method"><strong>3. Trapping method</strong></h3>
<p>Normally, different people will buy mole traps depending on the trapping mechanism. Some gardeners prefer to use exposed traps because these traps are easy to clean with pressurized water. Others opt to buy traps that will hide the mole insight.
While some gardeners prefer traps that kill moles, others wouldn&rsquo;t even come close to a dead mole. If you prefer traps that kill moles, be sure to check your trap regularly to avoid bad smell that comes from overstayed carcasses.
Once you have identified the type of trapping device, read the instructional manuals to help you set up the tools properly. Plus, you can take time to learn the basics of the device.</p>
<h3 id="4-safety"><strong>4. Safety</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the devices I have discussed are spring-loaded and bare sharp clasping jaws/edges. Thus, safety is of great importance when using them to kill moles. A good trap will kill moles without inflicting injuries to you, your kids, guests, and pets.
Most of these traps come with safety pins/clips to protect you from accidental triggers. Learn the mechanism of the traps to know how the safety clips work. Also, beware of the exposed pointed corners of the trap.</p>
