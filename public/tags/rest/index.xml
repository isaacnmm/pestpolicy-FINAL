go into non-action up-to 6 months without a meal (by reducing energy use). But the spider will spring into action when a prey appears.</p>
<p><strong>But do spiders sleep? Spiders don&rsquo;t sleep like humans but have circadian rhythms - rest &amp; activity cycles. Spiders lack eyelids and don&rsquo;t close their eyes like humans.�</strong>
<strong>During the resting phase, spiders conserve energy during the day and cold areas by lowering the metabolic rate and cutting their activity - how spiders hibernate during winter. But spiders are more highly active at night so as to avoid predators such as birds at day time.�</strong></p>

will be active mainly at night. In addition, these arachnids will hibernate during the cold season.
Do spiders sleep?�To a curious mind, it would make sense that a creature with 8 eyes would need to sleep from time to time. However, do spiders sleep? The answer to this is fascinating and shrouded in mystery as demonstrated below
The fact that spiders do not have eyelids suggests that spiders rest, just not in the way we do but in their own unique way. Spiders have daily cycles of rest and activity. They cant shut their eyelids but their body reduces activity levels and lowers their metabolic rate to conserve energy.</p>
<h2 id="science-behind-sleep-hibernation-in-spiders">Science behind Sleep (Hibernation) in Spiders</h2>
<p>There is scanty research on the science behind animal sleep. However, studies suggest that animals have a cardiac rhythm which is determined by the time of day. Animals are either nocturnal (active at night) or diurnal (active during day time).
During their inactive phase, the creatures tend to burrow and experience a drop in their metabolic activity rate. During cold seasons, spiders curl their legs and reduce their metabolic rate even as they stay huddled together in cocoons during the coldest months of the year.</p>
<h2 id="do-spiders-crawl-in-mouth-while-sleeping">Do Spiders Crawl in Mouth While Sleeping?</h2>
<p>The fact that spiders are capable of such hibernation means that they can do so in short bursts on a day to day basis to give the impression of sleep. As the spider encounters a period of low food availability and harsh climatic conditions, they enter hibernation mode to conserve energy.
When the spiders are resting,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-brains/">their brains</a>
will be working round the clock. For example, they&rsquo;ll feel even the smallest vibration with their great tactile sense. In addition, they&rsquo;ll react in case of danger of when one of their prey gets stuck on their web.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-species---differences-in-sleeping">Spiders Species - Differences in sleeping?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s brain is a little different from the human brain. Therefore, the arachnids won&rsquo;t get bored in their &ldquo;rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; mode. But some spiders may take naps at night.
But hunting spiders posses more powerful eyesight compared to those that build webs. for example, wolf spiders will attack and chase their prey.
Crab spiders will just sit around waiting to ambush their prey on the leaf and flower.�In addition, jumping spiders will use their great
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-ears/">hearing capability</a>
, intelligent and eyesight.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-of-the-arachnids">Lifestyle of the Arachnids</h2>
<p>Different spiders will &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; in their webs but some won&rsquo;t require the web traps against their prey. For example, the trapdoors build their tunnels and install doors (with hinges).
There are over 1000 spider species globally. For example, jumping spiders are computed to be about 5000 - which is roughly 13 % of all species of spiders.
The Salticidae family - particularly jumping spiders don&rsquo;t also create spider webs but will spin tether ropes if they&rsquo;re jumping. So, spiders will be quite at rest waiting for a suitable prey or while conserving energy.</p>
<h2 id="arachnidssnoring-andbody-language">Arachnids&rsquo;�Snoring and�Body Language</h2>
<p>In hibernation mode, the arachnids will lower their metabolic rates while also tucking in their legs. Therefore, the spiders will live longer with no food as they won&rsquo;t be burning calories - particularly at night and during the cold weather.
However, whenever you see a spider that has taken an odd position such as legs tucked plus lying on its back - it could be dead.�What about snoring in spiders? Well, spiders won&rsquo;t snore like human beings.
In fact, these insect will be hiding in wall crack among other protected areas. Further, for survival these arachnids will sleep, nest, and hunt out of predator&rsquo;s harm.

<h2 id="maybe-the-spiders-did-pass-out">Maybe the Spiders did Pass Out?</h2>
<p>Some factors like cold temperatures or circadian rhythms may make the spiders such as Agelenopsis aperta may pass out or remain unconscious - you might in fact think that the insects is dead.
In addition, some drugs like marijuana, caffeine, or chloral hydrate may make the spiders to pass out or it&rsquo;ll negatively affect the insect&rsquo;s web-making capability.</p>
