<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-car-wash-soap"><strong>How to Choose the Best Car Wash Soap</strong></h2>
<p>Cleaning is part of car maintenance in addition to other routines like changing oil, replacing filters, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>But in order to get the best car cleaning results, you need to have the right kind of car wash soap.</li>
<li>Dish soaps are not recommended for a car wash because they tend to strip off the wax finish and paint on your car.
Below, Ive provided you with a guide for choosing the best car wash soap.
<strong>Foaming</strong>
Plenty of suds or foams help in lifting dirt to separate it from the car surface. It also lubricates the dirt and surface, making it possible to flow away from the rinsing surface.</li>
<li>This is an important consideration because it reduces or eliminates the need for scrubbing, which may leave your paint surface with scratches.
However, some stains like bird droppings tend to stick on the surfaces and may not be removed without scrubbing.
<strong>PH Level</strong>
The sealants and paint finish on your car cannot withstand
<a href="https://www.lenosgarage.com/blogs/auto-detailing/4-things-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-car-wash-soap">high PH levels</a>
.</li>
<li>High PH soap solutions tend to strip the layer of paint and wax finish making your car lose its original shiny appearance.</li>
<li>Luckily, therere products with a balanced or neutral PH that will not strip the finish coat in your car.
The high PH in most dish soaps makes them unsuitable for cleaning cars.
They are associated with stripping the protective coat and decreasing the durability of the paint.
Also, your skin might be affected by high PH in some car soaps. Therefore, its advisable to get a product with a balanced or neutral PH.
<strong>Finish</strong>
You want your car to retain its original shiny appearance or even become better.</li>
<li>Some car wash soaps are formulated with ingredients that enhance the paint finish after washing.</li>
<li>Shun any product that will make your car look dull than before.
Apart from cleaning, a good product should also leave the paint finish on your car free from streaks or water spots.
<strong>Value For Money</strong>
This will be determined by the concentration rather than the quantity of the product.</li>
<li>The higher the concentration, the little the amount you need per wash.
Thus, a highly concentrated car wash soap will give you several washes before buying another one.
<strong>Safety</strong>
Your product of choice should not contain harsh ingredients that might affect you or damage your car&rsquo;s paint.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-use-a-plunger/">Follow how to use a plunger</a>
.�Also, an environmentally friendly product will go a long way to protect the surrounding environment from pollution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Not all soaps or shampoos are good for cleaning cars. Some of them will leave your car with a dull appearance and expose the paint finish to corrosion.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the best car wash soap will give your car a brilliant and lasting surface finish.</li>
<li>Any one of the above products is designed for cleaning cars, and it wont interfere with the paint finish or wax coating.
Get yourself a quality product with a big reputation and a long history of good performance.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, keeping your home spotless should be effortless and efficient. Cordless stick vacuums are revolutionizing how we clean, offering unparalleled freedom and flexibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine gliding effortlessly from room to room, up the stairs, and even outdoors without being tethered by cumbersome cords.
But with so many options available, how do you choose the <a href="/posts/best-cordless-cultivators-for-a-small-garden/">best</a> one for your needs? Our guide to the 5 best cordless stick vacuums will help you find the perfect match for your lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-best-cordless-stick-vacuums">5 Best Cordless Stick Vacuums</h2>
<h3 id="1-dyson-v15-detect"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CDN7F736?ie=UTF8&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_source=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtings.com%2Fvacuum%2Freviews%2Fbest%2Fcordless-stick&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=dab7fe8bf175f3fdbaa884342712975e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">1. Dyson V15 Detect</a></h3>
<p>Dyson V15 Detect is my top stick vacuum - I love its excellent suction to remove most dirt particles and human and pet hair (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-vacuuming-kill-flea-larvae/">and kill fleas</a>
) on my bare floor, hardwood, carpets, or sofa - thanks to the many attachments.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The battery offers 70 minutes of continuous vacuuming</li>
<li>Uses a laser to illuminate or sense surfaces, particles, and dust
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Challenging to push on hard rugs
However, it is inadvisable to keep the vacuum constantly on the stand since this tends to shorten the battery life - and these batteries are pricey. Dyson V15 Detect is suitable for vacuuming bare floors and high or low-pile carpets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dyson V15 Detect has a digital display that shows the particle count or size, predicted run time, and charging status. It&rsquo;s interesting that you can see the level of the trash in the collection bin, which you can empty easily.</p>
<p>It also has an ergonomic design so you can easily vacuum the stairs without power cords that could trip you over. It won&rsquo;t hurt your back, and you&rsquo;ll experience less fatigue compared to an upright vacuum that&rsquo;s super heavy.
<strong>Key Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Surfaces:**Hard Floors, floors, all floors</li>
<li>**Weight:**3.08 Kgs</li>
<li>**Run time:**60 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-shark-stratos-cordless-vacuum"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B5JMNGNQ?ie=UTF8&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_source=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtings.com%2Fvacuum%2Freviews%2Fbest%2Fcordless-stick&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=614792e30c0fc51053a9a7efc2fd7e0a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">2. Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum</a></h3>
<p>A unique feature of the Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum is its automatically controllable suction. The Clean Sense IQ function will adjust the suction power based on the sensor report (amount of debris) on the surface.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impressive battery performance - 50+ minutes cleaning time</li>
<li>Great suction for dirt and debris</li>
<li>Brushroll is self-cleaning
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Longer charging time ~ 4 hours</li>
<li>Not suitable for thick carpeting
Its MultiFlex wand arm allows the user to reach around surfaces (like under chairs or tables) easily as it is hinged at the center. It&rsquo;s quite ergonomic, so you won&rsquo;t have to lean over or bend over much. It&rsquo;s also handy but comes with fewer attachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the twin-roller floorhead is also large and thus might be challenging to clean tight spaces.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shark Stratos Cordless comes with a bigger dustbin, so you won&rsquo;t need to empty it regularly. It also emits perfume through a replaceable cartridge on the floorhead that will envelop any bad odor as you&rsquo;re cleaning.</p>
<p>However, despite its ability to clean for an hour continuously, you&rsquo;ll get a larger downtime compared to the Dyson since it takes about 4 hours to charge fully.
<strong>Key Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Surfaces:**Floors but not thick carpeting</li>
<li>**Weight:**4.03697 Kgs</li>
<li>**Run time:**50+ minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-tineco-pure-one-s11"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CDQ52TB?ie=UTF8&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_source=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtings.com%2Fvacuum%2Freviews%2Fbest%2Fcordless-stick&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=778b977427173293f65df0b2751168c3&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">3. Tineco PURE ONE S11</a></h3>
<p>Compared to Dyson, the Tineco PURE ONE S11 is notably lightweight (bagless too) so it can clean in tight spaces. It will easily clean pet hair, carpet, and hardwood. Some of the attachments are the dust brush, for upholstery, and one for crevices.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper option</li>
<li>Lightweight and thus easy to carry
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Shorter run time ~ 40+ minutes continuously</li>
<li>Smaller dustbin
You&rsquo;ll love that the vacuum head has LED lights to illuminate the surfaces or objects being cleaned, including tiny items
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-vacuum-for-dog-hair/">like dog hair</a>
. The machine has two filters that it also cleans automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s also digital equipment that comes with a phone app to let you know the status of the vacuum filter and the battery.</p>
<p>The function power is also automatically adjusted like with the Shark Stratos Cordless, so it&rsquo;ll generate larger suction when the head encounters an area with more debris. But its dustbin may blow debris and dust when you&rsquo;re emptying it.
<strong>Key Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Surfaces:**Carpet, furniture, Stairs</li>
<li>**Weight:**2.58548 Kgs</li>
<li>**Run time:**40+ minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-wyze-cordless-vacuum"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09J8V2CXF?ie=UTF8&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_source=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtings.com%2Fvacuum%2Freviews%2Fbest%2Fcordless-stick&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=e6e367c2a7cd02193030c8c3a66d1742&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">4. Wyze Cordless Vacuum</a></h3>
<p>Wyze Cordless Vacuum is good for couches and hard surfaces. It also has good power but is not suitable for carpet vacuuming due to the low clearance and relatively low suction.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to assemble</li>
<li>Intensive spot cleaning with 24,000 Pa Suction Power</li>
<li>Offers 50+ run time
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Poor build quality - plastic
An extra battery would be great to have if you&rsquo;re vacuuming a large house. But this one has fewer attachments and doesn&rsquo;t have the automatic suction power adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll love it for vacuuming tiles, hardwood floors, carpets, and pet hair. It has great performance in picking solid debris, thanks to the HEPA exhaust filter that removes fine particles such as pet dirt and dust.</p>
<p>On runtime, Wyze Cordless Vacuum will give you about 60+ minutes of cleaning before you recharge.
<strong>Key Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Surfaces:**Bare floor, Carpet, Carpet, and Upholstery</li>
<li>**Weight:**1.27006 Kgs</li>
<li>**Run time:**50+ minutes</li>

Dyson Omni-glide</a></h3>
<p>Dyson Omni-glide is designed for hard floors and excels in maneuverability. Its unique omnidirectional soft roller cleaner head allows it to glide in any direction, making it perfect for tight spaces and under furniture.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ultra-lightweight and easy to handle</li>

<h3 id="what-to-consider">What to Consider</h3>
<h4 id="i-battery-runtime-and-charging-time">i. Battery Runtime and Charging Time</h4>
<p>Longer runtime for your cordless stick vacuum will ensure you clean surfaces for an extended time without requiring frequent recharging. Also, check if your specific model has an interchangeable battery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have less downtime when cleaning if the vacuum machine requires less time charging - also you&rsquo;ll get power output that is consistent if the battery is Lithium-ion, and the battery will also last longer.</p>
<h4 id="ii-adjustable-suction-power">ii. Adjustable Suction Power</h4>
<p>Get a vacuum with adjustable suction power to ensure a more versatile cleaning. So, you&rsquo;ll easily adjust the suction power for various surfaces such as hard floors, or carpets.</p>
<p>Check if the cordless stick vacuum will suck different materials such as debris and fine dust particles possibly with multi-stage filtration.</p>
<h4 id="iii-maneuverability-and-weight">iii. Maneuverability and Weight</h4>
<p>Finally, consider the design and weight of the vacuum. This will affect how easily you can carry the machine to other rooms, including upstairs or downstairs.</p>
<p>If the vacuum is light, you&rsquo;ll easily undertake detailed or overhead cleaning. Check that the joints are flexible and also have swivel heads, which will allow easy cleaning of tight spaces and under furniture.</p>
<p>A lightweight design also speaks to inclusivity, ensuring that individuals of all ages and physical abilities can use the vacuum without strain. This consideration is crucial in creating universally designed products that cater to a diverse user base.</p>
<p>Also, the vacuum should have a large dustbin to cut down on how frequently you&rsquo;ll need to empty the machine during cleaning. This feature adds convenience but also highlights the importance of efficient waste management in household products.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>When shopping for a cordless stick vacuum, consider lightweight designs, budget, suction power and technology, battery life, and innovative technology to help clean different floor types.</p>
<p>This approach not only ensures a clean home but also reflects a thoughtful consideration of the broader implications of your choices, from environmental impact to inclusive design and cultural significance.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-dishwasher-detergent"><strong>How to choose the Best Dishwasher Detergent</strong></h2>
<p>Dishwashers come in different types and qualities. Therere powder detergents, gel detergents, and tablets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Youll get all these in your local market or online. However, not all of them will perform as they promise.
So, before choosing your ideal dishwasher detergent, here are a few important things to consider.
<strong>Powder</strong>
Perhaps, powder detergents are some of the oldest cleaning products in the market.</li>
<li>Theyre available in both small and bulk. Getting the bulk package will give you cost-effective cleaning.</li>
<li>The main setback with powder detergents is their tendency to absorb moisture.
Therefore, youll have to store them in watertight containers so that they retain their cleaning properties.
<strong>Gels</strong>
Gel detergents are cheaper and have the ability to dissolve easily, especially in hot water in your dishwasher.</li>
<li>They dissolve even at low temperatures and will not have harsh effects on your hands.
Theyre, however, not as effective as either powders or tablets.
<strong>Tablets</strong>
Also known as tabs, pics, or packets, these dishwasher detergents are premeasured for use as single-dose pieces. This gives you convenience when putting the detergent in your dishwasher.
The single-dose tabs contain a multi-action formulation that pre-treats, degreases, bleaches, and rinses your utensils.</li>
<li>They are effective in lifting and removing the mess from utensils.
However, their cost-per-load is higher than that of powders or gels. They also tend to disintegrate when handled with wet hands.
<strong>Composition</strong>
Some ingredients used in the manufacture of dishwashing detergents negatively affect your utensils and affect your skin.
Avoid products that contain chemicals such as phosphate.
<strong>No Residue</strong>
Residues left on utensils after dishwashing requires you to rerun the machine or clean them manually.</li>
<li>This is not only time-taking but also consumes more water and energy.
If your dishwasher has a drying cycle, your utensils will have to get wet once more.
<strong>Packaging</strong>
Go for packaging that gives you an easy time when putting or pouring the detergent into your dishwasher.</li>
<li>Tablet detergents provide the quickest way to add to your dishwasher.
Some like the Finish Quantum Max Powerball is unwrapped and pre-measured. That means you only have to throw the tablet into the dishwasher.
Most of the powder products come in plastic bags, which are cheaper and environmentally friendly. Thus, youll have to pour them into a convenient and reusable container.
Some gel detergents come with a dispenser to enable precise measuring.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>If you have been getting unsatisfactory results with your dishwashing, its time you tried a new dishwasher detergent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting an effective brand will get your utensils clean in the least time, money, and with less hustle.
Whether you prefer a tablet, gel, or powder detergent, the brands I have reviewed will work perfectly with your dishwasher.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="buyers-guide---best-drain-snake"><strong>Buyers Guide - Best Drain Snake�</strong></h2>
<p>When shopping for a drain snake, it is common for many customers to become overwhelmed by the many varieties that the market has to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is worth noting that price does not always go with quality. So, be keen not to be fooled by shopkeepers who present the pricey products as the best in quality and performance.</li>
<li>Also, different customers may be interested in different features of a product.
So what you see as the qualifying factor in a product may not be the qualifying factor for another customer. Thus, I find it important to share some of the most important factors to consider when buying a drain snake.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considerationswhen-buying-a-drain-snake">Considerations**�when buying a drain snake**</h2>
<p><strong>1. Cable Length</strong>
Drain cleaners come with varying cable lengths. So, depending on the span of your clogs, the ideal cable should be able to reach them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, your cable length will be determined by theplace you livein. Typically, people who live in a single storied house will require a drain unit with a least 25 ft cable, such as Ridgid 41408.
A 25 ft cable will not be the ideal cable for cleaning a bathroom drain on the second floor. You need a unit with at least 25 ft cable length.
<strong>2. Diameter</strong>
A drain snake should slide freely through the drain piping to reach the clogs. That means the diameter of the cable should always be smaller than that of the drain piping.
Experts usually recommend a difference of at least  to 1 between the snake diameter and the pipe diameter.�If you dont know the pipe diameter, go for a small diameter.
<strong>3. Auger Mechanism</strong>
Every snake needs a means of spinning the cable through the drain. Turning of the cable is what makes it possible to negotiate curves and penetrate clogs.
Avoid units that lack an auger mechanism. The auger mechanism you opt for should be reliable. Otherwise, you might spend a lot of time unclogging your drain or even retrieving the cable from the drain.
<strong>4. Head Type</strong>
Drain cleaners come with either fixed or interchangeable heads. If you opt for a snake with a fixed head, choose one that will tackle your most frequent clogs.
In the case of interchangeable heads, choose those that are easy to change. Below are the most common types of head types used for drain snakes.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Screw head</strong>: Also known as coil head, this type of head allows you to pull the blockage. This is a powerful head for removing blockages such as paper towels and other related products.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting head</strong>: A cutting head is the most preferred head for blockages that require cutting. Most professional plumbers prefer this type of cable head.</li>
<li>**Fixed Head:**This type of head is fixed on the cable and cannot be changed.</li>
<li><strong>Interchangeable Head</strong>: When a drain snake comes with an interchangeable head, it provides you with a way of leveraging different heads to cater to different types of clogs. The good thing is that they are easy to change and do not require special tools to change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-drain-snakes"><strong>How to use the Drain Snakes�</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
We&rsquo;ll take the plumber&rsquo;s snake. Next, I&rsquo;ve loosened the thumbscrew, as this will allow me to pull out the snake.
<strong>2.</strong>
Next, we&rsquo;ll pull out the snake and start pushing it into the drainpipe that&rsquo;s clogged. Continue with this process until you meet so relatively high resistance. This resistance means that you&rsquo;ve reached the drain blockage or a bend in the pipe. Check
flea foggers
.
<strong>3.</strong>
But you need to be about 6 inches from the pipe opening. Once I meet some resistance, I&rsquo;ll tighten up the thumbscrew. Now, I&rsquo;ll spin the auger bit, and it&rsquo;ll drill through the blockage. To do this, I&rsquo;ll hold the handle while pushing forward.
<strong>4.</strong>
Now, hold at the end and loosen the nut, pull out the drain snake more, tighten the nut again and repeat the process to drill through more of the drain blockage.
<strong>5.</strong>
When you feel that you&rsquo;ve drilled through most of the blockage, loosen the thumb screen and pull back the drain snake.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to drain clogs of all types, a drain snake would be an ideal solution rather than paying for a plumber&rsquo;s services be.
And although there are various drain snakes out there, not all of them are suitable for your type of drain clog.
So, it is recommended that you access your kind of drain clog to determine the suitable drain snake for you.
Always go for a drain snake that fits into your drain pipes. Oversize drain snakes will not do a good job or, even worse, will end up damaging your pipes.</p>

      <description>When choosing the</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the
<strong>best shower drain cleaner</strong>
, you can consider factors like effectiveness,
safety
, ease of use, and environmental impact. Selecting the right product will help prevent costly plumbing repairs and keep your <a href="/posts/how-drain-cleaners-work/">drains</a> flowing smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1effectiveness">1.<strong>Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0182VBOJE/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Green Gobbler</strong></a>
, are known for their powerful formulas that quickly break down hair, soap scum, and grease.
Effectiveness is key when choosing a cleaner, as it directly impacts how quickly and thoroughly the drain becomes unclogged. Look for products specifically designed to target your type of clog, whether its due to hair or grease build-up.</p>
<h3 id="2safety-for-pipes-and-septic-systems">2.<strong>Safety for Pipes and Septic Systems</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TS2R1A/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Drano Max Gel Clog Remover</strong></a>
, are formulated to be tough on clogs but gentle on pipes. Using harsh chemicals can damage your plumbing over time, so its important to choose a drain cleaner that is safe for all types of pipes, including PVC and metal.
For homes with septic systems, opt for septic-safe products to avoid disrupting the balance of bacteria essential for the systems function.</p>
<h3 id="3environmental-impact">3.<strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Environmentally friendly options, like
<strong>Biokleen Bac-Out Drain Care Gel</strong>
, offer effective cleaning power without harmful chemicals.
These products use natural enzymes or bacteria to break down organic material in the drain, which is better for the environment and safer for your home. If reducing your ecological footprint is a priority, check for biodegradable and non-toxic labels.</p>
<h3 id="4ease-of-use">4.<strong>Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Liquid-Plumr Pro-Strength Full Clog Destroyer</strong>
, are designed to be user-friendly, requiring no special tools or complicated instructions.
The ease of application can make a significant difference, especially if youre dealing with a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner/">stubborn clog</a>
and need a quick fix. Most gel formulas are easy to pour directly into the drain without any mess.</p>
<h3 id="5speed-of-action">5.<strong>Speed of Action</strong></h3>
<p>Some cleaners, such as
<strong>CLR Power Plumber</strong>
, work within minutes, while others might need to sit in the drain for a longer period to achieve full effectiveness. Fast-acting solutions are ideal for emergencies when you need to restore water flow quickly. However, slower-acting solutions can be more thorough and may prevent future clogs from building up again soon.</p>

<h2 id="considerations-for-the-best-toilet-paper-for-septic">Considerations for the Best Toilet Paper for Septic</h2>
<p><strong>1. Breaking Ability and Ease to Dissolve.</strong>
Ensure you select a toilet paper that can break rapidly into small pieces after use.</p>
<ul>
<li>This makes it easier to be carried by flush water without blocking the septic system.</li>
<li>Besides, the broken pieces shoulddissolve easily in flush water from a liquidmixture.
It is difficult to flush undissolved toilet paper. Moreover, these fibrous tissues will require extra Flush water to push them forward.
<strong>2. Anti-clog type.</strong>
Check if the toilet paper you intend to buy whether has anti-clog a property. Most low-quality tissue papers clog the toilet, sewer, and septic system affecting the entire network.
What happens is that the broken tissue paper stick on the inner lining of the sewer pipes and septic, thus narrowing the passage.
The flush water cannot wash away these clogs since they form a hard substance that requires higher force (the ingredients for which these low-quality toilet papers are made from propagating the stick ability).
<strong>3. The Biodegradable ability.</strong>
Any tissue should be biodegradable. This means that it should be in a position to be decomposed by
bacteria found in the septic
or sewer system at ease.</li>
<li>This is very important as it will avoid pollution and the high accumulation of used toilet paper in the septic tank.
Removal of undigested used toilet paper waste from the septic system is costly and time-consuming.
Ensure you confirm the biodegradable label before purchasing any toilet paper brand.
<strong>4. The Eco-friendly�</strong>
The climate and environmental organizations encourage the use of products that do not pollute the environment during and after use.
Toilet papers, when dropped in the background, should naturally decompose and cause minimal pollution.</li>
<li>You should avoid purchasing tissue papers that take longer to decompose.
The pulp used for toilet paper should be sourced from well-managed forests but not from recycled materials. Do your background study of any tissue paper producing company well before buying their product.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dont-flush-down-septic-systems-why">Don&rsquo;t Flush Down Septic Systems? Why?</h2>
<p>You can achieve this by avoiding flushing some of these things:
<strong>1. Clothes and Sanitary towels.</strong>
Usually, clothes do not decompose in septic tanks quickly. Though they may be of small size, their accumulation in the septic tank is disastrous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most sanitary towels do not decompose swiftly.Some of them are large and make it difficult to flow in sewer lines.
Together with clothes, sanitary towels mostly block the septic and sewer system leading to unnecessary maintenance costs.
<strong>2. Plastics and Nylon products�</strong>
Avoid flushing plastic and nylon products such as papers, condoms, pampers, and wrappers since they block the septic and sewer system and accumulate in the septic tank.
It would be vital if you can make a notice at your home to warn users against flushing such substances.
<strong>3. Chemicals</strong>
Don&rsquo;t wash/clean your septic and sewer system with chemicals (Sodium Hydroxide, Lye, caustic soda) that may be found in your houses, such as
dish soap
, drain cleaners, and powder cleaners.</li>
<li>Most of them contain substances that form foam in the septic tank.
Avoid oily waste flush into your septic as it sticks on the inner wall causing a thick layer, which accumulates, thus narrowing the system network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The right selection of toilet paper is key for the safety of your septic system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for biodegradable, eco-friendly, chemical-free, rapid braking, and more comfortable dissolving properties when purchasing the best toilet paper for your septic.
Avoid flushing plastic, nylon, and non-biodegradable products in your septic as a proper way of maintaining your septic and sewer system.</li>
</ul>

      <description>Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review? Dont we all hate the common challenge of the slow-moving drain in the kitchen or sink?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review? Dont we all hate the common challenge of the slow-moving drain in the kitchen or sink?
In this post, Ive reviewed the Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria, which is one of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners I recommend for your plumbing systems</a>
. I tested Bio-clean using Friskies cat food that contains 10 % fats, 30 % protein, and the others are mineral substances &amp; carbohydrates.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
You have to note that Bio-clean
Drain cleaner
is a bacteria/ enzyme formula that is eco-friendly. Luckily, itll tear down the clog/ gunk on the inner side of your
drain pipes
(both metal including copper and PVC pipes) but wont damage the pipes.</p>
<h2 id="bio-clean-drain-septic-bacteria-2-review">Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review</h2>
<p>Therefore, compared to other
drain cleaners that are either highly basic or highly acidic
, thus harming your piping system, this Bio-clean Drain cleaner has only enzymes and natural bacteria thatll break down the organic matter (the drain clog) thats blocking the plumbing system.</p>
<h3 id="safe-and-ease-of-application">Safe and Ease of application</h3>
<p>Youll require a single teaspoonful of the
drain cleaner and dump it into the clogged/)
<a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> or piping system. However, mix the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">drain cleaner powder with some hot water</a>
to activate the bacteria and enzymes&rsquo; working. Finally, pour your great water drain cleaner mixture directly into the clogged drain.</p>
<h3 id="the-slower-rate-of-action-4-6-hours-overnight-is-better">The slower rate of action: 4-6 hours (Overnight is better)</h3>
<p>Compared to the other drain cleaners such as
Pure Lye drain opener
,
Drano Max Gel Clog Remover
, or the
XIONLAB Safer Drain Opener
that required an allowance of 15-30 minutes to work on the drain clog fully, this Bio-clean Drain cleaner requires about 4-6 hours without flushing with either cold or hot water. This is mainly because The organic enzymes and bacteria have a slow rate of action compared to the basic, acidic or caustic cleaners.</p>
<h3 id="cost-effective-drain-cleaner">Cost-effective drain cleaner</h3>
<p>Bio-clean Drain cleaner is more very safe and cost-effective compared to other drain cleaners available in the market today  due to the en enzymatic mode of action. Bio-clean is highly economical.
It allows about 100 drain treatments per bottle. As noted above, youll only require just one tablespoon to treat your clogged drain. The natural bacteria tend to multiply fast after eating some organic matter in the plumbing system, giving you faster and cheap drain removal.
[amazon box=&ldquo;B001N09KN4&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]</p>
<h3 id="genetically-built-formula">Genetically built formula</h3>
<p>The genetically built formula will consume all the soap scum, oil, grease, hair, and cotton in your clogged drains. Its a unique formula that is a development from the advances in the recent decades biotechnology. The clog&rsquo;s enzymes act by digesting the foreign material in a way just like how humans digest food.
On the other hand, once mixed in water, the bio-clean digest the organic matter, tripling in number by the minute, and release mineral ash, carbon dioxide, and water. Further, the enzymes do not rely on gravity to act and will thus ill love throughout the clogged drain and eat away the organic matter.</p>
<h2 id="bio-clean-safe-for-pipes"><strong>Bio-Clean safe for pipes</strong>?</h2>
<p>I would say that Bio-clean, as they are just natural bacteria and enzymes, wont generate dangerous gases in their action. Bio-clean digests organic materials without heating or generation poisonous fumes.
The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner</a>
wont harm your pipes as it has not contained caustic, acidic, or alkaline formula. Further, it wont eat away any live tissue as hence its safe for yourself, your kids, or pets in addition to being eco-friendly.
Further, the products of its action are only mineral ash, water, and carbon dioxide. The mineral ash must not make you worry as it&rsquo;s safe and even helps aid plant development.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0sMRKb0NY">YouTubers Claim</a>
. The two ingredients are readily available and will have a bubbling reaction.
<em>Summary: It&rsquo;s a thumbs down for the�vinegar and baking soda in unclogging blocked drains and de-scaling pipes. A�recent experiment proves that the bubbling (Sodium Acetate + Water) can&rsquo;t de-clog your drain or remove the clogging gunk deep down the drain. So, I&rsquo;ll stick to�reliable drain cleaners.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Drain Cleaner&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="vinegar--baking-soda--sodium-acetate--water">Vinegar + Baking Soda = Sodium Acetate + Water</h2>
<dl>
<dt>When you add vinegar to Baking soda, youll create a bubbling mix. However, the bubbling is just producing Sodium Acetate + Water, which will not do a reliable deep cleaning.</dt>
<dt>With the vinegar plus Baking soda, its mix will create just</dt>
<dt><a href="http://www.crunchybetty.com/diy-101-baking-soda-vinegar-not-so-much">salt and water that will not help generate the drain clog</a></dt>
<dt>you might burn your resources.</dt>
<dt><strong>So, whats the best method</strong></dt>
<dd>Instead of using the mix of the two greening ingredients, use the
baking soda
like your scouring agent in cleaning bathrooms or the sinks. On the other hand, use vinegar for neutralizing any odor or like a scum busting.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="avoid-vinegar-plus-baking-soda">Avoid Vinegar plus Baking Soda</h2>
<p>When used separately,
vinegar and baking soda are excellent home
cleaning agents. For example, vinegar acts to remove odor and disinfectant, while baking soda has great scrubbing power.
As noted above, even though e reaction will not get to the bottom of the drain clog, it cant clear it. I know that most DIY experts recommend the mixture but leave it at just that.
The effervescence will be lovely, and the resulting bubbles will run down the
drain pipes
.
I know most of you may believe the bubbles (from the white vinegar plus baking soda) will break down the clogs (hair, oils,
shampoo
, and grease), but all this does not get to the clogging gunk deep in the drain.
<strong>Alternatives  Boiled water, Dish Soap, Salt, Drain Snake�</strong>
However, if you still dont fancy using the recommended
drain cleaners
, you can use boiled water and mix it with some dish soap (it works in the drain with oil or grease buildup, such as kitchen sinks). Further, you can add salt to boiled
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">water to also help in unclogging the drain</a>
.
I recently covered how to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-shower-drain-full-of-hair/">unclog a shower drain full of hair</a>
, just like its covered in this guide showing�why these alternative methods are effective.
However, youll need to remove the hair, oil, and grease clog balls by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-snakes/">snaking the drain</a>
for shower or bathtub clog.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The vinegar/ baking soda technique will not solve the grease buildups in your showers or kitchen sinks.
Notably, melting away the oil and grease would require both a surfactant and heat, which would allow the oil to flow out with the water.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today, Im at my house in Downtown Houston ready to do a review of the Drano Max Gel Clog Remover - the runner-up product in the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaners</a>
. I aim to see what the cleaner can do about a severe clog in my kitchen sink.
<em>Summary: Drano Max Gel will liquefy even the most challenging drain clogs in your plumbing or septic systems. This powerful drain cleaner will clean soap scum, hair, shampoo oil, organic matter, paper, &amp; grease. Its ultra-thick to move through standing water, and it&rsquo;s a 100% biodegradable product.�</em>
So, Ill go ahead. The label instruction recommends that I pour about a fifth of cleaner in this container and allow it to sit in there for 15-30 minutes. It&rsquo;s excellent for drains in the kitchen, laundry sinks, bathroom, lavatory, garbage disposals. Luckily, its also odorless, and not corrosive, and wont leave any waste.
<strong>See top drain cleaners.</strong>
I&rsquo;d tried to use boiling water, plungers,
vinegar, and baking soda, but they didn&rsquo;t remove the drain clog
.</p>
<h3 id="whats-this-drano-max-gel">What&rsquo;s this, Drano Max Gel?</h3>
<p>This Drano Max Gel is a powerful enzymatic
drain cleaner
that will clean most of your tough drain clogs. The cleanser is produced by S. C. Johnson &amp; Son  an American company that stands for quality and ethical manufacturing.
But the Drano Max Gel cleaner was first produced in 1923. So, you can guess that it has undergone numerous iterative improvements in safety and quality. �However, the company also has other products such as Drano snake and Drano Aerosol Plunger.
What makes Drano Max Gel unique among all the drain cleaners include-:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its produced to protect your pipes (both PVC and metal pipes) from corrosive action. Also, you can leave it overnight,working on your clogged drain.</li>
<li>It has quick action time  about 15 to 30 minutes before you flush out the debris using warm water.</li>
<li>You can pour into the sink with water, and itll cut through it and get to the drain clog fast with its natural enzyme formula.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="drain-test---time-it-takes-bottle-of-water-to-drain">Drain Test - Time it takes Bottle of water to drain</h2>
<p>To test this Drano
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner&rsquo;s</a>
effectiveness, well time how long it takes to drain a pre-measured bottle of water before and after using the drain cleaner. So, lets get started. I now pour the water (filled to the top line) while setting off the timer to check on time.
So, I am done pouring the water, and it has gone down the drain in 7.74 seconds (
<em>as shown in our timer below</em>
).</p>
<h2 id="now-pour-a-5th-of-the-drano-in-the-clogged-drain">Now, pour a 5th of the Drano in the clogged drain.</h2>
<p>As noted above, it took 7.74 seconds to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">drain the clean water</a>
. We&rsquo;ll come back to this time at the end of the experiment. But first, now we pour the Drano Max Gel.
Therefore, I thoroughly rinsed out this sink. Next, I pour about a fifth of the Drano Max Gel into the drain. Next, I set my timer and allow 20 minutes before we come back for the next process. Finally, the 20 minutes ended.</p>
<h2 id="flash-drain-with-warm-water">Flash Drain with Warm Water</h2>
<p>So, we continue following the label instructions. Next up, we now use warm water to flush the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/sink-not-draining-but-pipes-clear/">drain hoping that Drano has now cleared</a>
the clog. So, we do that right away  flush the water for about a minute, as fast as the faucet can run from the tap.
Luckily, I can already tell that the water is draining much faster than before using the Drano MAX Gel cleaner. When my wife brushed her teeth this morning, the water was backing up and getting to about three-quarters of the sink.
However, to verify my claims, well repeat the drain test  with clean water and a timer.</p>
<h2 id="second-drain-test---draining-clean-water-timer">Second Drain Test - Draining clean water (Timer)</h2>
<p>Now, we go back to the bottle filled with clean water and have our timer running. So, let&rsquo;s get right to the test. So, the water runs down the drain in about 4.36 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, this test shows we achieved faster water draining - but about 3.38 seconds. So, definitely, this Drano Max Gel Clog Remover works, and I would recommend that you trust it for your clogged drains and garbage disposal pipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage-results--">Usage Results: -</h3>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drano Max Gel Clog Remover is made to be a thick formula that&rsquo;ll dissolve even the toughest of the drain clogs. Further, being denser than water, the cleaner will move through standing water and work on the challenging clogs - including hair, soap scum, oils, and grease.
It has no phosphorus and will work great for septic systems, garbage disposals in addition to metal, PVC, and plastic pipes.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaner</a>
available in the market.
The powder formula was great, but this new liquid option is even simpler to use. Just un-cock it and pour the contents one of the chambers, and you&rsquo;re done. Check top drain cleaners.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Green Gobbler GGDIS2CH32 Dissolve&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="green-gobbler-liquid-instructions">Green gobbler Liquid instructions</h2>
<p>Interestingly, you don&rsquo;t wear rubber gloves, no nothing - it&rsquo;s all safe. Most traditional
drain cleaners
may bore the clog (with heat) to allow some water to move through it but don&rsquo;t clean the pipes. However, Green Gobbler won&rsquo;t produce heat and will clean the pipes too.</p>
<h2 id="how-green-gobbler-liquid-works">How Green Gobbler Liquid Works</h2>
<p>Green Gobbler will
clear drain
clogs in the tubs, showers, sinks, and toilets. It works through emulsification and dissolution of paper, oils, grease, feminine products, toothpaste, hair, and organic matter stuck in the clogged drain pipe.
<strong>Shower Drains &amp; tubs</strong>
I recently discussed how to
clean a shower drain clogged with hair
. This post noted that Showers, Drains, and tubs are mainly clogged by hair, soap scum, grease, and
shampoo oils
. Therefore, an enzymatic cleaner like Green Gobbler will be the best solution to emulsify and dissolve all those debris and organic matter.
So, after pouring the
cleaner into the clogged drain
, give it like 20 minutes (check the product label for instruction) and finally pouring hot water to flush the foreign materials.
<strong>Toilets</strong>
Most times, well accidentally flush female products such as sanitary pads down the toilet. This leads to confusion; do you use a plunger, hot water, or acidic cleaner to eat away the product&rsquo;s fiber? Luckily, you can unclog the pipes by pouring down the Green Gobbler powder into the toilet, even without removing the water remaining on the toilet basin.
<strong>Sink Drains</strong>
In addition to the hair, grease, and shampoo oils,
sink drains
will also be clogged by toothpaste as you brush your teeth. A major differentiating factor for Green Gobbler is that it is eco-friendly as it doesnt use chemical but just natural enzymes. Sadly, I have to tell you that you&rsquo;ll need to
<strong>avoid vinegar and Baking Soda</strong>
remedy because
it doesn&rsquo;t work
.
<strong>The Good:�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**1. Pre-measured Liquid bottles:�**As you may have noted, this green gobbler liquid is packed in a plastic bottle that is conveniently divided into two compartments with separate lids. Luckily, each of the packets is enough for a single treatment or<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/">drain unclogging</a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, no mess and no measuring. You&rsquo;ll use one chamber for your kitchen or shower sink while you&rsquo;ll need to empty two chambers when cleaning any toilet clogs.</li>
<li>**2. Environmental friendly:�**Green Gobbler works through enzymatic action and does not produce dangerous fumes while in action. Its not basic, acidic, or acoustic-like your regular drain cleaners. This has earned this cleaner the prestigious EPA approval for being environmentally friendly and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation">biodegradable</a>.</li>
<li><strong>3. Great for PVC and metal pipes</strong>: Contrary to common belief, this liquid<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/xionlab-safer-drain-opener-review/">drain cleaner</a>will work well in both PVC and metal pipes  this includes cast iron, copper, and aluminum. It also dissolves most clogs and hair fast enough. It&rsquo;s also great for big toilet clogs.</li>
<li>It has fast dissolve technology that will help to clear the drain clogs effectively. So, if you have regular problems with toilet clogs and are environmentally conscious, then this Green Gobbler dissolve should be your ultimate drain cleaner.
<strong>The Bad:�</strong></li>
<li>**1. Requires hot water:�**Green Gobbler comes in a liquid form. After 20-30 minutes, you&rsquo;ll need to flush the toilet (not activating) using hot water. Therefore, if you&rsquo;re not on solar power, the process could be delayed by power blackout or gas unavailability.</li>
<li>**2. Slow on fully clogged drains:**I noted that when the drain or sink, if fully clogged, you might need to use a snake first or a bent hanger wire, or else the process will be too slow.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Itll dissolve fast, oil, soap scum, hair, and grease  in its amazingly two pre-measured portions. Being heavier or denser than
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">water, the Green Gobbler cleaner will move through</a>
stagnant water and clean your pipes and drains.
Further, it is non-flammable and odorless, making it so much better than the acidic, basic, or acoustic drain cleaners. Itll be great for shower drains, bathtubs, toilets, or kitchen sinks.</p>

<strong>Summary:�Oxidizing drain cleaners (with�nitrate ions) utilize heat and gas to unclog <a href="/posts/best-shower-drain-cleaner/">drains</a> while caustic drain cleaners generate hydroxide ions that clear the drain clog.

<h2 id="how-drain-cleaners-work-unclogging-plumbing">How Drain Cleaners Work (Unclogging) Plumbing</h2>
<p>Chemical drain clears produce heat and gas, which may melt the PVC pipes if not used according to label instructions. Further, you must keep the cleaners away from animals or children as they are dangerous if ingested.
The products may burn clothes or char mucous membranes, skin, and eyes. Precautions to take include dont use a plunger, dont
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">mixing on the drain cleaners</a>
, wearing gas masks and rubber gloves, and ensuring that the room is ventilated.</p>
<h3 id="i-chemical-based-cleaners">(i). Chemical-Based Cleaners</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Drain cleaners</dt>
<dt>(powder, gel, or liquid) in your local store are mainly chemicals substances that function by giving or taking electrons to or from the drain clog, a process that also could produce heat.</dt>
<dt><strong>1. Acidic drain cleaners</strong></dt>
<dd>Mainly, youll not find these types of drain cleaners in your local store. However, they are mainly found with the plumbers due to their high acid (either hydrochloric or sulfuric acid) concentrations.
Their mechanism of action is by introducing hydronium ions (ion H3O+) to the
clogged drain
and thus attracts a majority of the electrons.
<strong>2. Oxidizing�drain cleaners</strong></dd>
<dd>Oxidizing�drain cleaners have nitrates, peroxides, and bleach. This chemical class of cleaners will oxidize the drain clog by extracting electrons from it.
Notably, being heavy compared to water, the chemical drain cleaner will settle at the bottom of any standing water, producing gas and heat that clears the clog.
<strong>3. Caustic�drain cleaners</strong></dd>
<dd>These
types of chemical drain cleaners
have caustic potash and lye.
Being basic/ alkaline types of cleaners, theyll release electrons to the drain clog, reacting with the hydroxide ions to allow the clog&rsquo;s unblocking.
The chemical will produce gas and heat thatll change the drain clog into a soapy and easily dissolvable solution.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="ii-enzyme-based-cleaners">(ii). Enzyme-Based Cleaners</h3>
<p>Caution: dont use enzymatic cleaners combined with chemical disinfectants or bleach since these products will lessen their effectiveness. These natural and effective products will work for you if you love green solutions or simply allergic to chemical cleaners.
The biofilm-eating enzyme cleaners will be great in unclogging
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bio-clean-drain-septic-bacteria-2-review/">drains in septic</a>
systems. Theyll work great with lukewarm water to allow the growth of different bacteria.

<ul>
<li>Well,snaking your drainwould be an�excellent option for this! But, while at it, other options includeusing a plungeror<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a>.
In the snaking process, you&rsquo;d use the drain snake (also known as a drain auger, electric eel, or a toilet jack) to destroy clogs sitting down the drain.
<strong>See these drain snakes.</strong>

</ul>
<h2 id="1-how-to-unclog-a-drain-with-a-snake"><strong>1. How to Unclog a Drain with a Snake�</strong></h2>
<p>A
drain snake
consists of a long coiled wire with a spiral spring, usually an inch thick with a handle on the other end. This tool`s working mechanism is the opposite of how a plunger operates.
<strong>Tools required:�</strong>
Hand gloves, Drain Auger, Pipe wrench or pliers or a screwdriver, and Towels or rags. The following are steps to be followed when snaking a
sink drain
.
<strong>1. First, you have to select a small drain snake that is handheld</strong>
. This small drain snake has a round casing that houses the wire that is 25-50 feet long.
<strong>2. Assemble the materials and tools required for the task</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Youll need a bucket, a snake, towels/rags, a pipe wrench, and gloves.
<strong>3. Remove the P-trap</strong>
(this is the curved
pipe under the drain
of your sink). Remove it using a pipe wrench.
Some P-traps are usually installed and may require hands to remove them. Place a bucket to collect water and other materials that may be trapped.
**4. Place the drain snake cable into the pipe coming out of the wall **</li>
<li>Drive it in until some resistance is felt.
In a clog case, the opposition will be squishy, but if the resistance is hard, that might turn, pull the wire, and push it again.
<strong>5. Move the handle in a clockwise manner-</strong>
Once the resistance experienced is squishy; turn the handle of the snake so you can break the clog.
Turning it in a clockwise direction leads to some clogs getting dismantled while others are caught at the edge of the snake.
**6. Retrieve the drain snake from the drain gently. **
This is done to prevent the clog from slipping back into the drain and place them into the bucket. Return the P-trap into its position and tighten the fasteners.
<strong>7. Run water down the sink to check whether the clogs have cleared from the drain.</strong>
When the operation is successful, the dislodged clog takes a few seconds to clear, after which water flows easily. If not successful, you can repeat the snaking operation or call a plumber for further assistance.</li>

<h2 id="2how-to-snake-a-shower-drain">**2.�**How to Snake a Shower Drain</h2>
<p>Have you ever found yourself in the bathroom standing in a pool of water, trying to push the water using your legs? Embarrassing right?
Soap residues materials like
hair in the bathtub
may be the root cause of that blockage, and before you call a plumber, here are some tips on how to do the unblocking yourself using a snake.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assemble all the required tools for the unblocking</strong>. Youll need a snake drain, a screwdriver, hand gloves, and towels/rags.</li>
<li>**Using a screwdriver, remove the cover of the shower drain to access the drain. **After accessing the drain, place the snake&rsquo;s end into the drain and drop it until you feel some resistance.
Once some resistance of the clog is felt, gently and slowly move the handle of the snake clockwise.
The clockwise movement helps move the clog further in the shower drainpipe while some materials get hooked on the snake.
In case of any increased resistance, that means you might have hit a bend in the pipe; that could also mean that the snake has caught more clogs; pull it back for a few centimeters, then return it as you turn it in the clockwise direction.</li>
<li>**Remove the drain snake-**Once you feel that the cloghas been successfully hooked at the end, retrieve the snake gently and slowly.</li>
<li>This is done to ensure that the clog does not fall back into the pipe. Turn the snake anticlockwise and ensure the pipe does not get damaged, and no clogged materials are left behind.
Once the snake is fully retrieved, you can use your hands to remove the materials from the drain hooked on the snake; better still, you can use a towel/rag to avoid any harm on the hands and dispose of the unclogged materials in the bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Ascertain that drain is unblocked by pouring water down it</strong>- The water will take a few seconds to drain, and afterward, the water will run quickly.</li>
<li>If the water does not drain quickly, then the drainpipe is still blocked. Repeat the snaking process until the clog clears. If the water still doesnt run, you may consider calling a plumber for further assistance.

<h2 id="how-does-a-drain-snake-work"><strong>How does a drain snake work?</strong></h2>
<p>A plunger creates a vacuum to attract the material to loosen or break up a blockage; a drain snake is pushed down the drain to the blockage point.</p>
<ul>
<li>There it breaks up the material, causing the blockage, which is hence flushed out.</li>
<li>The snake also assists in acquiring access to the clog, thereby pulling it out. Snakes may be manually or electronically operated.
Snaking involves selecting the right type of auger for the drain in question, and by the use of small skills and efforts, your drain becomes clear.</li>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-drain-clogs"><strong>How to Prevent Drain Clogs</strong></h2>
<p>Here are some few tips to observe that will save you the agony of clogged <a href="/posts/best-drain-cleaner/">drains</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use a screen tub in the bathroom to prevent the infiltration of unwanted materials into the <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> pipe. The screen tub collects the materials the cause clogging, and hence you should be cleaning the screen tub occasionally.</li>
<li>In line with the prevention, you can catch unwanted materials in the bathroom, including hairs and soap residues, using hands before they go down the drain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You can run hot water in the kitchen sink after use to keep oils off the drain, which causes clogging.
Also, waste disposal in a trash bin instead of the sink helps keep waste that causes blockages away from the drains.</p>

<h3 id="g-contact-a-professional-plumber-to-inspect">g.����� Contact a professional plumber to inspect</h3>
<p>A professional plumber will do great work in cleaning out the clogged drain, especially if you go for a long-serving expert with a track record in a similar task. A plumber also saves you money and time.</p>
<h2 id="what-causes-sink-clogs">What causes sink clogs?</h2>
<p>A sink drain clog can be caused by either of the following:</p>
<h3 id="1hair">1.�Hair</h3>
<p>Hair is stuck along the sink drain lining, especially when there is a soapy mixture. Shaving and making your hair in your bathroom is paramount. Additionally, some strands of hair actually shed unnoticeably for instance when you wash your face.</p>
<h3 id="2-grease">2. Grease</h3>
<p>Over time, with a gradual accumulation of oil and grease on the inner surfaces, your bathroom sink drain may clog or get totally plugged up.</p>
<h3 id="3-toiletry-debris">3. Toiletry debris</h3>
<p>Slow drainage may occur when cotton swabs, paper towels, and other debris from toiletries get trapped in the sink drain.</p>
<h3 id="4-soap-scum">4. Soap scum</h3>
<p>Whenever you bathe with liquid bath soaps, suds are created. Suds have a tendency of sticking on drain pipes, thus clogging them with time.</p>
<h3 id="5-obstructed-sewer-line">5. Obstructed sewer line</h3>
<p>Blocked sewer line, impends smooth flow of sink waste. Stagnation of such debris causes internal drain clogging. In case you encounter a similar problem, contact your area sewer line, or maintenance team.</p>
<h3 id="6damaged-pipes">6.�Damaged pipes</h3>
<p>Slow drainage or clogging on your bathroom sink drain may result from the broken, faulty, or damaged pipe  a broken section traps debris in the sink waste leading to clogging. Contact a plumber to have it fixed immediately.</p>
<h2 id="when-should-you-call-a-plumber">When Should you Call a Plumber?</h2>
<p>Cleaning the showerhead could help fix your low water pressure head at times.
However, the use of DIY methods such as vinegar and baking powder, hot water, or plunger may fail to attain quality results in some cases.
So, its advisable to call a plumber if you encounter instances highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="i-a-rapid-burst-pipe-leak">i. A rapid burst pipe leak</h3>
<p>A pipe or your water line may suffer a major burst causing gallons of water to flood all over your house. Though uncommon, this occasionally happens and when it does, calling a plumber is imminent.
Not only that, but you also have to act promptly to temporarily stop the rapid leak before the plumber gets there.
Locate the intermediary cut-off valves closest to the leak and stop the supply of water to the leaking line. If you cant find any of the cut-off valves, then find and turn off the main water shut-off valve  this will cut-off water supply to the entire house until a plumber rectifies the leak.</p>
<h3 id="ii-no-water-supply-in-the-house">ii. No water supply in the house</h3>
<p>In most cases of this problem, water stops flowing in one or several of the sub-water-lines in your house, for example, bathroom sink, kitchen, or shower.
In very rare cases will you find a total stoppage of water supply to your house  especially if you own an online water backup supply.
It is recommendable to first inspect the affected water outlets and their subsections (those that are not receiving water). For instance, due to a faulty water heater, hot water may not be delivered to your shower outlet despite the cold water supply being fully operational.
Moreover, it is possible that the water supply has stopped because of a massive leak in the sunken pipe feeding your house water line from the street-side water meter.</p>
<h3 id="iii-when-you-have-a-leak-in-the-drainage-line-leak">iii. When you have a leak in the drainage line leak</h3>
<p>Leaking kitchen and bathroom leaks are a common thing for homeowners  its caused by excess internal pressure or pipe breakage.
The leaking sink trap should be replaced  ensure the water supply is turned off first. For leaking lines that you cant be accessed easily or those that are sealed by walls and flooring, you should immediately call a plumber to have them dealt with. This act ensures that your dry walls, paint, and subfloor do not suffer further damage.</p>
<h3 id="iv-gaseous-odors-and-filling-sinks-or-bathtubs">iv. Gaseous odors and filling sinks or bathtubs</h3>
<p>Once you detect a fault with your sewer line, it is recommendable to contact a plumber to undertake the inspection.
The foul stench manifests in form of an odorous smell that fills up your home if not attended to immediately. A similar case occurs in the case where your kitchen/bathroom sinks,
bathtub
, or toilet gets filled with wastewater.</p>
<h2 id="5-major-signs-that-your-slab-is-leaking">5 major Signs that your slab is leaking</h2>
<p>Either of the following can detect slab leaks:</p>
<h3 id="1-when-you-detect-mold-smell">1) When you detect mold smell</h3>
<p>When you notice mold growing on your home foundation, walls, floorboards, or somewhere along an embedded water line, then it is likely that you have a slab leak and that mold is growing from the moisture released. The presence of mold is also accompanied by a musty smell.</p>
<h3 id="2-sound-of-running-water-when-appliances-are-not-in-use">2) Sound of running water when appliances are not in use</h3>
<p>You will notice (hear/see wet areas) water flow or moisture section when none of the appliances or water outlets is in use.
In such as case, the best decision to take is to first turn off the main water supply (for your house) and call a plumber to fix the problem.</p>
<h3 id="3-sunken-floorboards-and-tiles">3) Sunken floorboards and tiles</h3>
<p>When water seeps into floorboards and tiles, they get destabilized causing them to sink in or bulk. Actually, this is a warning sign resulting from leakage - you should call your plumber right away.
Tackling this problem early enough reduces losses due to house foundation damage, which could be quite expensive.</p>
<h3 id="4-dampened-carpets">4) Dampened carpets</h3>
<p>A damp carpet is caused by water, which could be from a leakage somewhere.
To ascertain to troubleshoot the problem, peel back the carpet and check for any wetness on the padding and floorboards. Once you are sure of the leakage, contact a plumber.</p>
<h3 id="5-abnormally-higher-water-bills-but-same-usage">5)����� Abnormally higher water bills, but same usage</h3>
<p>When your water bills are strangely higher than average yet your water usage routine is unchanged, then there might be a leak somewhere in your houses water line.
First, get a technician from your local water company to check for any leaks  once ascertained, then you should go right ahead to call a plumber to correct the leak.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on how to unclog a bathroom sink drain, you can simply use a Zip-It tool, hot water, or hot water.
If the fault is pretty serious; then, go for a plunger or use a vinegar-baking powder solution to attain total removal of clogs, dirt, and residuals in your sink drain.
If the clogging persists even after trying highlighted solutions; then, you may have to contact a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/xionlab-safer-drain-opener-review/">professional plumber</a>
since this may suggest blockage or some other problem with the sewer line. Remember to wear protective gear for your personal safety.</p>

<dd>(1) Several screwdrivers (either the standard or fill-ups) depending on the type of screws on your Bathtub Drain. (2) A Flashlight (3) Wet-Dry Vacuum (ensure to remove its filter). Others include a damp rag, Sponge, bucket, and rubber gloves.
Put on your rubber gloves to prevent getting infected with germs or bacteria. Ensure you block the bathtub overflow using your hands or some damp rag.
<strong>Extract all the standing water�</strong>
So, to start, youll need to extract all the topical or standing water above the
drain to have a clean/)
working ground. Now, remove the screws, and this is where you can use the flashlight to see the screws.
<strong>Extract dislodged material - Apply Downward pressure.</strong>
Next up, please put on the wet-dry vacuum (after removing its filter) so that you can now extract any hair, soaps, feminine products, and wires stuck in the clogged drain.
Now point the Vacuum Wand Extension to the clogged drain and press it down to prevent any air from getting in. Continue applying downward pressure on your vac tube, and press it completely before quickly pulling it up to extract that hair and other debris. So, as I noted, the drain stoppages are mainly caused by soap scum and hair.
<strong>Test bathtub drain if it&rsquo;s working well.�</strong>
So, keep the vacuum turned on and completely remove the gunk before testing the Bathtub

<h3 id="method-2snake-the-bathtub-drain--plumbing-snake">Method 2:�Snake the bathtub Drain  Plumbing Snake**�**</h3>
<p><strong>�</strong>
Now we come to the difficult plumbing snake on your bathtub. However, if you find this process too difficult, then you should hire a plumber to bring their professional services to unclog the standing water.
<strong>Remove overflow cover and snake.�</strong>
Further, remove the overflow cover above the bathtub. Next, feed your plumbing snake through this overflow cover up to the point you experience relatively high push back.
<strong>Rotate snake anti-clockwise�</strong>
Next up, rotate the snake in an anti-clockwise direction to possibly break down the drain clog. Be keen to feel if the resistance has reduced when you push. If so, now pull the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-snakes/">snake out of the drain</a>
. Repeat this process until the clog is cleared. Finally, flush the drain using hot water.</p>

<strong>Remove the coil and overflow cover.�</strong>
Check the coil and eject all the foreign material and hair. Next, eject the overflow cover of your bathtub completely cover it using the damp rag. However, make sure that the overflow exit is airtight before starting the plugging process.
<strong>Plunge the Bathtub</strong>
Now take your
plunger and start the plunging process on your bathtub drain
. However, its important that you allow yourself enough time and dont give up early as the process is very tasking.
The litmus test for success in the plunging process will be when the standing water complexly and quickly drains away from the bathtub. When this is fully done, youll need to flush the bathtub using some hot water. However, if youre unsuccessful in

<strong>Caution</strong>
:
Avoid mixing the chemicals
as this might result in the production of�poisonous gas.
<em><strong>1. For the Liquid Drain cleaner:�</strong></em>
Now hold the bottle with the liquid cleaner and open its top. Pour the cleaner (as instructed) into the open shower drain.�This will require that you squeeze the bottle to get the liquid out. Next, allow the
cleaner about 30-60 minutes
to act on the clogged drain. But remember, this must follow the label instructions.
The next step on this is to flash out the drain using hot water. However, when you notice that the shower
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain does not clear enough</a>
, you might require adding some drain cleaner and giving it time to work.
<em><strong>2. For Granulated Crystal Cleaner:��</strong></em>
If youre using a granulated crystal cleaner, youll need to follow a different process to unclog the shower drain. However, first, just like with the liquid cleaner, read the label instructions.
For the granulated crystal cleaner, clear all the stagnant water in the shower and drain. Then pour about 2-3 tablespoons of the granular crystal cleaner into the shower drain.
Finally, pour about cold water (about two glasses) into the drain. �Then leave the chemical to act for 35-50 minutes, after which youll only need to pour cold water to flash all the hair and debris in the shower drain.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-clogging-of-your-shower-draining">How to prevent clogging of your shower draining</h2>
<p>Definitely, after unclogging your shower drain, youll now require to stop any factors that could take you back to the slow-moving drain mess. Therefore, in this section, Ill dig into how you can keep your drain cleaner longer and thus have an enjoyable shower time.
**1. Replace worn-out shower strainers: **
First things first, you need to keep your protection system up all the time. This comes down to having a reliable and screwed or corked down shower strainer in the shower drain. Further, it would help if you kept the strainers clean from any hairballs or dirt.</p>
<p>Therefore, the strainer prevents large hair from doing down the drain. Thus you can clean most of the large hairballs using your regular brush or broom after each shower.
However, avoiding falling back to chemical drain cleaners so fast as some could, over time, destroy the drainage pipes. Therefore, the alternative is avoiding drain blockage as much as possible instead of using chemicals every time.
**2. Pour hot water once weekly: **
Take some time once a week to do general
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dont-use-vinegar-and-baking-soda-to-clean-clogged-%5Bdrains%5D(/posts/best-drain-cleaner/)/">cleaning to rid the shower drain of any clogged</a>
hair. Besides washing off any hair after every shower session, youll need to pour some hot water and some <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> cleaner down the drain once per week. The hot water will dissolve oils, greats, and soap solids that could combine with hair to form large balls of clogs.
<strong>3. Don&rsquo;t pour grease and oil into the shower drain:�</strong>
Like your kitchen drain, the shower drain will clog whenever you pour down grease and oil into them. As noted above, grease and oil will help the hair cuttings to come together to form large balls. Therefore, if you think any oils are not safe to pour down the
kitchen sink
, theyre not good for the shower drain.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to have some safe</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051T92C2/?tag=p-policy-20">soap dish</a>
since the soap (dropped down the drain) can help form large hair clogs. It goes without saying too that soap that lies around carelessly could cause slippage accidents.</p>

.
Therefore, in this post, you&rsquo;ll learn the DIY tips on unclogging your toilet without a plunger or having to call a plumber.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Drain Cleaner&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="method-1-mixing-baking-soda-and-vinegar"><strong>Method 1: Mixing baking soda and vinegar�</strong></h2>
<p><em>Requirements:�Baking soda, Vinegar, Small bucket, and Hot water  (not boiling water)</em>
This method is used for soft blockages.
Baking soda and vinegar/)
are used in many household activities. They are mostly used as cleaning chemicals.
You can find them at your local shops. When combined, they have a fizzing effect. That effect can be used in unblocking soft blockages.
<strong>Step 1 - Sprinkle baking soda directly into the toilet bowl.</strong>
Pour at least one cup and ensure that it is well spread in the toilet. Using more than one cup does not affect.
<strong>Step 2 - Slowly and gently pour one cup of vinegar into the toilet bowl.</strong>
Pouring the vinegar should have a fizzing effect. This is caused by the chemical reaction of the baking soda and vinegar. Pouring the vinegar quickly causes increased fizzing, which may mess up the place.
<strong>Step 3 - Allow the ingredients to stay for about 25 minutes.</strong>
This is done to allow the ingredients to work and react well. It also buys time to let the level of water to drop in the bowl.
Alternatively, you can allow the mixture to stay for longer, say 2 hours or even overnight. Allowing more time is essential in ensuring the reaction is an effective one.
<strong>Step 4 - Take the hot water and pour it into the toilet bowl.</strong>
Boiling water is not recommended because you do not want to crack your toilet. Boiling
water may also damage pipes down the drain
. After the 25 minutes have elapsed, pour the hot water. This hot water will wash down the baking soda, vinegar, and any soft blockages.
<strong>Step 5 - Test Flush</strong>
Flush water to ascertain that the blockage is cleared. If the water does not flush, you may consider repeating the process. You can try an alternative method. However, if the problem persists, you can contact your plumber for further assistance.

<h2 id="method-2using-dish-soap-and-hot-water">**Method 2:�**<strong>Using Dish soap and hot water�</strong></h2>
<p><em>Requirements:�Dish soap, Bucket, Hot water.�</em>
Another way of unclogging is by using dish soap and hot water. Remember not to use boiling water so that you cannot spoil the toilet bowl and pipes.
Dish
soap is used for many purposes, including washing
utensils (as it is called), shining jewelry, and surfaces. Other uses are unclogging a toilet, yes you read that right!
For your toilets soft blockages, this is the method that you should try since dish soap and hot water are easily available. Dish soap can be easily accessed from your nearest shop. It is found in different flavors, sizes, and brands.
Since dish soap is heavier than water, it sinks to the bottom of the bowl lubricates whatever is clogging the toilet. And after pouring water, it pushes the clog down.
<strong>Step 1 - Pour about half a cup of dish soap into the toilet bowl.</strong>
After pouring the dish soap into the bowl, it will sink because of its dense nature. Wait for about 25 minutes before making the next move. Dish soap is preferred to shampoos or bar soaps since they contain fats that could clog the toilet.
Remember to put a good amount of dish soap enough to unclog the toilet. The 25 minutes are for buying time to let the water level drop and let the dish soap act effectively.
<em>How does the dish soap work?�</em>
Dish soap lubricates whatever is causing the clog. It then pushes the material down the drain once the hot water is poured.
<strong>Step 2 - Pour the hot water into the bowl.</strong>
Pour the hot water directly into the bowl. You are advised not to use boiling water not to spoil the ceramic of the toilet bowl. Pouring boiling water leads to the sudden expansion of the ceramic hence cracking.
<strong>Step 3 - Test Flush</strong>
Flush your toilet to ascertain that the clog is cleared
If the operation was successful, the water should drain with ease. If the water does not drain, it means the operation was not successful. You can repeat the process. If the water still does not drain, you can try out other methods discussed here or call a plumber for further help.</p>
<h2 id="method-3breaking-up-the-clog-with-a-hanger">**Method 3:�**<strong>Breaking up the clog with a hanger�</strong></h2>
<p><em>Requirements:�Coat hanger, Pliers, Piece of rag/clothing, Duct tape, Gloves, Trash bin.�</em>
This is an
eco-friendly way of removing clogs
since no chemicals are involved. The use of chemicals poses a great risk to your drains and ceramic.
When you use chemicals, they are washed to the sewers to harm any form of life. Almost every house has hangers for hanging clothes. They come in handy when a plunger is missing, and your toilet needs some unclogging.
<strong>Step 1 - Undo the twisted part of the hanger.</strong>
Using the pliers unwinds the hanger apart from the hook. The hook is the part that actually hangs on the wall.
After you have unwounded it, straighten it, so you have a straight wire with a hooker on the other end. The hooked part will act as the handle.
<strong>Step 2 - Wrap the end of the wire with a rag.</strong>
The rag is tied on the end that does not have a hook. Use the duct tape to prevent the rag from falling off. Alternatively, you can tie a knot. It will still serve the same purpose. This prevents the damaging of the bowl by the sharp end.
<strong>Step 3 - Stick the wire directly into the toilet bowl.</strong>
Move the hanger in all directions to push the clog away or break it down. Ensure that you have gloves on to protect your hands from the dirty water in the bowl.
Hold it firmly as you push, twist, poke in attempts to break the clogs. These repeated movements will disintegrate the clog, and the water level will start dropping.
Once you are sure the blockage has been broken down, retrieve the wire hanger and put it in a safe place. You should place the retrieved clogging materials in the trash bin for disposal.
<strong>Step 4 - Test Flush</strong>
Once you remove your hanger, you can flush the toilet to ascertain that the clog is cleared. If the method was effective, the water should flush and drain quickly.
If not, you can repeat the process, and if the problem persists, you can try out any other method as described here before calling a plumber.</p>
<h2 id="method-4-"><strong>Method 4: **** Use a drain snake to breaking up the clog�</strong></h2>
<p><em>Requirements:�Drain snake, Gloves, and Trash bin.�</em>
A
drain snake�(flexible
cleaning tool or an auger) will be an excellent solution to break up the hard drain clogs. It&rsquo;s an eco-friendly method since no chemicals are used.�A drain snake consists of a long wire screw that has a corkscrew on its tip.
The wire is flexible that you can easily move down the toilet to clear the clogs. It can maneuver the curves and go deep to as far as the length allows. However, you must select the
right type of drain snake
for the job.
The most suitable one is the closet auger, as it&rsquo;s uniquely designed for use in unclogging toilets. It is widely used because it does not damage the bowl&rsquo;s ceramic/porcelain and is also effective.
<strong>Step 1 - Assemble the required tools and materials required.</strong>
You will require hand gloves which will protect your hands:</p>
<ul>
<li>When turning the handle of the drain snake hence protecting you from injury.</li>
<li>From the dirty water that may be jumping up and down
<strong>Step 2 - Put one end of the snake into the drain.</strong>
Place it into the drain and push it down the drain. It would help if you pushed it until you experience some resistance. You can remove the wire and return it to make sure you had not hit an end.
Once the resistance you experience is spongy, know that you have reached the point of clogging, move the wire in a clockwise direction to push it down the pipes.
<strong>Step 3 - Move the handle in a counter-clockwise manner.</strong>
Once the auger is in position and the clog has been felt, turn the handle anticlockwise. The curved hook of the
drain snake will break the clogs in the pipes
. This helps in holding what has been caught and bringing it up to the surface.
You are always advised to try bringing what has been trapped up against the surface. Pushing the clogs down may cause blockages at other advanced parts of the pipes. Once you retrieve the snake, dispose of the caught materials in the bin. Remember to wash and sanitize the snake every time you use it.
<strong>Step 4 - Test Flush</strong>
To ascertain that the operation was successful, you should flush the toilet. If successful, the water will drain quickly. If not, you can repeat again and again until the clog clears. Else if, you can try other methods of unclogging a toilet before calling a plumber.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-ways-of-removing-clogs-without-a-plunger"><strong>Other ways of removing clogs without a plunger</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Using a chemical drain drainer�</strong>
You are advised to avoid them at all costs and only use them as a last resort. They pose great harm to people, pets. They are also very corrosive to pipes.
Ensure that there is free circulation of air in your toilet when using them. Their fumes are usually very poisonous. Apply them according to the accorded instructions. Ensure that you have protective gear for your protection.
<strong>2. By use of a wet/dry vacuum�</strong>
Ensure that the bowl has no water. Put the end of the vacuum
cleaner in the drain
. Place it a few inches into the drain.
You can use a rag as a seal around the drain. Turn the vacuum cleaner machine on, and the chances are that the vacuum cleaner will suck out the clog.
<strong>�How to</strong>
<strong>Prevention of clogs�</strong>
A clogged toilet is not only embarrassing but also stressful. It causes inconveniences for a lot of people. Here are some tips on how to avoid future clogs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only flush human waste and tissue paper- Pipes used in the toilets are specifically designed to<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-toilet-paper-for-septic/">flush human waste and tissue paper</a>. Any other materials will cause clogging. Dispose of such wastes in a trash bin and not the toilet.</li>
<li>Any other materials you dispose of in the toilet should be water-soluble. Other materials such as sanitary towels, toothbrushes, and others should be disposed of in a trash bin.</li>
<li>Use the necessary amount of toilet paper- Stuffing of a lot of tissue paper, and trying to flush it causes clogging. Only use the amount you require.</li>
<li>Ensure your toilet is always clean- Using toilet washing chemicals periodically wash to your toilet will meltdown and wash away any forming clogs.
**Note - **
Always remember to clean any spilled water on the floor. You can even cover the floor around the toilet using towels and tissue paper. In case of any spillages on the floor, wash them using a disinfectant.
Remember always to wear gloves. Any exposure to germs from the toilet can lead to infections and illnesses. Once you are done, ensure you dispose of the used gloves and wash your hands with soap or a hand sanitizer.</li>

<p><strong>0:</strong>
<strong>Pick the right plunger for the work. What do you want to unclog? Is it a toilet, bathtub, or sink?�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cup-style plungers</em>have a shallow dome and a flat-bottom rim. It&rsquo;ll create an airtight seal when you�plunge it into the sink basin. Compared to<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-toilet-without-a-plunger/">toilet plungers</a>, the cup-style plunger�has no flap and is ideal�for unclogging sinks and bathtubs.</li>
<li><em>Flange or toilet plungers</em>have an extra flap that&rsquo;s attached inside the cup. When inserted into a toilet, flange plungers will create a tight air seal and thus produce a high suction power. These are suitable for unblocking toilets.

<h3 id="how-to-plunge-a-toilet-withflange-or-toilet-plungers">How to Plunge a Toilet (with�Flange or Toilet Plungers)</h3>
<p><strong>1:�</strong>
If the toilet bowl is full, wear some gloves and bail out the excess water until it&rsquo;s half full. Alternatively, wait at least 10 minutes for the water level in the bowl to drop after flushing.
<strong>2:�</strong>
If the bowl is empty, add water until half full.�The right amount of water will completely cover the cup of the plunger, thereby increasing suction power.
<strong>3:�</strong>
Next, submerge the plunger and position it over the
drain opening
at the bottom of the toilet.
<strong>4:�</strong>
Be sure to hold the plunger vertically. This will
ensure the drain opening
is completely sealed for proper suction.
<strong>5:�</strong>
Gently insert and press the toilet plunger until the drain opening is completely sealed. Then, push and pull down the plunger with the handle still in a vertical position.
NB: Do not completely pull out the plunger to avoid breaking the seal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue pushing and pulling the plunger for about 15 seconds or more.</li>
<li>As soon as you release the plunger, some of the clog materials may come up. Please pick them up and dump them in the garbage bin.</li>
<li>Add more water into the toilet and continue the same process. This will ensure that all the debris clogging it is gone before flushing.</li>
<li>Remove the debris after the second round and flush the toilet. You can use hot water to flush down the toilet, which will help dissolve soap scum along the drain.</li>
<li>If plunging doesnt bear any fruits, consider using a Snake Drain or call your local plumber.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-plunge-a-sink-withcup-style-plungers">How to Plunge a Sink (with�Cup-style Plungers)</h3>
<p><strong>1:�</strong>
If unclogging a bathroom/kitchen sink or bathtub, you need to seal the
drainpipe
before plunging. In other words, you need to block the overflow opening.
<strong>2:�</strong>
Use a wet rag or towel to block the opening. This will seal in the air and therefore increase suction power while plunging.
<strong>3:�</strong>
If youre dealing with blocked double-basin kitchen sinks, block the opening in one basin before plunging the other.
<strong>4:�</strong>
Next, fill the basin half-full with tap water. Then, place the cup plunger into the sink basin or bowl drain hole until its completely submerged.
<strong>5:�</strong>
Push down the handle so that the cup forms a complete seal with the drain opening. Pull up the handle and continue pushing and pulling with the plunger.
<strong>6:�</strong>
As you do so, avoid tilting the cup as you might break the seal and reduce the suction power. Pump for around 20 seconds before releasing the plunger.
<strong>7:�</strong>
Youll see some debris after releasing the plunger. Collect and throw it in the trash bin.
<strong>8:�</strong>
Add more water to the sink and repeat the process. At this point, plunging will become much more comfortable as the clog loosens up. The second round should help clear the clog completely.</p>
<h2 id="pro-tips-for-using-your-plunger">Pro Tips for using your Plunger</h2>
<p><em>But first</em>
:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plunge vertical and�straight: Notably, along your plunger will reduce the force and may loosen the tool&rsquo;s seal.</li>
<li>Submerge your plunger: If the bowl or dish has little water, add more water to submerge the plunger&rsquo;s rubber end fully.</li>
<li>Remove air from your plunger cup: Reduce the air in the plunger cup by slowly pressing down the plunger to generate a good seal and excellent suction.</li>
<li>Should you still experience a slow drain, consider plunging more, and this time around, use more force.</li>
<li>If the seal between the plunger cup and basin is not healthy, apply some petroleum jelly around the lip of the cup. This will help create a better seal.</li>
<li>Flush the drain with hot, soapy water. Hot soapy water will help dissolve and clear stuck soap scum and even fat/grease in the sink drain</li>
<li>If plunging doesnt seem to unclog the sink or toilet, consider using a drain snake or seek professional plumbing services.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scorpions are a pest that will come out regularly in the desert areas of the United States (especially the southwestern regions).
<strong>So, we just today found such a scorpion in our neighbor&rsquo;s <a href="/posts/house-lizard-lifespan/">house</a>. So I&rsquo;m wondering if there could be more around.�</strong>
<strong>My answer is that this will depend on the location and region that you found this scorpion  - which means where you live.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-i-found-one-scorpion-in-my-house-could-there-be-more">Details: I Found One Scorpion In My House? Could There Be More?</h2>
<p>My detailed response on whether there could be more than one scorpion in a house is that it depends on the location; the weather, the terrain, and the climate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other factors that will affect the number of scorpions that may have entered your house is if your neighborhood and yard are an excellent habitat for the pests.
So if the conditions and location are right, your area and your house could experience the manifestation of more than one scorpion.
For specific directions, scorpions will mainly love shady, dry, and hot areas.</li>
<li>This is because scorpions love hunting in darkness and they grow best with heat.
So if you are neighboring or country that has arid weather, and also a location that has many insects, and bugs, then you might experience many scorpions on your property.
Besides, if there are any massive ground-digging or unearthing activities going on in the surrounding, then the scorpions may flee from the old ground into your house for safety - just like the
Bearded Dragons
.</li>
<li>So even in your new house, all structures could be infested by scorpions escaping dangers from a construction or unearthing site.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV-x46Qy30I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV-x46Qy30I</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scorpion-species-and-their-biting">Scorpion Species and their Biting</h2>
<p>First, scorpions are considered to be social animals and won&rsquo;t pose a major threat to humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are scorpions really dangerous? Scorpions are not dangerous but they are non-venomous.
But the scorpion bites will be painful and leave some swelling that&rsquo;s comparable to what you get with a bee sting.
But elderly people and kids could experience relatively worse effects from the scorpion venom.
However, for any human that is bitten by a scorpion, medical experts advise you to talk to a doctor for a prescription and advice.
Scorpions do not love staying around humans and so they could have gotten there just by accident.
These animals will only bite humans during the panic in situations like when you crush them as they&rsquo;re hiding in clothes, gloves, or shoes.
So if you&rsquo;ve seen a scorpion in the house, it will be great to inspect the dark areas for the presence - at least to avoid a scorpion sting.

<h2 id="scorpions-are-social-animals">Scorpions Are Social Animals</h2>
<p>Depending on the species, most spiders are described as social animals.
But this will also vary with the local environment such as your yard or neighborhood and how inviting it is.
So, if you&rsquo;re home earlier has many scorpions, it will require extensive energy to eradicate them all within a short time.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because there could be many other scorpion eggs in the dark places waiting to hatch.
Preventing or repelling the scorpions from your house, especially in the scorpion-dense areas, will only push them to the yard or the neighbor&rsquo;s house.
So, it is good practice to alert all the neighbors to enable the scorpion prevention or control to be more widespread (broad) and effective.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scorpion-proofing-methods">Scorpion Proofing Methods</h2>
<p>In this section, I will outline the measures that can be used to scorpion-proof your house.</p>
<h3 id="a-remove-or-control-bugs">a. Remove or Control Bugs</h3>
<p>First I advise that you remove or control insects and pests that are within the house surroundings which may include flies, moths, crickets, and beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are the creatures that scorpions use as food and so removing them repels scorpions.
To repel the insects and pests, apply effective and environment-friendly insecticides to act as a barrier for the house.
Father, for the basement, doors, and windows, you should use an indoor pesticide that is non-hazardous to kill the pests and insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-maintain-the-yard-properly">b. Maintain the Yard Properly</h3>
<p>Scorpions get into your house by first hiding in the yard.
So you must keep a well-organized and tidy garden or yard since this will help keep scorpions off your house.
Scorpions get dehydrated regularly and will hide in the cool and shady areas of your yard to avoid exposure to sun and heat in the daytime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim the trees and bushes provide the overgrowth touching the house</li>
<li>Declutter the yard by removing excessive leaves and wood stacks.</li>
<li>Avoid over-watering the garden or yard by inspecting a water system.</li>
<li>Trim the garden or yard grass

</ul>
<h3 id="c-remove-debris-and-seal-the-house">c. Remove Debris and Seal the House</h3>
<p>For the house, you should remove the debris to keep it clean so that it doesn&rsquo;t hide insects and scorpions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove debris from the basements, bathroom, and kitchen.
Seal the entrance that the scorpions can use to gain access to the house. These openings may include ceiling fan openings, wall cracks, light switches, windows, and doors.</li>
<li>Inspect for more openings on the porch, patio, attic, and basement.
To sell the openings and trucks you can use expandable foam, sealers, fillers, silicone caulk, and concrete caulk.
When the windows and doors are not in use we should keep them sealed or shot.
As noted earlier, scorpions will regularly experience loss of moisture when either outdoors or indoors and so you should remove any moisture, standing water, or water puddles.</li>
<li>Keep the backyard area leakage free and dry since this will help repel the scorpions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-install-scorpion-traps">d. Install Scorpion Traps</h3>
<p>The next step will be installing some suitable rat or mice traps in the house to trap scorpions - oor use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-cages-for-bearded-dragons/">dragon cages</a>
.
Place them around water sources and the entryway and dark areas such as the closet and furnishings.</p>
<ul>
<li>But remember that the sticky pest traps could have toxic chemicals such as hazardous pesticides.
You can also deter the scorpions by using essential oils such as cinnamon, peppermint, tea tree, lavender, and cedar.
Spray the water-diluted essential oil in the basement, windows, doorways, and other similar entry points.</li>

<h2 id="is-drain-cleaner-acid-or-base---blocked-drains">Is drain cleaner acid or base? - Blocked <a href="/posts/best-shower-drain-cleaner/">Drains</a>?</h2>
<p>Drains could become clogged
from various substances, the most common ones being insoluble solids. Examples include hair, tree roots, and leaves, as well as other solid substances.</p>
<p>Other common causes of drain blockage include food particles. These range from oils and fats that mix with grease and then solidify on the inner surfaces of the drain. Other food materials such as flour, fine-grain cereals, tea bags, and even scum from soaps could cause drain blockages.</p>
<p>The last common cause of clogged drains (
how to snake the drain
) is dirt or corrosion of the drainage system. This especially happens in drain systems that are not regularly maintained, or ones made up of cheap, corrosive materials which easily attract mineral buildup.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-of-the-most-common-drain-cleaners">What Are Some Of The Most Common Drain Cleaners?</h2>
<p>As we have already mentioned,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a>
can be divided into either acids or bases. Common acids include Hydrochloric acid [HCL] and Sulphuric acid [H2SO4]. The following are some of the most popular bases that can be used as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/">drain cleaners</a>

<p>Sodium Hypochlorite [NaClO],</p>

<h2 id="distinguish-an-acidic-and-a-basic-drain-cleaner">Distinguish An Acidic And A Basic Drain Cleaner?</h2>
<p>Before we get to distinguishing between the acidity and the basicity of drain cleaners, it is important to begin easy by understanding what these terms are.</p>
<p>Acid refers to a sour-tasting, corrosive substance that turns litmus paper red. On the other hand, a base refers to any substance that when reacted with an acid, gives water and salt as the only products.</p>
<p>Basic drain cleaners are mostly those whose chemical formulae end in O or OH. When the last letter is an O, it basically means the substance is an oxide.</p>
<p>When used as a drain cleaner, such substances mainly get rid of the blockage through oxidation. On the other hand, the drain cleaners with chemical formulae ending in OH are also known as alkalis. They are bases that easily dissolve in water, and are often recommended for that very trait.</p>
<p>In order to distinguish between an acidic and a basic drain cleaner, you may need to apply your knowledge of the pH scale. pH, which stands for the power of hydrogen refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions in a substance or compound. The pH scale has values ranging from 0 to 14.</p>
<p>On this scale, cleaners with values closer to 0 are considered strong acids with values closer to but not greater than 7 considered weak acids.</p>
<p>On the other hand, strong bases are located on the opposite end of the spectrum, usually assigned values between 12 and 14. Weak bases are located closer to but not less than 7. Compounds with a value of 7 are considered to be neutral, with water being a common example.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-choose-an-ideal-drain-cleaner">How Do You Choose An Ideal Drain Cleaner?</h2>
<p>Whether basic or acidic, there are certain factors you should put into consideration when choosing your ideal cleaner.</p>
<p>Obviously, you need a drain cleaner that is effective at unclogging all manner of drains. The effectiveness of a drain cleaner will depend on the acidity or alkalinity of the substances primarily clogging your drains.</p>
<p>The cleaner should be able to deal with all manner of blockages, from soapy residues to oils and fats, as well as grease and various protein-based deposits.</p>
<p>You might also want to go for a cleaner that, besides unclogging your drains, also kills fungi, bacteria, and other harmful microorganisms that could potentially be hazardous to the drains.</p>
<p>Another point of consideration is the bleaching and deodorant effects of the drain cleaner. A cleaning agent like sodium bicarbonate is lauded for its great deodorant effects while
sodium hypochlorite has bleaching and insect-killing
properties.</p>
<p>You might also want a drain cleaner that is fairly available. Availability has direct effects on the overall cost of such cleaners. However, when looking for high-end drain cleaners, cost should come at the very bottom of your list of factors to consider.</p>
<p>Last but not least, insist on drain cleaners that leave minimal damage to the environment. First, it should be a cleaner that does not cause any allergic reactions to you, your kids, or even your pets.</p>
<p>Sulphuric acid has been shown to cause damage to PVC pipes. That does not only make them less cost-effective, but the damage could see toxic gases released into the environment.</p>
<p>As a result, you could suffer from respiratory or cardiovascular diseases, not to mention the increase in carbon footprint.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whether you go for acidic or basic drain cleaners, remember that your choice of the most ideal one depends on what you are looking for in a cleaner. Thankfully, there are lots of cleaners in the market, each coming with its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>As the user, be sure to read carefully on the ingredients as well as how to use a drain cleaner. Especially pay attention to any caution notes. This will help avoid any accidents like corrosion. And at the very least, always have protective gear when using any drain cleaner.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ortho Home <a href="/posts/best-crossbow-for-self-defense/">Defense</a> (Dual-Action) is one of the top
bed bug sprays
we recommend for you. The aerosol spray insecticide is specifically designed to kill bed bugs in your indoor spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its active ingredients are Imidacloprid (0.05%), n-Octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide (1.00%), and 2-dimethyl-3-(2-methylprop-1-enyl) Cyclopropanecarboxylate.</li>
<li>You can use this insecticide as a spot treatment around or on your mattress seams, luggage, carpets, suitcases, or bed frames. So, let&rsquo;s get down to the review.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Ortho Home Defense Dual-Action Bed Bug Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1review-summary">#1:�Review Summary</h2>
<p>Ortho Home Defense Dual-Action is a fast-acting (and long-lasting)
formula to defend your home or office space from bed bugs
, brown dog ticks, and�fleas.
I found it great to treat even large areas and
kill the pyrethroid-resistant bed bugs
, including their eggs and larvae. Ortho Home Defense comes in 2 convention sizes.
Luckily, the spray formula will dry fast, it&rsquo;s unscented, and non-staining to clothes, linen, or fabrics (water-resistant fabrics).
<strong>Unique Features:�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to spray into crevices and wall cracks that are often difficult to reach</li>
<li>Has a quick knock-down effect - with its fast-acting formula</li>
<li>An excellent�spottreatment for the household bed bugs</li>
<li>Delivered in either the�3-ounce or the 18-ounce convenient cans
The Good:</li>
<li>Quick-knockdown effect</li>
<li>Good forbed bug prevention and killing�throughcontact</li>
<li>Kills even�the insecticide-resistant bed bugs</li>
<li>Has the�3-ounce pack that&rsquo;s travel convenient</li>
<li>Has a mild and non-irritating smell.</li>
<li>Great for use on clothes and furniture�finishes
The Bad:</li>
<li>Labourious to apply
<strong>Caution:�</strong>
Leave the area you&rsquo;ve sprayed for about 3 to 4 hours. This allows the spray to dry and thus avoid poisoning your kids, or
pets such as cats and dogs
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-my-detailed-review">#2: My Detailed Review</h2>
<h3 id="1-ultra-fast-acting-formula">1. Ultra-fast-acting formula</h3>
<p>Ortho Home Defense Dual-Action has a quick knock-down effect (kills within minutes) against
bed bugs
and other crawling insects - and thus, it can be classified as an ultra-fast-acting insecticide.
The insecticide is both a contact-killing and spot treatment formula. Therefore, this will ensure that the
bed bugs won&rsquo;t come back to your living
spaces.
However, Ortho Home Defense has high potency, which means that it might not be very
safe around kids or pets
. Therefore, you must clean the sprayed areas sometime after treating your home for bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="2-odorless-and-non-staining-on-clothes-and-furniture">2. Odorless and Non-staining on clothes and Furniture</h3>
<p>Ortho Home Defense will be safe to use on your furniture since it will not damage or stain the furniture&rsquo;s finishes in your home.
Further, the spray may be considered odorless but has a little smell that most humans and pets will not find irritating. Also, it comes in both travel and regular sizes that are convenient.
Despite being super powerful against household bed bugs, this spray won&rsquo;t hurt the environment, including producing dangerous fumes.
However, some fabrics or clothes might not be compatible with this spray, and thus you might need to undertake some cleaning after
bed bug treatment
.</p>
<h3 id="3-exterminates-even-pesticide-resistant-bed-bugs">3. Exterminates even Pesticide-Resistant Bed bugs</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re dealing with bed bugs that have developed immunity against various pesticides (as noted by
<a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130314-bedbug-insecticide-resistance-pest-science/">National Geographic</a>
), then Ortho Home Defense is an excellent solution for you.
From the onset,�Ortho comes out as a highly reliable manufacturer of
pest control
solutions. Equally, this
roach spray brand will kill
even�stink bugs,�dust mites,�and fleas.</p>
<h2 id="3-my-experience">#3: My Experience:</h2>
<h3 id="1-is-ortho-home-defense-kid-and-pet-safe">1. Is Ortho Home Defense kid and pet safe?</h3>
<p>Ortho Home Defense and its active ingredients are EPA-registered and safe to use around for yourself, your kids, and pets such as cats and dogs. However, please don&rsquo;t use it around aquatic life like fish.
However, I haven&rsquo;t experienced many people who&rsquo;ve been poisoned by
Ortho Home Defense. However, realize that�deltamethrin may be�neurotoxic or irritate your skin.
I found this spray great for safely treating the covering of the traveling luggage as a spot treatment. Further, it&rsquo;s safe for treating mattress seams, furniture, and carpets.
In summary,
Ortho Home Defense will be safe to use around your kids and pets, but you must not use it near aquatic life like fish.</p>
<h3 id="2-has-a-2-weeks-residue-effect">2. Has a 2-weeks residue effect</h3>
<p>Ortho Home Defense (dual-action) has a long residue effect of about two weeks. Further, some other customers note that this spray formula will have 7-10 days or residue effect.
However, the manufacturer also recommends that you spray regularly. For example,
Ortho states that you begin with the daily application before going to 2-3 times spraying per week.
Finally, you can now spray weekly or once every two weeks. Therefore, you can use
bed bug spray to both protect and kill
the pests.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s a Pure Lye Drain Opener Review - I am here in my basement, and the sink drain has been clogged for a few weeks. Definitely, the sink now has serious stuff such as oils, grease, and debris. I can already smell the bad odor since the water has been standing for a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this post, Ill be going through tips on using the Pure LyeDrain Openerto unclog slow-moving drains.</li>
<li>However, the caveat is that this cleaner, despite being among the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">top drain cleaners</a>,�is not as effective on a totally clogged drain. However, you can use it tounclog a bathtub that has standing water.
<strong>Precautions</strong>
: Ensure you wear disposable rubber gloves and safety goggles while ensuring that the rooms are adequately ventilated.

</ul>
<h2 id="natural-drain-cleaner"><strong>Natural drain cleaner�</strong></h2>
<p>The Pure Lye Drain Opener is a pure white formula that is a natural remedy for your clogged drain and sewer full of odor. Pure Lye allows you to do away with the pungent vapors and fumes that come from a
clogged drain
. Its safe to use either in restaurants, hospitals, educational institutions, and households.
I noticed that the finely shaped and small lye beads work great for PVC and metal pipes, chrome trims, and bath fixtures. The green/ eco-friendly clog remover contains almost 100% biodegradable formula with no bad odors, toxic chemicals, acids, or dyes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chOsY3ynFDE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chOsY3ynFDE</a></p>
<h2 id="works-in-all-drain-types">Works in all drain types</h2>
<p>Pure Lye
Drain Opener is powerful enough
to unclog quickly�(in about 15  30 minutes) all types of septic systems, sewer lines, sinks drains, and shower/ bathtub drains. Also, make sure you pour some hot or warm water down the drain so that you warm (or almost there) the pipes. This will make the lye cleaner function better by quickly activating it.
Youll require to begin with just a few lye tablespoons, and when the water starts going down, you can now add some more over the clogged drain. Finally, pour some hot or warm water to dissolve the lye and activate it.
Now allow the lye to work on the clogged drain for about 15 - 30 minutes. Definitely, some cracking sounds will be coming off the clogged
drain as the lye cleaner
does its work. Finally, pour additional hot water to clean the slow-moving drain fully.</p>
<h2 id="is-lye-drain-cleaner-safe-for-pipes">Is lye drain cleaner safe for pipes?</h2>
<p>Lye (in chemical terms described as caustic soda/ sodium hydroxide) is considered a reliable drain clog remover. However, some homeowner has understandable fears that it would be too powerful for drain pipes. This is because the chemical is also used on an industrial scale for a cleaning agent or different purposes.
However, to settle this debate, I have to say that this lye
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner</a>
could corrode your pipes if you dont use the right concentration (as described in the product label instructions). Therefore, it will be helpful if you use the right concentration to protect your plumbing systems.</p>
<h3 id="polyvinyl-chloride-pvc-pipes"><strong>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes�</strong></h3>
<p>PVC pipes are made from some form of thermoplastic polymer that is cheap and strong enough to withstand weather changes and some chemicals in your plumbing system.
Also, PVC will not react with most chemicals and is light, which implies that the lye clog remover wont corrode its pipes.�To get a great glimpse of such reactions, check this
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/">guide on how drain cleaners work</a>
.</p>
<h4 id="corrosive-to-metal-pipes-">**Corrosive to metal pipes? **</h4>
<p>Although PVC pipes can resist corrosion from the lye chemical, weve noted that its important to avoid very high concentrations beyond the recommendation on the product label instructions.
Also, lye can corrode some metals due to its caustic nature. You must also not mix the lye drain cleaner with different chemicals like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/drano-max-gel-clog-remover-review/">Drano Max Gel Clog Remover</a>
.</p>
<h4 id="caustic-lye"><strong>Caustic Lye�</strong></h4>
<p>As noted above, lye is a caustic alkali base with its pH being 7.0 or more. Therefore, despite not being an acid, a strong chemical concentration would still corrode the PVC pipes. Notably, some of the lye cleaners will be mixed with different quantities of aluminum.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I outline how I cleared my sink drain blockage that had persisted even with clear pipes.
<strong>But first, I narrate my sad story.�</strong>
<em>I was almost going insane due to the bathroom sink that had blocked for about a week. My kids and I had already started using a basin to take our shower. ????</em></p>
<ul>
<li>*By this time, I had called my plumber numerous times, but he was not available as it was Christmas times. My plumbing snake, drain cleaners, and hot water, the wet-dry vacuum cleaner was not working. *</li>
<li><em>I had disconnected the u-bend under the sink and tried using a wire coat hanger to clear any drain clog, all with no success.�</em>
**Summary: Assuming that the waste line sits at a small decline, youll need to solve a possible airflow issue�for your vent stack. This will keep neutral air pressure (prevent negative or positive pressure). **
<strong>Thus, wastewater will flow down the drain with the help of gravity. You should know that the toilet waste line and the sink waste lines are connected at their vent stack.�</strong>

</ul>
<h2 id="sink-not-draining-but-pipes-clear">Sink Not Draining But Pipes Clear</h2>
<p>My issue was that maybe I had a more significant problem because, in the previous three months, I had just miraculously
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">unclogged�my stubborn bathtub that had standing water</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-vent-stack-where-is-it-and-how-can-i-checkfix-it">What is vent stack? Where is it, and how can I check/fix it?</h3>
<p>Vent stack blocked? The gurgling sound usually means it is starving for air. Without venting, the flush operation would act as a vacuum and would not properly flush.
The vent stack is usually hidden behind the wall. It is a vertical pipe to which all the <a href="/posts/how-to-unclog-a-bathroom-sink-drain/">drains</a> along with that line tie into. Check the toilet too to make sure there is no partial blockage. Does the sink do anything funny also?
<strong>Check if the vent stack opening up on the roof?�</strong>
Maybe yes? It is a black pipe that extends past the roof and is open at the top allowing rain to enter. So perhaps some rain froze on the lip and is restricting the opening of the pipe.
I have the same problem since installing new efficient flush toilets. If a vacuum created could cause p-traps to dry out or the toilet bowl level to drop when not in use? ( no leaks).
Raps should NEVER be dry!! Sewer gases can enter your home. In general, if there is a vacuum in the line, it can suck the water out of your traps and drop the toilet water level.

      <description>Finding a decent</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a decent
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaner</a>
is difficult. Most options on the market are far too expensive. And those that you can afford are often limited in the functions they can perform.
So you have to purchase multiple types and brands of drain cleaners to sufficiently cater to your homes entire plumbing system.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-thethrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner">+What is the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/THRIFT-T-600-Alkaline-Granular-Cleaner/dp/B00E1N09JO?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=2b4aec92d6fd01239eb8ccd0c93edf67&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner</a>?</h2>
<p>Thrift T-600 is an acid-free drain cleaner. In other words, it can eliminate the organic matter that clogs your <a href="/posts/best-drain-cleaner/">drains</a> without using acidic components.
The Thrift T-600 cleaner stands out because it provides four
cleaning solutions
where other <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> cleaners only cater to one or two disparate issues.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner">+Why You Need the Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner?</h2>
<p>Clogging is unavoidable. Human activity is designed to produce the sort of waste that debilitates a plumbing system&rsquo;s functions. You can neither prevent nor guard against clogging.
Every time you shower, you shed hair. This is particularly problematic if you live in a home with multiple women. But even if the hair wasnt a problem, any bath you take will probably involve soap, shampoo, or some detergent.</p>
<p>Soap scum and bath oils are common causes of clogging. The same can be said for the grease that pours down the drain of your kitchen sink every time you wash your plates after a scrumptious dinner.
Over time, all that grease and soap scum and hair and bath oils will accumulate to create blockages. The symptoms are difficult to miss. You will notice that the water in your
sink drains
slower than usual and that the drain even spits back food particles every once in a while.
If you allow the situation to deteriorate without taking action, your drains will stop working altogether.
Now, people are quick to reach out to plumbers who often waste no time in opening all the pipes and deploying their drain snakes whenever this happens.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/">Drain cleaners</a>
like the Thrift T-600 generally make all that chaos unnecessary. If you hate the mess that the unclogging process attracts, you can pour a drain cleaner down your pipes and sewers and then sit back and wait for it to do all the work.
It sounds like a lazy approach to the problem, but it works. You dont really need any technical plumbing knowledge. Anyone can deploy the Thrift T-600 Drain cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner-do">+What Does the Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner Do?</h2>
<p>The Thrift T-600 cleaner comes in a 6-pound bottle filled with dry, odorless crystals. To deploy the cleaner, pour the crystals down the drain and then pour hot water.
The hot water will activate the crystals, and the crystals will liquefy all the hair and the grease clogging your drains.
It is that simple. There are no unique drain snakes required, no plumbers that you need to hire to dismantle and re-configure your pipes.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-the-thrift-t-600-drain-cleaner-so-special">+What Makes the Thrift T-600 Drain Cleaner so Special?</h2>
<h3 id="-pros">+ Pros</h3>
<p>1). You can find plenty of drain cleaners on the market that works on either sewer lines, grease traps, septic systems, or drains. But this product applies to all four areas. Drain cleaners are rarely that multi-functional.
2). The cleaner works so quickly. Expect results in as little as sixty seconds. This is as opposed to other products that require several hours.
3). Despite its efficacy as a drain cleaner that eats hair and grease, the Thrift T-600 will only affect organic matter. It wont eat acrylic, fiberglass, or any other delicate components. As such, you can use it on kitchen and bathroom surfaces without worry.
4). The drain cleaner is not disruptive. Whereas many other drain cleaners produce dangerous fumes, this one doesnt even have much odor. So you can use it in hospitals, schools and the like without causing distress.
5). The product is straightforward to use. Just pour the crystals and then add hot water.
6). The crystal format makes the drain cleaner safer to use.</p>
<h3 id="-cons">+ Cons</h3>
<p>1). The drain cleaner is quite expensive.
2). Even though it is supposed to be less disruptive, the drain cleaner still produces toxic vapors when it is in use. If you come too close to the drain, the vapor will irritate your eyes and nose.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner-work-on-toilets">+Does, the Thrift T-600 Alkaline, Based Drain Cleaner Work on Toilets?</h2>
<p>This product works so well that it is easy to see why some people might be tempted to use it in their toilet. But the drain cleaner only activates when hot water is applied.
So even if you got the crystals in place, you have no way of running hot water over them in a toilet. More importantly, even the packaging warns you against using the drain cleaner on toilet bowls and garbage disposals.
That being said, if you have the plumbing experience and can afford to pull the toilet up, the Thrift T-600 could work for you.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">+Verdict</h2>
<p>Drain Cleaners might be a dime a dozen today, but it is easy to see why this one draws so much attention.
You wont find that many drain cleaners on the market that come in crystal format, only require hot water to activate, and can liquefy hair and grease in 60 seconds without ruining your polished brass, porcelain, and chrome trim, plastic, or even the metal pipes.</p>
