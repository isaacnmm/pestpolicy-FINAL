<h3 id="1-chemical-treatments"><strong>1. Chemical Treatments</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-chemical-treatments">¶</a></h3>
<p>Usually, insect sprays that don&rsquo;t contain chemicals as their active ingredients are regarded as the best remedies. The chemical treatments that you use indoors may not necessarily work effectively outdoors since the weather conditions are different.
You will also find that treatments that you use outdoors vary in their effectiveness.�Therefore chemical treatments work effectively when applied to their specific environments.
As an example, Methoprene won&rsquo;t be effective when used in direct sunlight, since UV rays usually break it down. It&rsquo;s, however, effective where there is shade. Therefore, when buying insect killers, make sure it is ideal for the specific outdoor conditions in your yard.
Also, look for chemical treatments that contain the most effective active ingredients in the market. Products that contain pyrethrin prove to very effective in destroying insects throughout their stages of the lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="2-non-chemical-treatments"><strong>2. Non-Chemical Treatments</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-non-chemical-treatments">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are many eco-friendly options to choose from if you are conscious about the environment. These are organic products that will help you eradicate ticks, fleas, and other insects while protecting your family, pets, and the environment.
Clove extract and peppermint are among the most popular natural ingredients inherent in organic insect sprays. Clove extract contains eugenol, a potent pesticide for eradicating ticks and fleas.
When you use organic products, you will be in an excellent position to repel other pesky insects like mosquitoes. The scent of some of these products is quite unbearable for mosquitoes.
Other available natural remedies include the use of beneficial nematodes, which are little worms-like bugs sold in spray cans. They release toxic substances capable of killing ticks and fleas. They don&rsquo;t pose any threat to humans or animals.

<p>To ensure the safety of your family, animals, and pets, it&rsquo;s advisable to buy organic insect treatments because they don&rsquo;t contain any toxic substances.
In case you prefer chemical treatments, go for products that are less dangerous to use around kids and pets.
Besides, opt for chemical treatments that dry quickly from the time of application. This makes the residues less dangerous to kids and pets. More importantly, follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions carefully and keep the products away from kids and pets.</p>
