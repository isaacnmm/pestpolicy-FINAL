      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the right lawn care provider is a significant decision for any homeowner looking to achieve a healthy, vibrant lawn. <a href="/posts/spring-green-lawn-care/">Spring</a> Green and TruGreen are two of the most prominent names in the industry, each offering a range of services with distinct operational models. This detailed comparison will delve into their costs, plans, customer experiences, and availability to help you make an informed choice.</p>
<h2 id="1-cost">1. Cost</h2>
<p><a href="/posts/spring-lawn-care-guide/">Lawn</a> care pricing is highly individualized, depending on factors such as your lawn&rsquo;s size (measured in square footage or acreage), your geographic location, the specific services you select, and any promotional offers. The figures below are <strong>estimates for an average-sized residential lawn</strong>, based on recent industry data. Always obtain a direct quote for your specific property.</p>
<h3 id="spring-green">Spring Green:</h3>
<p>As a franchise-based company, Spring Green&rsquo;s pricing can exhibit some regional variation depending on the local owner&rsquo;s operational costs and market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual Cost Range:</strong> For basic to comprehensive plans, you can generally expect to pay between <strong>$500 and $2,000 per year</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Lawn Care (Fertilization &amp; Weed Control):</strong> Roughly <strong>$500�$1,200 annually</strong> for small to mid-sized lawns.</li>
<li><strong>With Add-ons (e.g., Aeration, Pest Control, Disease Prevention):</strong> Costs can climb towards the higher end of the range, often <strong>$1,200�$2,000+ per year</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Per Service/Application Estimates:</strong> While not always explicitly published, individual fertilization and weed control applications might start from around <strong>$50 per service</strong>, with add-ons like aeration costing approximately <strong>$75�$100 per application</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trugreen">TruGreen:</h3>
<p>As the largest national provider, TruGreen often has more standardized pricing, though still adjusted for local market conditions and lawn size. They frequently offer attractive introductory rates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual Cost Range:</strong> TruGreen&rsquo;s annual plans typically range from <strong>$640 to $1,500 per year</strong> for an average-sized lawn. More comprehensive plans or larger lawns can push the cost up to <strong>$2,000 annually or more</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Plans (e.g., TruMaintenance for Weed Control + Fertilization):</strong> Start around <strong>$640�$730 per year</strong>.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Per Service/Application Estimates (for a 5,000 sq. ft. lawn):</strong>

<h2 id="5-faqs">5. FAQs:</h2>
<h3 id="q1-how-do-i-get-an-accurate-price-quote-for-my-specific-lawn">Q1: How do I get an accurate price quote for my specific lawn?</h3>
<p>A1: The most accurate way to get pricing is to contact both Spring Green and TruGreen directly through their websites or by phone. They will typically ask for your address (to measure your lawn via satellite) and discuss your specific needs to provide a personalized quote.</p>
<h3 id="q2-are-the-products-used-by-spring-green-and-trugreen-safe-for-pets-and-children">Q2: Are the products used by Spring Green and TruGreen safe for pets and children?</h3>
<p>A2: Both companies utilize products that are generally considered safe for pets and children once they have dried. This is a standard practice in the industry. It&rsquo;s always advisable to keep pets and children off the treated area until the product is completely dry, which usually takes a few hours. Always ask your technician for specific re-entry times for the products applied to your lawn.</p>
<h3 id="q3-how-long-does-it-typically-take-to-see-noticeable-improvements-in-my-lawn">Q3: How long does it typically take to see noticeable improvements in my lawn?</h3>
<p>A3: The timeline for results varies based on your lawn&rsquo;s current condition, the specific treatments applied, and environmental factors like weather. For basic fertilization and weed control, you might start seeing a greener lawn and fewer weeds within a few weeks. However, significant, long-term improvements in lawn health and density typically become evident after a full season of consistent treatments (usually 4-6 months).</p>
<h3 id="q4-do-i-need-to-be-home-when-the-technicians-visit-my-property">Q4: Do I need to be home when the technicians visit my property?</h3>
<p>A4: In most cases, you do not need to be home for the technicians to perform their services. As long as they have unobstructed access to your lawn (e.g., gates unlocked, pets secured), they can complete the treatment. You will usually receive a service summary or a bill notification after the visit, often via email or a note left on your door.</p>
<h3 id="q5-what-if-im-not-satisfied-with-a-service-or-the-results">Q5: What if I&rsquo;m not satisfied with a service or the results?</h3>
<p>A5:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TruGreen:</strong> Offers a <strong>&ldquo;Healthy Lawn Guarantee.&rdquo;</strong> If you are on an annual plan and not satisfied with a treatment, they will gladly revisit your property between scheduled visits to make necessary adjustments at no additional cost.</li>
<li><strong>Spring Green:</strong> As a franchise, their satisfaction policy is handled at the local level. Most reputable Spring Green franchises are committed to customer satisfaction and will work with you to address any concerns and re-treat as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to understand the specific guarantee and re-treatment policy of the company you choose before signing a contract.</p>
