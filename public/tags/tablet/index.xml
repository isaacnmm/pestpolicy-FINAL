<h2 id="buyers-guide-for-best-laptop-tablet-combo">Buyer&rsquo;s Guide For Best Laptop Tablet Combo</h2>
<h3 id="1-laptop-combos-story">1. Laptop combos story</h3>
<p>Despite their exponential growth in popularity, not all laptop-tablet combos are made equal or match up perfectly to either their laptop or tablet counterparts.
Dont get me wrong here: Nothing trumps having the best of both worlds at your fingertips, but laptop-tablet combos can be rather clunky as tablet replacements or too slow and weak for today&rsquo;s laptops.</p>
<ul>
<li>While some come with all the trending designer-centric embellishments, some are totally lacking on that front.</li>
<li>That is why you really need to spend some time going over the available options and do an excellent job at comparison-shopping before putting your money down.
Some of the undesirable aspects that characterize some laptop-tablet combo options on the market when compared to either laptops or tablets include:
Pros:</li>
<li>Insufficient and in-expandable RAM</li>
<li>Rigid viewing angle</li>
<li>Lower Processor speeds</li>
<li>Overheating
Cons:</li>
<li>Too heavy</li>
<li>Compromised functionality</li>
<li>Too big
?
Lets get one thing clear:ï¿½You need to understand the terminology used to refer to options on the market before you can isolate the best laptop-tablet combo for your needs.</li>
<li>Though often used interchangeably, the terms hybrid and convertible refer to two distinct designs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-hybrid">2. Hybrid</h3>
<p>A hybrid (also known as detachable-hybrid) is generally a laptop that features a removable screen.
In such a scenario, the screen typically has full computing capabilities and its own power source to ensure that it continues to function even while detached from the chassis and keyboard or dock.</p>
<h3 id="3-convertible">3. Convertible</h3>
<p>A convertible (also known as convertible-hybrid) is some form of transformer as it can be folded back to transform from being a laptop into a handheld rectangular tablet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some feature a keyboard that can be easily flipped behind the screen. This design is best for you if you wish to have the keyboard with you at all times.
Consider the intended use -ï¿½Whatever your intended use of the product, some of the basic desirable traits in the best laptop-tablet combos include more battery power, processing speed, and less weight.
It goes without saying that the processor speed and the size of the RAM are important points that must appeal to the intended use of the product.</li>
<li>Apart from issues to do with the specific specs of the options on your shortlist, you also have to consider the aesthetic appeal.</li>
<li>The best-selling laptop-tablet combos are gifted with some of the sleekest and most vibrant designs and colors to choose from.
There are also a few subtle and not-so-subtle design differences that you have to consider, such as whether you want to go for one with a detachable screen or a 360-degree hinge.
We understand: Sifting through the myriad options to find the best match for your requirement, whether general use, business, gaming, school, or any combination thereof, is a task easier said than done.</li>
<li>Hope this piece on some of the best laptop-tablet combos available today goes a long way in helping you zero in on the best pick.</li>
<li>However, neither seems able to withstand the rampaging advancements driven by<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10447310801920524?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">ever-changing and increasing customer demands and tastes</a>.
To make your shopping easier, list all the desirable specs and make a decision on whether you want to go for a fully-detachable option or a convertible.
Dont let the details confuse you like the specs of all convertibles and detachable follow the same format as those of standard laptops.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are shopping on a budget, also offers used options that are still in mint and near-mint condition at heavily discounted prices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the product page of your Best Laptop Tablet Combo and check below the main product name and customer reviews for used and refurbished options.
You can also get in touch with the seller to get your questions answered such as the possibility of upgrading from HDD to SSD.</li>
