<h3 id="1-boss-oc-3-super-octave"><strong>1. BOSS OC-3 Super Octave <a href="/posts/best-bass-compressor-pedal/">Pedal</a> for Guitar or Bass Bundle - Our Top Pick</strong></h3>
<p>Well kickstart with this amazing and versatile OC-3 octave pedal that operates as a guitar and bass at the same time. This is one of a kind pedal that allows both the guitar and the bass and with separate responses for the two instruments.</p>
<p>Youll love the amazing sounds and various tonal controls that come from this incredible instrument. Also, the drive mode will make you fall in love more with this pedal. This application includes a few alterations to the octaves to provide you various options to experiment or try-out diverse sounds.
Most Bassists and Guitarist praise the superior octave sound effects of this pedal. To make it even more appealing, it includes 3 pre-programmed approaches for operators to select. They include Drive mode, Polyphonic Mode, and the initial OC-2 mode.
The Polyphonic Mode of this tool allows octaves to be synthesized while playing cords. The drive mode allows Additional aggressive sounds to be heard which adds some alteration to the keyed bass and guitar signal.
This pedal produces single notes octave up and two octaves down when using the guitar. However, going very low while on the bass doesnt bring positive results, so its best to maintain an upward position.
If you maintain the pitch up, the synthesized sound quality stays strong, clear, and balanced giving the bass prominence, hence improved overall sound.
An octave pedal is a powerful tool and can add a whole lot of difference in your music by improving your tone and pitch signals. With that said, lets review some of the best bass octave pedals in the market today.

Another incredible feature that makes this pedal a darling is the Mid+ switch. This switch offers additional midrange improvement to your tone irrespective of the frequency you decide on, you can play up to 15dB.
