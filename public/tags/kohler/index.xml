      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When selecting a new toilet, functionality, efficiency, and comfort are paramount. For many, a standard-height toilet can present challenges, especially for taller individuals, the elderly, or those with mobility issues. <a href="/posts/kohler-rethinks-bathroom-medicine-cabinets-with-maxstow-model/">Kohler</a>, a renowned leader in plumbing fixtures, addresses this need with its <strong>Highline Arc Extra Tall Toilet</strong>. Part of their bestselling Highline family, this model combines Kohler&rsquo;s reputation for quality with an elevated design focused on enhanced accessibility and powerful flushing.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Extra Tall&rdquo; feature distinguishes this toilet from standard or even &ldquo;Comfort Height&rdquo; models, providing an even more accessible seating option. Coupled with the Highline Arc&rsquo;s distinctive design and efficient flushing technology, it aims to deliver a superior user experience. Let&rsquo;s explore the features, benefits, and considerations of the Kohler Highline Arc Extra Tall Toilet to help you determine if it&rsquo;s the right choice for your bathroom.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-extra-tall-advantage-beyond-comfort-height">The &ldquo;Extra Tall&rdquo; Advantage: Beyond Comfort Height</h2>
<p>Kohler offers a range of toilet heights to cater to diverse user needs. While &ldquo;Comfort Height&rdquo; (or chair height) toilets typically sit around 16.5 to 17.5 inches from the floor to the top of the bowl (without the seat), the <strong>Highline Arc Extra Tall toilet elevates this even further, often reaching 19 inches from the floor to the top of the bowl</strong>.</p>
<p>This additional height provides a significant advantage for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taller Individuals:</strong> Minimizes the strain of bending excessively to sit down.</li>
<li><strong>Seniors:</strong> Makes sitting and standing much easier, reducing pressure on knees and hips.</li>
<li><strong>Individuals with Mobility Issues:</strong> Offers greater independence and reduces the effort required to use the toilet.</li>
<li><strong>Anyone Seeking Enhanced Comfort:</strong> Provides a more natural, chair-like seating position.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that while the &ldquo;Extra Tall&rdquo; height offers considerable comfort benefits, it may not be ideal for very short individuals or young children, who might find it too high. Always consider the primary users of the bathroom when choosing a toilet height.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="design-and-aesthetics-the-highline-arc-series">Design and Aesthetics: The Highline Arc Series</h2>
<p>The Highline Arc series is recognized for its blend of traditional styling with modern sensibilities. Key design elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elegant Flared Tank:</strong> The tank often features a distinctive, subtly flared design that gives the toilet a refined and classic yet contemporary appearance.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Piece Construction:</strong> While some Highline models may come in a one-piece design, the &ldquo;Highline Arc Extra Tall&rdquo; is typically a two-piece toilet (separate tank and bowl). This makes it generally lighter per component for easier maneuvering during installation compared to a heavy one-piece unit.</li>
<li><strong>Vitreous China Material:</strong> Like most quality toilets, it&rsquo;s crafted from vitreous china, a durable, non-porous ceramic material that is resistant to stains, scratches, and chips, making it easy to clean and maintain its pristine white (or biscuit) finish.</li>
<li><strong>Bowl Shape Options:</strong> The Highline Arc Extra Tall is commonly available with an <strong>elongated bowl</strong>, which offers added comfort and seating room compared to a round-front bowl. An elongated bowl is generally preferred in master bathrooms or larger spaces.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="flushing-power-and-water-efficiency-the-class-five-canister-flush">Flushing Power and Water Efficiency: The Class Five� Canister Flush</h2>
<p>Beneath its tall and elegant exterior, the Kohler Highline Arc Extra Tall toilet houses a powerful and efficient flushing system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class Five� Flushing Technology:</strong> This is Kohler&rsquo;s proprietary gravity-fed flushing system. It&rsquo;s designed to deliver &ldquo;virtually plug-free performance&rdquo; and superior rinsing power for a clean bowl. Key to this system is the large 3-inch canister flush valve, which creates a rapid, strong siphon for waste removal. Unlike traditional flapper systems, the canister valve rotates 360 degrees, allowing water to flow from every direction into the bowl for a powerful, consistent flush.</li>
<li><strong>WaterSense� Certified (1.28 GPF):</strong> Most Highline Arc Extra Tall models are WaterSense� certified by the EPA, meaning they use 1.28 gallons per flush (GPF) or less. This significantly reduces water consumption compared to older, less efficient toilets (which could use 3.5 GPF or more), potentially saving thousands of gallons of water per year and lowering your utility bills. Despite the low GPF, the Class Five� technology ensures that performance is not compromised.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="convenience-and-installation">Convenience and Installation</h2>
<p>Kohler often offers its Highline Arc toilets as part of their &ldquo;Complete Solution�&rdquo; package. This means that the toilet comes in a single box with everything needed for installation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bowl and Tank:</strong> The main components.</li>
<li><strong>Slow-Close Toilet Seat:</strong> A popular feature that prevents slamming and reduces wear and tear.</li>
<li><strong>Wax Ring:</strong> For sealing the toilet to the floor drain.</li>
<li><strong>Floor Hardware:</strong> Bolts and caps for securing the toilet to the floor.</li>
</ul>
<p>This &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; approach simplifies the purchasing process and ensures you have all necessary components, which is particularly beneficial for DIYers. Standard 12-inch rough-in is common, making it compatible with most existing bathroom plumbing configurations. Installation for a two-piece toilet, while requiring careful handling, is generally straightforward for those with basic plumbing knowledge or a willingness to follow instructions closely.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pros-of-the-kohler-highline-arc-extra-tall-toilet">Pros of the Kohler Highline Arc Extra Tall Toilet</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superior Comfort and Accessibility:</strong> The &ldquo;Extra Tall&rdquo; height is a standout feature, making it exceptionally easy for adults, especially taller individuals or those with mobility challenges, to sit down and stand up.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful and Efficient Flush:</strong> The Class Five� canister flush system provides robust waste removal with a single flush, while its 1.28 GPF rating ensures excellent water conservation.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable Brand Quality:</strong> Kohler is a trusted name in plumbing, known for producing durable and well-engineered products.</li>
<li><strong>Complete Solution Package:</strong> The inclusion of the seat and all necessary installation hardware simplifies the purchase and installation process.</li>
<li><strong>Clean and Modern Aesthetic:</strong> The Highline Arc&rsquo;s design is versatile, fitting well into various bathroom styles.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to Clean:</strong> The vitreous china material and the standard design make external cleaning simple.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="cons-and-considerations">Cons and Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Height May Not Suit Everyone:</strong> As mentioned, the extra height can be inconvenient for very short individuals or young children, potentially requiring a step stool.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Piece Design:</strong> While easier to maneuver piece by piece during installation, two-piece toilets do have a seam between the tank and bowl that can accumulate dust and grime, making them slightly less easy to clean than a one-piece skirted toilet.</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> While offering excellent value for a Kohler product with these features, it will typically be more expensive than basic, standard-height toilets from budget brands.</li>
<li><strong>Bowl Cleaning:</strong> Some users of high-efficiency toilets occasionally report lower water levels in the bowl, which <em>might</em> require more frequent brushing to keep the bowl perfectly clean, depending on usage.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="is-the-kohler-highline-arc-extra-tall-toilet-right-for-you">Is the Kohler Highline Arc Extra Tall Toilet Right for You?</h2>
<p>The Kohler Highline Arc Extra Tall Toilet is an excellent investment for homeowners who prioritize comfort, accessibility, and reliable flushing performance. If your household includes taller individuals, seniors, or anyone who would benefit from an easier sitting and standing experience, this toilet is a top contender. Its water-saving efficiency also makes it an environmentally conscious and cost-effective choice in the long run.</p>
<p>While it is a two-piece design, which might be a minor aesthetic compromise for some compared to sleek one-piece skirted toilets, its robust performance, durable construction, and the sheer comfort of its elevated height often outweigh this consideration. As with any plumbing fixture, ensure the rough-in measurement matches your existing setup for a smooth installation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Kohler Highline Arc Extra Tall toilet stands out as a well-engineered fixture that elevates daily comfort while delivering the powerful and efficient flushing performance that homeowners expect from a leading brand like Kohler.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For decades, the <a href="/posts/a-tour-of-chelseas-hall-bathroom-renovation/">bathroom</a> medicine cabinet has been a utilitarian staple � a simple mirrored box above the sink, designed for quick access to everyday essentials. While functional, many traditional models have been criticized for their limited storage, clunky design, and often, an inability to truly meet the diverse needs of modern households. Enter <a href="/posts/kohler-extra-tall-highline-arc-toilet/">Kohler</a>, a brand synonymous with quality bathroom fixtures, which has taken a fresh look at this humble cabinet with its innovative Maxstow model, aiming to revolutionize how we store and access our bathroom necessities.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-traditional-bathroom-medicine-cabinets">About Traditional Bathroom Medicine Cabinets</h2>
<p>Before we dive into Kohler&rsquo;s innovation, let&rsquo;s consider the conventional medicine cabinet. Typically, these units come in two main forms: recessed (set into the wall) or surface-mounted (attached to the wall&rsquo;s surface). While they offer convenient, eye-level storage, they often suffer from several limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited and Inefficient Storage:</strong> Most traditional cabinets feature a few evenly spaced, fixed shelves. This design rarely accommodates the wide range of bottle heights and item sizes found in a typical bathroom. Taller bottles often don&rsquo;t fit, leading to wasted vertical space or items being stored horizontally, creating clutter. Shorter items get lost behind taller ones.</li>
<li><strong>Shallow Depth:</strong> Many older models are quite shallow, often around 3 to 4 inches deep, making it difficult to store anything beyond small bottles or tubes. Larger items often have to sit on the countertop, defeating the purpose of the cabinet.</li>
<li><strong>Dated Aesthetics:</strong> Some traditional medicine cabinets can look bulky, &ldquo;builder-grade,&rdquo; or simply outdated, impacting the overall visual appeal of a modern bathroom. Frames can be chunky, and the overall design might not integrate seamlessly with contemporary d�cor.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Flexibility:</strong> Once installed, the internal configuration is usually fixed. There&rsquo;s little room to adapt to changing storage needs.</li>
<li><strong>Mirror Limitations:</strong> Often, the only mirror is on the exterior door, meaning when the cabinet is open, you lose your reflection, making it awkward for grooming tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Installation Challenges:</strong> While surface mount is easier, recessed cabinets require cutting into the wall, which can be a more involved and permanent alteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations often lead homeowners to seek alternative storage solutions, such as open shelving or larger vanity drawers, potentially sacrificing the convenient, hidden storage that a medicine cabinet can provide.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-kohler-revolutionized-the-bathroom-medicine-cabinet">How Kohler Revolutionized the Bathroom Medicine Cabinet</h2>
<p>Kohler&rsquo;s Maxstow medicine cabinet line directly addresses these common pain points, rethinking the internal organization and overall design to maximize utility without compromising aesthetics. Their &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; lies in smart, user-centric engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Key Innovations of the Maxstow Model:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Innovative Staggered Shelving:</strong> This is perhaps the most significant departure from traditional designs. Instead of uniformly spaced shelves, Maxstow cabinets feature a combination of full-width and partial-width shelves at varying heights. This ingenious layout allows you to store both tall items (like electric toothbrushes, hairsprays, or tall lotions) and shorter items (like contact lens cases, dental floss, or small jars) without wasted space. No more tilting bottles or squishing items!</li>
<li><strong>Slim Profile, Maximized Internal Space:</strong> Despite being noticeably slimmer than many traditional cabinets (often around 3.5 inches deep compared to 5 inches), the Maxstow manages to offer comparable or even <em>more</em> usable internal storage volume. This low-profile design allows the cabinet to hug the wall for a sleek, clean look, reducing how much it projects into the room.</li>
<li><strong>Mirrored Interior:</strong> Maxstow cabinets typically feature mirrors not just on the exterior of the door, but also on the inside of the door and the back panel of the cabinet itself. This means you maintain a reflection even when the cabinet is open, which is incredibly convenient for grooming, applying makeup, or grabbing items while still seeing yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Lighting (on select models):</strong> Many Maxstow models come with side-integrated LED lighting. This eliminates the need for separate sconce lighting and provides optimally bright, even illumination for grooming tasks, reducing harsh shadows and hot spots. The quality of light (often 3000 Kelvin and high CRI) is designed to render colors accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Electrical Outlets:</strong> Some lighted Maxstow cabinets include interior electrical outlets. This is a game-changer for charging electric toothbrushes, shavers, or other small devices <em>inside</em> the cabinet, keeping your countertop clear of clutter and tangled cords.</li>
<li><strong>Durable Construction:</strong> Made from rust-proof aluminum, these cabinets are built to withstand the humid bathroom environment, ensuring longevity.</li>
<li><strong>Easy Installation:</strong> Designed primarily for surface-mount installation, they eliminate the need for complicated wall cutting. They typically screw directly to the wall, making DIY installation feasible for many homeowners.</li>
<li><strong>Soft-Close Hinges:</strong> For a touch of luxury and to prevent slamming, the doors often feature two-way adjustable hinges with a wide 108� opening capability and a soft-close mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing the core issues of storage, aesthetics, and usability, Kohler&rsquo;s Maxstow line elevates the humble medicine cabinet from a mere storage unit to a thoughtfully designed piece of bathroom furniture that genuinely enhances daily routines.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="built-for-righties-or-lefties">Built for Righties or Lefties</h2>
<p>One subtle yet highly appreciated design feature of the Kohler Maxstow medicine cabinet is its inherent flexibility for door swing orientation. Understanding that bathroom layouts and personal preferences vary widely, Kohler engineered the Maxstow for easy adaptability, making it suitable for both right-handed and left-handed users, or simply to fit the specific constraints of your bathroom space.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong>
The Maxstow cabinet is designed to be <strong>reversible</strong>. This means that during installation, you can choose whether the door hinges on the right side (for a left-hand swing) or on the left side (for a right-hand swing). This flexibility is typically achieved by designing the cabinet structure and the hinges in a way that allows the entire unit to be simply flipped upside down, or by having pre-drilled holes for hinge mounting on both sides of the cabinet frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Preference:</strong> A right-handed person might prefer a right-hand swing door (hinged on the left) so they can open the cabinet with their left hand while grabbing items with their dominant right hand. Conversely, a left-handed person might prefer a left-hand swing (hinged on the right).</li>
<li><strong>Bathroom Layout:</strong> The direction a door swings can significantly impact usability, especially in smaller bathrooms. You might need the door to swing away from a vanity, a toilet, or another cabinet to allow for full access without obstruction. The reversible design ensures the cabinet fits seamlessly into various layouts.</li>
<li><strong>Future Adaptability:</strong> If you ever remodel or reconfigure your bathroom, or if new occupants have different preferences, the cabinet can be re-installed with the opposite door swing without needing to purchase a new unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple yet effective design choice underscores Kohler&rsquo;s commitment to user-friendly products that offer practical solutions and adaptability, a hallmark of thoughtful modern design.</p>
