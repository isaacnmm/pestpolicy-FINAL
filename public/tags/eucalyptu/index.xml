<h3 id="1-mild-versus-severe-bed-bug-infestations">1. Mild Versus Severe Bed Bug Infestations</h3>

But for treating severe infestations of bed bugs, you should consult a
professional exterminator
or use Insecticides such as pyrethroids, pyrethrins (chrysanthemum flowers extract), and neonicotinoids.
Eucalyptus oil may cause skin irritation or damage so diluting with water before spraying clothes or furniture with it is recommended.
In some cases, eucalyptus oil may make symptoms worse if inhaled directly from the bottle without first mixing it up in another container because some individuals are allergic to this substance.</p>
<h3 id="2-on-mattressand-bed-sheets">2. On Mattress�and Bed sheets</h3>
<p>For your mattress�and bed sheets, spray�the eucalyptus oil solution on the mattress, then use a clean cloth to wipe it in.
You may also add the eucalyptus oil onto your laundry loads (like in washers) in order to kill bed bugs and their eggs.
A couple drops each of these essential oils can be applied in a few places around your room - on corners of furniture or underneath objects.</p>
<h3 id="3-f"><strong>3. F****urniture and other Household items</strong></h3>
<p>You can also use eucalyptus oil to clean your furniture and various household items, like carpets.
Ensure that the area is well ventilated before applying any of these oils because they may cause damage to our respiratory system when inhaled directly from the bottle without first mixing it up in another container!

The odor should last enough days (both by masking existing smells while providing the smell itself) to effectively drive them off once it is detected.</p>
<h2 id="making-eucalyptus-oil-spray-against-bed-bugs"><strong>Making Eucalyptus-Oil Spray Against Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>To make the eucalyptus oil repellent or spray; the requirements are as follows: 30 ml of water, 20 drops of eucalyptus oil, and a small spray bottle.
Next, mix the spray ingredients together in the bottle and shake it well. Heavy bug infestations might require a stronger eucalyptus oil to kill both adults and eggs.
Then, spray the mixture onto bedding or mattresses to deter the bed bugs from sleeping there - this will get rid or repel the bed bugs. Also, spray into those hard-to-reach corners where bed bugs love hiding out.
The bed bugs themselves will be deterred from crawling over those sprayed surfaces in order to avoid contact with the repellent effect and being killed by it as well.
