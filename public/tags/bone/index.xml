      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably you have come across various species of lizards in your home, compound, fields, yards, or zoo and wonder if they have bones. How then are their body muscles supported?��So,
<em>do lizards have bones?�</em>
<strong>The direct answer is, YES, all **
lizards are vertebrates
** that have bones that are interconnected together to help them in locomotion.�</strong>
<strong>The bones of lizards are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton. These bones offer support, protection of internal organs, and options for attachment of body muscles and cells. The number of each bone varies according to size and species of lizard.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-do-lizards-have-bones">Details: Do Lizards Have Bones?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860302/">Lizards, like other reptiles, have bones</a>
. Their bones are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton. The appendicular skeleton consists of the pelvic girdle, the pectoral, the limbs, and the bones of the front and hind legs.</p>
<p>The axial skeleton form the central axis of the lizards body. It comprises the skull, the dorsal/thoracic cage and the vertebral column.</p>
<p>The two skeleton structures are interconnected and plays a great role in protecting the inners body organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and intestines as well as the spinal cord (vital). Moreover, they provide suitable support of the body and enhances easier locomotion.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-functions-of-bones-in-lizards">What are the functions of Bones in Lizards?</h2>
<p>The following are main functions of bones in lizards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protecting the spinal cord - the vertebral column bones.</li>
<li>Protecting the brains and cerebral system - the skull.</li>
<li>Protecting providing option for attachment of internal organs such as digestive organs, heart, kidney, liver and lungs (ribs).</li>
<li>Provides option for attachment of the body muscles  axial skeleton, pelvic and pectoral girdle.</li>
<li>Help in locomotion/movement  the appendicular skeleton  femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, scapula, metacarpals, and metatarsals.</li>
<li>For grasping and grinding over the surface  the phalanges, metatarsals and metacarpals - including<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">lizard teeth</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-many-bones-does-a-lizard-have">How Many Bones Does a Lizard Have?</h2>
<p>Lizard species have different varying number of bones due to their difference in sizes. However, the skeleton of lizard has 28 specialized bones, which work collective to offer protection and locomotion effectively.</p>
<p>These bones include the vertebral column (caudal, sacral, lumbar, thoracic/dorsal and cervical vertebrae), the sternum, the scapula, the tarsals, metatarsal, carpal, metacarpal, tibia, fibula, ulna, radius, ribs, mandibles, maxilla and the phalanges.</p>
<p>Most lizards have 100 to 300 bones while large lizards such as Tree crocodile may have more. On the other hand, small lizards such as gecko may have less than 100 bones.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-have-bones-in-their-tails">Do Lizards Have Bones in Their Tails?</h2>
<p>Yes! Lizards have bones in their tail. The tail which is formed from the caudal vertebrae contain bones, ligaments, nerves, vasculature and tail muscles which gives it the tail power.</p>
<p>The tail of most lizards get detached easily when held. The Fracture of the tail vertebrae usually occurs at the fracture plane leaving behind flesh tail tissue to heal.</p>
<p>The cut tail is not easily returned in lizards  thus most of lizard species wont grow their tail back (remain tailless) - check
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5484412/">lizard tail bones regeneration</a>
.</p>
<p>Though a few lizard species show lateral growth of detached tail, the tail may not be as functional as the original tail. The First 3 bones in the lizard caudal vertebrae are fused to give it tail power. In case the tail detachment occurs past these three bones, there is normally no regrowth that can occur in most cases.</p>
<p>Lizards lack the tail autotomy and cannot be treated once their cut tail. Ensure you hold your pet lizard from below at the chest region (not lifting it by the tail).</p>
<h3 id="a-appendicular-skeleton">a. Appendicular Skeleton.</h3>
<p>The appendicular skeleton in lizards comprises of the bones that form the front and the hind legs plus the pelvic girdle and pectoral girdle from which the limbs are attached to the axial skeleton. These bones collectively coordinate the lizards movement.
<strong>1. Pectoral girdle.</strong>
This consist of two main bones, that is, the scapula and the collarbone also called clavicle. The clavicle is s-shaped <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-bones/">bone</a>, which articulates with the sternum at the front chest of the lizard. The clavicle also joins the scapula at the end of lizards shoulder.</p>
<p>Its main function is to support the scapula. Lizards have two collarbones  each jointed at the sternum and scapula.�Scapula is a bone that articulates with humerus and aid in the shoulder movement of lizard.</p>
<p>Scapula has a wide v-shaped surface area that offers an option for attachment of the neck and back muscles that coordinates the movement of joints. Lizards have two scapula  one for each front leg/limb.
<strong>2. Front Legs.</strong>
Lizards have two front legs. Each leg has similar and equal number of bones as the other. Humerus (limb) joins scapula at the shoulder articulation point.</p>
<p>Then, the two leg bones (ulna and radius) join humerus at the sigmoid notch. At the end of ulna and radius lay carpal bones, which allow rotary movement of the arm.</p>
<p>The Carpals extent to form the metacarpal bones (bones at the palm of the arm) and phalanx bones (the bones that allows the folding of the arm). The phalanges are jointed to help the lizards when grasping the prey.</p>
<p>The bones at the front legs of lizards function to coordinate in the locomotion and grasping the prey. In addition, they provide option for attachment of front leg muscles.
<strong>3. Pelvic girdle.</strong>
The Pelvic girdle has three bones that provide an option for the attachment of the lizards hind legs. The three bones are the pubis (front), ischium (back) and ilium (wing). The pelvic girdle also provides the surface for attachment of back muscles.</p>
<p>Most lizard species have their pelvic girdle fused and linked to the axial skeleton at the caudal vertebrae except in large lizards such as Komodo Dragon and Tree Crocodile Monitor and
bearded dragons� do they eat tomatoes?
.</p>
<p>In small lizards, the femur is connected directly to the axial skeleton through the ball and socket joint at the sacral vertebrae.
<strong>4. Hind legs.</strong>
Lizards have two hind legs. Each leg has equal number and similar bone type as the other. The Hind leg is joined to pelvic girdle at caudal vertebrae using the femur  which has the ball shaped end to allow the notch rotary motion.</p>
<p>At the end of femur, there is a patella bone, which helps form the knee joint. The leg is extended using two bones called tibia (larger) and fibular (smaller). These two bones function to support the weight of lizards and offer
<a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3013">option for attachment of leg muscles</a>
.</p>
<p>At the end of tibia and fibula lay tarsal bones that allows two-way motion of the arm. These bones are connected to metatarsal bones (metatarsals are elongated bones and forms base of lizards foot). At the end of metatarsals are phalanx bones. The phalanges are jointed and form the toes, which help in grasping on the ground, trees or rocks when walking.</p>
<h3 id="b-axial-skeleton">b. Axial Skeleton.</h3>
<p>The axial skeleton comprises of the skull, the dorsal/thoracic cage and the vertebral column. Axial skeleton forms the central axis of the lizards. The major function of axial skeleton is to offer point for the attachment of the appendicular skeleton and protect the spinal cord (spinal cord is responsible for nervous system coordination).
<strong>1. The skull.</strong>
Skull is a bony structure, which forms the head. The lizards skull is divided into several bones, which include the facial bones, the cranial bones, the hyoid bone and auditory ossicles.</p>
<p>The skull also contain the lower jaw (mandible - the only movable bone) and maxillae. The meninges (head hard skin and muscles) grow and merge with the lizards body skin.</p>
<p>Major functions of the skull is to protect the brain  which is be most sensitive part of the body coordination system.
<strong>2. Cervical Vertebrae</strong>
The cervical vertebrae consist of vertebra found at the lizards neck region. The first two cervical vertebra (atlas and axis) are specialized to help the nodding of head (atlas) and rotary motion of the head (axis).</p>
<p>Other vertebra are fused making the neck region of lizard stiff while some advance to form thoracic vertebrae. The cervical vertebrae also offer option for attachment of neck muscles.
<strong>3. Thoracic/dorsal vertebrae.</strong>
The dorsal vertebrae, also called thoracic vertebrae, is found at the chest region of the lizards. The vertebra provides option for the attachment of the ribs (ribs protects internal organs such as lungs, heart and livers from external damage).</p>
<p>The end of each rid is attached to sternum (breastbone) that is located at the front chest region. The number of ribs and vertebra varies from one lizard species to another. Large lizards like Tree Crocodile monitor and Komodo Drago have 15 to 24 vertebra, the medium sized lizard lizards have 10 to 16 dorsal vertebra while small lizards such as savannah and chameleon lizards have 7 to 11 thoracic vertebrae.</p>
<p>Each dorsal vertebra is connected to two ribs (one on either side).� The dorsal vertebral provides option for the attachment of the back muscles.</p>

<strong>4. Lumbar Vertebrae.</strong>
Most lizard species do not have lumbar vertebrae apart from the large lizards such as Komodo dragon and Asian water monitor lizards. The lumbar vertebra do not have the ribs attached. This region is where the stomach lay and provides option for the lizards to coil effectively during attacks.
<strong>5. Sacral Vertebrae.</strong>
The sacral vertebrae are found at the sacral section (sacrum). The pelvic girdle is jointed with the sacral vertebrae and offers large surface area for attachment of back muscles. The Lizards have 1 to 7 sacral vertebra. However, larger species can have 3 to 5 more vertebra.</p>
<p>Small and middle-sized lizards such as Nike water lizards, savannah lards and house lizards have their sacral vertebra fused to form caudal vertebrae.
<strong>6. Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The caudal vertebrae, also called tail vertebrae, is what forms the tail of the lizards. Caudal vertebrae has bones that decrease in size up to the last one. Each vertebra has two short protruding ribs that provide surface for attachment of tail muscles.</p>
<p>The caudal vertebra has short spines and arches. Long-tailed lizards such as Basilisk, chameleon lizards and skinks have 10 to 32 caudal vertebrae while small-tailed lizards have 1 to 10 caudal vertebrae.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>All Lizard species have bones that are collectively linked to aid them in protection and locomotion. The bones are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton.</p>
<p>Main functions of the bones include support, protection of internal organs and offer options for attachment of body muscles. �The total number of bones vary according to size and species of lizard. Lizards have an average of 28 specialized bones.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your regular spiders are small-bodied insects. So, its not out of the ordinary to imagine how small their bones would be, if they have any at all.</p>
<p>In fact some bigger creatures like lobsters, crab, snails, worms and shrimps have no bones.
<em>So, do spiders have bones?</em>
<strong>Well, spiders don&rsquo;t have bones - and like other arthropods. However, they have an �endoskeleton plus an exoskeleton (external skeleton) that provides primary support for the arachnid&rsquo;s muscles. Its exoskeleton has cuticles plus joints on their surfaces to enable easy movement.�</strong>

<p>The spider&rsquo;s cuticle is composed of 4 layers (like other arthropods) unlike insects that have 3 cuticle layers. However, the cuticles are all made off chitin fibers plus protein.
But, don&rsquo;t be mistaken, the spider still has a small internal skeleton - that&rsquo;s has, however, no bones in it.�The spider&rsquo;s endoskeleton has collagen and a couple of plates which won&rsquo;t articulate like bones do for the skeleton in vertebrates.
Compared to humans and other animal species -these ones have an endoskeleton that acts like a support structure that&rsquo;s created from bones.
The endoskeleton offers support to its organs like
lungs

,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-hearts/">heart</a>
and maintain the animals size and shape.</p>
<h2 id="exoskeletons-offer-spiders-body-support">Exoskeletons offer Spiders Body Support</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, spiders have an exoskeleton as compared to having an internal skeleton created from bones. So, what&rsquo;s these exoskeletons and what makes it up?
The arthropod&rsquo;s exoskeleton is made from chitin- which covers its body outer surface to offer support, protection, and structure. Thus, the exoskeleton will be shed (through molting) as the spider grows and develops. So, below is a�tarantula shedding her exoskelton:�</p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-benefit-from-theexoskeletons">How Spiders Benefit from the�Exoskeletons</h2>
<p>Compared to endoskeletons, exoskeletons will provide more protection because it covers the whole spider&rsquo;s body while the bones would only be located internally.
Also, exoskeletons enable the spider&rsquo;s muscles to achieve more leverage for movement, lifting, or picking objects - this is better than in the animals with endoskeletons.
Therefore, the exoskeletons will give the spider more power and straight than other animals of the same size but having an endoskeletons.

<h2 id="how-spiders-move">How Spiders Move</h2>
<p>The segments of the exoskeleton in the arthropod are joined using joints to allow it to move up and down. Therefore, the muscles that are attached to the exoskeleton tend to contract allowing the spider to move its legs inward.
However, the spider lacks muscles that would otherwise extend its legs back (outward) to their default position. Therefore, the creature use its blood and other bodily fluids to push the legs outward.
Whenever the spider loses excessive bodily fluid, it&rsquo;ll lack the required pressure (
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/hydraulic.htm">hydraulic)</a>
for moving its legs outwards. You&rsquo;ll notice the spider lying on its back and its legs in a curled up position.</p>
<h2 id="howspiders-molt">**How�****Spiders **<strong>Molt�</strong></h2>
<p>Spiders will move from one point to another through muscle contraction - these will be attached to the exoskeleton on the outer part of the arthropod.
The spider&rsquo;s exoskeleton is composed of different cuticle layers - that are made from chitin (polysaccharide) and
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/cell3.htm">proteins</a>
. This allows the cuticle structure to be layered like a
<a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question154.htm">plywood</a>
grain.
Therefore, the cuticle structure is very strong for protection while also preventing the spider from losing fluids excessively and drying out. This would in turn prevent effective movement in the arthropod.
But the cuticle won&rsquo;t grow like the human tissue or bones (endoskeleton) and thus it must be shed off as the spider continues to develop and grow. But spider molting mainly happen when the spider is in its younger years - but other may molt all its life.</p>
<ol>
<li>When time is ready, the spider&rsquo;s body (directed by its hormones) will absorb a part of its cuticle layer (particularly the lower layer) in its exoskeleton.</li>
<li>In addition, the spider&rsquo;s body will also start generating a new cuticle layer to create another exoskeleton. So, the emerging exoskeleton will be folded slightly to allow it to expand when the spider sheds off the old exoskeleton.</li>
<li>The spider will inject a molting fluid at the areas separating the new and old exoskeleton. The fluid allows easy separation of the two exoskeletons by create a gap between them.</li>
<li>Next, the spider bust out to shed its old exoskeleton. To achive this, the animals tend to raise the heart rate and thus pumping more blood (hemolymph) into its cephalothorax from their abdomen.</li>
<li>Therfeore the hemolymph&rsquo;s pressure forced the older exoskeleton to crack while the spider continues to flex their muscle to make its old exoskeleton to molt.</li>
