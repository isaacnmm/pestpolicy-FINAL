Weve tested and compared the top gnat repellents on the market, evaluating their effectiveness, safety, and ease of use. Below, we break down the
<strong>five best gnat repellents for Summer 2025</strong>
, including their pros and cons.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-best-gnat-repellents-for-summer-2025">7 Best Gnat Repellents for Summer 2025</h2>
<h2 id="1-bug-soother-gnat-mosquito-repellent"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3C1QJ0/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Bug Soother Gnat, Mosquito Repellent</a></h2>
<p>Bug Soother is a top choice for those who prefer
<strong>plant-based protection</strong>
. Made with citronella, lemongrass, and vanilla essential oils, it repels gnats without harsh chemicals. The light, pleasant scent makes it great for everyday use, and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, natural repellents typically require
<strong>more frequent reapplication</strong>
especially in humid or bug-heavy areas. While perfect for casual outings, those in high-gnat zones might need something stronger.
**Pros: **</p>
<ul>
<li>100% natural ingredients</li>
<li>Safe for kids and pets</li>
<li>Non-greasy, fast-absorbing</li>
<li>Pleasant citrus-vanilla scent
**Cons: **</li>
<li>Lasts only 1-2 hours</li>
<li>Not sweat/water-resistant
<strong>Best for:</strong>
Light outdoor activities, families, and eco-conscious users.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need
<strong>all-day defense</strong>
, Sawyers
<strong>20% Picaridin formula</strong>
is a top performer. It repels gnats,
mosquitoes
, and ticks for
<strong>up to 14 hours</strong>
making it ideal for camping, hiking, or tropical trips. Unlike DEET, its odorless and wont damage clothing or gear.</p>
<p>The downside? Its a
<strong>synthetic formula</strong>
, so those with very sensitive skin should test it first. But for serious outdoor enthusiasts, its one of the most reliable options available.
**Pros: **</p>
<ul>
<li>14-hour protection</li>
<li>Odorless and non-greasy</li>
<li>Safe for most fabrics</li>

<p>No Natz offers a
<strong>gentle, plant-based formula</strong>
with peppermint and geranium oils. Its safe for kids, pets, and sensitive skin, and the light herbal scent is far more pleasant than chemical sprays.</p>
<p>The trade-off? Its
<strong>not as long-lasting</strong>
as synthetic repellents, requiring reapplication every 2-3 hours. Still, its a great choice for short trips and eco-friendly users.
**Pros: **</p>
<ul>
<li>100% natural ingredients</li>
<li>Safe for kids &amp; pets</li>
<li>Travel-friendly size

<p>Designed for babies delicate skin, Babyganics uses
<strong>citronella and rosemary oil</strong>
for gentle yet effective protection. Its pediatrician-approved, free of synthetic fragrances, and doubles as a light moisturizer.</p>
<p>The oil-based formula isnt water-resistant, so it needs reapplying after swimming or sweating. The spray nozzle can also clog occasionally.

<ul>

<p>This unique
<strong>SPF 30 + bug repellent</strong>
combo is perfect for beach days or outdoor events. It moisturizes with vitamin E and aloe vera while keeping gnats away.</p>
<p>However, combined formulas are
<strong>less potent</strong>
than standalone products. Its not water-resistant, so reapplication is needed after swimming.

<ul>
<li>Sun protection + bug repellent -mosquito repellents</li>
<li>Light, pleasant scent</li>
<li>Moisturizing formula
**Cons: **</li>

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0025YOJXS&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Zymox Otic Pet Ear Treatment is one of the most popular and effective ear mite treatments available. The treatment usually works in 7 days though it might take longer in other animals.
It is gentle and safe. Zymox works by cleaning the ear first to get rid of the debris. You dont have to dig in the cats ears, which is very painful to the cat.
The treatment helps destroy antibiotic-resistant organisms and is ideal for treating inflammation from bacterial, yeast, and viral infections.
Made under acceptable manufacturing practices, the product is certified as being cruelty-free to animals.
Even during development, no experimentation is done on animals. It is not advisable to clean the ears before or during the administration of the treatment.</p>
<h2 id="4-sentry-hc-earmitefree-ear-miticide-for-cats"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0030DH0Q6/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Sentry Hc Earmitefree Ear Miticide For Cats</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0030DH0Q6&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
The Sentry HC Earmite is for use in
cats only to control
ear mite infestations. Made from pyrethrin and piperonyl, it is effective for the elimination of ear mites and ticks.
Some cats show allergic reactions to the pyrethrin ingredient; this is not a serious problem in most cases. Stop medication in such cases. It also contains aloe vera, which helps in soothing and relieving itchiness on the skin.
Make sure the cats ears are cleaned before administering medication. Massage the ears gently after every treatment helps the medication penetrate the ears&rsquo; inner parts.
The treatment is water-based and non-oily, which makes it fast and easy to use. It is, however, harmful when swallowed, so it should be kept away from children. It can lead to allergic reactions.</p>
<h2 id="5-otomite-plus-ear-mite-treatment"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HJOZECO/?tag=p-policy-20">5. Otomite Plus Ear Mite Treatment</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B00HJOZECO&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Otomite Plus Ear Mite Treatment doesnt irritate the cat after administering. This makes it one of the best
options for the treatment
of ear mites. It can also be used on dogs, puppies, and kittens.
The medicine&rsquo;s oil suspension enables it to penetrate the deep inner parts of the cats ears. The treatment is, therefore, able to kill all the ear mite. Clean the cats ears before administering it.
It is recommended for the best results to re-treat the cat with another dose of Otomite Plus Ear Mite Treatment. This should be done every seven days.
Discontinue the treatment after two weeks if there are no changes. The treatment is only recommended for animals that are over 12 weeks old.</p>
<h2 id="6-zymox-enzymatic-ear-solution--05-percent-hydrocortisone"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NVJAJG/?tag=p-policy-20">6. ZYMOX Enzymatic Ear-Solution + 0.5-Percent Hydrocortisone</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B007NVJAJG&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Zymox Ear Solution is very effective in managing bacterial, yeast, and fungal infections in cats. However, it is only half as strong as the Zymox Otic Pet Ear Treatment.
The treatment doesnt directly target ear mites but is a cost-effective way of dealing with ear mites in cats. To win the fight against ear mites, you will have to double the dose administered.
Warm the solution in a cup of hot water before administering it. The treatment is a bit oily and slippery. Therefore, it should be applied on a tiled floor where it is much easier to clean up after administering it.</p>
<h2 id="7-eradimite-ear-mite-treatment-for-cats"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002AL6UQ/?tag=p-policy-20">7. Eradimite Ear Mite Treatment for Cats</a></h2>

Eradicate
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-get-ear-mites-from-dogs/">Ear Mite</a>
Treatment is made from aloe vera. It is, therefore, completely safe with minimum chances of developing
side effects
to the treatment.
The aloe vera also helps in soothing the inflamed or itchy skin caused by the ear mites. Apart from cats, it can also be used on other
pets such as dogs
and rabbits. The treatment also gets rid of the ticks and helps in breaking down and removing ear wax.
It is easy to administer
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">medication to the cat as the treatment</a>
is applied through topical drops to the ear. Eradicate Ear Mite Treatment is readily available over the counter.
One does not need a prescription to purchase the medicine. It is, however, advisable to seek professional advice from a qualified vet before administering. Consult your vet in the case of side effects, or the cat is under special conditions such as pregnancy.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gnat bite transmits diseases such as carrison, sandy fever, and river blindness among others. Therefore,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-gnat-repellents/">preventive measures</a>
should be undertaken whatsoever. So, can <a href="/posts/best-gnat-repellents/">gnats</a> bite really! How and why, if so?</p>
<ul>
<li>**Well, YES! the female gnats will bite humans &amp; animals (to feed on blood). But male gnats don&rsquo;t bite humans since they feed on plant juice and flower nectar. **</li>
<li><strong>Unlike bees and wasps, gnats don&rsquo;t sting (the insects have a jagged saw-like mouthpiece that cuts through the skin when sucking blood).�</strong>
Usually, a <a href="/posts/best-gnat-repellent/">Gnat</a> bite appears like a tiny reddish spot with moderate swelling on your skin surface. The swelling is itchy and very painful, especially when touched. The pain and swelling may take over a week to heal.

<h2 id="details-do-gnats-bite-humans">Details: Do Gnats Bite Humans?</h2>
<h3 id="1-why-gnats-bite">1. Why Gnats Bite</h3>
<p>Female gnats, unlike male ones, bite humans and animals to acquire blood meals. Blood is an important food for female gnats, especially for their reproduction purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before laying eggs, gnats suck blood to boost their protein levels, which is necessary for bodybuilding and getting eggs ready.
Female gnats won&rsquo;t lay eggs until they get enough blood meal - they can travel over 50 miles in search of blood.
NB: Male gnats don&rsquo;t bite humans since they feed on flower nectar and plant juice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-how-gnat-bite---stages">2. How Gnat bite - stages</h3>
<p>Female gnats have jagged saw-like/serrated mouthparts (males don&rsquo;t have), which aid in cutting through human skin when sucking up blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike insects such as mosquitoes, female gnats don&rsquo;t suck blood by inserting their mouthparts into human skin, instead, they use mandibles to cut tiny holes(in the skin), through which they suck your blood.
When biting, female gnats release an anticoagulant substance into humans&rsquo; blood, which leads to severe pain and allergic reactions for those individuals that bite sensitively. Generally, female gnats bite happens in the following stages:
<strong>a. 1st Stage</strong>
The female gnats penetrate their mandibles into human skin.
<strong>b. 2nd Stage</strong>
This is the stage when gnats try to position their mouthparts inside your skin/wound. They actually anchor the syntrophic within the skin using laciniae.
<strong>c. 3rd Stage</strong>
This stage involves actual bloodsucking it feeding. Human blood is pumped into the gnats using a group of muscles (three) and two functional pumps that are separated by a food canal.
The blood-sucking process is sequential but complex in nature. However, the flow is synchronous and smooth - relative expansion and contractions.
<strong>4. 4th Stage</strong>
This is actually the escape stage when the female gnats remove laciniae and detach the syntrophium from human

<h3 id="3-gnat-bite-appearance">3. Gnat bite Appearance</h3>
<p>Usually, gnat bites look like pin-prick swells with tiny reddish marks/spots. The degree of redness differs, though in most cases, the color is pale (for a few bites) and otherwise darker (for multiple bites).</p>
<ul>
<li>Gnat bites are very painful (due to toxic anticoagulant substances) and the bites are characterized by an itchy feeling, which is severe when touched/scratched.
Further, gnat bite forms medium swelling that may take one to two weeks to heal. Unlike other insects bites, gnat bite blood spread beneath the skin surface or around the swelling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-diseases-transmitted-by-gnat-bite">4. Diseases Transmitted by Gnat bite</h3>
<p>Gnat&rsquo;s bite transmits disease such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leishmania - this causes severe cut sores on human skin</li>
<li>Carrison&rsquo;s disease - bacteria disease transmitted through gnat infectious bite</li>
<li>River blindness - this disease causes the victim to lose their sight with time</li>
<li>Toscanca &amp; Plunta toto virus - an infectious viral disease</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-symptoms-of-a-gnat-bite">5. Symptoms of a Gnat Bite</h3>
<p>Gnat bite has some of the following signs and symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medium reddish swelling or spots</li>
<li>Severe pain on the bitten section</li>
<li>Reddish marks on human skin</li>
<li>Itchy feelings</li>
<li>Burning sensation or skin irritation on bitten section</li>
<li>Allergic reactions on the bitten skin surface due to anticoagulant reaction</li>
<li>Difficulty in breathing - about 2% of victims</li>
<li>Fever after sometimes</li>
<li>Skin discomfort</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-gnat-bite-treatment">6. Gnat Bite Treatment</h3>
<p>In case you are bitten by gnats, you can undertake the following treatment measures:
<strong>a. Apply pain relief or anti-itch medicine</strong>
Apply anti-itch medicine (antihistamine) on the bite gently to relieve pain - this diagnosis depends on the extent of the bites and pain felt.
Avoid rubbing or scratching the bitten area since this may open up room for bacterial infections.
<strong>b. Disinfect Bitten Skin surface</strong>
Clean the area with treated warm water and soap gently/thoroughly. Alternatively, you can use other disinfectants such as vinegar or alcohol-based solvent. Finally, cover the wound with a clean piece of clothes lightly.
<strong>c. Apply Antiseptic swab</strong>
Gently, apply antiseptic swab (over the wound surface). Leave the solvent to kill germs and pathogens that may be transmitted by gnats. Leave to would to heal - don&rsquo;t rub the bitten area.

<h2 id="how-can-you-avoid-gnats-bite">How Can you Avoid Gnats Bite?</h2>
<p>The following are possible ways of avoiding gnats bite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desist from using scented lotion, cologne, or perfume when you go for outdoor activities - such scents attract biting gnats like sand gnats.</li>
<li>Use a table fan or pedestal when relaxing on your yard or porch - it helps you locate gnats easily.</li>
<li>Often, wear a full neck, long pants, and a full sleeve shirt in order to minimize any uncovered body parts.</li>
<li>Install a fine fiberglass window screen for your house and patio - it makes it difficult for gnats to penetrate in.</li>
<li>Consider applying DEET repellant when going for outdoor activities - this keeps biting gnats away.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-attracts-gnats-in-your-place">What Attracts Gnats in Your place</h2>
<p>If you have gnats infestation in your place, chances are that either of the following attracts them:</p>
<h3 id="1-vegetables-and-fruits">1. Vegetables and Fruits</h3>
<p>Gnats (especially males) are highly attracted by ripe fruits - male gnats feed on fruits. Also, vegetables (mainly succulent) are good sources of gnat meal.
Whether it&rsquo;s your house or garden, ripe or rotting fruits/vegetables have a strong scent that pulls the gnats into the vicinity.</p>
<h3 id="2-moisture">2. Moisture</h3>
<p>Gnats usually breed in moist places such as wet windows, wet rags, garbage bins, or overwatered plants. Female gnats lay 150-500 eggs at once, which hatch in a couple of days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moisture favors the growth of body tissues (for larvae) and prevalent check from one stage to another in their life cycle.
Leaking pipes, vents, moist potting soil, beneath the sink, food spillage, or kitchen store are possible places you need to ensure that they are dry so as to prevent gnats infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-source-of-light">3. Source of Light</h3>
<p>Bright light is critical for gnats&rsquo; movement in the dark - it provides a pathway for gnats to locate places they want to land.
You will note gnats moving to areas such as light fixtures, bulbs, LEDs, disco lights, and lamps. Attach gnats repellant to such items in case you spot an infestation in your home.</p>
<h3 id="4-human-beings">4. Human beings</h3>
<p>Household gnats, especially female gnats, are attracted to humans as that the primary source of food (they suck blood).</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, carbon dioxide, mucus, tears, sweat, body heat are attractants that bring gnats to your place too.
In addition, perfume, lotion, detergents, and hairspray attract gnats as well. You need to limit such chemical use and maintain high body hygiene to stop gnats from visiting your place.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-decaying-organic-matters">5. Decaying organic matters</h3>
<p>Gnats love rotting flowers and plants - they feed on them as food (male gnats). Organic materials such as mold, moss, compound refuse, and fungi are great sources of food for gnats; thus, will attract gnats too.
Clean all organic matters in your place (especially the rotting ones) as preventive measures.

<li>Unlike bees and wasps, gnats don&rsquo;t sting. Actually, the female gnats are the ones that bite humans and animals since they feed on a blood meal. Contrary, male gnats feed on flower nectar and other plant juice hence, they won&rsquo;t bite humans.
The gnat bites appear like tiny reddish spots/marks with medium size swellings on your skin. The swellings are very painful and itchy (especially when scratched).
The pain and swelling may take over a week to heal. More so, gnat bite will transmit diseases such as river blindness, carrison, sandy fever among others. Therefore, preventive measures highlighted in this article should be put into place. Importantly, seek medical attention instantly in case you get bitten by gnats and the condition is deteriorating.</li>
