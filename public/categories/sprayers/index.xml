      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using the best pump <a href="/posts/best-air-compressors-for-spray-painting/">sprayers</a> for staining fences will be both less
labor- and time-intensive compared to

<p>You should stain or paint your wood fence (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/%5Bbest%5D(/posts/best-airless-paint-sprayer/)-stain-for-swing-set/">with exterior decking stain</a>
) every 2-3 years as the wood will be exposed to many elements - and thus staining or painting will increase its durability.
On quantity, you&rsquo;ll require one gallon of
stain for painting
smaller fences of roughly 175 square feet. But you&rsquo;ll need about 2 to 4 gallons of stain to paint larger fences of a maximum of 700 square feet.
But should you pressure wash your fence prior to painting?� Well, YES, pressure-wash the fences to remove
grime, dust, dirt, and
old finish(es) as these may ultimately show through the stained surfaces.</p>

      <description>If you own a Graco</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you own a Graco
RAC sprayer
, then, you will have to read this article to acquire in-depth knowledge on the fine finish, low pressure (FFLP) tips. Quality paint finish layer is a function of the type of spray tip you select and skills.</p>
<p>*This article endeavors to review Graco FFLP tips for sprayers in detail. We shall be checking on the working principle, the top performance, efficiency, cleaning options required, replacement techniques, and repair. *
<em>Further, we shall delve into the FFLP tip design and available sizes, spray action rendered, finish quality attained, area of use, paint compatibility, and key features that boost your overall knowledge bank without overlooking the cost implication.</em></p>

<h2 id="-graco-fflp-tip-for-sprayer">: Graco FFLP Tip for Sprayer</h2>
<p>When it comes to actual operation, we recommend that you stick to the manufacturers instructions and avoid undertaking repair if you are new to the Graco RAC series.</p>
<h3 id="1-working-principle">1. Working Principle</h3>
<p>Fine finish, low-pressure tip works for airless paint sprayer by reducing the energy required to atomize the paint (fluid) before reaching the surface under paint application.
The FFLP tip utilizes the internal orifice design to blend the pressure difference (between entry and exit) and cause complete atomization needed for quality paint finish.
Moreover, the orifice diameter is a function of intended quality and fan width as per the spray area under paint application. Moreover, the low-pressure concept of FFLP makes it more common in airless spray paint applications.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnCztEg4_XA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnCztEg4_XA</a></p>
<h3 id="2-tip-performance">2. Tip Performance</h3>
<p>The FFLP tip delivers a quality finish by preventing surface overspray and enhancing the paint atomization process.
Unlike Low-pressure tips, FFLP tips are designed to eliminate surface drains and enhance quality finish performance during spray painting.
You will like the fine finish layer created by the FFLP, unlike other conventional tips that lack self-leveling surface properties and control dial.</p>
<h3 id="3-efficiency">3. Efficiency</h3>
<p>As compared to low-pressure tips, FFLP comes with 50% efficiency and low energy gain from the power source.
You will spend far much lesser when using FFLP, than when you use RAC X gun tips.
Further, the quality of the paint finish is quite high, while the atomization process is 100% attained without any internal complications.</p>
<h3 id="4-cleaning-options">4. Cleaning Options</h3>
<p>FFLP tips are simple and more comfortable to clean. Usually, the tip guard is nicely threaded into a universal tip fastener for motion stability.
When cleaning, you only need to unscrew the guard and pull the FFLP tip gently. Further, dip the tip in thinner to clean the orifice and paint channel.
You can opt to pass pressurized clean water to flush paint that may be stuck within the orifice.</p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="5-repair-and-replacement">5. Repair and Replacement</h3>
<p>During paint application, the tip guard is often affected or damaged due to excessive vibrations or surface collisions.
The FFLP tip may fail to atomize paint solvent completely  this affects the finish coat quality. In such a condition, youll have to clean the tip to remove the internal clog and pre-test it (for assessment).
Alternatively, the FFLP tip can be replaced with a new one, (of the same type and size) to restore your Graco paint sprayer to its original performance.</p>
<h3 id="6-fflp-tip-sizes-and-tip-design">6. FFLP Tip Sizes and Tip Design</h3>
<p>Fine finish, low-pressure tips are designed and manufactured in various sizes to meet prevailing painting needs.
Though the working principle and overall design may be the same, the orifice size and interior channel differ as per the area extent and paint type you intend to handle using a particular FFLP tip.
In order to identify the best FFLP tip size for your paint application process, you need to know the diameter of the orifice, which defines the spray fan width.
To do this, check the FFLP tip number, i.e. FFLP 310. If the first digit is doubled, then youll get the width of the spray fan-generated when painting. In this case, FFLP 310 tip will produce a 6-inch diameter patch when spraying.
Before making your purchase decision, consider the surface area you need to spray paint and undertake fan width calculations (as explained above), to prevent overspray.
Moreover, note the maximum pressure (PSI) under which every FFLP tip operates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See Also:
Graco Magnum X7 Sprayer</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="7-spray-action--overspray">7. Spray Action  overspray</h3>
<p>The FFLP (green) is specially designed to eliminate overspray problems during paint application.
The available FFLP tip sizes allow optional selection to match your spray width and eliminated drains or surface run.
The quality of paint finish is best achieved by using FFLP tips (green) instead of conventional pray tips when using an airless sprayer.</p>
<h3 id="8-compatible-paint-use">8. Compatible Paint Use</h3>
<p>FFLP tips handle well-thinned paint to prevent blocking and internal clogging.
You can use FFLP with latex paint, enamel, acrylic, or satin paint comfortably without experiencing any failure.
However, for an airless paint sprayer, the fluid pressure (PSI) should not exceed 3500 for safety purposes.
Many painters tend to use guard, though that wont necessarily guarantee you safety when it comes to pressure inbuilt effects.
High viscous paint should not be used with FFLP as it blocks the channel and destroys the quality of the finish layer.</p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="9-area-of-use">9. Area of Use</h3>
<p>The FFLP tips (green) size 110 and 108 are best suited for spraying cabinets and frames and spindles. The narrow output design minimizes over sprayer and attains classic finish without blowing out.
For shelves and cabinet doors, consider FFLP 210 (green)  the tip works excellently with latex paint and overcomes internal clogging in case of pressure built up.
Doors and trims can be handled by either, FFLP 310 tip (green), or FFLP 311 tip (blue). The tips produce a 6-inch fan width that covers the surface nicely during application.
Depending on the thickness of the paint solvent, you may consider having a wider orifice tip like FFLP 312 or FFLP 313.
Wall, ceiling, fence, and exterior siding requires an FFLP 516 or FFLP 517 tip that can handle wide a wide range of acrylic paint without getting fatigued. A newly constructed wall needs FFLP 615 or FFLP 721 to contend with high volume flow demands.</p>

<p>If you are a professional or a DIYer, there is a need to know more about what the Wagner Flexio 590 can. What are the dos and the donts of this sprayer and why choose this sprayer over the others.
This review will give you an elaborate guide to help you understand what it is you are dealing with and what is its limits.
This sprayer comprises 3 main components that work differently but altogether enhance its performance.
These components include X-Boost Turbine and 2 nozzles; ispray and a detail finish nozzle.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q6YZsK4je8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q6YZsK4je8</a></p>
<h4 id="11-x-boost-turbine">1.1. X-BOOST TURBINE</h4>
<p>The X-Boost turbine is specially designed for this sprayer to generate pressure and create paint flow from the in-built motor.� This is a great enabler of the many benefits found in this sprayer.
The turbine is electric powered and can be used both indoors and outdoors. By default, the sprayer flow is set to the maximum but can be adjusted based on the kind of paint that you are using and also the kind of project that you are undertaking.
You can set a higher power/speed flow in case you are doing a paint with high viscosity and a lower speed for unthinned paints. The maximum speed of this sprayer is 10 times faster than brush and rollers.</p>

<h4 id="12-adjustable-ispray-nozzle">1.2. Adjustable ispray Nozzle</h4>
<p>If you are going to undertake a large project, you will need to use the ispray adjustable nozzle. This is faster and appropriate for such.
You can adjust the ring of this nozzle depending on the kind of spray pattern you want to achieve, i.e. horizontal, vertical or round painting.
You can also adjust the nozzle to fit into spraying edges, narrow space, and corners, and other smaller spaces. For all the large projects, you just need to increase the turbine speed and power for efficiency in your spray.
The higher the power, the greater the coverage and the easier it is for a professional smooth finish. With this nozzle, you dont have to worry about the kind of paint materials. Whether oil-based, water-based, stains, varnishes, or even latex paints.</p>

<h4 id="13-detail-finish-nozzle">1.3. Detail Finish Nozzle</h4>
<p>If you undertaking small projects like small furniture, railings, or even trims, this is an ideal nozzle to use on your Wagner Flexio 590 sprayer.
Just like in the ispray, the paint flow will also be very vital when spraying as well as adjusting the nozzle to fit into the appropriate spray pattern.
However, it is important to know that this nozzle cannot work well with thick paints but you can use it on stains and oil-based paints.</p>
<h3 id="2-elaborate-pros">2. Elaborate Pros</h3>
<p>The good side of having this Wagner Flexio 590 is the power it gives you control of how your painting should be.
With X-Boost, you can regulate the flow and speed of the sprayer to achieve smooth coverage. This is achievable through the dial with a speed of 1-9.
Though the machine comes set by default at the maximum speed, you can always regulate it by turning the knob either clockwise or anticlockwise.
This sprayer also has a unique ispray nozzle that you can on all kinds of surfaces whether large or small. With it, you can spray all kinds of materials with different viscosity.
The design of this hand sprayer enhances its portability and makes it possible for one to do large projects with minimum fatigue.
Additionally, this sprayer is very easy to assemble and even if its your first time owning this sprayer, you will have an easy time fixing it.
The flow knob on the top of this sprayer is very effective when it comes to controlling the paint flow and therefore improving the coverage and minimizing any likelihood of an overspray.
When you are done, with your spray, the sprayer is easy to clean-up. All you need to do is fill the cup/reservoir with water and turn it on as though doing a spray until the reservoir is fully rinsed.</p>

<h3 id="3-elaborate-cons">3. Elaborate Cons</h3>
<p>Though, this sprayer ticks in almost everything, there are still limitations especially on thick paints that can easily clog this sprayer.
Adequate thinning of such materials should adhere to as well as using the appropriate nozzle to avoid such unfortunate incidences.
The other thing is the short power cord that is very limiting especially when you have to do large projects.
This can be very discouraging especially if the source of power is far from where you are undertaking your project. This may also be common for outdoor projects where you have to source power.</p>
<h3 id="4-maintenance">4. Maintenance</h3>
<p>Maintenance should be taken seriously if indeed you need longer service life from this sprayer.
First, you need to clean-up the sprayer very well after use to avoid wears and tear that could occur due to rust and corrosion among other damages.
Using proper cleaning materials should also be observed with strict adherence. For instance, using warm water and soap is advisable especially when you are done using latex paints.
Secondly, use the right nozzle for the right materials is equally important and will keep your sprayer long enough.
Using the wrong nozzle could negatively impact the sprayer and cause clogging and possible damage to the sprayer. More maintenance information is also provided in the user manual.</p>

<p>Could be you are impressed by the features of Wagner Flexio 590 and it is not available in the stores or you feel you need a more updated model of the same sprayer Wagner FLEXiO 2000 would be a good alternative for you.

Another alternative would be Wagner Control Spray 250 which is pocket friendly but with reduced features than the Wagner Flexio 590.
