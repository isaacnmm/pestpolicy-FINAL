      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/do-fleas-bite-humans/">Fleas</a> are
very stubborn parasites
. They like to suck blood from both humans and animals-more so our pets at home. When its cold outside, they find their way into our houses for survival. When on human, can fleas bite through clothes?</p>
<ul>
<li>**Yes, and No, fleas cant bite through thick clothing or layers of clothes such as denim, jeans, and sneakers. **</li>
<li><strong>But, fleas can bite through thin clothes such as silk or lace - thin and tight fabric-like skin tights. Fleas cannot bite through clothes but like to find their way under the clothes and enjoy biting and sucking blood.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Killer for Fleas&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
*But, fleas will move under the clothes to feed on your exposed skin. *
*Thus, you can stop <a href="/posts/why-do-flea-bites-itch/">flea</a> bites by wearing closed-toe shoes, long trousers, and socks - and tuck the pant legs into your socks. *
For additional flea bite protection, use sprays some Sawyer Products Permethrin on your garments.

<h2 id="can-fleas-bite-through-clothes">Can Fleas Bite Through Clothes?</h2>
<p>Fleas cant bite through clothes. But if the clothes are thin or tight they can. In most cases, fleas like to penetrate under the clothes and hide before they can bite into your skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some clothes that protect you from fleas. These clothes should actually cover your body well without leaving any part bare.</li>
<li>Fleas will always reach out for the skin but if they cant reach it, they will attach themselves to the clothes as they wait for the best moment to bite.
On the other hand, there are clothes made from loose weaves that easily allow fleas to get to your skin.</li>
<li>For this kind of clothing, fleas wont have to struggle to get to the skin even when you have fully covered yourself.
Fleas can also sneak their way into the clothes seam and stitch into the skin. This can happen even if the fabric used is strong and hard to allow fleas.

<h2 id="wearing-long-pants-tacked-into-socks-">**Wearing Long Pants Tacked Into Socks **</h2>
<p>Even if fleas cant bite through clothes, it is good to wear protective clothing that keeps fleas off.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, there are long pants that can be tucked into socks and easily keep the fleas off.</li>
<li>Fleas can easily get into our bodies through open legs and feet and closed shoes will also help.
In the case of your hands, wear long-sleeved shirts and avoid crop tops and others that expose your skin.
**Jeans and sneakers - **
These are good clothing that you can use to help in protecting yourself against fleas attacks.
You can wear them with socks because flies have a soft entry spot between socks and trousers. You can as well tuck the trousers into the socks.
So far so good, the best clothes that you can put on in a flea-infested zone are long pants and long-sleeved shirts. This is only helpful when it comes to preventing flea bites but that doesnt mean fleas wont attack you.</li>
<li>If not that, you can still use some spray repellents on your clothes to keep off the fleas from your clothes and prevent bites as well.</li>
<li>There are clothes that make us prone to fleas bite-these are;
**Skin tights and thin fabrics - **
These kinds of fabrics are the easy spots for fleas, they can easily penetrate through them. If you have such kinds of clothes dont dare use them
**Loose woven clothes - **
This kind of clothing, though they are thick enough, they have a loose hole and pattern that allows fleas to go through. They are not good to put on in a fleas-infested area.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/best-roach-bait/">Cockroaches</a> are infamous for being one of the most resilient and pervasive pests, invading homes and often causing distress among homeowners. They are often associated with the transmission of diseases and can be a real nuisance.</p>
<p>But the question that often comes to mind is, &ldquo;Do cockroaches <a href="/posts/can-fleas-bite-through-clothes/">bite</a>?&rdquo; In this comprehensive article, we will delve into the world of cockroaches, exploring their behavior, what drives them to bite, the potential dangers, and how to treat a cockroach bite.
<strong>Cockroach Diet: Omnivores at Heart</strong>
Cockroaches are omnivorous pests, which means they have a diverse diet. They will eat just about anything that&rsquo;s edible, whether it&rsquo;s dead or alive animals, plants, or decaying matter. This dietary versatility is one of the reasons they are such persistent and adaptable pests in various environments.</p>
<h2 id="do-cockroaches-really-bite"><strong>Do Cockroaches Really Bite?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Yes, the answer is a resounding yes, cockroaches can and do bite. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that cockroaches do not bite humans as a primary source of food.�</strong>
<strong>Their natural inclination is to find food and shelter, and humans are not typically on their menu. Instead, cockroaches resort to biting in certain situations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>**Scarcity of Food:**When cockroaches cannot find their usual sources of food, such as crumbs or organic matter, they may explore alternative options, including nibbling on human skin.</li>
<li>**Feeling Threatened:**Cockroaches are primarily nocturnal creatures that prefer to remain hidden. If they feel cornered or threatened, they may<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641686/">bite as a defense mechanism</a>.</li>
<li>**Extreme Infestations:**In cases of severe infestations, cockroaches may become bolder and more desperate, increasing the likelihood of encountering humans and potentially resorting to biting.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-do-cockroach-bites-look-like"><strong>What Do Cockroach Bites Look Like?</strong></h3>
<p>Cockroach bites on humans are typically small, red, and raised welts. They may resemble mosquito bites but are usually smaller in size.</p>
<p>These welts can be itchy, but the discomfort is generally mild. It&rsquo;s important to remember that cockroach bites are not a common occurrence for most people.</p>
<h3 id="variation-in-cockroach-biting-behavior"><strong>Variation in Cockroach Biting Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>Not all cockroach species exhibit the same biting behavior. While all cockroach species have the capability to bite, some are more likely to do so than others.</p>
<p>German cockroaches, Australian cockroaches, and American cockroaches are among the species that are more prone to biting humans.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to note that the level of pain from a cockroach bite may vary from person to person. Some individuals may only feel a slight twinge or pinch, while others may experience more discomfort.

<h3 id="are-cockroach-bites-dangerous"><strong>Are Cockroach Bites Dangerous?</strong></h3>
<p>Cockroach bites, in and of themselves, are not dangerous. Unlike some other insects, cockroaches do not inject venom into their victims. Therefore, a cockroach bite typically causes irritation, swelling, and sometimes mild pain, but it does not pose a significant health risk.</p>
<h3 id="cockroach-allergies-vs-bites"><strong>Cockroach Allergies vs. Bites</strong></h3>
<p>While cockroach bites may not be particularly harmful, cockroaches can trigger allergies in some individuals.</p>
<p>These allergies are typically caused by cockroach allergens found in their saliva, feces, and shed skin. Symptoms may include sneezing, a runny nose, and itchy eyes when exposed to these allergens.</p>
<h2 id="cockroaches-and-disease-transmission"><strong>Cockroaches and Disease Transmission</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches are notorious for being potential vectors of disease. However, it&rsquo;s important to clarify that they do not transmit diseases through their bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead, cockroaches and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">baby roaches</a>can carry disease-causing pathogens on their bodies and in their excrement.
By crawling in unsanitary environments, such as drains, sewage, and garbage waste, they can pick up these pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>When they come into contact with food or surfaces that humans touch, they can transfer these pathogens, potentially causing diseases like typhoid, cholera, diarrhea, and dysentery.</p>
<h2 id="when-do-cockroaches-bite-and-where"><strong>When Do Cockroaches Bite, and Where?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches are primarily nocturnal creatures, which means they are most active at night. This is when you&rsquo;re more likely to encounter them if you have an infestation.</p>
<p>Biting usually occurs when they feel threatened or when their food sources are scarce. They may bite areas of your body with some food residue, such as hands, feet, and even dead skin.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-a-cockroach-bite"><strong>How to Treat a Cockroach Bite</strong></h2>
<p>If you suspect you&rsquo;ve been bitten by a cockroach, follow these steps for treatment:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Avoid Scratching:**It&rsquo;s crucial not to scratch the bite area to prevent additional inflammation and potential infection.</li>
<li>**Elevate the Bite Area:**Keeping the bitten area elevated can reduce swelling and irritation.</li>
<li>**Apply an Ice Pack:**Place an ice pack over the cockroach bite for about 20 minutes to soothe swelling and discomfort.</li>
<li>**Natural Remedies:**You can use natural remedies like honey, eucalyptus, coconut oil, rosemary oil, apricot oil, or lavender oil to soothe the irritation.</li>
<li>**Over-the-Counter Solutions:**Calamine cream can help reduce swelling and irritation caused by cockroach bites.</li>
<li>**Hydrocortisone, Peppermint, and Aloe Vera:**These ingredients can also be applied to the bite area to reduce irritation and swelling.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="when-do-cockroaches-bite-during-sleep"><strong>When Do Cockroaches Bite During Sleep?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches tend to bite humans when they are sleeping, mainly because most of your defenses are down at this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>If their food sources are limited or if the cockroach population in an area has grown too large, they may resort to biting.
This is particularly common aboard ships, where cockroach populations can multiply rapidly, and their food sources become limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Related:
Use roach bombs
.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In conclusion, cockroaches can indeed bite, but it&rsquo;s not something that should cause excessive concern for most people. Cockroach bites are usually mild, causing irritation and swelling, but they are not inherently dangerous.</p>
<ul>
<li>The primary focus should be on preventing cockroach infestations in your home, as cockroaches are more likely to bite when their food sources are scarce.</li>
<li>Maintaining a clean environment, sealing entry points, and using effective pest control methods can help keep these pests at bay.
Remember that cockroaches are more likely to transmit diseases through contamination rather than their bites, making proper hygiene and pest control crucial in keeping your home safe and pest-free.</li>

<h2 id="do-fleas-bite-humans-where-home-flea-remedies">Do Fleas Bite Humans? Where? Home Flea Remedies</h2>
<p>Flea bites trigger inflammation, itching, and anemia due to blood loss to the parasitic insect in petshowever, it&rsquo;s
clear that fleas
also bite humans.
An adult flea can jump about 150x its height, but they&rsquo;ll also easily move around by
hitchhiking on humans
and pets - mainly cats and dogs while moving around the house or yard.
Fleas will bite
humans on their lower extremities - ankles, feet, lower legs, calves. Therefore, the yard or lawn bugs will target camping blankets, pant legs, stockings, and shoes.
With 3 months (their whole lifespan), adult fleas will bring forth
400 to 500 baby fleas
. However, fleas are mainly left in your yard by wild animals like skunks, raccoons, and moles - check these
durable moles traps
.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-fleas-bite-humans">Where Do Fleas Bite Humans?</h2>
<p>So, is this the case for humans? Well, in this post, I&rsquo;ve tackled this highly itchy question, &ldquo;where do
fleas bite
humans?&rdquo;
<strong>The short answer is</strong>
,
fleas will bite humans
on their lower legs, calves, ankles, feet, and (though rarely) the head, groin, and chest area.</p>
<p>Therefore, rarely will the bites happen above the human knee unless you&rsquo;re lying or sitting on the groundRelated:
How to Get Rid of Fleas
.</p>
<h3 id="1-feet-and-ankles--regular-flea-bites">1. Feet and Ankles -�Regular Flea Bites</h3>
<p>Fleas will bite and suck blood from any part of the human body. But,
cat fleas will jump
a maximum of 5.2 inches -7.9 inches. This height is merely just below the human knees, which means thats where the fleas will land.
When fleas land on the human skin, the
bugs start biting
and sucking blood instantly without roaming or moving around carelessly. Hence,
flea bites will occur more commonly
on humans on the lower legs, calves, ankles, and feet.
<strong>- Bare Skin above Sock Line</strong>
As a rule of thumb, fleas wont bite
through your clothing
either various fabrics, socks, or jeans. But no too fast!�Fleas might actually bite through your thin, loose-fitting clothes like yoga pants, pantyhose, and tights.
Fleas will generally move around while under the clothes and s stay in this hiding situation unless theyre
biting your exposed skin
.
Hence, putting on pants and socks will block fleas from biting you. But, these nasty
bugs may still attack and bite
you on any bare skin just above your sock line. You can
prevent such flea bites
by tucking the pant legs into your socks.</p>
<h3 id="2-above-human-knees--rare-flea-bites">2. Above Human Knees -�Rare Flea Bites</h3>
<p>Fleas will rarely bite
anywhere above the human
. Despite that
cat fleas
can jump about 8 inches, it&rsquo;s not so high of a jump to reach above your knees.
Therefore, fleas wont jump enough to reach above the human knee, and thus most flea bites wont be found in these areas. You can use
flea bombs
to control a major flea infestation in your house.
<strong>- Upper Body Parts�</strong>
However, as noted above, fleas bites above your knee can be witnesses in cases where youre lying or sitting on an infested
place or near the flea
bedding.
If fleas breed uncontrollably, they may spread in many areas and could bite humans on the upper legs, waist, head, pubic area, and the denser parts of their hairs on the chest.
<strong>- Human Head�</strong>
Flea bites on the human head are rare because this body part is so far from the ground, and fleas cant jump that high. For example, fleas could bite your wrists in some rare circumstances.
Nevertheless, such high-octane might still happen when a person is sitting on the floor, and thus the fleas will easily reach the upper body parts.</p>
<h3 id="3-neck-and-scalp">3. Neck and Scalp</h3>
<p>Fleas may bite your neck, but this only happens in major flea infestations. Again, flea bites on either your head, face, or scalp will mainly happen if youre sitting or sleeping on flea-infested ground or near flea bedding.
Equally, you should know that sharing your
bed or couch will a flea-infested dog
or cat may also encourage fleas to attack your head and neck.</p>
<h2 id="fleas-prefer-cats-and-dogs-as-their-primary-hosts">Fleas Prefer Cats and Dogs as their Primary Hosts</h2>
<p>Fleas bites on human beings will mainly be instigated by human fleas, cat fleas, and
dog fleas
. Further, the flea bites on your skin will mainly appear in clusters or large groups. If you&rsquo;re overly sensitive to flea bites, you might get red bumps or hives.
Cat fleas
rarely jump off the bodies of your household pets, including cats and dogs. So, its definite that fleas will always prefer biting
pets over attacking humans since
we dont have body hair where they can hide.
Thus, fleas will hitchhike onto humans (
fleas don&rsquo;t stay on humans
)  during which time they bite the human skin about 2-3 times.
However, whenever disturbed when feeding on your human blood, the
fleas will hide
under your clothes for a maximum of 24 hours. Also, when the cat fleas can trace their way out of your clothes, theyll continue feeding on your blood periodically.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-why-do-fleas-bite">When and Why do Fleas Bite?</h2>
<p>Fleas detect the volatile organic compound (VOC) released from the human body, mainly due to body odor and skin flora, and can readily select their prey.
<strong>~~� Fun Facts ~~�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas will suck blood thats about 15 times their body weight.</li>
<li>The flea eggs have short spikes thatll allow the bug to stick on its host strongly.</li>
<li>After prickling the hosts skin, the flea injects saliva that acts like an Anesthesia. But the saliva may trigger allergic reactions in both humans and pets. Related:
Reliable Roach Killers
.
Further, adult female fleas require to suck more blood compared to their male counterparts. This is because female fleas require more energy to breed or reproduce.
So, if youre wondering, flea bites will mainly be small red dots (which may progress into large patches of redness) that arise from skin injury and allergic reactions due to the flea bite.
Definitely, after a flea bite, a cat, dog, or human being will scratch their itchy skin, and this may result in infections.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-bite-humans">How Do Fleas Bite Humans?</h2>
<p>Fleas use their specially
developed mouths to bite the human
skin and suck blood from their capillaries. The mouth has 3 key stylets that are shaped like some tiny needles.</p>
<h3 id="1-exploratory-probing">1. Exploratory Probing</h3>
<p>Fleas find a good site for biting on humans using the labial palps. Next, the insect pierces the skin in what&rsquo;s known as exploratory probing.
<em>Related:�Best Bed Bug Steamer.�</em>
Two parts of the mouth will bite the human skin cutting it to suitable blood vessels. The insects introduce the anticoagulant saliva to assist in locating human blood.</p>
<h3 id="2-skin-piercing-and-drawing-blood">2. Skin Piercing and Drawing Blood</h3>
<p>Then, the fascicle or epipharynx (needle-like stylet) will go into the capillary and suck blood. The probing process will lead to lesions clusters due to biting reactions.
The flea&rsquo;s maxillary laciniae readily pierces the human epidermis. The middle epipharynx tip goes into the blood vessel, enabling the blood to move up into their fleas body.
The insect has muscles on its fore-gut that&rsquo;ll easily contact to produce some suction force and pump more blood into the flea&rsquo;s body. The blood meal travels easily via the esophagus, and it&rsquo;s mid-gut ready for digestion.</p>
<h4 id="3-saliva-anticoagulant-introduction">3. Saliva (anticoagulant) introduction</h4>
<p>Finally, once the flea has a good blood meal, it&rsquo;ll open its 4 salivary glands and release some anticoagulant into the human body through the needle-like mouth-parts - this prevents blood clotting.
The fleas&rsquo; salivary glands are placed in their abdomen, and thus only long ducts will link it to the insect&rsquo;s mouth.
During the blood-feeding process, the glans will open and drop saliva on the tissues around the wound on the human skin.</p>
<h3 id="4-movement-in-feeding">4. Movement in Feeding</h3>
<p>The anticoagulant in the flea&rsquo;s saliva tends to imbibe blood. The saliva will also soften and spread the human skin tissues, allowing effortless insertion and equal
removal of the flea
fascicle.
So, fleas are vessel feeders as contrasted to bugs that are pool feeders. The human&rsquo;s blood pressure benefits the flea to allow faster feeding - leaving limited or no hemorrhage.
If the insect is disrupted during the feeding process, it&rsquo;ll jump off the human or pet host and only come back to another site shortly. Thus, flea bites on humans will result in multiple nearby bite spots.</p>
<h3 id="5-blooddigestion">5. Blood�Digestion</h3>
<p>Once the flea has imbibed enough blood, the pro-ventricular gut will behave like a valve and hence hinder blood regurgitation chances.
The pro-ventricular gut sprays the ingredients and digestive enzymes necessary for blood digestion. Blood will be digested in the mid-gut that looks like a sac, and later the contents move to the hind-gut.
But female fleas will digest the host blood faster than the male fleas - this is interpreted because the females need more energy and nutrition to create and lay
flea eggs
.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-flea-bite-look-like-on-humans">What Does Flea Bite Look Like On Humans?</h2>
<p>Fleas bites on humans appear like small and reddish dots that exist in 3-4 clusters or groups. The dots will have some light halo or redness surrounding them.
The bites and redness will mainly be found around the lower part of the human body - ankles, feet, lower legs, calves. However, if left alone, the fleas will move all over the body biting more parts of your skin.
Bites are tiny but have a red spot at the center - but when clustered, the bites will create a scab or line that&rsquo;s also irritating and painful to the person.</p>
<h2 id="are-flea-bites-dangerous-for-humans">Are Flea Bites Dangerous For Humans?</h2>
<h3 id="1-pulex-irritans-human-flea"><em>1. Pulex irritans (Human flea)�</em></h3>
<p>The CDC states that human fleas don&rsquo;t carry diseases that can infect humans when bitten. But these fleas may act as intermediate hosts for some parasitic tapeworms.</p>
<h3 id="2murine-typhus--cat-flea">*2.�*Murine Typhus -<em>Cat flea�</em></h3>
<p>Flea bites can cause Murine typhus in humans, mainly carried by rats and transferred to humans by fleas. Fleas defecate around the bite area, leaving the
*Rickettsia Typhi *
bacteria.
As noted earlier, cat fleas love pet hosts, including cats and dogs, compared to human hosts. However, cat fleas will also bite humans and cause diseases such as typhus, cat-scratch conditions, and plague.
Murine typhus in humans will be known by signs such as body aches, nausea, fever, and headache. In the first week, you&rsquo;ll see some rash on your body, legs, and arms.
Untreated Murine typhus will lead to other diseases like kidney disease and diabetes.</p>
<h3 id="3-cat-scratch-disease--chigoe-flea">3. Cat Scratch Disease -�Chigoe flea</h3>
<p>Bites from Chigoe fleas are equal dangers to humans as they&rsquo;ll lead to infections or sometimes amputation.
Chigoe flea can cause
Bartonella henselae
that&rsquo;ll trigger a scratch fever, particularly in cats and kittens. You&rsquo;ll notice the occurrence of this condition if the cat is lethargic or vomiting.
These fleas leave a wound that can attract infections and diseases. However, Chigoe
fleas won&rsquo;t carry any diseases as the other cat
fleas do.
The fleas will transmit the cat-scratch disease to humans through bites or the cat when they scratch, lick, or bite a human being&rsquo;s skin - particularly around scabbed or wounded skin areas.</p>
<h3 id="4mycoplasma-haemofelis--oriental-rat-flea">4.�Mycoplasma haemofelis -�Oriental Rat Flea</h3>

<ul>
<li>**Well, YES! the female gnats will bite humans &amp; animals (to feed on blood). But male gnats don&rsquo;t bite humans since they feed on plant juice and flower nectar. **</li>
<li><strong>Unlike bees and wasps, gnats don&rsquo;t sting (the insects have a jagged saw-like mouthpiece that cuts through the skin when sucking blood).�</strong>
Usually, a <a href="/posts/best-gnat-repellent/">Gnat</a> bite appears like a tiny reddish spot with moderate swelling on your skin surface. The swelling is itchy and very painful, especially when touched. The pain and swelling may take over a week to heal.

<h3 id="1-why-gnats-bite">1. Why Gnats Bite</h3>
<p>Female gnats, unlike male ones, bite humans and animals to acquire blood meals. Blood is an important food for female gnats, especially for their reproduction purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before laying eggs, gnats suck blood to boost their protein levels, which is necessary for bodybuilding and getting eggs ready.
Female gnats won&rsquo;t lay eggs until they get enough blood meal - they can travel over 50 miles in search of blood.
NB: Male gnats don&rsquo;t bite humans since they feed on flower nectar and plant juice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-how-gnat-bite---stages">2. How Gnat bite - stages</h3>
<p>Female gnats have jagged saw-like/serrated mouthparts (males don&rsquo;t have), which aid in cutting through human skin when sucking up blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike insects such as mosquitoes, female gnats don&rsquo;t suck blood by inserting their mouthparts into human skin, instead, they use mandibles to cut tiny holes(in the skin), through which they suck your blood.
When biting, female gnats release an anticoagulant substance into humans&rsquo; blood, which leads to severe pain and allergic reactions for those individuals that bite sensitively. Generally, female gnats bite happens in the following stages:
<strong>a. 1st Stage</strong>
The female gnats penetrate their mandibles into human skin.
<strong>b. 2nd Stage</strong>
This is the stage when gnats try to position their mouthparts inside your skin/wound. They actually anchor the syntrophic within the skin using laciniae.
<strong>c. 3rd Stage</strong>
This stage involves actual bloodsucking it feeding. Human blood is pumped into the gnats using a group of muscles (three) and two functional pumps that are separated by a food canal.
The blood-sucking process is sequential but complex in nature. However, the flow is synchronous and smooth - relative expansion and contractions.
<strong>4. 4th Stage</strong>
This is actually the escape stage when the female gnats remove laciniae and detach the syntrophium from human

<h3 id="3-gnat-bite-appearance">3. Gnat bite Appearance</h3>
<p>Usually, gnat bites look like pin-prick swells with tiny reddish marks/spots. The degree of redness differs, though in most cases, the color is pale (for a few bites) and otherwise darker (for multiple bites).</p>
<ul>
<li>Gnat bites are very painful (due to toxic anticoagulant substances) and the bites are characterized by an itchy feeling, which is severe when touched/scratched.
Further, gnat bite forms medium swelling that may take one to two weeks to heal. Unlike other insects bites, gnat bite blood spread beneath the skin surface or around the swelling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-diseases-transmitted-by-gnat-bite">4. Diseases Transmitted by Gnat bite</h3>
<p>Gnat&rsquo;s bite transmits disease such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leishmania - this causes severe cut sores on human skin</li>
<li>Carrison&rsquo;s disease - bacteria disease transmitted through gnat infectious bite</li>
<li>River blindness - this disease causes the victim to lose their sight with time</li>
<li>Toscanca &amp; Plunta toto virus - an infectious viral disease</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-symptoms-of-a-gnat-bite">5. Symptoms of a Gnat Bite</h3>
<p>Gnat bite has some of the following signs and symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medium reddish swelling or spots</li>
<li>Severe pain on the bitten section</li>
<li>Reddish marks on human skin</li>
<li>Itchy feelings</li>
<li>Burning sensation or skin irritation on bitten section</li>
<li>Allergic reactions on the bitten skin surface due to anticoagulant reaction</li>
<li>Difficulty in breathing - about 2% of victims</li>
<li>Fever after sometimes</li>
<li>Skin discomfort</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-gnat-bite-treatment">6. Gnat Bite Treatment</h3>
<p>In case you are bitten by gnats, you can undertake the following treatment measures:
<strong>a. Apply pain relief or anti-itch medicine</strong>
Apply anti-itch medicine (antihistamine) on the bite gently to relieve pain - this diagnosis depends on the extent of the bites and pain felt.
Avoid rubbing or scratching the bitten area since this may open up room for bacterial infections.
<strong>b. Disinfect Bitten Skin surface</strong>
Clean the area with treated warm water and soap gently/thoroughly. Alternatively, you can use other disinfectants such as vinegar or alcohol-based solvent. Finally, cover the wound with a clean piece of clothes lightly.
<strong>c. Apply Antiseptic swab</strong>
Gently, apply antiseptic swab (over the wound surface). Leave the solvent to kill germs and pathogens that may be transmitted by gnats. Leave to would to heal - don&rsquo;t rub the bitten area.
<strong>d. Visit the doctor in case you notice these symptoms;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have breathing problem</li>
<li>Green fluid or yellow drain coming from the wound (bite)</li>
<li>Excessive swelling around the bites</li>
<li>Abnormal swelling/inflammation on the chest, mouth, or throat.

<h2 id="how-can-you-avoid-gnats-bite">How Can you Avoid Gnats Bite?</h2>
<p>The following are possible ways of avoiding gnats bite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desist from using scented lotion, cologne, or perfume when you go for outdoor activities - such scents attract biting gnats like sand gnats.</li>
<li>Use a table fan or pedestal when relaxing on your yard or porch - it helps you locate gnats easily.</li>
<li>Often, wear a full neck, long pants, and a full sleeve shirt in order to minimize any uncovered body parts.</li>
<li>Install a fine fiberglass window screen for your house and patio - it makes it difficult for gnats to penetrate in.</li>
<li>Consider applying DEET repellant when going for outdoor activities - this keeps biting gnats away.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-attracts-gnats-in-your-place">What Attracts Gnats in Your place</h2>
<p>If you have gnats infestation in your place, chances are that either of the following attracts them:</p>
<h3 id="1-vegetables-and-fruits">1. Vegetables and Fruits</h3>
<p>Gnats (especially males) are highly attracted by ripe fruits - male gnats feed on fruits. Also, vegetables (mainly succulent) are good sources of gnat meal.
Whether it&rsquo;s your house or garden, ripe or rotting fruits/vegetables have a strong scent that pulls the gnats into the vicinity.</p>
<h3 id="2-moisture">2. Moisture</h3>
<p>Gnats usually breed in moist places such as wet windows, wet rags, garbage bins, or overwatered plants. Female gnats lay 150-500 eggs at once, which hatch in a couple of days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moisture favors the growth of body tissues (for larvae) and prevalent check from one stage to another in their life cycle.
Leaking pipes, vents, moist potting soil, beneath the sink, food spillage, or kitchen store are possible places you need to ensure that they are dry so as to prevent gnats infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-source-of-light">3. Source of Light</h3>
<p>Bright light is critical for gnats&rsquo; movement in the dark - it provides a pathway for gnats to locate places they want to land.
You will note gnats moving to areas such as light fixtures, bulbs, LEDs, disco lights, and lamps. Attach gnats repellant to such items in case you spot an infestation in your home.</p>
<h3 id="4-human-beings">4. Human beings</h3>
<p>Household gnats, especially female gnats, are attracted to humans as that the primary source of food (they suck blood).</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, carbon dioxide, mucus, tears, sweat, body heat are attractants that bring gnats to your place too.
In addition, perfume, lotion, detergents, and hairspray attract gnats as well. You need to limit such chemical use and maintain high body hygiene to stop gnats from visiting your place.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-decaying-organic-matters">5. Decaying organic matters</h3>
<p>Gnats love rotting flowers and plants - they feed on them as food (male gnats). Organic materials such as mold, moss, compound refuse, and fungi are great sources of food for gnats; thus, will attract gnats too.
Clean all organic matters in your place (especially the rotting ones) as preventive measures.

<h2 id="how-can-i-prevent-gnat-infestation">How Can I Prevent Gnat Infestation</h2>
<p>The following are ways that will help prevent future gnats infestation in your place:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce plants watering frequency, especially indoor plants - moisture is gnats attractant</li>
<li>Store foodstuff like fruits in a refrigerator, if possible- this kills the scent, which attracts gnats</li>
<li>Empty trash bins daily and clean them thoroughly and seal all bins used either inside or outside your house.</li>
<li>Minimize moisture in your home - drain tunnel, seal leaks, dry moist surface.</li>
<li>Remove and clean drinks/food leftovers - food spillage attracts gnats</li>
<li>Avoid using strong scented perfumes and cologne in your place, especially at night</li>
<li>Always spray gnat repellent in your home (where need be) to keep off gnats from your place

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on do gnats bite humans, the direct answer is yes. Most gnat species bite humans in search of a blood meal. Usually, gnats have a jagged saw-like mouthpiece, which cuts through humans&rsquo; or animals&rsquo; skin when sucking blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike bees and wasps, gnats don&rsquo;t sting. Actually, the female gnats are the ones that bite humans and animals since they feed on a blood meal. Contrary, male gnats feed on flower nectar and other plant juice hence, they won&rsquo;t bite humans.
The gnat bites appear like tiny reddish spots/marks with medium size swellings on your skin. The swellings are very painful and itchy (especially when scratched).
The pain and swelling may take over a week to heal. More so, gnat bite will transmit diseases such as river blindness, carrison, sandy fever among others. Therefore, preventive measures highlighted in this article should be put into place. Importantly, seek medical attention instantly in case you get bitten by gnats and the condition is deteriorating.</li>

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255965/">bedbug</a>
bites.
<strong>Both these bites swell up and can be itchy, so here are some tips thatll help you tell the difference between them:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fleas prefer animal blood but can drink human blood as well. Whereas bedbugs only drink human blood.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flea bites appear to be red, swollen, and hard. Bedbug bites, on the other hand, seem to have a dark red spot in the center of the bitten and raised area of the skin.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fleas tend to <a href="/posts/do-fleas-bite-humans/">bite</a> randomly over the body, and you might notice clusters of three dots together. Bedbugs, however, tend to bite their hosts strategically in a pattern of a linear row, you can find a group of 10 or more together.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flea bites can be found on the lower half of the body, in places like ankles, calves, or moist areas such as elbows and knees bends. Whereas, bedbug bites are found in the upper half of the body in areas such as the neck, arms, shoulders, and back.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cat ScratchingLets go into detail about all the things that make the two bites different, as well as how to deal with them.</p>
<h2 id="flea-bites-vs-bedbug-bites--the-physical-differences">Flea Bites vs. Bedbug Bites  The Physical Differences</h2>
<p>As both the insects are small in size and feed on blood, the result of their bites look almost the same. However, if you have the right information, you can easily differentiate between the two. Its crucial that you identify them correctly if you want to succeed at the pest control battle against these blood-sucking pests.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-the-bite-occur">Where Does the Bite Occur?</h3>
<p>**Flea Bites **
are expected to occur in the lower parts of your body like your legs, ankle and feet. They are likely to be found in any area where the skin folds such as around the waist and under your arms.
**Bed Bug Bites **
usually appear in the upper areas of your body such as your face, neck, hand and arms. However, at times they can appear anywhere on your body.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-bite-look-like">What Does the Bite Look Like?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
appear in clusters, and look like small bumps surrounded by red patches. They look quite similar to mosquito bites as theyre itchy and might break if you scratch them too much. Since fleas tend to jump, youd notice that the bites would be scattered all over your skin.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
also result in red, small and round bumps. These bites usually have a dark red spot thats raised at the center. Theyre itchy and if you make the mistake of scratching them, itll become worse and you can end up with blisters. As bedbugs crawl on your skin, the bites mostly appear in a linear pattern. They bite several times in the same place before moving on.</p>

<h3 id="what-reaction-does-the-bite-cause">What Reaction Does the Bite Cause?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
might not cause any reaction for some people; others at the same time can suffer from horrible reactions causing you to scratch your skin. It all depends on the sensitivity of your skin. Scratching them may lead to a secondary infection. It triggers hives or an allergy attack for people who have sensitive skin or tend to have strong allergic responses to insect bites.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
would show different reactions for different people depending on the sensitivity of their skin. You might feel the urge to scratch them but the irritation doesnt last for more than a week. People with sensitive skin might experience serious allergic reactions causing you to develop hives or blisters.</p>
<h3 id="can-the-bites-lead-to-infection">Can the Bites Lead to Infection?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
are quite dangerous, as fleas are prospective carriers and transmitters of human diseases, like typhus. They might pass on cat scratch fever to your feline pet thats transferable to humans as well. Fleas are known to host tapeworms, which can make their way to your family and your pets.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
however are much safer, as they arent known to cause any disease. They can, however, be itchy and lead to allergic reactions for some people. Scratching the bites might expose your skin and result in secondary infections. Other than that, they dont pose any major health risks.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-do-they-last">How Long Do They Last?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
heal depending on the sensitivity of your skin, and might take between one day and two weeks. Many might not experience any severe reaction to the bite, and would notice the symptoms disappearing within a day or two.</p>
<p>However, if you have sensitive skin, you might have a more serious reaction to flea bites, as well as itchiness and swelling resulting from the fleas saliva thats left behind on your skin. As a result of continuous scratching, you may end up with severe blisters on your skin that can take up to two weeks to heal.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
might take different time to heal for each individual. The bites usually stay for about two weeks. If you dont have very sensitive skin, itll take less than a week for the effects of the bite to go away. Some of you may be lucky enough to not experience any symptoms at all.</p>
<p>However, if your skin has an allergic reaction to bedbug bites, you can experience severe reactions. The bites will be extremely itchy and you may not be able to resist the urge to scratch them constantly, resulting in blisters that usually take long time to heal.</p>
<p>Now that youve identified whether its a flea bite or a bed bug bite, you need to know how to treat them. If youre lucky enough not to be one of their victims, learn preventive methods so you can stay safe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if youre already scratching yourself, youve got an infestation on your hands. But you dont have to let go of your beloved pet or set your bed on fire to get rid of these parasitic pests. Weve got a simple way out for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-treat-the-bites">How to Treat the Bites?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bite</strong>
treatments require you to keep the bitten area clean, so wash it daily with soap and water. To reduce the chances of allergic reactions, incorporate an oral antihistamine in your treatment. Get hold of a soothing antipruitic (anti-itch) cream thatll ease the itching on your skin, ensuring that you dont end up with a secondary bacterial infection. To reduce inflammation, consult your doctor regarding a topical steroid that you can use. If the bite doesnt heal and seems to get worse, visit your doctor for an antibiotic prescription.</p>
<p>To treat the bites naturally, you can use Aloe Vera gel to lessen the itchiness and redness. For healing, use black or green tea to wash the area of the bite.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
become worse when you scratch them. To deal with the swelling and itchiness, you can apply a topical anti-itch cream or calamine lotion to the bites. For pain, an over-the-counter pain reliever should be sufficient. If the bites persists for more than two weeks, even after your home is infestation free, or youve developed a secondary infection, go visit a doctor. They may prescribe you an antibiotic.</p>
<p>For a treatment that you can do at home on your own, use water and baking soda and mix them together make a paste. Apply the mixture on the bite directly, and wash it off after an hour.</p>

, or
<a href="https://www.webmd.com/allergies/guide/allergic-reaction-causes">allergic reactions</a>
, and you may require some soothing treatment. In this article, I&rsquo;ll describe how to treat ant bites; what should I do?
<strong>To treat ant bites, hydrocortisone cream &amp; antihistamine will ease the itching. Wash the bite area using water &amp; soap, then smear some antiseptic and an antiseptic like calamine or hydrocortisone.�</strong>
<strong>If there is swelling around the ant bite area, cold-compress that place with an ice pack. Other DIY remedies include apple cider vinegar, olive oil, baking soda &amp; lemon juice, salt, toothpaste, cucumber, and honey.�</strong>
Let&rsquo;s check the details!</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-bites-or-stings-from-ants"><strong>Signs of Bites or Stings from Ants�</strong></h2>
<p>The signs you&rsquo;ll get following the <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">ant</a> bites include pain and itching especially if you&rsquo;re attacked by many ants in a swarm.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, you&rsquo;ll notice that bites from other ant species are less intense compared to the ones caused by fire ants.
General ant bites are less uncomfortable, less itchy or painful, and less red.
The ant bites could also trigger allergic reactions, some redness, and possible swelling. However, observe if the allergic reactions might be extreme since this could be dangerous.
Check for extreme allergic reactions from ant bites; some signs could include dizziness, confusion, tongue &amp; tongue swelling, intense itching &amp; burning, and challenges breathing.

<h2 id="details-how-to-treat-ant-bites-what-should-i-do">Details: How to Treat Ant Bites; What Should I Do?</h2>
<p>An ant bite will leave an itchy (small and painful) lump that will get better within 1 hour. But you could get a tiny or large blister around the ant bite area within 24 hours.</p>
<h3 id="1-soap--water---get-relief-from-ant-bites">1. Soap + Water - Get Relief from Ant Bites</h3>
<p>Experts advise that you treat the ant bites using soap &amp; water - simply wash the bite area with the soap + water and then cover it using some bandage.
You should also apply some ice on the ant bite area to reduce the pain. Other treatments include topical treatments such as antihistamines and steroid creams (over-the-counter).</p>
<ul>
<li>Other professionals approve of using some DIY ant-bites treatment made from<a href="http://fireant.tamu.edu/files/2011/12/FAPFS023_2002rev_Medical.pdf">bleach and water</a>.</li>
<li>Another solution would be using astringents, aloe vera, and diluted ammonium - these will offer relative relief.
Further, the bite or sting marks caused by the ants will be finished within a week.</li>
<li>However, scratches on the bite area could trigger further infection - and thus the bite or sting bite marks may remain longer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2avoid-contact">2.�Avoid Contact</h3>
<p>Besides treating the ant bites, avoidance is considered an effective technique too.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, when you notice an ant nest, it would be great if you avoid the urge to disturb the insect&rsquo;s homes.
Further, when playing or working in the outdoor spaces, it&rsquo;ll be great if you wear socks and shoes.
Besides, if ants attach you or your kids, you&rsquo;ll need to move off the nest and also brush them off from your clothes or body - but ensure you&rsquo;re having some gloves on to avoid further bites.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll find it challenging to control thecolonies of fire ants- you may use some ant poison baits such as piretherine if you apply them regularly.
I would advise you to use the ant baits in the fall season as it&rsquo;ll be most effective since the insects have reduced activity.</li>
<li>Further, to finish the fire ants in their anthill, pour some boiling water onto it as this will kill the ants. But take care since the surviving ants could launch biting attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-honey"><strong>3. Honey</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe you already know that sugar and honey droplets left behind could attract some ants to the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>But do you realize that honey may also be used to relieve the pain &amp; discomfort that comes from ants - while also reducing itching, swelling, and redness?
Luckily, if you need immediate ants&rsquo; bite relief, honey will be an excellent remedy.
So, simply apply some hone drops on the ants&rsquo; bite area.

<h3 id="4-baking-soda--lemon-juice">**4. Baking Soda &amp; **<strong>Lemon Juice�</strong></h3>
<p>Baking soda &amp; lemon juice are critical DIY elements that can help stop the pain &amp; discomfort that arise from ant bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if you have some lemons in the yard, you might find them helpful in tackling that ant bite challenge. Simply cut that fruit, squeeze some quice and drop it into a bowl.
I recommend you apply the lemon juice directly onto the ant bite area - this has in the past given me quick relief.
As with the lemon juice, baking soda too will also help ease your pain and discomfort.</li>
<li>I know that you may already have some baking soda in the house or<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">bathroom</a>- it&rsquo;ll work as a great alternative.
Simply mix some 3 teaspoons of the baking soda with some water and mix to create some thick paste.</li>
<li>Next, apply that basking soda mixture onto the area affected by the ant bite.
So, the baking soda &amp; lemon juice will work well in reducing that discomfort or pain that is caused by the ant bite.
<strong>5. Apple Cider Vinegar�</strong>
Likewise, Apple Cider Vinegar is a common ingredient in most kitchens - it&rsquo;s loved for various purposes.</li>
<li>However, the substance has acidic features - apple cider vinegar will ease the itching and pain on the ant bite area.
But make sure to mix that apple cider vinegar with enough water prior to applying it to the bite area.
So, if you&rsquo;ve stepped onto some ant bed, the apple cider vinegar will be excellent - you may soak some cotton into the solution and apply it to the bite area.</li>
<li>This apple cider vinegar will finish that itchy and painful bite from ants including the fire ants.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-olive-oil-and-c"><strong>6. Olive Oil and C****ucumber</strong></h3>
<p>Olive oil will also be a suitable remedy when trying to treat or cool down the pain or itching that arises from the ant bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>The oleocanthal in the olive oil will prevent inflammation�from the enzymes.
You&rsquo;ll require just some of the oil on your palm and smear it on the ant bite area - and you&rsquo;ll get pain relief.</li>
<li>Cucumber will also be great on the ant bite - simply cut it into some slices and apply the gel on your ant bite.

<h2 id="spider-bite-vs-bed-bug-bite-top-7-difference">Spider Bite Vs Bed Bug Bite: Top 7 Difference?</h2>
<h3 id="a-physical-appearance">a. Physical appearance</h3>
<p>Bedbug&rsquo;s bite is usually small and appears as a reddish bump on the skin surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bites are multiple/several/clusters in numbers. Contrary, a spider&rsquo;s bite appears as a single swollen mark.
The outlook feature of the bedbug&rsquo;s bite usually leaves fang marks on the surface, especially if it&rsquo;s from species such as the black widow spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-size-of-bite-mark">b. Size of Bite Mark</h3>
<p>The size of the bite mark from a spider is usually big/wide (deep fangs can be seen when the bite is still flesh), whereas the size of the bedbug&rsquo;s bite is small - no visible marks at times.
Further, the
<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/need-know-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/)/">bedbug&rsquo;s bite</a>
may appear like a flat patch on the skin or tiny-pus rashes.

<h3 id="c-number-of-bites">c. Number of Bites</h3>
<p>Spider leaves one <a href="/posts/flea-bites-vs-bed-bug-bites/">bite</a> at a time in a given surface/location, while bedbug carries multiple bites (clusters) in a given surface/point - you will see small shallow marks or swellings on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="d-signs-and-symptoms">d. Signs and Symptoms</h3>
<p>The outstanding symptoms of a spider&rsquo;s bite include high blood pressure, large swelling, severe pain, paralysis, increased heartbeats, muscle cramping, headache, nausea, and a high breathing rate.
Contrary, bedbugs symptoms include red swollen bumps, itchy rashes/blisters (with pus), smelly odor on the surface, and prevalent painful sensation.</p>
<h3 id="e-duration-of-bitewould">e. Duration of Bite/would</h3>
<p>Upon being bitten, the spider&rsquo;s bite may take one week (7days) to heal, particularly when the right treatment is undertaken.
However, the bedbug&rsquo;s bite will take a slightly longer period (one to two weeks - 14 days) to heal under proper medication.</p>
<h3 id="f-degree-of-bite-pain">f. Degree of Bite Pain</h3>
<p>The fact that the spider&rsquo;s bite is deeper and larger as compared to that of the bedbug, the bite mark on your skin is more painful and may bleed profusely for some time.
Further, the venom injected into your body worsens human health conditions through intoxication and paralysis  this is more pronounced if bitten by some particular species of spiders like the black widow.
Bedbug&rsquo;s bite is sharp and short-lived on bite onset. However, the reddish pimples formed on the skin later generate an itchy feeling that makes one scratch themselves in search of relief.</p>
<h3 id="g-bite-location">g. Bite Location</h3>
<p>Spider&rsquo;s bites are usually found on the fingers, arms, and legs (these are areas bitten mostly), while bedbug bites almost all parts of the body i.e. legs, arms, face, neck, torso, feet, and back.
Further, the bedbug bites either appear as a linear pattern or cluster on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="h-severity-of-bite">h. Severity of Bite</h3>
<p>Most spiders bites are known to be more venomous than bedbugs. Black widow and
brown recluse spider
bites inject hemotoxic venom that impairs the human response system and paralyzes the immune system, thus leading to death with time.
Most spider bites lead to large swollen proportions that may lead to severe wounds if not attended to instantly.
On the contrary basis, bedbug&rsquo;s bites never go beyond mere pimples, which appear like red boils with under-skin pus.
Though the bedbug&rsquo;s bite takes a slightly longer time to heal as compared to the spider&rsquo;s counterpart, the intensity of pain is less severe/painful - the pain fades away easily.

<h3 id="i-biting-time">i. Biting Time</h3>
<p>Usually, bedbugs bite night more than daytime. They tend to be more active in dark than a day  they are nocturnal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The light scares the bedbugs into their hideouts. On the other hand, spider bites during the day than at night.
The presence of light is a key factor that helps the spider to locate the biting point (either leg, arm, or fingers). This doesn&rsquo;t mean that a spider can&rsquo;t bite you at night - however, the chances are limited.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="j-bite-frequency">j. Bite Frequency</h3>
<p>Spider normally bites once at a given point (one bite and then runs always), while the bedbug may bite several times on a particular skin surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, unlike bedbugs, spiders tend to bite only when you threaten them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-ways-of-preventing-spiderbedbug-bite">Best Ways of Preventing Spider/Bedbug Bite?</h2>
<p>Spider or Bedbug bite may not be a comfortable encounter, especially if you are new to the ordeal.

<h2 id="how-to-treat-spiderbedbug-bite">How to Treat Spider/Bedbug Bite</h2>
<p>In case a spider or bedbug bites you, consider any of the following treatment approaches:</p>
<h3 id="a-spider-treatment-methods">a. Spider Treatment Methods</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using Plantain</strong>- smear the flesh plantain on the spider bite area. This helps draw and neutralize the venom before a reaction takes place. Further, the fluid reduces severe reaction, swelling, and prevents anaphylactic shock.</li>
<li><strong>Activated Charcoal</strong>- rub activated charcoal on the spider bite gently and leave it for five minutes before cleaning. Rub once more and repeat this daily until the skin heals. The activated charcoal has high absorption properties that remove toxic venom and reduces acute pain</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>- dissolve baking soda in warm water and wipe the bitten area gently. The alkaline substance (in baking soda) reduces inflammation, itching, pain, and draws out the venom</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Meat Tenderizer</strong>- rub meat tenderizer onto spider bitten part, softly. The papain enzyme in the tenderizer breaks down the proteinaceous toxins in the bites, thus eliminating inflammation as well as itching/swelling occurrences.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for antihistamine medicine</strong>- apply for antihistamine medicine on the spider bitten area after washing the part with soap and warm water. The medicine helps in reducing itching, swelling as well as in preventing intoxication.</li>
<li><strong>Get Tetanus Booster</strong>- for a poisonous spider bite, it&rsquo;s advisable to take a tetanus injection booster to prevent intoxication and paralysis, which may be fatal if not attended to in time. This should be taken instantly if you note symptoms such as breathing difficulties and heart palpitations problems.

<h3 id="b-bedbug-treatment-methods">b.� Bedbug Treatment Methods</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using Diatomaceous earth</strong>- Gently, rub diatomaceous earth on the bedbug bitten area and leave it for 10minutes before washing. Repeat the same two to three times. The active substance in diatomaceous earth reduces swelling and itching feelings that escalate if not attended to in time.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrocortisone cream</strong>- Apply the cream on the bitten section and leave it to heal with time. The paste does not only act as a pain relaxer but prevents swelling and curb further intoxication.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Antihistamine medicine</strong>- apply or get an antihistamine injection to prevent intoxication and further swelling of the bitten skin area. This should be carried out as soon as you discover the bite is bedbugs.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Herbal Lotion</strong>- consider applying herbal lotion over any bedbug bite since the compound contains components that prevent intoxication and swelling. Further, the herbal concoction acts as a pain relaxer too.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On spider bite vs bedbug bite, youll need to check on indicators such as the physical appearance of the bite, size of the bite mark, the number of bites on the surface/body, duration of bite to heal, location of the bite as well as the degree of pain instilled when you got bitten, in order to differentiate between the two.</p>

<h2 id="details-spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite-what-bit-me">Details: Spider Bite vs Mosquito Bite; What Bit Me?</h2>
<h3 id="1-different-in-bite-appearance">1. Different in Bite Appearance?</h3>
<p><em>a. Mosquito bite�</em>
Mosquito bites to animals and humans mainly come from their females to get that blood meal - enabling great egg production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using their proboscis (mouthpart), mosquitos pierce your skin and suck blood.</li>
<li>Its saliva causes your skin to itch and bump. For some people, the effect is more strong redness, soreness, and swelling.
The appearance of a mosquito bite include:</li>
<li>Dark spots on the skin resembling some bruises</li>
<li>Further, mosquito bites will result in reddish and puffy bumps that&rsquo;ll appear some minutes following the bite.</li>
<li>They cause reddish-brown, itchy, and hard bumps - which could also be multiple bumps that&rsquo;ll appear within the day after the bite.
Individuals who&rsquo;ll get adverse effects from mosquito bites include kids and adults that have immune system disorders or those who&rsquo;ve not previously been bitten by these bugs.
Further, mosquito bites reactions may have severe reactions including;</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
<li>Hives</li>
<li>Low-grade fever</li>
<li>Wide-area skin redness and swelling
<em>b. Spider Bite�</em>
The charactratics of spider bites from spiders such as the lack of widow spiders include pinprick-like, sharp, and immediate pain.
Also, the bite location will be numb.�Additional symptoms for bites from the black widow spider are;</li>
<li>Itchy skin rash</li>
<li>Excessive sweating</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Stiffness in the back, chest, shoulders, and painful muscle cramps</li>
<li>Vomiting and nausea</li>
<li>Excessive saliva production</li>
<li>Swollen and droopy eyes</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing
However, some of the bites from the spiders won&rsquo;t be immediately noticeable or painful. But the spider bite pain could be faced within 1 hour.
For the brown recluse, the spider bite symptoms will include;</li>
<li>The Bite area will have an itchy skin</li>
<li>Could lead to a skin ulcer and blisters (and later result in scars) - which start with reddish skin or bruises.
Finally, bites by Hobo spiders - and its bite on your skin will include;</li>
<li>Cognitive impairment</li>
<li>Nausea.</li>
<li>Fatigue.</li>
<li>Pus-producing blisters</li>
<li>Swollen and red skin</li>
<li>Hardened bite-area skin</li>
<li>Severe headache that beings shortly after getting bitten - and the headache could remain active for about a week.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-causes-high-risk-illnesses">2. Causes High-Risk** i**llnesses?</h3>
<p><em>a. Mosquito bite�</em>
Mosquito bites will result in pink, red &amp; rounded, plus itchy bumps. But this bite could result in severe illnesses like eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), malaria, West Nile virus, and Zika virus.
Zika virus will, for many humans, result in a flu-like illness. However, newborns from mothers infected with this virus could get microcephaly�birth defects.
The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com">CDC notes</a>
that the West Nile virus was (in 2019) spread over 47 states of the US.</p>
<ul>
<li>The virus symptoms will be evident within 2 - 14 days - these include skin rash, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, body aches, and headaches.
Further, humans that get West Nile that&rsquo;s severe may develop encephalitis, meningitis, and other signs like convulsions, high fever, disorientation, severe headache, and neck stiffness.</li>
<li>But mosquitoes will largely infect humans with malaria - but the malaria cases have malaria transmission in the US.
The malaria flu will result in symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, muscle aches, headache, and fever. However, CDC notes that malaria is treatable &amp; preventable.
Another mosquito species known as
<em>Aedes scapularis is found in Latin and Caribbean America but also in Florida - as noted by the JMEntomology.�</em>
<em>b. Spider Bite�</em>
Spider bites won&rsquo;t largely result in grave problems. However, you could experience pain, swelling, and redness around the area with the spider bite.</li>
<li>But bites from spiders like the hobo spiders, brown recluse, and the black widow may result in more grave effects
Such effects may include muscle cramps that are painful, severe headaches, and trouble breathing - such effects from spider bites could need urgent medical care.
But how serious are these spider bites? Well, bites from most spiders will be harmless. All spiders will have the venom poison but many of them have small fangs that won&rsquo;t easily puncture the skin of a human.
So, which spider species will be venomous to humans? From the over 60 spider species, but only a few of these spiders will be dangerous - these include:</li>
<li>**Hobo spiders -**The brown-colored hobo spiders have a herringbone (V-shaped) of their belly - mainly occupying the Pacific Northwest. You&rsquo;ll find them on woodpiles, window wells, crawl spaces, moist &amp; dark basements - areas where they&rsquo;ll create their funnel-shaped webs.</li>
<li>**Brown recluses - **Also referred to all the violin or fiddle-back spiders, the spiders largely found in the Southern and Midwestern states. You&rsquo;ll largely find them in sheltered and dry places like on leaves, rocks, piles of wood. Also, you can find them in shoes, attics, and dark closets.</li>
<li>**Black widows -**These back window species will mainly occupy the outhouses, fence, woodpiles, and building eaves (overhangs) - and largely occupy the Southern &amp; Western U.S. Their belly has an hourglass shape that is colored red.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-difference-in-treatment-of-spider-and-mosquito-bites">The difference in Treatment of Spider and Mosquito Bites</h2>
<p>After identifying that bite, it&rsquo;s important to use the right technique to treat the various bug bites.
<strong>Treating Spider Bites:�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by quickly locating that spider which bit you. You might need to search those hiding or dark areas - this will help you identify if the bite is toxic.</li>
<li>For toxic spider bites such as from Brown recluse or Black Widow spider, you&rsquo;ll require emergency medical treatment.</li>
<li>Avoid home treatment if their spider at hand is noted to inject toxic through their bites</li>
<li>Thoroughly clean the spider bite, if the spider is identified as being non-toxic, and this will help avoid further infection</li>
<li>In addition, to prevent an additional allergic reaction from that spider bite, I advise you take some antihistamine
<strong>Treating Mosquito Bites:�</strong></li>
<li>Compared to the bites from ticks or spiders, mosquito bites are known to be largely harmless</li>
<li>So, unless there are serious symptoms such as fever or nausea, you won&rsquo;t require to take those drastic measures</li>
<li>To stop the skin itching after the mosquito bite, I recommend you rub some baking soda or salt.</li>
<li>For those with no sensitive skin or even younger kids, you can use calamine lotion</li>
<li>Further, for mosquito bites, you may use some mild treatments such as honey, tea bags, and ice.
In summary, compared to mosquito bites, some of the spider bites will be more toxic and life-threatening.
But with mosquito bites, it&rsquo;s important to take appropriate prevention steps while also controlling the resulting diseases plus easing the biting pain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On spider bite vs mosquito bite, in summary, that unsettling bite bump on your body could be from a mosquito or spider.
Spiders bites that are largely poisonous are the tarantula, hobo spider, black widow, and brown recluse.</p>
<ul>
<li>But mosquitoes will bite even when they&rsquo;re not threatened - mosquitoes aim to suck mosquitoes for reproduction and nutrition.</li>

      <description>The legs of fleas have strong claws and proboscis (tiny needles) that&amp;#39;ll help the pest bite the skin of the hosts such as cats,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legs of <a href="/posts/can-fleas-bite-through-clothes/">fleas</a> have strong claws and proboscis (tiny needles) that&rsquo;ll help the pest bite the skin of the hosts such as cats,
dogs
, and even humans.
**Why do <a href="/posts/do-fleas-bite-humans/">flea</a> bites itch? Well, fleas will bite humans and pets where they&rsquo;ll secrete some saliva into the blood - which the host&rsquo;s body and blood take as an allergen. **
<strong>The immune system will send histamine to counter the allergen (flea saliva) and thus the chemical triggers itching and swelling.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-why-do-flea-bites-itch">Details: Why Do Flea Bites Itch?</h2>
<p>The flea saliva will be taken like an allergen triggering your immune systems to release histamine that will irritate your skin and trigger itching.
But how will flea bites appear on humans? You&rsquo;ll notice the flea bites are discolored, small bumps that could be in the form of a cluster or line.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea bites will likely be on the human ankles, calves, and feet. So, rarely will the flea bites be found above the human knees unless the person is lying down or sitting down.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="itching--scratching---how-else-can-you-identify-flea-bites">Itching &amp; Scratching - How Else Can you Identify Flea bites</h2>
<p>Fleas bites are unlike other insect bites - I&rsquo;ve noted above that they&rsquo;ll be discolored (small) bumps on your skin that&rsquo;ll be itchy, and may trigger scratching.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, you may see come discolored rings that could develop around the flea bite area.</li>
<li>However, flea bites won&rsquo;t cause swelling like other insects bites such as by mosquitoes.
Also, the location and pattern of the flea bites will be unique compared to other insects - the flea bites appear in a cluster or on some straight line.</li>
<li>On location, flea bites largely appear on the human ankles, calves, and feet - below your knees.
Thus, I would recommend you inspect for flea on the pets including cats &amp; dogs. Check if the pers are restless or scratching - this could be indicators of flea bites.

</ul>
<h2 id="flea-bites-wont-stop-itching-what-should-i-do">Flea Bites Won&rsquo;t Stop itching; What Should I do?</h2>
<p>First, I must say that it isn&rsquo;t advisable to see those flea bite areas. This could lead to skin breakage and may trigger further infection.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, if you break the skin, I advise you to clean the area using some soap &amp; water and finally cover the bite area using a bandage.
Further, a doctor can help in easing the pain or itching caused by flea bites.</li>
<li>Despite that flea bites will raim just a number of days. You may use home remedies and OTC products to help in stopping the itching.
Although some DIY fleabites treatment options could work well, you should counsel the healthcare professionals prior to using such products to avoid allergic reactions.
<strong>1. Hydrocortisone</strong></li>
<li>The corticosteroid Hydrocortisone when mixed with some anesthetic will help relieve the pain from flea bites.</li>
<li>Also, the Hydrocortisone combination will relieve the swelling. I advise you to apply that combination on the flea bite like an ointment or cream.
<strong>2. Antihistamines</strong></li>
<li>An antihistamine, as noted earlier, will help ease the pain caused by flea bites.</li>
<li>The immune systems will release the histamine chemical (which causes itching) once it reaches an allergen - the flea saliva is taken like an allergen by the immune system.</li>
<li>Thus, the antihistamine drug or pill will counter the histamine (once applied on the flea bite).
<strong>3. Chamomile tea</strong></li>
<li>Using some chamomile flowers that are dried will have flavonoids and terpenoids that will work as a natural antihistamine or antioxidant.</li>
<li>Further, a DIY technique that you can use is to add the tea bag (with chamomile) into some water.</li>
<li>Allow that teabag to settle for about 20 minutes up to the right color (gold-brown).</li>
<li>Next, get that teabag out of the water and squeeze all the water from that teabag.</li>
<li>Finally, press that tea bag onto the flea bite allowing about 10 minutes before wiping the flea bite clean.
<strong>3. Ice</strong></li>
<li>Presing ice packs on a flea bite (or any skin locations) will cut the blood volume that flows to that location. This reduced blood will reduce itchiness, swelling, inflammation, and pain.</li>
<li>You should cover that ice pack with a light towel before placing it on the flea bite for about 10 minutes - this will provide excellent relief.
Use the ice pack or some towel-wrapped frozen vegetables wrapped to help ease the skin numbness, relieve swelling, and soothe your skin irritation.
<strong>4. Oatmeal -�</strong>
Oat flakes and oatmeal have long been used for soothing itching, rashes, and skin irritation - and it&rsquo;ll be helpful with flea bites.</li>
<li>You can use a number of products that contact oat flakes or oatmeal; these include products like shampoo, body wash, and lotion.
Otherwise, for oatmeal, mix some warm water with 1-2 tablespoons of the oatmeal before soaking your lower legs or feet in that solution for about fifteen minutes.</li>
<li>Also, you may grind the oatmeal into some colloidal oatmeal (fine powder) using some appropriate food processor such as a blender.</li>
<li>Then create some sticky (thick) oatmeal mixed with water and the colloidal oatmeal.</li>
<li>Finally, cover the flea bites using the colloidal oatmeal mixture - and allow about ten minutes before wiping off that oatmeal mixture from the flea bite.
<strong>5. Aloe vera</strong>
-�Aloe vera is widely used as a DIY treatment for sunburns but it&rsquo;s also an important remedy to treat flea bites.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll simply apply the alow vera gel onto the flea bite to ease the discomfort, itchiness, and redness.
The succulent Aloe vera gel has salicylic acid - this is what will reduce pain and itchiness when applied on the flea bite.
<strong>6.�Honey</strong></li>
<li>Honey is also a popular product in DIY remedies and it has antimicrobial properties that will help ease pain and itching.</li>
<li>The catalase enzyme in the hone will help ease the pain and skin inflammation.
I recommend using unprocessed honey onto the flea bite - and you may put some bandage on the flea bite as not doing it may cause messy stickiness.</li>

both humans and pets
using a combination of techniques. But first, you may examine the fur on your pet&rsquo;s belly, back, neck, and ears.
<strong>1. Vacuum</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flea vacuuming your space will help clean the fabric furniture, rugs, and carpets besides removing the favorable conditions for the living of fleas.</li>
<li>However, don&rsquo;t hesitate to seal &amp; dispose of that dirty vacuum bag as this could be carrying manyflea eggs, adult flea, or even flea larvae.
<strong>2. Wash Pet bedding</strong></li>
<li>Next, you can prevent flea bites by cleaning the spaces that act as their rearing ground - this includes the pet bedding.</li>
<li>Thus, the fleas will be cleaned from the bed bedding and thus won&rsquo;t bite pets or get to you or other pets that they can bite.</li>
<li>Ensure that the pet bedding is adequately cleaned and dried using the heat setting being at its highest - disposing of the allowable temperature for the fabric.
