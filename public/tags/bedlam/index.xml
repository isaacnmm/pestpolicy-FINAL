      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, and welcome. I&rsquo;ve reviewed Bedlam Plus bed bug spray - one of our
best bed bug sprays
in this post.
Bedlam Plus residue will continue killing bed bugs for about 4 weeks after application. I note that it&rsquo;s great for carpeting, box springs, and mattresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808785/">research reports that</a>more than 40 percent of the bed bug die when treated with Bedlam plus.</li>
<li>For safety when using Bedlam Plus, make sure you read the label instructions.
First off, I note that Bedlam will also
kill the bed bugs and the eggs
resistant to pesticides such as pyrethroids.
<em>So, let&rsquo;s get started!�</em>

<h2 id="1review-summary">#1:�Review Summary</h2>
<p>So, Bedlam Plus is a residue formula, and hence even after applying, its active ingredients will continue repelling and
killing bed bugs/)
for about 1-4 weeks. Spray lightly on fabrics, drapes, sofas, mattresses, and
mattress encasements-bug-mattress-encasements/)
.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Luckily,Bedlam Plus has no restrictions like other bed bug sprays, and thus you can apply it at any location you&rsquo;d apply to other liquids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But exclude pets and kids from the places where you&rsquo;ve applied the Bedlam Plus until the aerosol has fully dried.

The active ingredients are n-octyl dicarboximide (bicycloheptene) in addition to sumithrin, which is a great chemical to allow you to kill the bed bugs readily.
Luckily, the new formula in this Bedlam Plus has imidacloprid, enhancing a faster knockdown
effect even for different bed bug
strains.
While spraying your sofas, you&rsquo;ll need to give special attention to corner cracks, folds, and seams since that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll mainly find
bed bugs, larvae, and their eggs
while still reducing their hatching rate. But, cover up your aquariums to protect your reptiles and fish.

<p>I&rsquo;ve used
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/">many bed bug</a>
control products, and I have to say that Bedlam Plus is definitely one of the best solutions we have out there. So, why and how did I end up selecting Bedlam Plus?</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, I found that Bedlam Plus was easy to apply (with the ready-to-go applicator) and equally made from natural ingredients.</li>
<li>Luckily, Bedlam Plus was able tokill even the bed bugsthat had developed immunity against various pesticide ingredients such as pyrethroid.
Bedlam Plus didn&rsquo;t stain my clothes and fabrics. Besides that, it won&rsquo;t get waterlogged and won&rsquo;t lose its
effectiveness while applied in different areas
such as bed bug frames and door frames.</li>
</ul>
