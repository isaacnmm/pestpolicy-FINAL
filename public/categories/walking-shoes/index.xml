<h3 id="excellent-arch-support-">**Excellent Arch Support **</h3>
<p>When picking the best shoes for degenerative disc disease it&rsquo;s crucial you consider the arch support of the shoe. Choose a shoe that matches the natural arch and shape of your foot. Types of arches include; high, low, or neutral. Flat-footed individuals may experience overpronation (inward rolling of feet). Shoes with good arch support can help to ease back pain, degenerative disc disease, and other discomforts.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-high-heels"><strong>Avoid High Heels</strong></h3>
<p>Wearing high heels continuously is linked to lower back pain and changing the natural alignment of the body causing your spine to hurt. As a result, you may experience muscle overuse and back pain issues. High heels also affect the arch support and ball of the foot causing severe back pain.</p>

Ensure you buy shoes that feature midsole that have good cushioning technologies. Some of the midsole technologies include polyurethane foam, EVA, and many others.</p>
<p>Therefore, individuals with high arches need to choose shoes with softer midsole. Those with low arches should pick shoes with firmer midsoles to facilitate enhanced motion control.</p>
<h3 id="consider-orthotics"><strong>�Consider Orthotics</strong></h3>
<p>If you require extra support or comfort, consider getting custom-made orthotics for your shoes. Individuals with high arches or flat feet can benefit from using an orthotic insert to support their arches.</p>
<p>Orthotics provide extra support, cushioning, and great shock absorption especially on hard surfaces.</p>
<h2 id="which-specific-shoes-should-you-consider-for-degenerative-disc-disease">Which Specific Shoes Should You Consider For Degenerative Disc Disease?</h2>

<p>ASICS launched its fuzeX collection featuring
**FuzeGEL, its innovative and **
responsive cushioning system, a combination of their older GEL technology with traditional EVA. Available for both men and women.</p>
<p>Fuzex is appropriate for indoor and outdoor running: being low profile and very light. In addition, the design and cushioning system graduate it to the supinator&rsquo;s shoes.
Coming with a 6mm heel drop, the shoe is excellent for fast runners. It allows a smooth transition that would be favorable for forefoot, mid-foot, and heel strikers. (1) Fuzex Lyte (2) Discover Fuzex
However, if you need additional cushioning in your Asics for the Supination, check the below shoes, and you&rsquo;ll love the protection provided to your foot. (1) Gel-Cumulus 18 (2) Gel-Sendai 3 (3) DynaFlyte (4) Gel Nimbus 18.
You&rsquo;ll benefit from neutral padded shoes such as the supination or underpronation shoes: you won&rsquo;t require medical stability, and thus motion control shoes won&rsquo;t be your fit.
The supination shoe brands will come enough cushioning/ padding to allow your foot to remain highly natural and roll enough to the end of your stride.

<p>Further, if youre concerned with shin splits, the Gel-Cumulus coms with enough and soft cushioning at its forefoot suitable for under-pronated or neutral runners.

Interestingly, Gel-Cumulus 19 comes in a variety of colors for both women and men. It also very durable and can clock over 350 miles.

<p>Brooks Adrenaline Gts 17 has a sleek update to its design, particularly to its upper (having supportive materials) that will enable you to walk and run faster even with Supination.</p>
<p>It is more aerodynamic and has a diagonal roll bar that will direct your body into its natural motion path and hence excellent for moderate to severe overpronation.
Its BioMoGo DNA technology enables the shoe&rsquo;s midsole to adapt to your weight, stride, and foot type. Definitely, running with your natural gait will limit your risk of injury and will improve your speed.
Its segmented crash pad will reduce injury by absorbing the shock you feel when you&rsquo;re hitting the ground. Further, you&rsquo;ll get a customizable fit in its heel and universal platform, and hence your feet won&rsquo;t slide and slip all over the place.
Its asymmetrical saddle comes with adjustable eyelets that&rsquo;ll give the feet additional snug feel. The extra eyelet in the shoe will provide you with the optimal heel lock.
Brooks Adrenaline Gts 17 has a 12 mm heel-toe drop with its sock-like fit, and its design will give you top stability, which is excellent for experienced and beginner runners.</p>
<h3 id="4"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GETZ0CS/?tag=p-policy-20">4.<strong>Brooks Glycerin</strong>14 Fabric and Synthetic sole</a></h3>
<p>Brooks Glycerin 14, which the company described to be &ldquo;premium and ultra-cushioned, &ldquo;has a smooth lining that&rsquo;ll leave a great feeling on your feet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll love the shoe&rsquo;s slide wall since they are firm to significantly bolster your foots shape.
With its rounded heel, Brooks Glycerin 14 will significantly improve your foo0t and ankle-bone area alignment.
This feature guarantees that you reduce the stress that lands on your ankle bones and joints, which significantly supports Supination. It has additional padding on the footbed, tongue, and throughout the shoe, which will allow you increased comfort.
Brooks Glycerin 14 comes with the DNA midsole (caterpillar) that are uniquely designed to give you excellent foot alignment. The DNA midsole will provide top comfort and won&rsquo;t bottom out as it&rsquo;s created for the hard hits.
Further, the shoe&rsquo;s midsole area is more stable due to the DRB Accel characteristic and Caterpillar Crash Pads.
Besides the awesome supination features, Brooks Glycerin 14 shoes have an excellent upper with a sock-like fit and feel. Not to forget its high-abrasion rubber outsole material.
Brooks Glycerin 14 will provide appropriate cushioning to help in the foot supination. Its platform pad will help with the shoe fit and function while the crash pad will assist in absorbing various shocks on your foot while you are walking.
I noted that the shoe&rsquo;s midsole tapped at its toe region (with the Omega-Flex Grooves) and hence gave me a smooth journey while transitioning from its foot-strike to the toe-off.</p>
<h3 id="5-brooks-ghost-9-synthetic-fabric-and-synthetic"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CLG6K15/?tag=p-policy-20">5. Brooks Ghost 9 Synthetic, Fabric and Synthetic</a></h3>
<p>After reviewing the Brooks Glycerin 14 for Supination, I&rsquo;ll now analyze Brooks Ghost 9.</p>
<p>In various standards, Brooks Ghost 9 falls very close to the above-reviewed shoes as an appropriate shoe for Supination.</p>
<p>Brooks Ghost 9 has a neutral support system and has appropriately energized foam that&rsquo;ll help absorb various shocks that come up when you are walking or running.
This will maintain your feet in an aligned position and thus prevent any supination &amp; under-pronation.
Its contoured midsole will maintain your foot in a stable position due to correct cushioning and alignment. Brooks Ghost 9 has a substantially padded footbed to give your top comfort. Also, its collar and tongue are padded and soft to provide an impressive grip near your ankle.
With its medium-high arch support provides appropriate support for Supination. Brooks Ghost 9 also comes with a great mesh upper to offer top breathability. Hence, you&rsquo;ll avoid any infection at your feet since the upper enhance high breathability and prevents any moisture.</p>

<p>New Balance 510v3 is an awesome Trial Running shoe that has top constant comfort and alignment. Its unique outsole and midsole provide amazing support to prevent pain resulting from Supination.</p>
<p>It is able to sustain flexibility and absorb any shocks. Amazingly, the shoe is designed from mesh and leather, which ensures that it&rsquo;s ultimately breathable. New Balance 510v3 has a 12 mm drop will offer you awesome foot comfort. It has NB ultra-soft on the shoe&rsquo;s inner surface.
The New Balance supination shoe comes with a rubber sole and thus will support your feet and reduce supination pain. Further, the innovative ABZORB technology allows the distribution of energy throughout your shoe and hence prevents supination pain.
Its IMEVA midsole eliminates any complications from your way and makes the shoe durable too. I would describe the New Balance 510v3&rsquo;s midsole as flexible, contouring, and firm.
To maintain top balance, New Balance installed a midsole (IM ethylene-vinyl acetate) in the New Balance 510v3. It tops among supination shoes with excellent comfort and alignment. Finally, the ABZORB technology will offer support against any shock which enters your shoe.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Therefore, it is crucial that you consider the most respected Supination or under-pronation shoes&rsquo; manufactures for various walking and running shoes.
Supination is caused by inflexible joints (or ball) &amp; heel misalignment and flexibility (and strength) imbalances in your ankle. The effects could be

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merino Shoes and Allbirds use the same material in their construction- merino wool. Wool is a natural product that originates from sheep. It wicks away moisture, thus, keeps your feet dry and warm.</p>
<p>Technological advancements make it possible for manufactures to creatively knit wool and combine it with other materials to bring forth exciting products. Its good to note that wool shoes werent most peoples favorite until Allbirds gained ground.</p>
<p>Although Allbirds receive a lot of love because of their excellent comfort features Merino Shoes are giving them a run for their money. Both of these wool shoe brands have grown in popularity over the years. Hence, if youre looking for a compressive comparison between Merino Shoes vs. Allbirds Ive got you covered.</p>

<h2 id="a-personal-testimony-of-merino-shoes-vs-allbirds">A Personal Testimony Of Merino Shoes Vs. �Allbirds</h2>
<h3 id="merino-shoes">Merino Shoes</h3>
<p>Merino came to be in 2017 in San Diego Australia. �Their mission was to produce the most comfortable shoes on Earth using top-quality merino wool.</p>
<p>True to their word, Merino shoes are some of the most comfortable shoes on the planet. I recently bought a pair of
<strong>Merino Women&rsquo;s Lace-Ups</strong>
. I must confirm that they are comfortable.</p>
<p>Merino shoes are solid and they properly hold the foot in place allowing you to walk comfortably with glove-like comfort.</p>
<p>I particularly loved that the shoes were lightweight and moisture-wicking. This means my feet stayed dry and fresh throughout the day. In addition, if you dont like wearing socks, these shoes will be perfect for you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Merino shoes come in various exciting color options and different sizes. The merino wool stretches, thus accommodate different shapes or sizes of feet. They are also highly breathable and comfortable.</p>
<p>Some of the things I didnt like about merino shoes include their pricing. I felt the shoes were too expensive compared to the Allbirds. For example, the Giesswein runners cost $129.</p>
<h3 id="allbirds">Allbirds</h3>
<p>If youre looking for a comfortable <a href="/posts/best-shoes-for-bunions-and-plantar-fasciitis/">shoe</a> brand thats has received massive positive responses from its users, then pick any Allbird shoe. From the beginning, most if not all Allbirds users have defined the brand by its simple design and amazingly comfortable construction.</p>
<p>I acquired my first pair of Allbirds in 2016. I specifically bought the all-famous
<strong>Allbirds Wool Runners</strong>
. Oh boy! It was the most comfortable shoe Ive ever worn. This made me try out almost all the Allbirds shoes.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, Allbirds shoes are truly comfortable in all ways you can imagine. However, I didnt like that they didnt hold up well. They stayed for a few months or a year and I couldnt wear them any longer.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage that I have experienced with Allbirds is their sizing; they mostly run a half size small. Thankfully, they have an excellent return policy. Thus, you can easily return and reorder your ideal size.</p>
<p>The negatives aside, I couldnt imagine that I could actually find shoes that provide both a pillowy or socks-like feel. I didnt experience any irritation or itching on my feet while on Allbirds. The shoes are also lightweight. Therefore, if you want a comfortable shoe thats both casual and stylish, Ill highly recommend Allbirds.</p>
<h2 id="are-merino-shoes-comfortable-are-they-worth-it">Are Merino Shoes Comfortable? Are they worth it?</h2>
<p>Merino shoes are highly comfortable and yes, they are worth it. Merino shoes come in different designs and many color options. Therefore, anyone looking for a pair of comfortable walking shoes will definitely find one that suits them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the padding on the sole is also sufficient to provide ample arch support. The wool material used for the construction of Merino shoes is soft and smooth. You can actually wear these shoes without any socks and still be very comfortable throughout the day.</p>
<p>Other than that, Merino shoes have a longer wear period compared to Allbirds.� They also provide reliable traction on various surfaces.</p>
<p>Ive worn both the Merino wool runners and the Merino slip-on. Both of these designs are wide and tall at the forefoot (toe areas). Thus, they offer protection against toe humps. Therefore, they are some of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-shoes-for-hammer-toes-and-bunions/">best shoes for bunions</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="is-allbirds-comfortable-are-they-worth-it">Is Allbirds Comfortable? Are they worth it?</h2>
<p>Yes! Allbirds are comfortable and theyre absolutely worth it. �The insoles of Allbirds feature merino wool fabric that provides a soft feel that makes you like youre walking on clouds. This wool fabric is also moisture-wicking and helps to inhibit odor.</p>
<p>Other than that, the sole of Allbirds incorporates a low-density foam that ensures the shoes remain lightweight throughout.</p>
<p>I also loved the fact that my Allbirds can regulate heat properly. During the cold season, my feet would remain warm and when its hot Ill have cool and dry feet. However, when its very hot, my feet would sweat so I have to wear socks.</p>
<h2 id="differences-between-merino-and-allbirds">Differences between Merino and Allbirds</h2>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>
I felt Merino was a bit expensive compared to Allbirds. For example, I got myself Giesswein runners and slip-ons at a cost of $129 each. On the other hand, my Allbirds costs $95. This means Allbirds is $34 cheaper than Merino.
<strong>Aesthetics</strong>
I must confess that I have wide feet and while wearing Allbirds you can actually see toe humps especially the big toe hump. However, with Merino, I didnt experience any humps. So that a plus for Merino. If youre wide footed its important you take note. Nevertheless, my colleague has never experienced any humps. �So I guess it comes down to foot size, shape, and preference.
<strong>Varieties</strong>
Its important to appreciate that unlike Albirds Merino produces more shoe varieties and designs. Allbirds shoes include Tree Dasher, Tree Runner, Wool Runner, and loungers(slip-on design). They include both men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Merino includes Women&rsquo;s Slip Ons, Women&rsquo;s Lace-Ups, Men&rsquo;s Slip Ons, and Men&rsquo;s Lace-Ups. Merino incorporates various exciting color options and designs. That is not to say that Allbirds are awful. Its a matter of personal preference.</p>
<h2 id="similarities-between-merino-and-allbirds">Similarities between Merino and Allbirds</h2>
<p><strong>Both Have Difficult Sizing Mechanism</strong>
Its tough to select the correct size for both Merino and Allbirds. �It would be better to try them in person first before ordering online.</p>
<p>For instance, �I wear womens sizes 8.5 to 9. When buying the Allbirds runners and slip-on I choose size 8.5. It was a mistake. I should have gone one size lower. The two shoe designs were too large and long for my liking.</p>
<p>For Merino, I went a half size down and bought 8. The good thing with merino wool is that it stretches and with time, the shoe expanded and accommodated my feet properly.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that both of these brands are not true to size and its difficult to size them.
<strong>Care</strong>
Both the Merino and Allbirds are machine wash friendly. You can also air-dry them. Therefore, care and maintenance for the two are quite easy.
<strong>Shockingly Lightweight</strong>
Merino wool is lightweight and since both shoes incorporate merino wool in their construction, youll love the light feeling on your feet. I remember the first day I wore my Allbirds Wool Runners, I couldnt imagine that a shoe could be that lightweight, comfortable, and still look durable.
<strong>You Can Wear Both without Socks</strong>
You can definitely wear Merino and Allbirds sockless. The shoes have interiors that are soft and smooth. Hence, provide additional comfort to the feet. However, if youre going to be on your foot for long hours its advisable that you wear socks for enhanced comfort.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When it comes to choosing between Merino shoes and Allbirds personal preference may play a role. Overall, I felt Allbirds were a great option for me especially the wool runners. However, I would have loved it more if the toe box was wider. Bottom line is that they are comfortable and supportive. Conversely, I felt the Merino shoes were more structured and well designed. I also felt their toe boxes were a bit constrained just like in Allbirds. Overall, both the Merino and Allbirds are comfortable, lightweight, and soft to the feet.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For heavy females, choosing the right walking or running shoes is not an easy task. This is particularly s due to the many brands, colors, cushioning technologies, and extensive marketing skills adopted by the many <a href="/posts/best-shoes-for-arthritic-hips/">shoe</a> companies.</p>
<p>In this post, Ill discuss the differences between the walking shoes vs the running shoes, with special focus to feature great for
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/running-women">plus-sized women</a>
.
However, barefoot walking would not be effective for long distances (over 6 miles) since youd lack the required cushioning. In this case, I would recommend the Brooks Glycerin since they are appropriately cushioned and are light.</p>
<h2 id="running-shoes-vs-walking-shoes-for-weight-loss">Running Shoes vs. Walking Shoes for <a href="/posts/best-shoes-for-weight-training-and-cardio/">Weight</a> Loss</h2>
<p>To begin with, consider the
overweight womens running shoes
that come with varied features that heavy female runners need for running. If need be you can visit your nearest store for shoe fitting.
Therefore, its important to know your shoe size, shoe shape, or even visit a footwear expert for correct fitting. Critical aspects to consider, besides style, are comfort, stability, functionality, and fit.</p>
<h3 id="heel-flare">Heel Flare</h3>
<p>For your running needs, the running shoes come with a flared heel to offer additional stability when you hit the ground at your midfoot. Therefore, its common knowledge that trail running footwear should have a flared heel like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-shoes-for-supination-and-underpronation/">supination shoes</a>
.
On the other hand, your waling shoe must not come with a flared heel. Notably, as you walk youll hit the ground using your heel and hence the flared heel will prevent rolling forward as you step.</p>
<h3 id="shoe-cushioning">Shoe Cushioning</h3>
<p>Compared to walkers - as a heavy female runner  youll require extra cushioning in your footwear,
compression socks,
and the best athletic shoes for lower back pain. Recent research shows that runners create an impact of over 3 times their body weight when running  which if not appropriately harnessed could lead to shock on your joints and muscles.
Therefore, as an overweight runner, youll require additional cushioning on the forefront and shoe heel compared to the walkers.�Walkers must go for light footwear that has enough cushioning to avoid excessive shock on the legs and feet.</p>
<h3 id="flexible-and-breathable">Flexible and Breathable</h3>
<p>Truth be told, both walking and running footwear must be flexible. To determine whether your shoe is flexible, youll need to press down using the shoes toe and note the point where itll bend.
Many of the available runners shoes will flex at the midfoot or arch. However, other models will flex at your forefoot. Such variations are aimed to match varied foot strike needs of different runners.
However, walking must flex only at your forefoot  further not bending at all would be disastrous for walkers. Therefore, shoes thatll flex at the arch will not offer the necessary support for walkers. Thus avoid stability shoes and motion control footwear since theyd not bend or flex.</p>
<h3 id="heel-height">Heel Height</h3>
<p>Running shoes must have a built-up heel to offer the required stability. However, the difference with various running shoes come with the heel-to-toe drop philosophy you believe. But this depends on where your foot hits the ground first; either the footballs, midfoot, or heel.
However, walkers wont require a high heel because they strike the ground through the heel and then roll as they step. Therefore, as a walker, youll need to go for a shoe that has the smallest difference between the toe and the heel  this should be at most 4 mm but below 8 mm would also work.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While selecting your walking or running shoes, the crista fact is proper fit, comfort and must allow natural motions on your feet.</p>
