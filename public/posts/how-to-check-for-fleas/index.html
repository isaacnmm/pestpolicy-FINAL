<dt>itching feeling in me</dt>
<dd>does my dog have fleas? Or is it just unfounded fear?
Since I acquired my dog pet: my fluffy king, I have had numerous challenges. Some of them include feed selection,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-dogs/">flea medication selection</a>
, and safety.
However, none of the above challenges with my dog has been
disturbing as seeing fleas
running on my pet. I tried numerous flea treatments, but the fleas always came back.

<p>To check for dog fleas on your pet, you will require the following tools; a
flea�comb
,
soaped water
, and a white kitchen�paper.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-a-visual-check-on-your-dog"><strong>Step #1: Conduct a visual check on your dog</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1-conduct-a-visual-check-on-your-dog">¶</a></h3>
<p>Despite that flea are small in body size, it is possible to catch a bug&rsquo;s glimpse
when jumping
from one place to another. You might not see it on the first day you check, but if you are keen enough, you will finally set an eye on some of them.
The fleas are brown and appear fat when they have sucked blood from you or your pets. They will
also jump rapidly
to avoid being caught or escape harsh conditions such as water, chemicals, and hot objects.
However, if you see your dog scratching, it is time you should already consider the best flea control techniques.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-flea-comb-youth-dog"><strong>Step #2: Flea Comb youth dog</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-2-flea-comb-youth-dog">¶</a></h3>
<p>Upon careful consideration, you can order a
flea comb
to undertake this exercise. Run the
flea comb
through the dogs fur or coat.
Ensure to put
adequate pressure on the flea comb
to touch the dogs skin smoothly. Check if the flea comb has picked some adult fleas or flea�dirt�(flea droppings or fleas).�Drown any fleas that you catch using soapy water.
Flea droppings are mainly comma-shaped, and when placed on the wet kitchen paper, they leave a red ring, signifying blood from the flea.

<strong>Next, some details on the flea life cycle �</strong>
This will help you understand why fleas have always come back and how you can wittingly get ahead of the coming fleas generation.
<strong>The flea life cycle is divided into four stages:</strong>
<strong>- Eggs:</strong>
One adult
flea can lay about 40 eggs
each day. Female
fleas lay eggs
24-36 hours after they take the first blood meal (flea bite). The eggs are visible to a naked eye and look pearly white, and are oval.
<strong>- Larvae</strong>
the larvae stage lasts from 5-12 days. Fleas have 3 larval stages.
<strong>- Pupa</strong>
Flea has 4 pupa stages: This is a highly protect phase of the fleas and may last up to 210 days.
<strong>- Pre-emergent adults</strong>
This stage is also referred to as the waiting stage. Notably, fleas in this stage emerge as adults if stimulated by heat, carbon dioxide, pressure, and vibration.</p>

<p>Maybe youll require using a combination of
flea treatment
options to eliminate the bugs from your home.
To effectively control the fleas, youll need to keep your dog indoors for 2 weeks after treating him, the kernel, and his bedding. However, you can still walk with him but avoid the lawns to avoid re-infestation.
After treating the
dog and house for fleas
, continue vacuuming the floors. Vacuuming will help eject the
flea eggs and larvae
from their cocoons and thus be reached by the insecticide.

<p>Dog fleas are small brown insects that attack dogs and cats, and other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite being small in body size, dog fleas can be seen using naked eyes. Also,fleas jump and hop from one hostto another with their strong legs.</li>
<li>Therefore, I must have been getting it wrong as the flea treatments only provided short-lived solutions.</li>
<li>Over the years, I have learned the need to have the right information about fleas&rsquo;signs and symptomson my dog and the useful products for controlling the bugs.</li>
<li>**Surely:�**You would like to learn from my experience; rather than yours! I have learned how to manage my cat and the pest that affects it the hard way.</li>
<li>Therefore, read on to learn the various signs, symptoms,recommended treatments, and safety precautions to take while considering fleas on your dog.
<strong>So, how do you free your dog from fleas?�</strong>
After a careful analysis of expert veterinary information combined with the vast experience with dealing with my dogs, in this guide,
<strong>I will aim to answer the following questions:�</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-do-fleas-keep-coming-back">Why do fleas keep coming back?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-do-fleas-keep-coming-back">¶</a></h1>
<p>Fleas thrive excellently in warm summer months and wet spring months but may appear at any time. However, after the flea appears in your residence, getting rid of them will be a daunting task.
While you start on the journey to fight fleas in your residence and on your dog, fleas have a particular advantage that makes them very hardy. Here the particular flea advantages:
<strong>Biological advantages</strong>
Flea has very back legs with significant muscle powers. The powerful legs enable the pest to jump about 1 foot vertically and 4-5 feet horizontally. These biological features allow the flea to navigate from one host to another and hide from different insect control mechanisms.
<strong>Advanced and long life cycle</strong>
Female
fleas lay many eggs
, about 30 eggs, in a day, and thus have a high reproduction rate. The eggs are also tiny and can thus hide on your dog or in cracks, crevices, and carpets. The eggs&rsquo; lightweight allows the dog to carry them around your house and fall off in different locations in your residence.
Flea eggs hatch within
one week, which could delay waiting for the right conditions. After hatching, the eggs turn into larvae.
The
flea larvae
create cocoons, and they move into them to grow into pupae, which takes about 1 week. However, fleas in the cocoon can survive for 6 months if they are not favorable to become adults. Also, a female flea can survive for about 1.5 years.
<strong>Fleas have good hiding</strong>
abilities.
For each flea that you spot in your facility, there could be other hundreds hiding in different locations such as under carpets and cracks. The
fleas that are hiding
could be in different developmental stages: larvae, eggs, and cocoons.
Therefore, it would be helpful to use products such as the
best fogger for fleas
in your home when there is a major infestation.
A flea can survive without feeding.
**Surprisingly! **
Fleas are capable of surviving for a long time without feeding. For example, after one blood feeding, the flea can survive for one month.
Various insect controlling chemicals such as
sprays
and foggers are good at fighting adult fleas. However, I recommend that you use
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A755Q3O/?tag=p-policy-20">natural pest control concentrate</a>
to kill fleas in all their developmental stages.</p>
<h2 id="prevent-flea-re-infestation-on-your-dog">Prevent flea re-infestation on your dog?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#prevent-flea-re-infestation-on-your-dog">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="step-1-control-fleas-outside-the-house"><strong>Step #1: Control Fleas outside the house</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1-control-fleas-outside-the-house">¶</a></h3>
<p>Do you have a lawn outside your house? That should be your first concern while you are aiming to
prevent flea infestation
on your dog. Lawns form an excellent residence for fleas, their eggs, and larvae.
Fleas love living
in the grass, and from there, they can hop and jump onto any animal, including you and your dog, that passes on the lawn.
Therefore, you should cut the grass short to enable heat from the sun to get to the roots. Such a condition would make the fleas uncomfortable, and thus fleas would not hide there.
Also, you can sprinkle
Diatomaceous Earth
(DE) on the lawn. The
Diatomaceous Earth
would break the fleas skins, absorb its moisture and thus kill them. Further, sprinkle the powder in the pets house and around your house.</p>

<p>After tackling the fleas from outside your house, it is now time to
kill or prevent any fleas
that would like to make your dog their host.
There are many products available to
treat fleas on your dog and cats
. Ensure to read online buyer reviews and talk to your vet to learn the best practices
for flea
prevention and control.
Despite that you might consider
cats and dogs
as almost equals, it is critical to note that some dog flea treatment chemicals can harm your cat. Therefore, please consult with your vet, read label instructions, and adhere to them!</p>
