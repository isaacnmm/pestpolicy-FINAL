The appropriate temperature will be over 32 degrees in the application time and 5 hours following the process. The moss stains will be cleared from the patio in about three weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, how does Wet &amp; Forget remove moss stains? Well, soak the pavers and driveway with the liquid until it gets to the base of that moss covering.
I used the Wet &amp; Forget for the garden shed and the fence, removing the greenish algae, but I made sure I conducted effective rinsing.

Get your sprayer - same that suitable for spraying fertilizer and water on your plants. So, soak the lichen with a solution of the stain remover.
