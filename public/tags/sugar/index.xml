<p><strong>The short answer is: YES, sugar ants will bite humans but; NO, they&rsquo;re not poisonous. Sugar ant bite order to defend itself. Thy&rsquo;ll first puff up their abdomens and flash their mandibles to express irritation.�</strong>

<h2 id="do-sugar-ants-bite">Do Sugar Ants Bite?</h2>
<p>Sugar ants can be invasive and stubborn household critters.�Although they are omnivores, they love nothing more than to lap up the sweet white nectar that has earned them their nickname.</p>
<p>Sugar ants can also describe any household ant ranging from 2 to 15 mm in size that have a sweet tooth that draws them to your pantry.</p>
<p>If you have these unsightly buggers in your house and you have kids or pets, you may be worried and asking yourself whether they bite.</p>
<p>Thankfully, sugar ant bites are relatively minor and don&rsquo;t hurt nearly as much as the bites of their carpenter ant or fire ant relatives.</p>
<p>With the exception of the case of a rare allergy, sugar ant bites are also far less likely to produce any lasting reactions or unpleasant symptoms.</p>
<p>When it comes to insect bites, it is common for people to confuse bites with stings, and thankfully sugar ants, unlike their carpenter and fire ant compatriots, are not capable of producing stings.</p>
<p>Sugar ants bite and pinch with their mandibles while fire ants actually inject venom into the skin with their stingers.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-bitten-by-a-sugar-ant">What should I do if I&rsquo;ve been bitten by a sugar ant?</h2>
<p>In the event that you are bitten by a sugar ant, there is a small likelihood that you may experience some slight inflammation or heat in the area around the bite.�This is because at the time of the bite the sugar ant spews a small volume and weak concentration of formic acid.</p>
<p>If this happens, relieve the inflammatory effect of the bite and any itchiness the same way you would with any other common insect bite: disinfect with an antibacterial ointment and apply ice, hydrocotisone or antibiotic cream to the affected area until the swelling decreases.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that the discomfort persists and the small pimple-like bite swells into a blister, and/or you begin to experience breathing difficulty or lightheadedness, contact a medical health professional.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-sugar-ants">How to Get Rid Of Sugar Ants?</h2>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s how to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-sugar-ants/">get rid of sugar ants</a>
. But for a summary, you&rsquo;ll need to clean up, use natural ant control solutions - including diatomaceous earth (DE), peppermint oil, mint plants or eventually call your trusted exterminator.</p>
<h3 id="1-clean-up-food-debris-and-dirt">1. Clean Up Food Debris and Dirt</h3>
<p>To get rid of sugar ants, first make sure that your kitchen is consistently tidied up. Keep all perishable foodstuffs refrigerated; regularly dispose of garbage and keep all compost outside.</p>
<p>Do not leave your unwashed dishes in the sink overnight, especially if they contain remnants of food; and ensure that all containers and bags of food in your pantry are tightly sealed at all times.</p>
<p>Most sugar ants come from outside, but some, especially if you are living in an older house, take up residence in disused objects and neglected corners inside.</p>
<p>Make sure to regularly vacuum your floors, carpets, and furniture to disrupt and get rid of any potential colony hiding places. You should also check your home for any crevices and cracks that might allow the ants inside: seal them up as needed.</p>
<h3 id="2-get-rid-of-the-problem-with-ant-traps">2. Get Rid of the Problem with Ant Traps:</h3>
<p>If regularly cleaning your kitchen and house and being vigilantly on the lookout for colonies doesn&rsquo;t get rid of the problem, you may want to consider purchasing ant traps and laying them near affected areas.</p>
<p>Commercial ant traps come in a variety of sizes and brands and can be bought in hardware stores and grocery stores. The ants you see around your kitchen are worker ants: they are the ones in charge of the food supply and they bring provisions back to the colony and queen.</p>
<p>The traps lure the workers to partake of its &ldquo;food,&rdquo; which is then transported back to the colony, effectively poisoning and eradicating them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Although they are inexpensive and effective, keep in mind that most conventional ant traps make use of pesticides and chemicals and should be kept away from human food. Keep them on the floor, not the counter!</p>
<h3 id="3-bite-back-with-natural-solutions">3. Bite back with Natural Solutions:</h3>
<p>If you are unable to secure a non-toxic, organic ant trap and are wary of bringing chemicals into the home, try out some natural remedies.</p>
<p>One option is to eliminate the scent trail that attracts ants to your food. Try filling a spray bottle with a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water and spraying it upon affected areas as well as door-frames and windowsills that may be serving as inadvertent portals to your home.</p>
<p>Directly spraying the vinegar and water mixture directly onto the ants will also kill them; wipe away the mess with a tissue or paper towel.</p>
<p>Diatomaceous earth is also effective: try sprinkling it beneath your fridge, around the garbage can, and other affected areas.�The tiny blade-like particles of Diatomaceous earth shear through the exoskeletons of ants, and their bodies soon dry up.</p>
<p>A less deadly solution is to fill the aforementioned door-frames,windowsills, and pantries with mint sprigs, mint plants, or cotton balls soaked with peppermint oil: insects detest the smell of mint, and in addition to sugar ants, this may take care of insect issues altogether!</p>
<h3 id="4-call-the-dreaded-exterminator">4. Call the dreaded Exterminator</h3>
<p>If cleaning up, ant traps, and natural solutions fail, you may have to consider looking into the services of an exterminator.</p>
<p>Luckily, professionals are increasingly discrete, and are typically able to resolve to situation in mere hours so you can get back to worrying about the things that matter and not another bite from an unwelcome guest!</p>

<p>Sugar ants are common during warm seasons when they come out of their nests to search for food.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ve discussed the 5 effective ways on how to get rid of the sugar ants.

<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-sugar-ants">How to Get Rid of Sugar Ants</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll mainly see sugar ants in the yard, under rocks, on trees, and if you are not careful, in your home. They are mainly attracted to sugary foods and scraps and they will do anything to gain entry into your home to find them.</p>
<p>These� insect&rsquo;s body size allows them to gain entry into your home through the tiniest spaces.�Sugar ants can be extremely annoying to most homeowners.�Let&rsquo;s get into the details of how to get rid of sugar ants once and for all:</p>
<h2 id="a-natural-methods">A. Natural Methods</h2>
<h3 id="1-keep-your-house-clean-especially-the-kitchen">1. Keep your house clean, especially the kitchen</h3>
<p>The typical sugar ant diet consists of anything they can find lying around in your home. Even a tiny crumb from a snack you hastily devoured might be enough to attract hundreds of ants to your home. Always keep your home clean and surfaces free from food scraps that might attract ants. Make sure you clean dirty dishes in the sink and dispose of your trash regularly. Wipe down the counters thoroughly, dust your shelves, vacuum your floors, and have professionals clean the carpet regularly.</p>
<h3 id="2-soapy-water">2. Soapy Water</h3>
<p>Dishwashing soap and other detergents can double up as pest killers in various circumstances. Just mix some soap with water and pour it into a spray bottle. Soap has a certain scent that acts as a deterrent against sugar ants and when sprayed directly on the ants, it can kill them.</p>
<h3 id="3-store-your-food-properly">3. Store your food properly</h3>
<p>Leaving your food open and exposed is almost like sending the sugar ants an invitation into your home. Keep your perishable food items such as fruits and vegetables safely locked away in the fridge where the ants can&rsquo;t access them. Your non-perishable food items such as cereals should be stored in airtight containers then kept in cabinets where the ants can&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-vinegar">4. Use Vinegar</h3>
<p>Vinegar can be an effective ant deterrent when used creatively. It contains acetic acid which is a powerful ant deterrent and also removes the scent of ant trails preventing other ants from using the same route to access your home. You just need to combine equal parts vinegar and water into a spray bottle and blitz the areas you&rsquo;ve either spotted ant activity before or where you want to ensure sugar ants never get to, such as kitchen surfaces.</p>
<p>The only drawback with vinegar is that it only keeps ants at bay when its scent is still strong, which doesn&rsquo;t last that long. You will need a full spray bottle if you choose to use this method for a while.</p>
<h3 id="5-coffee-grounds">5. Coffee Grounds</h3>
<p>If you are a coffee lover, you will love this one! Instead of getting rid of your coffee grounds, you can use them to repel sugar ants. Ants hate the burning acidity and smell of coffee grounds. You can sprinkle them around your home or in areas where you want to repel ants, such as near pet bowls.</p>
<h3 id="6-cloves-bay-leaves-or-garlic">6. Cloves, Bay Leaves or Garlic</h3>
<p>The compounds responsible for the strong smell in bay leaves and cloves are also highly effective for repelling sugar ants. Garlic also has a strong odor that throws ants off their scent trails and confuses them. Lay out bay leaves and whole cloves along baseboards and other areas where you want to repel ants.</p>
<h3 id="7-homemade-ant-repellent">7. Homemade ant repellent</h3>
<p>You can easily make your own insect repellent at home by combining water with peppermint or lavender essential oils and spraying it on ant infested areas.</p>
<h3 id="8-homemade-ant-trap">8. Homemade ant trap</h3>
<p>You can easily make an ant trap by smearing a sweet and sticky substance like honey or corn syrup on a plate and placing it in areas where you know sugar ants have invaded. The sugar attracts ants to the plate but since it&rsquo;s sticky, the ants will be stuck giving you a chance to annihilate them.</p>
<h2 id="b-chemical-methods">B. Chemical Methods</h2>
<h2 id="1-ant-killer-sprays-and-insecticides">1. Ant killer sprays and insecticides</h2>
<p>There are commercial ant killer sprays or insecticides that you can use to kill ants in your home. However, remember that such products contain toxic chemicals that can be harmful to you, your kids or pets. Be careful when using them.</p>
<h3 id="2-ant-bait">2. Ant Bait</h3>
<p>This is where you use a poisonous bait disguised as ant food to destroy an entire colony. The idea is to trick the ants into carrying the bait back to their colony as food. Once the ants eat the bait, they&rsquo;ll slowly begin to die. Most ant baits contain borax or boric acid which is a slow-acting ant poison.</p>
<p>If you have tried all these methods and failed( which is highly unlikely), your next best option is to hire a professional exterminator to come in and deal with the ant problem for you once and for all.</p>

<p>Sugar ants (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_sugar_ant">banded sugar ants</a>
or
<em>Camponotus consobrinus</em>
) are one of the most popular types of ant species.</p>
<p>Sugar ants will mainly be seen in most homes hauling grains of sugar and food particles.

<p><strong>Summary:��</strong>
<em>The banded sugar ant is a type of ant that is only found in Australia. It&rsquo;s polymorphic and relatively large in size with a black body and a distinctive orange-brown band wrapping around its gaster. Banded sugar ants differ slightly in appearance based on the roles they play in the colony.�</em></p>

<h2 id="details-what-do-sugar-ants-look-like"><strong>Details: What Do Sugar Ants Look Like?�</strong></h2>
<p>These are the other types of sugar ants found in other parts of the world but share similar characteristics with the banded sugar ants (apart from the band).</p>
<p>Also referred to as odorous house ants, sugar ants are tiny ants that measure around 10mm in length and are commonly found in forests, woodlands, trees, shrubs, under rocks, in the soil, or even right in your home.</p>
<p>Male sugar ants are black while the female sugar ants have a lighter reddish-brown color than can easily be mistaken for a tiny drop of honey or syrup.</p>
<p>All sugar ants are tiny and skinny with a large head, thorax, and abdomen. Their heads have two antennae on top which the ants use to find trails and communicate.</p>
<p>They also have powerful mandibles which they use to break food and sugar particles into small ones that they can actually carry. Depending on their roles, some sugar ants may appear different as a result of adaptation.</p>
<p>For instance, the worker sugar ants will have bigger heads and mandibles since their job is to gather food.�When sugar ants invade your home, you will likely spot them lined up in a queue coming from their entry point to their source of food in your home.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-know-you-have-a-sugar-ant-infestation"><strong>How to Know You Have a Sugar Ant Infestation</strong></h2>
<p>Sugar ants are tiny creatures whose size allows them to enter your home through any tiny crevices they can find. They can use cracks in doorways, windowsills, or other openings in your home.</p>
<p>When you have a sugar ant infestation, you may notice as soon as it starts happening when the affected area is clearly visible such as the kitchen.</p>
<p>But, when they invade a hidden area such as tall cabinets or basements, it can take a while to realize that you&rsquo;re under attack.�The following are some ways to tell when you have a sugar ant infestation:</p>
<h3 id="1-actually-seeing-them">1. Actually seeing them</h3>
<p>Sugar ants are very courageous creatures and when in search of food, they will walk right in front of you or even on you to get to it.</p>
<p>The thing that makes sugar ants easy to see is that they never travel alone. When searching for food, sugar ants travel in hundreds or thousands so if you see one, there&rsquo;s probably many others nearby.</p>
<h3 id="2-trails">2. Trails</h3>
<p>Sugar ants usually leave a pheromone trail to the food source so that the other ants can know how to get to it. This trail appears to be a pale while line and you should wash it off with soapy water as soon as you see it.</p>
<h3 id="3-hollow-sounds-in-wood">3. Hollow sounds in wood</h3>
<p>If your home is made of wood, you could be in serious trouble if sugar ants attack your home especially if it goes on for a long time undetected.</p>
<p>Sugar ants may burrow into wooden components of your home when trying to gain entry which, over time, may damage your home&rsquo;s wooden parts. Sugar ants are not nearly as destructive to wood as carpenter ants but they can also do quite a bit of damage.</p>
<h3 id="4-seeing-them-around-your-home">4. Seeing them around your home</h3>
<p>If you see sugar ants in your lawn, backyard, fence or other places near your home, it won&rsquo;t take long until they find a way into your home or maybe they already have.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up"><strong>Wrapping Up�</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you know what sugar ants look like and how to know if they have invaded your home, it&rsquo;s up to you to get rid of them and take the necessary measures to keep them out of your home for good.</p>
