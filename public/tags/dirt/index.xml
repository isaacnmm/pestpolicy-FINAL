      <description>**What is flea dirt? **</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**What is flea dirt? **
Flea dirt (flea poop or flea frass) is the round black pepper or dandruff-looking specs made up of undigested and dried blood (dropped by fleas) after sucking blood from cats, dogs, or
humans-repellent-for-humans/)
.
You can find flea dirt when
combing
or running fingers against the grain of your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s hair.�Flea dirt is mainly found around your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s
groin
area, the tails, or between their hind legs.
Ultimately, flea larvae will feed on the flea dirt -
<em>remember its blood anyway</em>
. But most fleas must be controlled from their hiding places in the
house
or the
yard
.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Fleas Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-is-flea-dirt-flea-dirts-color-shape-and-size">What Is Flea Dirt? Flea Dirt&rsquo;s Color, Shape, and Size</h2>
<p>Fleas will
poop either in their hiding place
or on cats and dogs. The dried-up blood (in the form of excreta) will produce oddly-shaped black, brown, or reddish specs - which we now referer to as flea dirt. Most homeowners confuse flea dirt (a collection of the flea poop) with black dandruff.
The flea dirt will look like (1)�Specks of grit or Ground pepper, (2) Black dandruff or Tiny black flakes, (3) Black or reddish specks.
<strong>Coils or�Spherules�</strong>
Flea poop mainly takes two shapes -�Coils or Spherules. First, coils will be about 0.84 mm in length - and thus, their largest mostly go lengthwise.
But, the Spherules will mainly grow into a round shape of about 0.08 mm to 0.24 mm. The flea adults will first take the form of spherules but turn into coils in their next two weeks.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-check-forflea-dirtflea-dirt-test">How to Check for�flea dirt/�flea dirt test?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to stop fleas and flea dirt on the belly of either your
cat or dog
. The stomach mainly has the fur or hair that is less thick and has the lightest shade of color. Also, you may find
flea dirt on your dog&rsquo;s
or cat&rsquo;s sleeping areas and bedding.
If you&rsquo;ve found flea dirt on your pest, then this could be a good indicator that you&rsquo;ve succeeded in
identifying the presence of fleas
. Further, the specs will turn your wet towel into spots of red or brown.</p>
<ol>
<li>But, you can
easily discern�flea
dirt by placing any of the black specs or clumps on a white and wet towel.</li>
<li>If the towel becomes reddish or brown, then that points to the presence of flea dirt - which, as noted earlier, is merely undigested blood in flea poop.</li>
<li>Also, check the pet&rsquo;s sleeping areas and bedding</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-worry-about-flea-dirt">Why worry about Flea Dirt?</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
Fleas will suck about 5 �l to 6.97 �l of blood each day to fill up their gut. However, female fleas will suck an event larger blood capacity (13.6 �l of blood).
Therefore, controlling flea dirt (and fleas too) would ensure that you reduce the amount of blood sucked from cats,
dogs, or human beings
.
<strong>2.</strong>
Flea dirt is &ldquo;dirty&rdquo;
on your pets and humans
as it leaves the feces to spread all over. For example,
fleas will excrete about�8-10 feces drops
in their 2-3 minutes of feeding.
Each day, an adult will drop feces with a weight of about 0.636-0.860 mg (with female females excreting more wastes - about 0.8473 mg).
<strong>3.</strong>
Fleas find it less energy-consuming to feed on the pet and human blood. Fleas are generally considered to be capillary (vessel ) feeders - which allows faster feeding.
Vessel feeding implies that the bugs will take advantage of the pet&rsquo;s blood pressure and thus take in the blood faster. Further, the bugs have�anticoagulant saliva and adequately�adapted mouthparts for better blood sucking - and losing a limited amount of energy.
**4. **
Flea dirt is not just waste for the flea but will also feed flea larvae and promote the development of a major flea infestation. But why? Flea dirt is
appropriate to flea larvae
as it requires them to spend a very minimal amount of energy.
It provides
flea larvae
with proteins and iron that are required for sclerotization and body development. Therefore, that&rsquo;s why females take more massive blood amounts to feed their larvae -with proteins, iron, and even vitamin B.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-flea-dirt">How to Get Rid of Flea Dirt?</h2>
<p>Well, besides
killing the fleas
, you&rsquo;d love to get rid of the flea dirt. The simple steps are
shampooing your dog
and cats to wash away the flea dirt.
But this is no guarantee that the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-come-from/">flea dist won&rsquo;t come</a>
back to haunt you.
But, the best way to rid your pets of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">this�flea dirt is by killing</a>
the fleas both in and around the house.
For your cats and dogs, I would recommend using various
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-puppies/">flea treatment</a>
methods such as�Capstar Flea Killer,�oral pills,�Frontline for the cats, or�Advantage II for your Dogs.</p>
