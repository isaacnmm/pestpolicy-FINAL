      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&rsquo;re the differences between
bed bug bites
vs. mosquito bites? We wake up in the morning and find rashes, red swellings, or streaks and get torn as to whether it was a mosquito or bedbug that bit us.
It is difficult to tell the similarities and differences between bed bug bites vs. mosquito bites - unless you have actually seen the parasite itself.
Both bites will appear as small raised lumps, itchy, and won&rsquo;t bust. Bedbugs bits, however, will take longer to heal compared to
mosquito bites

<h3 id="1-appearance"><strong>1. Appearance</strong></h3>
<p>Both appear as red, raised lumps. Both can range in color from light pink to a brownish look. Both
bites are also slightly raised from your skin
. Besides, both are smooth when you touch them and appear swollen.
When left untreated, the bitten area might attract germs and infections that can harm our health. Below is how you can treat them.
There are certain things which you can do while a mosquito or a bed bug bites you. They are not too dangerous but to avoid having severe symptoms, try to cure it before its out of hand.�Related:

<h3 id="2-itchiness"><strong>2. Itchiness</strong></h3>
<p>Both bites are itchy because their saliva contains chemicals.�Your skin will itch upon a bite from either of them because they contain two different chemicals: Anticoagulant and Anesthetics.
Anticoagulant stops blood from clotting. This allows them (bedbug and mosquitoes) to suck up blood for several minutes before the wound closes up.
Anesthetic chemical leaves a numb feeling which prevents the bite from itching at. First, this ensures you don&rsquo;t notice them feasting you, well, at least for seconds.

<h3 id="3-swelling"><strong>3. Swelling</strong></h3>
<p>Both bites will appear swollen, can&rsquo;t be squeezed and popped. The bitten area will swell as a response mechanism from your body to enable more blood to reach it.
More blood ensures sufficient white blood cells that can help fight the threat of infections. More blood concentration in the bit area will see it swell, but it can&rsquo;t be squeezed nor popped. Related:

<h2 id="differences-bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites"><strong>Differences</strong>**: Bed Bug Bites Vs. Mosquito Bites**</h2>
<h3 id="1-size"><strong>1. Size</strong></h3>
<p><em>Bedbug bite:�</em>
About 4-5mm long and 1.5mm wide
<em>Mosquito Bite:�</em>
Size depends on the length of time the mosquito&rsquo;s labium remained stuck in your skin.
The size of a bedbug bite is relatively bigger than a mosquito bite, whose size depends on the length of time its labium remained stuck in your skin. The longer the time, the larger the bite.</p>
<h3 id="2-reaction"><strong>2. Reaction</strong></h3>
<p><em>Mosquito Bite:�</em>
Bite turns red immediately, a rash appears.
<em>Bedbug Bite:�</em>
Reaction depends on an individual, which might occur between the first 20 minutes to days after.
Our bodies will detect a mosquito bite instantly, and a rash will appear right after the bite. In some extreme cases, your body can form blisters in reaction to the mosquito bite.
For bedbugs, however, the reaction will depend on your body. It could be after 20 minutes or even days. Some of us won&rsquo;t react to it at all. Related:

<h3 id="3-length-of-before-bite-disappears"><strong>3. Length of Before Bite disappears.</strong></h3>
<p><em>Mosquito Bite:�</em>
Clears up faster, 3-4 days.
<em>Bedbug Bite:�</em>
Takes longer to clear up, 1-3 weeks.
Mosquito bites will disappear faster, usually after a maximum of 4 days, depending on how your body reacted. Over that length of time, the bite will gradually lose its swelling and smoother its normal color.
For bedbug bites, however, it will take up to 3 weeks at most to clear up. Those of us with a strong reaction to it will see the bite take a longer period to clear up.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-they-feast"><strong>4. How they feast</strong></h3>
<p><em>Bedbug Bite:</em>
appears on parts of the body close to the mattress.
<em>Mosquito Bite:�</em>
appears anywhere that was exposed.
As you sleep, part of the body that gets in conduct with the mattress is the one bedbugs will bite. Contrary to that, mosquito bites appear anywhere that was exposed.
These areas are more likely to be your legs and arms, given they easily get exposed. Check Out:

<h3 id="5-transmission-of-diseases"><strong>5. Transmission of Diseases</strong></h3>
<p><em>Mosquito bites:�</em>
transmits Malaria.
<em>Bedbug bite:</em>
don&rsquo;t transmit diseases; they, however, contain pathogens that can be harmful.
Mosquito bites spread several viruses like malaria, zika virus, and yellow fever, among others. For bedbugs, they don&rsquo;t carry any disease; however, the wound can lead to the entry of germs in our bodies when left untreated.</p>
<h3 id="6-who-they-bite"><strong>6. Who They Bite.</strong></h3>
<p>Mosquitoes
bite not only humans
but also many other animals like birds. Mosquitoes are categorized into different species, and each has their preferences on what to feast on. Some prefer humans over other animals.
Contrary to that, bedbugs have a specific diet: human blood. Although bedbugs do feed from other animals in some cases, they stick to
humans for most of their lives
.
Their preference for human blood has been attributed to the host&rsquo;s convenience, given they cannot
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-fly/">fly nor jump</a>
. Also, the human
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-your-skin/">skin has an easier surface to bite</a>
through compared to that of furrier animals.

<h2 id="where-are-you-likely-to-get-mosquitoes-and-bedbugs"><strong>Where are you likely to get Mosquitoes and Bedbugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Both bedbugs and mosquitoes are scattered across the country, depending on the nature of the location.
Bedbugs are most common in populated settlements like cities and suburbs. The higher the population, the more the bedbugs. The proximity of households enables the easier
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-jump/">movement of bedbugs</a>
from one house to another.

Mosquitoes, on the other hand, require
standing water
like ponds and pools to breed. Therefore, you are more likely to experience mosquito problems if you live near a lake, ocean, or neighborhood with an un-maintained swimming pool.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bedbugs are hard to control but their bites could also trigger allergic reactions, cause itching, and are painful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bugs-that-look-like-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">look like many other insects</a>but they will mainly hide inside mattresses, baseboards, upholstered furniture, headboard, walls, and furniture.
Is it a <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bully-review/">bed</a> bug that is biting you? Well, in this article, I will teach you how you can differentiate between bed bug bites and other bites.
Lets dive in.
Most humans will get terrified when bed bugs crawl into their bed or house.
Bed bugs are nocturnal insects that will bite on animals and humans (while they sleep) to suck blood.</li>
<li>If your skin has some small red dots, you may be confused whether they are from bed bugs or any other biting or stinging insects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-bed-bugs-bite">Where Do Bed Bugs Bite?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs tend to bite on most of the skin diseases caused including the feet, hands, arms, legs, neck, and face.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pests will bite the areas of your skin that are not covered while you are sleeping.</li>
<li>However, bedbugs invite you all over your body if you sleep wearing few or no clothes.
A bed bug will bite humans and inject their
anticoagulant
that will make your skin numb so that you won&rsquo;t feel it while they&rsquo;re sucking blood.
The bed bug sucks a fill of the human blood (before going into hiding for a number of days) and will only return when its blood supply (their food) goes down.</li>
<li>Bed bug bites have a similar shape and size to those from mosquitoes and fleas - which makes it difficult to identify them correctly.
But in summary, here are some of the unique features that will help you identify the bedbugs bites.</li>
<li>The localized bite area will have a rash</li>
<li>Burning sensation</li>
<li>Itching around the bite area - localized</li>
<li>Red welts that are small and appear in clusters or in ZigZag lines.
Also, humans may experience anxiety and insomnia because the bed bugs will disturb their sleep patterns.</li>
<li>Luckily, besides causing possible allergic reactions, bed bugs (includingbaby bed bugs)are not documented to carry any disease-causing pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-bed-bug-bites-versus-flea-bites">1. Bed Bug Bites Versus Flea Bites</h2>
<p>a. Bite Locati
<strong>on</strong>
It&rsquo;s important to know where specific pests will bite a human being.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if you know that the b of a specific pest tends to be concentrated in a certain area, itll be easy to identify the pest.
Fleas will mainly target humans on the lower extremities
<a href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/mg343">such as the legs</a>
when bed bugs will bite your upper torso.
But why?
Well, bed bugs will mainly hide or nest in the bedding such as mattresses and sheets.</li>
<li>They will mainly move towards the head of your bed and thus they will bite your arms and upper torso - but you can use a<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">mattress Encasement</a>.
On the other hand, fleas will mainly bite humans on the lower body such as the legs.</li>
<li>This is because fleas do not fly but leap over small heights - about 13 inches.
Also, fleas do not target people but will buy them when their preferred host (cats and dogs) is not available. See how to
Keep Fleas off Me While I Sleep
.
b. Colour and size
The Colour and size of the bite are important factors in trying to identify the animal causing them.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that the differences between bed bug bites and flea bites (when considering color and size) is minimal, I have some clues for you.
Bites caused by animals are relatively large and they will appear like reddish welts but they will be less bright compared to flea bites.</li>
<li>Bed bug bites will be laid down in clusters in a zigzag or line.
However, flea bites will be smaller than bed bug bites and will also have a red appearance that is brighter.</li>
<li>Flea bites can be found in patterns of the human skin but may also be grouped closely.
c. Time of biting
Bugs have different feeding habits, and will also feed at varied times of the day -information that can help you identify the insect biting you.
First, we&rsquo;ve noted that bed bugs mainly feed at night because they are nocturnal insects.</li>
<li>Also, these bills will mainly be hiding during the day and thus they want to bite humans.
However, fleas will move and feed at any time of the day or night that they choose.</li>
<li>So if you notice bites occurring and insects crawling on your skin during the day, you know that you are battling with fleas.
But flea bites and bed bug bites have similarities; they take some time to be felt since they inject an anticoagulant.
Also, both bites may lead to severe reactions such as itching and allergy (insect-related).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9UzvclvEQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9UzvclvEQ</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-bed-bug-bites-versus-mosquito-bites">2. Bed Bug Bites Versus Mosquito Bites</h2>
<p>Mosquito bites will be painful since mosquitoes do not have the numbering ability like that in the saliva of bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, mosquito bites will leave you with some unique (one or two) large marks on the skin.
However, bed bug bites will appear in clusters as opposed to singly or in pairs.</li>
<li>So, if you notice several bites in one location but you didn&rsquo;t feel them being inflicted, these will be bed bug bites.
a. Bite Location
Bed bugs will mainly bite humans on the part of their body that is near the mattress - which is the back, sides, arms, and upper body.</li>
<li>For example, if you are sleeping on your back and the bed bugs are hiding on the top right side of the mattress, then the b will appear on your right shoulder and side.</li>
<li>Also, if the bed bugs are hiding on the bed headboard, the bites will appear mainly on your head and shoulders.
So if you notice that you have some regular bites on your body that appear on the right side, then inspect the side of your mattress.
However, mosquito bites will be inflicted on any part of your body that is exposed.</li>
<li>Parts of the body that are regularly exposed include the arms and legs and this is where you&rsquo;ll find most of the mosquito bites.
This implies that mosquitoes will not get under your sheets to bite you like it is the case with bed bugs.
b. Colour and size
Bed bug bites and mosquito bites have a similar appearance with their colors ranging from brown to light pink.</li>
<li>Both bites will be raised a bit from the human skin but have an average size of a pea.
On sensation, bed bug bites will feel the same (in pain and itching) as mosquito bites.</li>
<li>Both will be swollen and feel smooth and so it&rsquo;ll be challenging to differentiate them just by their looks
Unlike the condition of pimples, both mosquito and bed bug bites cannot be popped or squeezed.
c. Time of biting
Compared to mosquito bites, bed bug bites and their pain tend to last longer - this could be up to two to three weeks (if you have a stronger bite reaction).</li>
<li>So mosquito bites will clear faster - which will be between three to four days.</li>
<li>But mosquito bites will have cleared within 1 week.
Also, bed bugs don&rsquo;t bite continually but in different locations since they need to get a blood meal every 3 days.</li>
<li>Mosquitoes can also bite humans continually but they&rsquo;ll be easy to control and clear.
Bed bug bites appear in clusters but this is not the case with mosquito bites.</li>
<li>Mosquito bites will appear on random human skin locations (that are exposed) since these insects will seek and attack their hosts singly.
However, bed bug bites will form a line (some form of pattern) since a number of bed bugs in the colony will follow the same route while attacking their hosts.</li>
<li>Also, bed bugs will attack humans in a group and they will bite on the first exposed location they find.
Earlier I noted that bed bugs will not carry disease-causing organisms but mosquitoes will.</li>
<li>Mosquito bites will, besides causing itching, transmit disease-causing organisms that lead to the Zika virus, yellow fever, malaria, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-bed-bug-bites-versus-tick-bite">3. Bed Bug Bites Versus Tick Bite</h2>
<p>Tick bites will be larger than bed bug bites but they&rsquo;ll have the same shape and color.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ticks will also remain on the animal for long (while still biting) and will also transmit diseases such asLyme disease.
But bed bugs will bite humans or other hosts, suck blood and then go back to hiding.
a. Bite Location
Bed bug bites will look harder and swollen compared to tick bites.</li>
<li>Also, bed bugs will move in numbers while biting humans on multiple occasions for their bodies.
So the bed bug bites will be patterned when the tick bites will be in only one location.</li>
<li>Further, ticks can bite under clothes or different layers while bed bugs will prefer biting skin that is exposed.
b. Colour and size
Tick bites may transmit diseases that are commonly known as tick-borne diseases.
Here is a quick guideline on how to identify tick bites.</li>
<li>Tick bites will not be filled with fluid but other bites such as from and we&rsquo;ll have some fluid (pus) inside.
On location, Tick bites will mainly be on the back of your legs, groin, scalp, and neck.
Besides, ticks will bite humans and pets on one location before burrowing in but other pests such as bed bugs and fleas will bite on multiple locations.
c. Time of biting
Just like bed bugs, this will also inject the anesthetic into your skin which will make its bites painless.</li>
<li>Injecting the chemical will help the tick to undertake its biting and blood-sucking undetected - at least for some time.
However, things will not borrow their body fully into the skin. The tick can continue feeding on the host&rsquo;s blood for about 10 days.
If the bite has a bulls-eye rash, then this could be a sign that there is an infection of Lyme disease due to a tick bite.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-bed-bug-bites-versus-chigger-bite">4. Bed Bug Bites Versus Chigger Bite</h2>
<p>Chiggers love living in wooded, grassy, damp, and moist areas - and so you want to generally find them in your bedroom.
You can differentiate between bed bug bites and chigger bites with the location of that bite on the human body.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chigger bites will give you welts and they will mainly be found around your waist.</li>
<li>But bed bug bites can be found just around all above your abdomen
You can cure the chigger bites using some quality chigger repellent.
a.Reaction time
Bed bug bites will generally not be felt when the pest is in action but will only be noticed if there is evidence on the sleeping area.</li>
<li>These pests will inject a numbing chemical into the human body.</li>
<li>The chemical will also prevent any blood from the bite location
Chigger bites and their symptoms can remain for a few days to several weeks depending on how long the pest lodges on you.
b.Colour and Size
Both chigger bites and bed bug bites will look inflamed, red, and raised spots on the skin.</li>
<li>But as outlined earlier, bed bugs bites will appear in random clusters or in a line, especially where there is exposed skin.
But chigger bites mainly happen one human is wearing clothes that are tight-fitting.</li>
<li>Also, the chigger bites will actually be grouped together in such areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-bed-bug-bite-versus-hives">5. Bed Bug Bite Versus Hives</h2>
<p>A hives outbreak can happen from a number of triggers such as a bug bite, environmental factors, or a reaction to food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hives will appear like red welts (angry) and they will spread on your skin, especially on locations that came into contact with the irritant.</li>
<li>Hives can create splotchy patterns and are linked to wheals or red bumps that are painful.
But bed bug bites would be formed into a line and we&rsquo;ll be a few. You can also use an antihistamine to treat hives.
a.Size and color
Bites from bed bugs will have a similar size but two separate ones can become joined and appear like a big bite.</li>
<li>In brief, bed bug bites will be about the size of an eraser on your pencil.
But I will have different sizes and may be small or large like a pimple.</li>
<li>On color, bed bug bites generally look red but the skin around the bite may be lighter.</li>
<li>However, hives can have a dark red to pale color (with a red skin surrounding) or even have a color similar to your skin.
b.Shape
Both bed bug bites and hives will be raised from your skin and they will flatten during the healing process.</li>
<li>The shape of the bed bug bites will be like that of mosquito bites - with even edges.</li>
<li>But hives will have uneven edges and their shape will vary.
c.Location
We&rsquo;ve repeated this a number of times, but my wife will likely appear on skin that is exposed.</li>
<li>As you sleeping on your bed or couch, bed bugs will bite your neck, legs, and arms
However, you may find hives on almost any part of your body.
Another characteristic feature that we differentiate bed bug bites from hives is the number of people suffering in the house.</li>
<li>Notably, if more than one person is suffering from similar skin irritation, then that will be most likely a bedbug bite.
However, if it is just one person suffering from skin irritation, then I would classify these as hives since they aren&rsquo;t contagious.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-bed-bug-bite-versus-chicken-pox">6. Bed Bug Bite versus Chicken Pox</h2>
<p>Vaccination is the most common remedy against chickenpox.</p>
<ul>
<li>But some people find it challenging to differentiate between chickenpox and bed bug bites.
The key differentiating factors between the two will be the type and quantity of markings.</li>
<li>Chickenpox marks are fluid-filled and irritated (blisters) while bed bug bites will be red bumps that have no fluid or pus.
Chickenpox is known to spread all over the human body because they caused by a virus.</li>
<li>Bad bed bug bites won&rsquo;t appear in large numbers since is pests bite at a lower rate.
So it is clear that chicken off will look different from bed bug bites.</li>
<li>Scratching the location that is affected by the bed bugs bite can result in a small bump and redness</li>
<li>But chickenpox will cause visible and clear marks that will persist on the skin for up to one year.
The symptoms of chickenpox will include itchiness and redness on the skin location that is affected.</li>
<li>Symptoms of bed bugs on humans will include an itchy red rash, headache, loss of appetite, hardness, and fever.
Chickenpox will leave your skin or not of your kids with marks but bed bug bites won&rsquo;t leave Marks just some minor redness.
Chickenpox will sure leave marks all over the human body but bed bug bites will appear as clusters or groups.
The remedies for chickenpox will include baking soda baths, oatmeal baths, and calamine lotion.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the remedies for bed bug bites will include ice to minimize redness and itching, calamine lotion, and anti-itch cream.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bugs would use a number of sectors such as carbon dioxide, and body heat to detect a suitable host such as human beings.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best will take a complete blood meal on their host in under 15 minutes and then get back to their hidden areas.
Bedbugs are cold-blooded insects that get into a dormant state and can survive in that condition for months without taking a meal.</li>
<li>For example, bed bugs will survive for about 12 months when the temperatures are under 55 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skills, the manufacture of Bed Bug Bully, markets the product as an effective, non-toxic, all-natural bed bug killer spray.
So, how accurate is this?
Can Bed Bug Bully safely exterminate mild to moderate bed bug infestations? Will it kill even the
baby bed bugs/)
?
In this post, I seek to verify these claims by undertaking a thorough review of
Bed Bug
Bully.�So, let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Bed Bug Bully&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="summary-bed-bug-bully-review-full-analysis">Summary: Bed Bug Bully Review (Full Analysis)</h2>
<p><strong>My Overall Review:�Only Suitable for Treating Small to Medium Bed Bug Infestations.�</strong>
<strong>1.</strong>
Bed Bugs Bully is
a contact killing killer
that offers great residual protection for prevention and killing.
Luckily, being odorless and chemical-free, you can even
spray this insecticide
in the bedroom even before your sleep.
<strong>2.</strong>
The spray will kill the whole bed bug life cycle - eggs, their babies, and adults bed bugs (
check the pictures of bed bugs here
).
Bed Bugs Bully is equally safe, besides
being highly effective
, to both humans (including kids) and pets in your house.
<strong>3.</strong>
Spraying bed bugs
bully won&rsquo;t stain your furniture, linens, or other surfaces in the area of coverage. Equally, it has no harsh odor or chemicals - but leaves a mild scent behind.
<strong>4.</strong>
However, some
<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/how_effective_are_natural_bed_bug_pesticides-146722">available case studies</a>
claim that Bed Bugs Bully is ineffective in treating bed bugs. Further, some homeowners claim that pesticide doesn&rsquo;t
kill bed bug eggs
.
The issue is that the pesticide won&rsquo;t
kill bed bugs and their eggs
tucked deep in the fibers or the blankets, pillows, and mattresses.</p>
<h2 id="features-or-specifications">Features or Specifications</h2>

<h3 id="1-longresidualprotection">1. Long<strong>Residual</strong>Protection</h3>
<p>Bed Bugs Bully is created
to have a long residue effect - it&rsquo;ll last even about 30 days.
Therefore, the pesticide will continue exterminating the
bugs for a long time after the first-bed
bug treatment.
However, it&rsquo;s good to repeat the
bed bug treatment
using this pesticide about 3-4 times after several weeks.</p>

<p>The pesticide will kill the bugs only on contact and thus great for controlling
bed bugs you can see in your home
.
However, this could be a disadvantage because the bed bugs might be hidden inside crevices, cracks, or
inside carpet fibers
.</p>
<h3 id="3-non-poisonous-non-toxic">3. Non-Poisonous /Non-toxic</h3>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, the
bed bug bully mainly is made
from natural oils, including castor oil, clove oil, citronella oil, and mint oil.
The product has no toxic chemicals and will be safe to use around your family members, other humans, and pets.
This can be contrasted to using other pesticides like the
best bed bug fogger
that would require you, your family, and all pets to leave the house for about 12 hours after setting them off.
Also,
bed bug bully won&rsquo;t leave
a toxic or lingering odor - and thus, it&rsquo;ll be comfortable to even sleep in a room that you&rsquo;ve just treated for bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="3-its-a-liquid-form-spray">3. Its a Liquid Form Spray</h3>
<p>The pesticide exists in liquid form and hence will be easy to
apply to
bedbug-infested areas such as mattresses, crevices, cracks, or bed frames.
Further, the liquid form makes it easy to combine this bed bug bully will different cleaning products such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a></p>
<ul>
<li>for effective control of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-suitable-foroutdoor-andindoor-treatment">4. Suitable forOutdoor andIndoor Treatment</h3>
<p>Bed Bug Bully will work
great for both your outdoor and indoor spaces.�You&rsquo;ll be able to control the bugs both inside the house and before they infest your dwelling spaces.
I dare say that the bed bug insecticide will work for most weather conditions - including winter and summer, killing bed bug adults and their babies.</p>
<h2 id="an-alternative-to-bed-bug-bully-to-kill-bed-bugs">An alternative to Bed Bug Bully to Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Traditional pesticides are just as effective or the naturally developed
bed bug killers
. An excellent pointer is Steri Fab, which many people trust in exterminating
bed bugs from their business premises
and homes.
Sadly, most
bed bug sprays
are ineffective in controlling bed bugs, or theyll have a lower efficiency level.
For this, I suggested that you use a combination of different bed bug control techniques, including Eco Defense, mattress encasement, diatomaceous earth, and dry
bed bug steamers
.</p>
<h3 id="1-mattress-encasements">1. Mattress Encasements</h3>
<p>Bed bugs will always be looking
for dark and warm places to hide  and mattresses are such good locations. However, you can use
bed bugs mattress encasement
as theyll safeguard the mattress against any such attacks.
Further, any
bed bugs thatll lock inside
the mattress encasement will lack the chance to take their regular blood meals and will thus starve to death. This is mainly because
bed bugs cant bite through clothing or fabrics
.
However, you can also use box spring encasement if youre using box springs. Also, ensure that the encasement isnt damaged or scratched since this will provide entry or
exit points for bed bugs
and their babies.</p>
<h3 id="2-diatomaceous-earth">2. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth�will be a great alternative to bed bugs bully because its cheap, non-toxic, and its all-natural  itll prevent the bugs from moving around your house and thus
spreading carelessly
.
However, DE must not be used alone as itll have lower kilning effectiveness.�DE is a natural white power thats manufactured from sea rocks.
Luckily, itll tear the
bed bugs skin
, dehydrate it by taking out its body fluids and thus kill it. So, put some DE over the floors and furniture in your
house where the bed bugs
will be walking.</p>
<h3 id="3-dry-bed-bug-steamers">3. Dry Bed Bug Steamers</h3>
<p>Steamers are an excellent way to treat
bed bugs in your walls, cabinets
, mattresses, furniture, chairs, and sofas.
For example, most steamers will generate steam at over 200 degrees thatll
exterminate both bed bugs
eggs and adults.
Luckily, steam will easily reach the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs while hiding</a>
in the crevices, cracks, and baseboards. However, only shift the steamer at 1 inch every second while treating these blood-sucking bugs in your house.
The machine has nozzles thatll release small amounts of dry steam. However, the device must be used cautiously as it can burn kids and pets with high-temperature steam.
Remember to use a respirator to protect yourself from ant gages or chemicals that might be released.</p>
<h3 id="4-vacuuming">4. Vacuuming</h3>
<p>A vacuum will enable you to keenly clean all the tough spots and corners that may
easily hide bed bugs
and their babies.
However, be sure to securely seal the vacuum bag before disposing of it after youve finished vacuuming. Next, ensure thoroughly washing the vacuum cleaner to remove all the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>
, the babies, and adults.
These, if not removed well, could trigger a
bed bug re-infestation
. Further, store the vacuum machine in a sealed bag  this will prevent re-infestation.</p>
<h3 id="5-wash-fabrics-with-hot-water">5. Wash Fabrics with Hot water</h3>
<p>Next, you can wash your clothes with very
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">water and then dry them to kill the bed bugs</a>
and their existing eggs.
Use a
dryer to kill bed bugs
with the least  but ensure to check the maximum temperature recommendation for each cloth fabric.</p>

<li><strong>Bites</strong>: Bed bug bites often appear in clusters or lines on exposed skin. They can cause redness, itching, and swelling.</li>
<li><strong>Signs of Infestation</strong>: Look for tiny reddish-brown fecal spots on bedding, mattress seams, and furniture. You might also find shed skins or live bugs in these areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prevention-tips-for-puyallup-homeowners">Prevention Tips for Puyallup Homeowners</h2>
<p>Preventing a bed bug infestation is much easier than eliminating one. Here are some tips to keep bed bugs at bay in Puyallup:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspect Secondhand Items</strong>: Puyallup residents often enjoy shopping at local thrift stores and garage sales. Carefully inspect used furniture, mattresses, and clothing before bringing them into your home. Bed bugs can easily hitch a ride on these items.</li>
<li><strong>Be Cautious When Traveling</strong>: When staying in hotels or other accommodations in Puyallup or beyond, check the bed and surrounding areas for signs of bed bugs. Keep your luggage off the floor and bed, and inspect it before returning home.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Clutter</strong>: Clutter provides hiding places for bed bugs. Keep your home tidy and reduce unnecessary items, especially in bedrooms. Puyallup&rsquo;s mild climate can sometimes encourage indoor clutter as people store seasonal items.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Cracks and Crevices</strong>: Inspect your home for potential hiding places such as cracks in walls, baseboards, and furniture. Seal these openings to prevent bed bugs from establishing themselves.</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: This natural powder can be applied to cracks, crevices, and other bed bug hiding spots. It works by dehydrating and killing the bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Oils</strong>: Some essential oils, such as tea tree oil and lavender oil, are believed to repel bed bugs. However, their effectiveness can vary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chemical-bed-bug-control-methods">Chemical Bed Bug Control Methods</h2>
<p>When natural methods aren&rsquo;t sufficient, chemical solutions can be effective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insecticides</strong>: Use bed bug-specific insecticides to treat infested areas. Follow all safety instructions and consider hiring a professional for application.</li>
<li><strong>Encasements</strong>: Encase mattresses and box springs in bed bug-proof covers to trap any existing bugs and prevent new infestations.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upon mating with a male bed bug, the female bed bug lays oval, white eggs about 1/16-inch long. You&rsquo;ll find the eggs hidden in crevices &amp; cracks.
In its lifetime, an
<a href="https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/manuals/25/">adult bed bug</a>
lay roughly 200-250 eggs.
The eggs will also hatch in 6-10 days, and the
baby bed bug/)
immediately starts hunting for a blood meal. Notably, the egg is the most challenging stage in the life cycle of bed bugs to control.
So, in this guide, we delve into the details of what the eggs look like and how to treat
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155541551730274X">these bed bugs</a>
on your clothing, yard, and house. Also, here&rsquo;s a guide on
how to kill those bed bug eggs
.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="bed-bug-eggs--pictures--appearance-and-life-cycle">Bed Bug Eggs * Pictures * (Appearance and Life Cycle)</h2>
<p>What do
bed bug eggs look and smell like
? They are off-white or semi-transparent in color and measure about 2.5 mm or 0.1 inches in length (relatively tiny!). You might confuse them for a pinhead, uncooked white rice (grain), or a grain of salt.
The eggs have a sticky surface that makes them stick together in a cluster. Further, the oval-shaped eggs have round ends that are elongated. When they&rsquo;re over five days old, they&rsquo;ll have an evident dark mark that makes them look like an eye.
The rice-like eggs have a &ldquo;wet spot&rdquo; on its surface - the sticky/ glue-like (but relatively invisible) substance allowing the eggs to stick together. You can find them using a flashlight or magnifying glass.
Adult
bed bugs will lay about 200-250 eggs
, and, when exposed to the right conditions, they&rsquo;ll put in 6-10 days. Further, the
bed bug nymphs will go hunting for a blood meal
.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-see-bed-bug-eggs">Can you see bed bug eggs?</h2>
<p>Despite that
bed bug being 2.5 mm in size
, you can see them with your naked human eyes. You&rsquo;ll notice that the adults anywhere near red, brown, or tan. Check here for
what bed bugs look like
.
However, the eggs and nymphs are tiny, and they&rsquo;ll be more challenging to see with your naked eyes -� not unless they appear in clusters - one of them is anywhere like a pinhead-sized.
Eggs are generally off-white of pearly whites, and they mainly exist in clusters of many eggs that&rsquo;ll ultimately measure about 1 millimeter in length.</p>
<h2 id="common-areas-where-bed-bug-eggs-are-found">Common Areas Where Bed Bug Eggs Are Found?</h2>
<p>So,
where do bed bugs
lay eggs? Well, adult
bed bugs won&rsquo;t move far from their hiding
place to feed and lay eggs. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll
mainly find bed bug
eggs in protected areas - near the food source.
For example, the bugs will sneak into cracks and crevices - even as thin as your business card - to lay their eggs. Check mattress joints and seams for the eggs. Don&rsquo;t forget the behind headboards or in the box spring when touching or fixed to the wall.
Further search for the eggs near or around your
bed because the bed bugs and bite
mainly suck blood while their host is sleeping. Thus, here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll mostly find the eggs - as the bugs primarily feed at night.
Check for black &ldquo;specks&rdquo; or red marking - bed bug feces since they have semi-digested blood. These could also have a sweetish or pungent odor that
comes from the bed bug&rsquo;s
scent glands.</p>
<h2 id="where-can-you-pick-up-bed-bugs-eggs">Where Can You Pick Up Bed Bugs Eggs?</h2>
<p>These
bed bugs will live in clusters</p>
<ul>
<li>that&rsquo;s the only way you can see them since they&rsquo;re too tiny for the naked eye when separated. So, here&rsquo;re the
signs of bed bug
eggs - particularly in the areas you rest or sleep.
<em>Bedroom:�</em>
In the bedroom, check especially around or on -</li>
<li>Mattresses buttons and folds, tufts, bed frames, mattresses, and box-springs.</li>
<li>Examine furniture, including chairs and desks - avoid second-hand furniture like the plague.</li>
<li>Checkbehind pictures, clocks, and wallpapers for bed bugeggs.</li>
<li>Examine under your carpet and wooden floors - especially in any cracks that you may find.
<em>While traveling</em>
: You can
carry off pick-up bed bug
eggs while you&rsquo;re traveling from one town or country to the other. Therefore,</li>
<li>Keenly inspect your new room when you&rsquo;re allocated as you start your vacation or even a short stay.</li>
<li>Check that you don&rsquo;t set your luggage on the hotel room floor and don&rsquo;t carry it into the house directly when you come from your travel.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget thatbed bugs can also hidein other rooms such as laundry rooms, living rooms, and bathrooms.
<em>Check smears and spots</em>
: Check for brownish or dark reddish smears or places that are fecal
deposits of the bed bug&rsquo;s
digested blood.
You may find these smears and spots around the bed, on mattresses, pillowcases, and bedsheets.
This shows that the beds were feeding around the bedding and sheets. In addition to fecal spots, also check for cast skins.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-bed-bug-eggs-hard">Are bed bug eggs hard?</h2>
<p>*So, are bed bug eggs hard? *
These nymphs are simple to squash because�they&rsquo;re
soft - they&rsquo;re sticky and smooth.
These
eggs are hard to pick up because they&rsquo;ll easily
squash or smear on your hands - despite having an outer shell. In the eggs, you&rsquo;ll find a fluid that eventfully
develops into your bed bugs
.
It is possible to
squash the bed bug
egg clusters using the nails or between the fingers.
However, don&rsquo;t crush
<a href="https://www.bedbugsinsider.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">the bed bugs</a>
, so hire an exterminator.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-bed-bugs-lay-their-eggs">Where Do Bed Bugs Lay Their Eggs?</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll
mainly find bed bug
eggs in
protected sites, including beds, different furniture, and mattresses. Most of these places will be near their host, and one with darkness, and given safety.
Also,
bed bugs will lay their eggs in floorboards
, baseboards, and wall cracks. Check
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/how-find-bed-bugs">how to check bed bugs on wood and fabrics, metal, bed-frames, or plastic</a>
. I&rsquo;ve analyzed
probable areas you&rsquo;ll find bed bug
eggs.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bug-eggs-in-beds">1. Bed Bug eggs in Beds</h3>
<p>Bed Bug eggs
will mainly be laid around
mattresses and buttons - you&rsquo;ll find them on rough surfaces. The bed is an excellent location because it&rsquo;ll be near the bug&rsquo;s host - i.e., humans beings.
Because bed bugs won&rsquo;t get very far from your house, it&rsquo;s possible to get the eggs in the bed - this is
where you&rsquo;ll see the bed bug
nymphs and adults. So, inspect the open spaces and the non-flat spaces on the bed. Check the
<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/emergingdiseases/mattress_fact_sheet_275417_7.pdf">bed bug in the mattress.</a>
Inspect the box springs, mattress edges or
folds, and seams for bed bug
eggs. Besides, check under the mattress and box springs, walls, floor,
mattress encasements
, and bed frame since they may contact the infested beds.</p>
<h3 id="2-flooring-and-carpet">2. Flooring and Carpet</h3>
<p>Sadly, you might not easily see the
bed bug eggs when they&rsquo;re hiding
in the flooring or carpet. These tiny eggs are translucent, measuring about a sesame seed in size.
If you
examine your carpet
, ensure you check under the chairs and dressers, legs of your bed frame, and the flooring. Don&rsquo;t just mop or sweep your carpet or floor, as this won&rsquo;t
kill bed bug
eggs.
On the contrary, you are using an excellent-suction
vacuum that&rsquo;ll remove the bed bugs
from your carpets, walls, and floors. Besides,
dry/ heat treat the rugs
or
vacuum the bed bugs
plus include a carpet shampoo.
The steam will
instantly kill the bed bug
eggs sitting deep into the flooring cracks and carpet fibers. Further, this will
quickly kill the bugs
in the mattress seams and furniture fabrics.
Further, examine around the baseboards and walls, in addition to joints and cracks in the hardwood floors. Remember to explore the wall-to-wall carpet - particularly along tack strips and edges.</p>

<p>A
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-abstract/109/6/2495/2422101">study by K. R. Hinson et al.</a>
shows that survival of bed bug eggs (

, life stage, and strain.
Notably, the study examined the insecticides&rsquo; efficacy
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-traps/">against first-instar nymphs and bed bug</a>
eggs. The motivation for the
research was because bed bug
eggs tend to be highly resistant.
The outcomes were that Temprid SC (imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin) produced the best

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs are reddish-brown and nocturnal insects that suck blood from warm-blooded animals including humans - youll find them in hotel rooms or in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bodies of the bed bugs are flattened (dorsoventrally) and hence they will easily hide in upholstered furniture, beds,carpets-live-in-carpet/), and floor cracks.
So if you starting a journey to control bed bugs in your business premises or house, it is very important to know the life cycle of these pests.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the lifecycle of bed bugs shows that it moves through 3 key stages: egg, the nymph, &amp; bed bug adult - this whole life cycle of bed bugs will take between 1 to 4 months to complete.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bed bug eggs will hatch in around 1 week (6 days to 9 days) while its nymph stage moves through five instars (or phases) to finally become an adult.
Signs of a bed bug infestation in your hotel or the house include seeing some reddish-brown and wingless insects that may be hiding in the bed or mattress - a quick remedy would be
using mattress encasements
.</li>
<li>Also, the presence of an outer shell of insects in the area may point to the presence of bed bugs.</li>
<li>However, depending on the stage that the bed bugs are in their life cycle they will have different sizes and colors.
Therefore it&rsquo;s important to know how to identify the bed bugs and differentiate them in their different stages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bed-bug-life-cycle---stages-in-the-life-of-bed-bugs">Bed Bug Life Cycle - Stages in the Life of Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>The general but critical information about bed bugs include;</p>
<ul>
<li>The eggs are laid covered with some glue and they&rsquo;ll hatch within 10 days.</li>
<li>The bed bug nymph stage goes through five phases (stages) or what we call instars.</li>
<li>Each of the bedbug instar we require to take a blood meal for them to molt to the next instar stage.</li>
<li>Adult bed bugs can live for about 10 months but their whole life cycle will complete in between 1 to 4 months.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6myZM7FO8w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6myZM7FO8w</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-bed-bug-eggs">1. Bed Bug Eggs</h3>
<p>The life cycle of a bed bug starts at the egg stage - the eggs are milky white and grain-like in shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs (females) we lay eggs clustered in 10 to 20 pieces and a total of 200 - 500 eggs on in their lifetime different surfaces including bed frames.
Bed bug eggs
will be laid in clusters or in singles and they will finally be stuffed in crevices and cracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bed bug eggs measure about the size of two salt grains - which is about a length of 1 mm or less.</p>
<ul>
<li>The eggs grow fast because in just two weeks they&rsquo;ll have hatched and their nymphs will be leaving already.
Since the bed bugs are tiny in size you might be unable to see them using your naked eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>But they will be late around where the bedbugs sleep, they look like grains of salt, and are white or creamy in color.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s laid, Bed bug eggs are around 1 mm but they will all have grown about 1.5 mm when moving to the nymph stage.</p>
<p>Bed bugs so what we call granular metamorphosis - this implies that pests will grow bigger progressively at every instant stage but they will require to take a blood meal for molting to happen.</p>
<p>The bed bug nymph will graduate product rule after death fifth stage of molting in their instar movement in the life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>When food and other conditions for growth are available bed bugs will move through their life cycle in 1 - 4 months.</li>
<li>But the adult bed bugs May leave even for 1.5 years.</li>
<li>Also provided the female bed bugs are healthy will continue laying eggs - which weve noted that in their lifetime theyll lay about 500 eggs.

Are Bed Bug Eggs Hard or Soft?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-bed-bug-nymphs--baby-bed-bugs">2. Bed Bug Nymphs / Baby Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>Bed bug nymphs or
Baby Bed Bugs
go through molting stages before achieving maturity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite that the nymphs may look mature, they are small-sized and have not yet achieved sexual maturity.
Old nymphs will be red-brown in color while the younger ones will be yellow-white.</li>
<li>The nymphs will require room temperature and a blood meal for them to successfully malt to the next stage.
When a suitable host is available to supply a blood meal to the bed bug nymphs, these organisms will molt to the next stage if there is room temperature in around 3 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bed bug eggs and their nails are yellow-white or light-colored and thus it will be challenging to spot them while on the carpets and bedsheets.</p>
<ul>
<li>The organisms turn red after feeding on that blood meal but they will also tend to darken as they achieve maturity
When you spot some of these nymphs be sure that is a larger bed bug population in your space.</li>
<li>Arsenal because the nymphs are small-sized there will be even more challenging to detect compared to the adult.</li>
<li>The size of the nymphs will be about the size of a sesame seed - which is around 1 to 5 mm in length.
Is it possible for the bed bug nymphs to lay eggs?</li>
<li>Well, technically, nymphs can&rsquo;t lay eggs but in around 5 weeks from egg hatching, these organisms will have achieved enough fertility (as an adult).
Will Diatomaceous Earth kill bed bugs?</li>
<li>Well yes, the formulation that isdiatomaceous Earthwill kill adult bed bugs and also exterminate their names nymphs.
Diatomaceous Earth as noted earlier kills bed bugs by dehydrating them after peeling off its skin.</li>
<li>So since the bed bug nymphs are immature, their skin will be immature and thus softer - that will mean that the Diatomaceous Earth will have an easier job exterminating them
The nymphs will walk over the diatomaceous Earth and they will get injured, begin bleeding and finally die.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will especially happen in the third and fourth stages of the nymphs growth because these organisms will be more active and will easily reach the location of the diatomaceous earth.</p>
<p>However diatomaceous Earth won&rsquo;t wipe out the whole nymph population. Therefore, experts recommend
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-heaters/">using heat treatments</a>
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">bed bug sprays</a>
or hiring exterminators for infestations that are large.</p>
<h3 id="3-adult-bed-bugs">3. Adult Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>The average length of an adult bedbug ranges from 1/4 inch to 3/16 inches - they have a wide and flat body but will get larger once theyve fed on blood from their host.</p>
<ul>
<li>After getting a blood meal (engorged) the bed bug&rsquo;s body will be cylindrical and longer.
But bed bugs are generally brownish, oval-shaped, and small insects (comparable to an apple seed) that live on hosts such as humans and other animals.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will move fast over ceilings, walls, and floors -<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-fly/">but they cant fly</a>.
Also before reaching maturity they mature bed bugs (instars or nymphs) will have shed skin 5 times when molting to the next stage and after feeding on blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the conditions are right, the bedbugs will reach the adult stage in about a month and thus will produce 3 + generations each year.</p>
<p>But where will bed bugs hide?</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs will make entry into your house unnoticed through items such as couches, second-hand beds, clothing, and luggage.
If there is a space in the house that measures the width of your credit card, then the bed bugs will take advantage of their flat bodies and hide there.</li>
</ul>
<p>But generally, you&rsquo;ll find bed bugs hiding in headboards, bed frames, box springs, and mattresses from where they can access humans easily at night while they are sleeping.</p>
<p>But as a bedbug colony grows these insects will move to other apartments or nearby rooms, protected locations, crevices, or just scatter around your bedroom.</p>
<p>You may also find bed bugs in clean hotel rooms or homes - this is contrary to the common rumor that bed bugs signify dirtiness but this is untrue since these insects survive only through blood meals.</p>
<p>At what time will bed bugs bite humans? Well, bed bugs will largely bite humans as they sleep - especially at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs will pierce your skin and suck blood via their elongated mouthparts for between 3 to 10 minutes before crawling away.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqcc3ILhHP0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqcc3ILhHP0</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The life cycle of a bed bug we&rsquo;ll take it 2 three life stages which are; egg stage, nymph stage (through five instars), and finally the adult stage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through these three stages, bed bugs will have different shapes, sizes, colors, and feeding habits.
Therefore as you seek to control bed bugs in your home or business premises you require to know how they look in their different life stages.</li>

<li><strong>Bite Marks</strong>: Bed bug bites often appear as small, red welts in a line or cluster on the skin. These bites are typically itchy and may cause discomfort.</li>
<li><strong>Fecal Spots</strong>: Look for small, dark spots (bed bug excrement) on sheets, mattresses, and walls.</li>
<li><strong>Shed Skins and Eggs</strong>: Bed bugs shed their skins as they grow. You may find these along with tiny, white eggs in the seams of mattresses, furniture, and other hiding spots.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="immediate-steps-to-take">Immediate Steps to Take</h4>
<p>If you suspect a bed bug infestation, taking immediate action can help prevent the problem from worsening:</p>

<li><strong>Vacuum Thoroughly</strong>: Use a<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-vacuum-for-bed-bugs/">vacuum cleaner to remove bed bugs</a>and their eggs from mattresses, furniture, carpets, and baseboards. Dispose of the vacuum bag in a sealed plastic bag outside your home.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="diy-bed-bug-treatment-methods">DIY Bed Bug Treatment Methods</h4>
<p>For minor infestations, these DIY methods can help manage and reduce bed bug populations:</p>

<li><strong>Encasements</strong>: Encase mattresses and box springs in bed bug-proof covers to trap and starve any remaining bed bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth around the edges of rooms, in cracks, and along baseboards. This natural powder dehydrates and kills bed bugs upon contact.</li>
<li><strong>Insecticides</strong>: Use over-the-counter bed bug sprays and powders. Be sure to follow the manufacturers instructions carefully. Look for products containing pyrethroids, which are effective against bed bugs.</li>
</ol>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs are a common pest problem in Tacoma, posing a challenge for homeowners and businesses alike. These small, elusive insects can cause significant discomfort and health concerns, making effective treatment essential.</p>
<p>This article provides an in-depth look at bed bug treatment options in Tacoma, ranging from professional pest control services to do-it-yourself (DIY) methods, along with preventive measures to keep these pests at bay.</p>
<h4 id="understanding-bed-bugs">Understanding Bed Bugs</h4>
<p>Bed bugs are small, reddish-brown insects that feed on the blood of humans and animals. They are nocturnal and often hide in cracks and crevices during the day, making them difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Signs of an infestation include itchy bite marks on the skin, small blood stains on sheets, and dark fecal spots on bedding and furniture.</p>
<h4 id="professional-pest-control-services">Professional Pest Control Services</h4>
<p>Engaging a professional pest control service is often the most effective way to deal with a bed bug infestation. Heres how the process typically works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspection</strong>: Professionals conduct a thorough inspection to identify the extent of the infestation. They check common hiding spots such as mattresses, bed frames, furniture, and baseboards.</li>
<li><strong>Heat Treatments</strong>: This method involves raising the temperature of the infested area to around 120F (49C), which is lethal to bed bugs at all life stages. Heat treatments are highly effective and can often eliminate bed bugs in a single session.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Treatments</strong>: Pest control experts use EPA-approved insecticides designed specifically for bed bugs. These chemicals are applied to affected areas, targeting bed bugs in their hiding spots. Multiple treatments may be required to ensure complete eradication.</li>
<li><strong>Steam Treatments</strong>:<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/">High-temperature steam</a>is used to kill bed bugs on contact. This method is particularly useful for treating mattresses, furniture, and other areas where chemicals cannot be applied.</li>
<li><strong>Encasements</strong>: Special bedbug-proof covers are used for mattresses and box springs. These encasements trap any remaining bed bugs, preventing them from feeding and eventually killing them.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="diy-bed-bug-treatment-methods">DIY Bed Bug Treatment Methods</h4>
<p>While professional services are often the most effective, there are several DIY methods that can help manage and reduce bed bug populations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vacuuming</strong>: Regular vacuuming of infested areas, including mattresses, carpets, and furniture, can help reduce the number of bed bugs. Be sure to dispose of the vacuum bag in a sealed plastic bag immediately after use.</li>
<li><strong>Washing and Drying</strong>: Washing infested clothing and bedding in hot water (at least 120F or 49C) and drying them on high heat can kill bed bugs. This method is effective for linens and clothing but may not address all areas of an infestation.</li>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: This natural, non-toxic powder can be spread in infested areas. It works by<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">dehydrating and killing</a><a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs that come into contact with it. However, it may take several days to weeks to see results.</li>
<li><strong>Bed Bug Sprays</strong>: Over-the-counter bed bug sprays can be used to treat visible bed bugs. However, these sprays may not be effective against hidden bed bugs or eggs, and their efficacy varies.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="preventive-measures">Preventive Measures</h4>
<p>Preventing a bed bug infestation is always preferable to dealing with an existing one. Here are some steps to help keep bed bugs out of your home:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decluttering</strong>: Reducing clutter eliminates potential hiding spots for bed bugs. Keep belongings organized and off the floor.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Inspections</strong>: Regularly check for signs of bed bugs, especially after travel. Inspect luggage, clothing, and bedding for any signs of bed bugs before bringing them into your home.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Cracks and Crevices</strong>: Seal gaps in walls, baseboards, and furniture to eliminate potential hiding spots. Use caulk to seal any cracks where bed bugs might hide.</li>
<li><strong>Careful Travel Practices</strong>: When traveling, inspect hotel rooms for signs of bed bugs and keep luggage elevated and away from beds. Upon returning home, wash and dry travel clothes on high heat.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="why-choose-professional-services">Why Choose Professional Services?</h4>
<p>While DIY methods can be helpful, professional pest control services offer several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expert Knowledge</strong>: Professionals have extensive knowledge of bed bug behavior and treatment methods, ensuring thorough and effective treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Solutions</strong>: Professional treatments often combine multiple methods (heat, chemicals, steam) for maximum effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Prevention</strong>: Professionals can provide ongoing monitoring and prevention advice to ensure bed bugs do not return.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are a persistent and troublesome pest, but with the right treatment methods and preventive measures, you can effectively eliminate them from your home or business in Tacoma.</p>
<p>Whether you choose professional pest control services or DIY methods, its important to act quickly at the first sign of an infestation to prevent it from spreading. By staying vigilant and proactive, you can keep your living spaces bed bug-free.</p>

<em>Mites</em></dd>
<dd>These arachnids will have pincer-looking mouth-parts, no antennae, and four pairs of legs. Mites have one body segment, but the shape is different in various species.
Their pear-shaped, rounded, and soft body is covered by pale hairs that&rsquo;s fine. As noted above, mites (with their unsegmented body) are 0.04 inches.
Due to the tiny body size, mites species may be over-looked - some are parasites, predators, decomposers (living in soil) while are others exist in the water while the rest exist in plants.

<h3 id="2-natural-habitats">2. Natural habitats</h3>
<p><em>Bed bugs</em>
:
Bed bugs will mainly hide
in tiny crevices and cracks around human sleeping and living areas. You&rsquo;ll find them on furniture crevices, upholstery, wallpaper, and baseboards.
Further, you may find bed bugs under seats in trains, buses, and other cars. They could also occupy alternative or temporary habitats like backpacks, luggage, and fabrics.
Some
bed bug species
like the Cimicidae family will mainly bite birds and bats - bides also biting humans. They also hide in clothing and lodging areas, including dormitories, apartments, and hotels.
<em>Bed bugs</em>
:
Mites mainly live as parasites on animals and plants, including fungi. The mites are in caves, thermal springs, salt or freshwater, ornamental plants, crops, pastures, and forests.
The mites will live in leaf litter and other organic debris. However, dust mites love moist and dark places such as cushions, pillows, and mattresses.</p>
<h3 id="3-eating-habits">3. Eating Habits</h3>
<p><em>Bed bugs</em>
:
Bed bugs won&rsquo;t
burrow into human skin
while feeding but will otherwise pierce with their sharp mouth-parts to reach capillaries to such blood.
On amount, bed bugs consume a meal about six times their body weight while sleeping, which happens within a quarter of an hour.
However, adults may live for even five months without taking a blood meal. After taking their blood meal, the female bed bugs will escape into the cracks and walls to lay eggs.
Further, their nymphs or baby bed bugs can also survive for a long time without eating. With the appropriate humidity and temperature, the bed bugs will live in this condition even for weeks.
Bed bugs will mainly take their meals every 3-7 days,
considering their conditions
and age. Therefore, most of the bed bugs will be digesting their meals - and hence treatment leads to dormancy.

<em>Mites</em>
:
Mite&rsquo;s diet feeds on the
blood and skin of mammals. However, others live like predators feeding on
micro-organisms. Also, some mites will feed on
decaying matter, such as fungi - decomposer diets.
Spider mites feed on several plants like house plants &amp; American-elm trees - their juice and soft tissues. Further, species like house dust mites will feed on dead tissue - they aren&rsquo;t parasitic.
Also, dust mites will eat the dead skin cells that are shed by humans. Further, some mites are predators and will eat other mites. But most aren&rsquo;t harmful.
Dust mites don&rsquo;t suck blood from pets or human beings. But the bugs eat flakes of a pet or human skin that&rsquo;s shed off. You&rsquo;ll find them on curtains, carpets, upholstered furniture, bedding, &amp; mattresses.</p>
<h3 id="4-health-effects">4. Health effects</h3>
<p>Despite being tiny bugs, mites have a large health effect because its poop will trigger allergic reactions like eczema, rhinitis, and asthma.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to dealing with pests in your home, it is important to correctly identify the type of infestation you are dealing with. <a href="/posts/how-much-do-bed-bug-exterminators-cost/">Bed</a> bugs are one of the most notorious household pests, but they are not the only ones that can cause discomfort or damage. In this article, we will compare bed bugs with other common household pests, including their behavior, signs of infestation, and methods of control. Understanding the differences between bed bugs and other pests will help you take the necessary steps to eliminate them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-bed-bugs">What Are Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) are small, flat, reddish-brown insects that feed on the blood of humans and animals. They are nocturnal and typically hide in cracks and crevices during the day, emerging at night to feed. Bed bugs are often found in places where people sleep, such as mattresses, box springs, and bed frames. Although bed bugs are not known to transmit diseases, their bites can cause itching, irritation, and allergic reactions in some people.</p>
<h3 id="common-symptoms-of-bed-bug-infestation">Common Symptoms of Bed <a href="/posts/how-to-find-bed-bugs-during-the-day/">Bug</a> Infestation</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Itchy, red bites:**Bed bugs leave bite marks that are often grouped together in a small area, typically on exposed skin.</li>
<li>**Dark spots on bedding:**Bed bug excrement appears as dark stains on sheets, mattresses, and other fabric surfaces.</li>
<li>**Visible bugs:**Bed bugs can sometimes be seen on bedding, furniture, or in cracks and crevices in walls or floors.</li>
<li>**Musty odor:**Bed bug infestations may produce a sweet, musty smell caused by the scent glands of the insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-common-household-pests">Other Common Household Pests</h3>
<p>While bed bugs are a significant concern, they are far from the only pests that can invade your home. Lets take a look at some other common household pests and how they compare to bed bugs in terms of behavior, signs of infestation, and control methods.</p>
<h4 id="1-ants">1. Ants</h4>
<p>Ants are among the most common household pests. They live in colonies and can invade homes in search of food, water, and shelter. Unlike bed bugs, ants do not feed on blood. Instead, they are attracted to sugary foods, grease, and other food remnants.</p>
<h5 id="signs-of-an-ant-infestation">Signs of an Ant Infestation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Visible trails of ants, especially near food sources.</li>
<li>Ant nests, often located in cracks, behind walls, or under flooring.</li>
<li>Frequent sightings of ants in the kitchen, pantry, or other food storage areas.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="control-methods">Control Methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Sealing cracks and gaps where ants may enter.</li>
<li>Cleaning up food spills and crumbs to remove food sources.</li>
<li>Using ant baits or insecticides to kill ants and destroy their nests.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-cockroaches">2. Cockroaches</h4>
<p>Cockroaches are resilient pests that can thrive in a variety of environments, particularly in warm, humid areas. Like bed bugs, they are nocturnal and are often found in dark, hidden places. Cockroaches feed on organic matter, including food, garbage, and even other insects.</p>
<h5 id="signs-of-a-cockroach-infestation">Signs of a Cockroach Infestation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Dark, greasy streaks along walls, floors, or countertops.</li>
<li>Small, dark droppings that resemble coffee grounds or black pepper.</li>
<li>Visible cockroaches, particularly at night.</li>
<li>Foul odor, often described as musty or oily.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="control-methods-1">Control Methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating food and water sources by keeping the home clean.</li>
<li>Sealing cracks and gaps where cockroaches can enter.</li>
<li>Using cockroach baits, traps, or insecticides to kill cockroaches.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-termites">3. Termites</h4>
<p>Termites are destructive pests that feed on wood and other cellulose-based materials. They often go undetected for long periods because they live inside walls or underground. Unlike bed bugs, termites do not feed on blood. Instead, they can cause significant structural damage to buildings if left untreated.</p>
<h5 id="signs-of-a-termite-infestation">Signs of a Termite Infestation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Hollow-sounding wood when tapped.</li>
<li>Visible mud tubes along walls or foundations.</li>
<li>Small piles of sawdust near wooden surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="control-methods-2">Control Methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Contacting a pest control professional for treatment, such as liquid termiticides or baiting systems.</li>
<li>Sealing entry points to prevent termites from entering your home.</li>
<li>Regular inspections to detect early signs of termites.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-fleas">4. Fleas</h4>
<p>Fleas are tiny, blood-sucking insects that typically infest pets, particularly cats and dogs. However, they can also infest homes if pets are not treated for fleas. Unlike bed bugs, fleas are more active and can jump long distances. Fleas can cause discomfort for both pets and humans, with bites that result in itching and irritation.</p>
<h5 id="signs-of-a-flea-infestation">Signs of a Flea Infestation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Frequent scratching or biting from pets.</li>
<li>Small, red, itchy bites on the skin, particularly around the ankles.</li>
<li>Flea dirt (small black specks) found in pet bedding or carpeting.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="control-methods-3">Control Methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Treating pets with flea control products.</li>
<li>Vacuuming regularly to remove fleas and eggs from carpets and upholstery.</li>
<li>Using insecticides or flea bombs in the home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-bed-bugs-compare-to-other-pests">How Bed Bugs Compare to Other Pests</h3>
<p>While bed bugs are often associated with bites and irritation, they are quite different from other pests in terms of their feeding habits, hiding places, and control methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Feeding:**Bed bugs are the only pests on this list that feed exclusively on blood. Other pests like ants, cockroaches, and fleas feed on food or organic matter, while termites feed on wood.</li>
<li>**Signs of Infestation:**Bed bugs leave distinct bite marks, dark spots on bedding, and a musty odor. In contrast, other pests like ants and cockroaches leave trails or droppings, while termites cause visible damage to wood.</li>
<li>**Control:**While bed bugs require targeted treatment such as professional extermination, other pests like ants, cockroaches, and fleas may be managed with over-the-counter treatments, cleaning, and sealing cracks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Identifying and controlling household pests is essential to maintaining a comfortable and safe living environment. While bed bugs are a significant concern, other pests like ants, cockroaches, termites, and fleas can also cause harm and inconvenience. Each pest requires different control methods, so it is important to understand the characteristics and behaviors of the pests you are dealing with. If you suspect a bed bug infestation or any other pest problem, it is advisable to contact a pest control professional for an accurate assessment and effective treatment.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there are pests in your house that look like
cockroaches
or bed bugs; you&rsquo;d better be sure.
One of them will cause damage in the kitchen while the other will bite you and your kids at night.
On bed bugs vs roaches; cockroaches have a bigger body, they can fly and they&rsquo;ll come out in the daytime - feeding on kitchen scraps. But bed bugs will suck human blood frequently.</p>
<ul>
<li>You cansquash bed bugs more easilythan cockroaches but both will be challenging to kill.
You will find it less time-consuming and less costly if you control either roaches or bed bugs in their early stages.
Prior to starting the pest treatment, ensure that you identify the bug correctly or you may
hire an exterminator
who is an expert in removing cockroaches or bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-bed-bugs">What Are Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/introduction-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)">Bed bugs</a>
have oval-shaped (flattened) bodies that are reddish-brown in color.
The pests will grow larger with age but they generally measure like poppy seeds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baby bed bugsare comparable in size to adult bed bugs but they will be lightly colored.
Bed bugs won&rsquo;t fly but they come with wing-like structures and I think but short antennas on their head.
Bedbugs are described as a public health pest by the USDA, CDC, and EPA. They will irritate humans, cause itching and suck blood they spread and transmit diseases.
So, I advise that you adopt appropriate control and prevention of the bed bugs since these pests can trigger more public health problems.
The increase in bed bugs is due to poor bug control techniques, resistance to pesticides, having limited information on pest prevention, and increased travel.
Controlling bed bugs requires combining chemical and non-chemical strategies.
Bed bugs will hide in crevices and cracks due to their small size, they will be challenging to find &amp; identify.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-cockroaches">What are cockroaches?</h2>
<p>You can identify mature roaches in a simple way; they have 1 to 2 inches (large body) that is flat oval making it easy to notice these bugs from some little distance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roaches have a body color that ranges from dark brown or black to light tan. Roaches don&rsquo;t fly but have wings and some forward-pointing (long) antennas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="roaches-versus-bed-bugs-differences">Roaches versus Bed Bugs; Differences</h2>
<p>Roaches and bed bugs have some similarities, particularly when they are younger.
However, the pests have differences that may assist you in identifying either of them.</p>
<h3 id="1-bites">1. Bites</h3>
<p>Cockroaches and bed bugs can bite humans. But
bed bugs
will prove highly aggressive in their biting compared to the roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bug bites will leave red and itchy skin marks
Bed bugs will bite humans and suck blood for their survival. The pest will bite you and attack itself on your skin feeding on blood until they get filled.
On the other hand, cockroaches will bite humans but rarely (they dont suck blood) but they will eat feces, food leftovers, and trash.</li>
<li>When cockroaches get enough food around their spaces, they wont bite people. However, when there are limited food sources for cockroaches, the bugs will bite human beings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-running-or-fighting">2. Running or Fighting?</h3>
<p>Cockroaches and bed bugs generally avoid going near humans during the day (during activity) and thus they will run from people.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the day, bed bugs and cockroaches will avoid human contact and hide<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/">under carpets</a>, and cracks.
An attempt to attack either cockroaches or bed bugs will cause these pests to run and hide.
Unlike cockroaches, bed bugs have no adaptation to enable them to fight humans. For example, they lack jaws while their stings are adapted only for sucking blood.</li>
<li>Therefore, bed bugs cant use their stings to attack or fight off human beings - and so theyre runners.
On the other hand, cockroaches can attack humans using their jaws. However, due to the small size of the bug and its jaws, roaches wont cause major injury to humans.
However, a direct confrontation between coaches and humans will have the pest running into some hiding places such as cracks - and so theyre also generally runners and not fighters.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-do-roaches-or-bed-bug-fly">3. Do roaches or Bed Bug Fly?</h3>
<p>On flying, both bed bugs and roaches have wings. These wings, however, are used differently in these pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, bed bugs are crawlers and thus they wont fly. Bed bugs will hide in mattresses (<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">but you can use mattress covers</a>) and so these pests will not require to fly to get to their host - the humans being sleeping on the bed.
Further, bed bugs will largely hide in indoor spaces (the home) and thus they dont need to fly long distances or move outdoors.
However, cockroaches are able to glide through the air and may even fly.</li>
<li>This might come as a surprise to most homeowners.</li>
<li>The cockroaches have a hard body that tends to hide their wings.
During flying the cockroach will open its hard outer shell and spread its wings.
However, most of the time the cockroaches will be crawling as opposed to flying even when moving into hiding spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-nocturnal-or-day-runners---roaches-vs-cockroaches">4. Nocturnal or Day Runners - Roaches vs Cockroaches</h3>
<p>Cockroaches and bedbugs are described as nocturnal and so you will mainly see them in the daytime.
Bed bugs for example tend to feed while humans are in bed (sucking their blood) and this is mainly at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the daytime, bed bugs will be digesting the blood meal taken the previous night, hiding in various locations, and laying eggs.
Bed bugs will run into hiding if humans attempt to irritate or harm them over the daytime.
Cockroaches on the other hand are also known to be nocturnal.</li>
<li>They will be rummaging around for food sources during the night as you are sleeping.
It is highly likely that you will see more cockroaches around the house during the day as opposed to the number of bed bugs you can see.</li>
<li>Cockroaches are very fast and nimble and so they will avoid getting harmed by running away.
However, cockroaches will remain in their hiding places during the day unless there is an urgent need to move around the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-do-roaches-or-bed-bugs-spread-diseases">5. Do Roaches or Bed Bugs Spread Diseases?</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that bed bugs will survive by sucking human blood, no scientific proof shows that they do really spread diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-bed-bug-bites-last/">bed bug&rsquo;s saliva</a>may trigger itching in humans and this may result in intense scratching around the bite area.</li>
<li>Such scratches on the human skin could result in infections.
Notably, most bed bugs will suck blood on an individual or the few people sleeping on the same bed.</li>
<li>So, it is less likely that the bed bugs will transmit any infections to other people that are not sleeping in the same bed.
However, due to how cockroaches feed and live, it is more likely that they carry infections and diseases.</li>
<li>For example, cockroaches will feed and leave around the sewer and trash bins where there are food sources, and areas that are dark and damp.
So, because of visiting and living in such areas, cockroaches can spread diseases such as cholera fever, typhoid dysentery, and diarrhea.
Besides, cockroaches can trigger allergies and asthma as they move around the dirty boots and pick different germs and allergens.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5OJ0hdsfc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5OJ0hdsfc</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary on cockroaches vs bed bugs, I would recommend getting a professional exterminator to help in the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, I know that baby roaches and bed bugs may have a similar appearance.
Other pests that look like baby roaches or bed bugs include fleas, spider beetles, carpet beetles, beetles, booklice, and bat bugs.
The signs of bed bug infestations will include reddish or rusty blood stains on mattresses and sheets.
Cheers!</li>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWiu07UDH50">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWiu07UDH50</a>
There is a wide range of powders that you can use to protect your
home from being bed
bug-infested�effectively.
To use the powders in the right way, you need to start by clearing the clutter and other mess in your bedroom and other parts of the house.
Apply your favorite powder in the holes, crevices, under the carpet, and in stuffed toys. These are the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-bed-bugs/">areas that the bed bugs use to hide</a>
and reproduce.
The powders should be applied in small amounts. However, you must ensure that you target the right areas since without that, the bed bugs will keep reproducing, and your house will not be safe.
Regardless of the powder that you use, you are supposed to clean your house of the residue that might have been left behind after the powder&rsquo;s application.
Note that some powders work faster compared to the rest. After applying the powder, you should give it at least 48 hours to
kill all the adult bed bugs
.
A good powder will also target the eggs (including
baby bed bugs
) and destroy them all.</p>
<h2 id="is-bed-bug-power-safe-for-humans">Is Bed Bug Power Safe For Humans?</h2>
<p>Diatomaceous earth
is the primary ingredient used by the powders mentioned above. It is mainly natural and does not have any effect on human health.</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">fact that it kills bed bugs</a>and prevents them from moving freely in your home makes it an ideal option.</li>
<li>It is essential to note that diatomaceous alone is not perfect forkilling and controlling bed bugsfrom infesting your home.
Though it kills and ensures that they dont move in your house, diatomaceous works best alongside heat treatment.
It is essential to heat-treat your items all the time and before using diatomaceous to complement the process.</li>
<li>Though the powders might not significantly affect humans, it is essential to treat and air your house after using them.</li>
<li>This makes sense since some companies use additives that might be poisonous.
Therefore, when your kids and pets get into contact with them, they might have allergic reactions that might be hard to deal with. Use as per the manufacturer&rsquo;s direction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bug powders come in different qualities, prices, and efficacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on your budget and level of infestation, you can pick the right powder to use.

ensure you need to place in on a stable place away from children and pets. You can hang it on the wall or roof if the Mosquito zapper has a hook option. This should not affect humans within the room.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/">for bed bugs</a>

<h2 id="bugs-that-look-like-bed-bugs"><strong>Bugs That Look Like Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-bat-bugs">1. Bat bugs</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Dark brown or beige
<strong>Description:</strong>
Among other bugs, bat bugs have the greatest resemblance to bed bugs. Perhaps only an expert can differentiate between the two using a microscope.</p>
<p>You cant tell the difference by looking at their color or shape. One of the most notable difference is their hair on the thorax. Bat bugs have longer hair than bed bugs.</p>
<p>While bed bugs feed on human blood, bat bugs feed on bat blood. However, in the absence of bats, bat bugs will feed on blood from other hosts including humans.</p>
<ul>

<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do bat bugs have wings?**The wings on bat bugs are non-functional.</li>
<li>**Do bat bugs bite?**Their bite is just as irritating as a bed bug bite.
<strong>Where are bat bugs found?</strong>
The name bat bug does not mean that they nest on the backs of bats. It rather depicts their adaptation to live in areas nested by bats as they feed on their blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from caves, bats can live in many other places. So its possible to find bat bugs just anywhere including our houses.</p>
<h3 id="2-spider-beetles">2. Spider Beetles</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Their color ranges from yellow to brown to near black.
<strong>Description:</strong>
Spider beetles have a common resemblance to spiders owing to their small oval body and long legs.</p>
<p>But they are also easily mistaken for bed bugs because most of them are reddish brown in color.</p>
<p>They are however smaller than bed bugs and have wings that are covered with hairs. Unlike bed bugs, spider beetles have two body segments (head connects to the body without a neck).</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**1/32 in-3/16 in or 1-5mm</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do Spider Beetles have wings?**They have wings but only a few species can fly</li>

where they can easily access stored food.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-cockroach-nymphs">3. Cockroach Nymphs</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Reddish-brown
<strong>Description:</strong>

<ul>
<li>**Size:**2 in long</li>
<li>**Shape:**Cylindrical</li>
<li>**Do Cockroach Nymphs have wings?**Cockroach nymphs have no wings</li>
<li>**Do Cockroach Nymphs bite?**They dont bite
<strong>Where are Cockroach Nymphs found?</strong>
Unlike bed bugs, roach nymphs like hiding in the kitchen and other places where there is food and debris.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-carpet-beetles">4. Carpet beetles</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Dark brown or black with white marks and red or orange scales.
<strong>Description:</strong>
They dont bear any resemblance to bed bugs but may give you some panic when they crawl on your carpet or clothes. They like feeding on fibrous material like cotton wool, silk, fur, feather etc.</p>
<p>They can be distinguished from bed bugs by their hard skeleton and antennae.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**Adults are 1/16-1/8-inch or 2.0-3.8mm.</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do Carpet beetles have wings?**Adult carpet beetles have wings which they use to fly during the day.</li>

Reddish-brown
<strong>Description:</strong>
They belong to the family Cimicidae, just like bed bugs. Physically, they resemble the bed bugs in their shape, size and color.</p>
<p>Notable differences between the two include the long antennae segment and the long hair on the body of swallow bugs. These can only be seen under a microscope.</p>
<p>Another distinction is perhaps their feeding habits. While bed bugs feed on human blood, swallow bugs feed on the blood of birds, specifically swallows.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**3/16 in</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do Swallow Bugs have wings?**They dont have wings.</li>

<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do fleas have wings?**No. But they can jump from one place to another.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="7-book-lice">7. Book Lice</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Their color ranges from pale brown to cream yellow and sometimes appear to be translucent.
<strong>Description:</strong>
Book lice bear a lot of similarity with bed bug nymphs. While both are light colored, bed bug nymphs will turn to reddish-brown when they feed.</p>
<p>The body of book lice appears to be more elongated than that of bed bug nymphs.</p>
<p>Book lice are not actually related to the lice that feeds on us. They however look alike in terms of shape and size.</p>

<p>Headlice stay on their host most the times and feeds regularly. However, bed bugs stay away from the host and only come to feed from time to time.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**1/16 in-1/8 in or 2.53 mm long</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oblong</li>
<li>**Do headlice have wings?**They have no wings but have legs for crawling from one hair to another or from one host to another.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Wear long-sleeved clothes, and youll be safe from bed bug bites (Cimex lectularius Linnaeus).&rdquo; Maybe, maybe not. But bed bug bites are painful and will cause anemia. So, you&rsquo;re wondering, can bed bugs bite through clothing?
<em>The short answer is, NO, bed bugs lack teeth to gnaw through clothing or fabric. The bugs only have a sharp�and long proboscis allowing them to access your blood vessels.�</em>
<em>The bed bug&rsquo;s feeding response is triggered when they land on bare skin. So, any bites that you notice under your clothes may have been caused by other bugs like scabies mites or mosquitoes.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-clothing-pajamas-socks-fabric">Can Bed Bugs Bite through Clothing? Pajamas, Socks, Fabric?</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, bed bugs won&rsquo;t bite through pajamas, just like in other clothes and fabrics. Bed bugs lack teeth to help them gnaw pajamas, plastic, or different material.
Notably, bed bugs have a sharp and long proboscis that they&rsquo;ll use to suck blood from your blood vessels on the human skin. In fact, the
bed bug&rsquo;s proboscis/)
is almost double its body size.
However, the bed bug&rsquo;s feeding mechanism is only triggered when the skin lands on the human skin. Thus, the bugs can&rsquo;t poke the proboscis through fabrics, pajamas, and clothes to reach your bare skin.
Researchers report that bed bugs only suck blood using a skin-type membrane, and hence clothes or fabrics and pajamas won&rsquo;t trigger these feeding actions. Therefore, if you have pajamas on, bed bugs won&rsquo;t bit through them.
So, any bed bugs bites you find after a night&rsquo;s sleep, despite having worn your pajamas, must have been because the fabrics had rolled up to leave your skin bare for the bed bugs to feed.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-leggings-or-socks">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Leggings or Socks?</h2>
<p>Luckily, most leggings and socks are too tight for bed bugs to bite underneath them - and the bugs won&rsquo;t definitely bite through them.
Most leggings have nylon and elastic materials that&rsquo;ll tightly hug your legs and hence prevent
bed bug bites
.�Therefore, any bed bugs bite you&rsquo;ll notice on your legs will only occur at any bare skin that the bugs will find.
So, when you&rsquo;re wearing leggings for protection, also ensure you control bed bugs in other ways like sprays or steaming

<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-tights">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Tights?</h2>
<p>Many people, especially women, love putting on tights when going to sleep. I note that socks are an excellent solution to
averting any bed bug infestation
.
This is because tights will form a tight bond with your body - therefore, the bugs won&rsquo;t crawl under the fabric. Therefore, bed bugs won&rsquo;t bite the whole part of your lower body when you&rsquo;re wearing tights.
However, do not consider wearing tight as the sole and reliable way of preventing bed bugs from biting your skin. Sadly, the bed bugs will turn to any tiny bit of your bare skin that&rsquo;s available and launch bloodsucking attacks on you.
Therefore, you&rsquo;d better control the bed bugs using
sprays
,
traps,
or
<strong>tea tree oil</strong>
instead of just wearing tights as the only protection. - these are also odorless, non-staining, and most are
safe for humans and pets
.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-blankets">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Blankets?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs won&rsquo;t also bite
through blankets and comforters as you&rsquo;re sleeping or merely covering yourself. However, just like with other clothes and fabrics, bed bugs will readily bite your skin when they claw under the blankets.
Bed bugs have a tiny
and flattened body that allows them to hide in blankets, clothing, crevices, comforters easily. The warm and dark conditions in these materials will easily attract bed bugs.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-vinyl">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Vinyl?</h2>
<p>Thus, after
undertaking bed bug
treatment, you&rsquo;ll need to place the blankets in new plastic bags. Also, ensure that the bags have no holes. However, don&rsquo;t use
spray insecticides
with the blankets to leave a foul odor and stains.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-sheets">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Sheets?</h2>
<p>The bugs won&rsquo;t care whether you have comforters or bedsheets; they&rsquo;ll crawl under to get to your bare skin. So, don&rsquo;t think that bed bugs did bite through the blankets and sheet - they claw to bite any exposed skin on your body.
You can easily control the bed bugs in the blankets and comforters using high heat and a dryer. Luckily, the high temperatures will
kill bed bug adults, nymphs, and eggs
.</p>
<h2 id="bed-bugs-crawl-underneath-your-clothing-to-bite">Bed Bugs Crawl underneath Your Clothing to Bite</h2>
<p>Most people recommend we put on lengthy clothes to cover even the legs and arms  to reduce the amount of exposed skin. Well, the neck and face are a favorite feeding spot for bed bugs and
their babies
.
Bed bugs wont bite through your clothes but will
crawl under your fabric or clothes
and bite the skin. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and shorts wont deter bed bugs from biting you or your family members.
Also, bites from bed bugs may not appear or hurt immediately after the bug suck blood from you. Thus, the bite you might see under your clothes may have been
caused by another bed bug hours earlier
but now when your skin was bare.</p>
<h2 id="how-bed-bugs-hitchhike-your-clothes">How Bed Bugs Hitchhike your Clothes</h2>
<p>First,
bed bugs cant jump or fly
. Thus, its unlikely that the block suckers will jump from one human being to your fabric or clothing. But its possible to find the
bugs hanging around the clothes
on the bed, laundry, or room floor.
The
bugs will mainly hide
on piles of clothes, cracks, and crevices, including bed sheet crevices and headboards. So, dont leave clothes on the bed, old or send-hand furniture, or floor of a room thats bed bug-infested.
So, besides hiding in second-hand furniture or mattresses, bed bugs will also hide in your bed and bedding. Notably, steam, dryer, and
hot water will help kill the bed bugs
.
Dealing with

in our houses. They like to hide under clothes and mattresses but can bed bugs bite through clothes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The truth is bedbugs cannot bite through clothes. They have to find their way through the skin before they can bite. A lot of people think that they can bite through clothes but they dont. They only penetrate through the open spaces of the pajamas, blankets, socks, sheets, and other fabrics.</strong>

<p>If you have a bed bug infestation in your house, dont be surprised if you wake up and find yourself with bugs bites.</p>
<ul>

Though these clothes help, some still cant protect you from the bites while others can.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-will-bed-bugs-bite-via-your-pajamas"><strong>1. Will Bed Bugs Bite via Your Pajamas?</strong></h3>
<p>Even if bed bugs cannot bite through fabrics, it is important to note that they can still make their way underneath the pajamas into the skin.
Bedbugs have mouths that are not structured to bite or cut through clothes but instead bite through soft skin. They also have a proboscis that easily penetrates into the skin and sucks blood which they depend on for survival.
The only way bed bugs will bite you even with your pajamas is when you sleep and leave parts of your skin exposed. They enter through the open spaces in the hand and legs and get to the skin before biting.</p>
<h3 id="2-will-bed-bugs-bite-via-skin-tights"><strong>2. Will bed bugs bite via Skin tights?</strong></h3>
<p>Just like others fabrics, bed bugs cant bite through skin tights. However, skin tights are very helpful because they keep the body well-covered making it hard for the bugs to get to the skin and bite.
Though the bugs may also try another way of getting to your skin by climbing to where the clothes are loose and easy to allow them to penetrate underneath.
Therefore, instead of pajamas, skin tights offer much better protection.</p>
<h3 id="3-can-bed-bugs-bite-via-socks"><strong>3. Can Bed bugs bite via Socks?</strong></h3>
<p>If you get bites underneath the socks, its probably not bed bugs because they cant bite through socks. Whether the socks are cotton or elastic types, bed bugs will not be able to bite through them.</p>

<li>May bed bugs will probably move around the socks borderline where they get into contact with the skin and bite.
However, there are socks that are loose or woven with large spaces, they can easily let the bed bugs underneath and into the skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-can-bed-bugs-bite-via-blankets"><strong>4. Can Bed Bugs Bite via Blankets?</strong></h3>
<p>Blankets dont offer much protection from bed bug bites. If you are relying on it to protect yourself, you will be disappointed.
Unlike skin tights and other clothing, blankets wont protect you from bites. Bed bugs are able to penetrate underneath the blankets and bite your exposed skin.
What if you tightly wrap the blanket around you? Well, chances are at night as you sleep you will untangle yourself and give room to the bugs to crouch in and start biting.
But if you are infested with bed bugs, dont go for the blankets instead use pest control products to eliminate them and have a bug-free house.</p>
<h3 id="6-can-bed-bugs-bite-via-sheets"><strong>6. Can Bed Bugs Bite via Sheets?</strong></h3>
<p>Just the same way, bed bugs cant bite through other clothing, they also wont bite through sheets. Like blankets, they will make their way underneath it before they can attack you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs are clever and will most likely hide beneath the blankets and sheets waiting for the right opportunity. In this case, they will also like to hide underneath the blankets.
Therefore, though bed bugs cant bite through clothing, some clothing still makes it easy for the bugs to get through and bite.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bed bugs are very nagging parasites. They attack when we least expect and can survive for a long period without a blood meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>They will hide under the mattress and other areas and wait for the opportunity to get to the skin and bite.
Even though they can hardly bite through clothing, some home remedies will be good to keep off the bed bugs off.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-using-mattress-covers-">**1. Using Mattress Covers **</h3>
<p>For those bed bugs that hide under the mattress, it is so easy to keep them off by using mattress covers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it is hard for the bugs to penetrate and bite through clothing, this will keep them off from finding their way to come and bite you.
This method is not 100 percent effective because it does not eliminate the bugs and those that are not enclosed under the cover will still come and attack you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-using-bug-traps"><strong>2. Using bug traps</strong></h3>
<p>There are tarps that are
designed to trap bed bugs
. They are available at the retailer&rsquo;s store and other outlets.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the traps, you can place them around the bed as you sleep to enjoy a peaceful night. These traps have either a slippery or a sticky surface that traps the bugs. These traps use heat and carbon dioxide to attract the bugs.
If you can have access to these traps, you can improvise a homemade trap by using water to create a slippery surface for the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-contacting-an-expert"><strong>3. Contacting an Expert</strong></h3>
<p>If the infestation is too much, contacting a pest control expert is a good option. This is because of their experience in bed bugs management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those using traps and covers works only to prevent the bites but will not stop the bugs infestation.
Most pest control experts know how to handle and also eliminate both adult bugs and eggs and have a bedbug-free house.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p>Can bed bugs bite through clothes? The answer is no. Their mouths are not adapted to that but are made of proboscis, which bites and sucks blood from the host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs find their way underneath the clothes into the skin, where can bite and have their blood meal. Some clothes like skin tights can prevent the bed bugs from reaching the skin while others like blankets and sheets can hardly do that.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can bed bugs climb metal or plastic? One of the worst bug infestations you can ever wish on your enemies is a bedbug invasion. These devious little creatures pack an irritable, itchy bite that will cut your night short.
If youve ever dealt with bedbugs before, you might be wondering how well they manage to navigate their way to all corners of our furniture. We previously noted that
bed bugs do not fly-fly/)
.
But, can
bed bugs
climb metal? Also, check our
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">list of ultimate drain cleaners</a>
as bed bugs can again come into your house through dirty drains.</p>
<h2 id="socan-bed-bugs-climb-metal-or-plastic">So,�Can bed bugs climb metal or plastic?</h2>
<p>Bedbugs are very agile creatures that
<a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/fs1251/">can climb any surface</a>
, so long as it has the right texture. Any surface that allows them some level of traction will be scaled with ease.
However, bedbugs will find it hard to climb polished surfaces of materials like metals, glass, or plastic, although this wont be a problem if the climbing surface has got a layer of dust.
Not to mention that bedbugs are very determined creatures that will go above and beyond the call of duty to find alternative routes to their ideal hiding spot. But do you know long
bed bug bites
last? If not, check this
guide
.
The notion you might have of bedbugs&rsquo; inability to climb metal is based on the fact that bedbugs generally prefer to harbor on wooden frames instead of metallic ones.

<p>You will be shocked just how relentless bedbugs are to turn you into their dinner. The fact that they cant climb metal or plastic comfortably should not guarantee you a good night&rsquo;s sleep.
You must take additional measures to keep off their nasty and painful bites
by killing the bed bugs
or preventing multiplication.
If you are worried about a possible bedbug invasion in your home, you can begin by setting traps in suspect areas to confirm or dispel your fears.
You can do this by placing each leg of your bed and other furniture into a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">container filled with water</a>
. You may also add some
rubbing alcohol
into the water to kill the bugs.
The
water will temporarily keep the bugs
from getting to you when you sleep. Bedbugs will float on water for a short while but die within minutes of being submerged.
If you genuinely have an infestation, chances are youll come across a few dead bodies of culprits trying to swim after a day or so. You can also pour some
ammonia
around the metal or plastic pipes or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">spray the bugs</a>
to discourage the bed bugs from scaling them.
This should be enough incentive for you to call a professional pest control service if you want the scourge to be successfully decimated swiftly and permanently.

<h2 id="familiar-hiding-places-for-bedbugs">Familiar Hiding Places for Bedbugs</h2>
<p>Bedbugs are masters when it comes to the art of hiding. Naturally, these parasites will
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">hide in the corners of our beds</a>
and between the sheets and wait patiently for you to go and sleep. Alternatively, you can kill the bed bugs using steam from
bed bug steamers
.
Remember that they do not
live off the hosts&rsquo;
bodies, so they have to find spots with proximity to their food source, your bed.
But beds arent the only place you are likely to find bedbugs hiding; usually, they will look for any spaces that give them quick access to you when you sleep.
They can do this because they are excellent climbers and scale virtually any surface to find the ideal hang-out spot.
You will find bedbugs hiding in areas such as Lamps, Electrical outlets, Bed frames, Boxsprings, Curtains, Wardrobes and cabinets, Wall cracks and crevices, and Rugs and carpets.</p>

<p>Bed bugs will feed on human blood by first piercing your skin using their tiny beak. The bite won&rsquo;t look serious but it will be skin-irritating.
The beak will inject some anesthetic liquid that&rsquo;ll leave your skin in a numb condition - this allows easy and non-irritating sucking of blood from the human body.
The bed bugs will suck blood from your body for roughly 2 to 5 minutes before crawling back to their hiding places. The bites will become itchy welts or small bumps on the scalp.
Equally notable is that some bloodstain may be left on the sheets or your pillow. For massive infestations, you may notice some offensive or musty odor.
On orientation, the bites from these bed bugs will be found on some straight rows. Your scalp will become raw and sore - but this won&rsquo;t make the hair fall off.</p>

in carpets. Most people consider carpet as fabric to step on and believe that human applied force may cause discomfort/kill to any insect within or under the carpet. This is not true. It is not possible either to
kill bed bugs
by stepping on them directly.
Carpets in your house/rooms may have more bed bugs infestations than other hideouts. Bed bugs prefer living in a warm place without much disturbance. Plastic carpets generate a warm temperate environment as they cling on the floor and are removed only when they get worn out. Therefore, bed bugs will crawl under them and breed successfully.
Most house carpets are heavy and difficult to move/pull about in real life while cleaning your house. Just like other homeowners, you may prefer cleaning carpets after a couple of months  this offers bed bugs ample time to breed and spread.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs! Their name is quite deceiving.Mainly, youll find these pests living in beds and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)-eat/">suck human blood</a>
. But, can <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs live in carpet?
**The simple answer is, YES, bed bugs can live in the carpet and other dark locations. This is particularly common in the gap between the carpet and baseboard and **
<strong>edges of the carpet behind your furniture.�</strong>
<strong>The carpet is a great spot for females to lay eggs.�</strong>
So, lets get started!</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet"><strong>Can Bed Bugs Live in Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bugs prefer hiding in locations where it is easy for them to bite on a host (here&rsquo;s how to
remove the bed bug bite scars
) and slip back into hiding without being noticed. So, apart from your bed, bed bugs will also hide in your carpet.</p>
<p>This is especially possible where your furniture presses against the wall leaving dark corners beneath. They also hide below the carpet and the spaces between the carpet and baseboard or the wall.</p>
<p>If you have an infestation, youre likely to see bed bugs at the edges of your carpet behind the sofa set, cupboard or bed. In case you dont see live bed bugs, their eggs or carcasses in these places are a clear evidence of their presence.</p>
<p>When bed bugs inhabit your carpet, they can create a very big challenge for pest eradication. Sometimes they get entangled in the fibres of the carpet and become extremely hard to locate.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bugs-are-very-swift"><strong>1. Bed Bugs Are Very Swift</strong></h3>
<p>Despite their inability to fly, bed bugs can move very fast from one room to another by crawling on the walls, floors and ceilings.</p>
<p>If you have some bed bugs in your bedroom or in an old sofa that you brought home, they will easily find their way into your carpets.</p>
<h3 id="2-carpets-have-dense-fibers">2. Carpets Have Dense fibers</h3>
<p>Some carpets have a dense network of fibres. This creates an ample hiding place for bed bugs and for female bed bugs to lay their eggs.</p>
<p>Thus, if a few bed bugs get into your carpet, they might soon develop into an infestation.</p>
<h3 id="3-bed-bugs-are-always-hunting-for-a-host"><strong>3. Bed Bugs Are Always Hunting For a Host</strong></h3>
<p>Bed bugs will not wait until you go to bed for them to have a blood meal - causing
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-make-you-sick/">anemia, itching and allergy from the bed bug bite</a>
. That means, they will follow you wherever you go.</p>
<p>As they traverse across the floor to look for a host, there are chances that many bed bugs will find their way in your carpet.</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-lay-eggs-in-carpet"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Lay Eggs in Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bugs will lay their eggs in the same places they inhabit. Since these pesky creatures hide and live in your carpet, you will also find their eggs here. However, you may not be able to see the eggs with your naked eyes since they are very small and translucent.</p>
<p>Again, bed bugs wont travel very far from their source of food. So, apart from your bed, bed bugs will find safe havens in your carpet where theyll hide and lay eggs. The eggs are usually coated with a sticky substance that makes them stick on any surface.</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-crawl-or-fly-across-a-carpet"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Crawl or Fly Across a Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike insects, bed bugs wont fly or jump around the carpet. They can only crawl through the carpet to get to you. Although they might get slowed by thick carpets, they usually have a way of getting through.</p>
<p>When you sleep on the couch or stay too late in the living room, bed bugs will travel from their hideouts and across the carpet in order to feast on your blood.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-inspect-your-carpet-for-bed-bugs"><strong>How to Inspect Your Carpet for Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>Once bed bugs get into your house, they wont go looking for specific places to hide. They can live anywhere in the house as long they have access to their favourite meal.</p>
<p>So, if therere signs of bed bugs in your house, the best thing to do is to inspect all possible hideouts. Below is a guide for inspecting your carpet for bed bugs.
<strong>1. Inspect Space between Carpet and Baseboard or Wall</strong>
The mostly likely place where bed bugs will hide is the space between the carpet and the baseboard or wall. You can use a flashlight to look through the small gap. Even better, you can run your credit card through the space to ambush the bed bugs.</p>
<p>If therere bed bugs inside, youll see them coming out in haste scampering for safety. In addition, dead bed bugs and debris might also come out from these spaces.
<strong>2. Check Underneath the Carpet</strong>
To check whats underneath the carpet, lift one of the corners away for the floor and the baseboard. While holding the corner in place, look keenly for any bed bug movement, carcasses, feces, eggs or other debris.</p>
<p>If that corner of the house is dark, use a flashlight. Bed bugs may drift away into hiding, with the slightest flip of the carpet. However, if you see their carcasses or feces, you should be sure that bed bugs are living here.
<strong>3. Inspect the Debris in Vacuum Cleaner</strong>
You need a bagless vacuum cleaner for this exercise. Starting off with an empty canister, vacuum all your carpeted room thoroughly. Dump the debris outside and vacuum the house again especially along the edges of the carpet.</p>
<p>Now, the contents of the canister are little debris which can be easily differentiated. If therere indeed some bed bugs in your carpet, you will see them scampering for safety.
<strong>4. Inspect Carpet, Behind Sofa, Cabinets or Bed</strong>
The part of carpet that is tacked behind sofa sets, cabinets or beds is very dark, meaning it is a safe haven where bed bugs can hide and breed. To inspect this place, youll need some extra muscle to move things around.</p>
<p>If youve bed bugs in your carpet, then this part of the house could be harbouring a host of them. Some will be on the carpet and others on the furniture just close to the carpet.
<strong>Conclusion�</strong>
Bed bugs can get in your carpet and give you a hard time to eradicate. However, with the above remedies, you can easily get these pesky insects out of your carpet.</p>
<p>These include diatomaceous earth, borax powder, heat treatment, steam treatment and vacuuming.�I recommend using a combination of these remedies to eradicate bed bugs and prevent future infestation.</p>

But bed bug bites will be painless as they&rsquo;ll inject some blood thinner or anticoagulant plus an anesthetic that&rsquo;ll produce some numbing effect for about 5-10 minutes.
Bed bugs
will mainly be active at night since they&rsquo;re attracted to the constant carbon dioxide flow we emit while sleeping. The bite turns into a big itchy and raised welt - they&rsquo;re infected if scratched.
Every human being will react differently to the bed bug bites. It&rsquo;s an everyday reality that� 30 percent of
humans won&rsquo;t show any reaction to the bites</p>
<ul>
<li>they might only see some small puncture wound.
Bedbugs may take about two weeks to develop, and they&rsquo;ll be lined in a row on your skin -

<h2 id="bed-bug-bites">Bed Bug Bites?</h2>
<p>Bed bug bites heal
fully within 3-6 weeks

However, the bedbug bites won&rsquo;t generally need treatment - most people will mainly experience just itching. For severe itching, you may get oral antihistamines or�topical steroid creams for relief.
The
<a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-bedbugs">bedbugs</a>

swollen bodies and have a reddish color.
Further, you may wash the

<h2 id="where-do-bed-bugs-hide">Where Do Bed Bugs Hide?</h2>
<p>Bedbugs won&rsquo;t fly
but are quick to move over ceilings, walls, and floors. They&rsquo;ll lay many eggs during their nymphs.
Bed bugs will mainly come into your spaces through used couches, beds, clothing, and luggage. Thye have a flattened body, and hence they&rsquo;ll fit in small spaces.
Compared to bees or ants,
bed bugs won&rsquo;t nest but will live
in hidden areas. Such places include the headboards, bed frames, box springs, mattresses - use
bed bug mattress encasements
.
With time, the

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one wants to be confronted with a bed bug infestation and one of the burning questions - can bed bugs live outside?
Will these tiny bed bugs survive outside/ in the lawn or yard - you may find
dead bed bugs/)
after you&rsquo;ve used <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bug steamers.
This is because if they can, many people become concerned that they could reenter a home after bed bugs have been eradicated and begin a new cycle.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-live-outside-where--how-long">Can Bed Bugs Live Outside? Where &amp; How Long?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs like to hide out in small dark spaces, and there are many opportunities for them to do so in the indoor environment, with tiny crevices and cracks in furnishings being ideal locations for these creatures.
Their name might suggest that they prefer to inhabit a bed, but this is misleading since they will happily set up home in any item within a house.</p>
<p>When looking for a place to stay, one of the main priorities is food, and bed bugs will live wherever food can be most easily accessed. In answer to the question of can bed bugs live outside, they can, but they prefer not to.
Bed bugs have become used to living in the indoor environment, and as we mentioned, they live where there is food. These minute pests feed off a host, in this case, a human, and so they will find homes where their host can be easily accessed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1QXtI2IhB4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1QXtI2IhB4</a>
Humans spend a lot of time within the home; it makes sense for the bed bugs to do the same. That being said, bed bugs can often be found in outdoor areas which are frequented often by their human hosts; this can include things such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>cars</li>
<li>outdoor furniture such as deck chairs and wooden tables</li>
<li>tents</li>
<li>sheds and other outdoor structures.</li>
<li>Wood piles
Bed bugs prefer to live in a warmer environment, and this is, of course, more simple when indoors. Being outside would not harm them, but they are not as keen on the outdoors&rsquo; cooler temperatures.</li>
<li>Some factors determine how long bed bugs can survive outside, and some of these are as follows.</li>
<li>Temperature extremes will have some effect on bed bugs, but they really do have to be extreme. These are pretty resilient little animals and are likely to survive hot and cold temperatures but will likely die off if the temperature drops well below freezing.</li>
<li>Of course, as with any insect, the bed bug has predators, and depending on the prevalence of these in your garden will depend on how long the bed bugs can last. Some of the most typical�bed bug predators include lizards, spiders, and ants.</li>
<li>If the bed bugs do not have access to food, they will eventually die out. That being said, these tough little pests can survive for months without food, but the females will be unable to produce<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-eggs/">eggs</a>if they are not fed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-get-back-inside-once-removed-from-the-house">Can Bed Bugs Get Back Inside once Removed from the House?</h2>
<p>Now that we have established that bed bugs can indeed live in an outdoor environment, we need to determine whether they can return after you have kicked them out of the home.
Bed bugs cannot fly or jump, like their distant cousins, the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/">fleas in the carpet</a>
, but they can still return into a house by way of attachment once they have been sent packing.
They do this by simply being on something that is returned inside; for example, if they live in a garden table, you then cover with a table cloth for a BBQ.
Once the BBQ is over, you return the table cloth into the home, and any bed bugs that have latched onto it will hitch a ride inside.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yChSIxn_9A8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yChSIxn_9A8</a>
It is essential that if you know there is a bed infestation outdoors or recently evicted some from within the home, you are extremely careful when bringing things back in from outside.
It is also worth noting that while they are tiny insects, they can travel around 20 meters in any one day and so can quickly march right back into the home should they wish to.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-get-rid-of-bed-bugs">How Can I Get Rid Of Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>If you are unfortunate enough to have some unwanted visitors in the form of bedbugs, there are some things that you can do to rid your home of these lodgers.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am using a professional heat treatment.</li>
<li>I am applying insecticide products to affected areas.</li>
<li>Vacuuming affected items thoroughly.</li>
<li>Use an oil-based varnish on wooden furniture.</li>
<li>Avoid having clutter inside or outside the home.</li>
<li>When bringing items inside the home, whether from your garden or anywhere else, thoroughly check them for the presence of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bugs can be a real nuisance, and once you have successfully eradicated them from your home, you are surely going to want to make sure that they do not return.
With this in mind, it is essential to understand that merely removing affected items outside is not enough to kill these pests because they can still thrive in an outdoor environment.
You can take measures to avoid their return, however, and most importantly, you should stay vigilant.</p>

<p>Whether bedbugs can survive in water depends on several factors. First, a recently fed bedbug tends to be heavy and takes the shape of a balloon. These two qualities make the bedbugs to sink when exposed to a pool of water.
When submerged in water, the
bed bug
cannot survive for long due to a lack of air.�On the other hand, an unfed bedbug appears flat, oval-shaped, and light in weight.
These factors result in adequate surface tension, making the
bed bug (check bed bug bully)
float on the water surface. While floating, the bedbugs have access to atmospheric air, which makes them survive.
However, you can drown the floating bedbugs by agitating the water with a washing machine or hand. Since bedbugs cannot survive for long in the water, they will easily die because of their inability to breathe - you&rsquo;ll see

Bed bug eggs
cannot also survive in hot water. Normally, adult

? Without meaning to state the obvious, bed bugs are, above everything else, insects. So it goes without saying that they are fairly visible. Well, not necessarily.
<em>Summary: Most bed bugs resemble an apple seed in various aspects, from shape, size, and even color.�</em>
<em>This is why you shouldnt experience any difficulties spotting these blood-sucking little monsters with your naked eye.related Bed Bug Steamers.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bug Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-you-see-bed-bugs-signs-of-bed-bugs">Can You See Bed Bugs? Signs of Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>In terms of size, bed bugs grow to approximately 5 to 7 mm in length. Thats just about 3/16 to  of an inch. However, as you probably already guessed, their size varies depending on their age. Check these
bed bug pictures
.
Thats a no-brainer, really. More interestingly, the shape of bedbugs significantly changes depending on how full they are. Early in the morning, when they are just fresh from their feeding frenzy, bed bugs assume a balloon-like body.
In such times, their body is ordinarily reddish-brown and relatively elongated. This contrasts with the long, oval shape and brown
color of a bed bug
that has not eaten for some time.
In addition to these basic features, it is also important to remember that all bed bugs possess the characteristics of true bugs.
These include the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>3 pairs of legs.</li>
<li>Cone-like eyes.</li>
<li>A three-segmented beak.</li>
<li>A golden appearance characterizes short hair.</li>
<li>Part antennas.</li>
<li>Non-flying wings.
However, chances are you will never get close enough to view these features up-close.
For most people, a bed bug
is meant to be squeezed as soon as it is spotted.
That notwithstanding, catching bed bugs is an art in its own right. This is because they are asleep during the day and active during the night.
And even during their active hours, bed bugs will not readily come out to feed. Instead, they will wait until the coast is clear. Due to their high sensitivity to movement, bedbugs will usually prefer a still host.
If you are lucky enough to get up in the middle of the night, you will be able to spot them easily. This is the time when their bodies are swollen, and can barely run or hide.
In rare cases, you may spot bed bugs during the day. This especially happens when they are starving and happen to have detected the presence of blood nearby.
But make no mistake, bed bugs that regularly feed at night will rarely come out during the day, except when they really have to.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-tell-bed-bugs-from-other-bugs-and-insects">How to Tell Bed Bugs from Other Bugs and Insects</h2>
<p>Apart from the basic features discussed above, there are other ways to
tell a bed bug
from other insects. If you are lucky enough to come very close to them, you will never miss their signature scent that is usually described as dusty and sweet.
When looking at them from afar, bedbugs that have not eaten recently may often be confused for young cockroaches. However, that strong, musty smell will easily clear all doubts.
Another major distinguishing feature between bedbugs and other bugs is that they are relatively slow. And when exposed, they will often run towards dark areas to hide.

Unlike adult bed bugs, nymphs usually sport a translucent or white-yellowish color. Their size varies depending on their current
stage in the life cycle
. In the first stage, most bed bug nymphs are usually 1.5 mm in length.
They will then increase in length by 0.5 mm for each subsequent stage until they reach the fourth stage. At the fifth stage, bedbug nymphs measure up to 4.5 mm.
Bed bug eggs
may be the most difficult to see with naked eyes. These eggs are normally pearl-white and have an oval shape with a length of about 1/16 inches. As they continue to grow, you will notice an eyespot emerging from their heads.
But perhaps your main concern is not whether you can spot
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>
, but how to get rid of these eggs as soon as you have the slightest idea of their presence.
Remember that females will lay up to 250 eggs in the course of their lifetime, and once laid, eggs take just about a week to hatch. Now, if you do not take the right measures to control bedbugs, you could be looking at a colossal infestation.

<p>The following are some of the telltale signs that your house could be harboring bedbugs.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-bed-bug-bites-last/">Bed bug bites</a>. They are usually multiple bites spread over your face or other areas of your skin that remain exposed while you are asleep. The bites could also come with some burning or itching sensations.</li>
<li>Spots of dried blood on your mattress or pillow. These spots are normally dark-reddish-brown and are caused when you accidentally crash the bedbugs as you turn during sleep.</li>
<li>You may also want to look for evidence of exo-skeleton. They are usually pale-brown in color.
Remember.
The best way to
deal with bed bugs (kill)
is to ensure they do not get into your house in the first place. When they begin to breed, their number swells like a malignant tumor.
To make that happen, you need to invest in a powerful
bed bug
repellent. You may also consider getting a mattress cover that deters them from finding safe shelters within your mattress.
If living in a house with holes and crevices on the wall, be sure to have them sealed. Above all, check your luggage clearly to ensure you do not bring bedbugs to your house, especially when you are on a long vacation.</li>

<h2 id="what-are-other-signs-of-bed-bugs">What are other signs of bed bugs?</h2>
<p>The truth is
bed bugs are tiny, and they move very fast
, which means spotting them will be hard. Therefore, you need to start looking for other signs that your house is bed bug-infested.
Start by looking for the signs of feces. You will find these around the bed frames and mattresses and in other areas that bed bugs like to use for hiding.
If you see things that look like small, dark, spots, then you shall have found them.�The other
signs that you might have bed bugs
in the house are tiny red spots on your bedsheets.
This can happen when you
killed a bed bug
unknowingly while asleep. Since they will be small spots, you need to get out your spotlight so you can see them.
The other thing is that before they reach the adult stage,
bed bugs molt several times
. Therefore, you need to look for exoskeleton in areas that they use for hiding.
You are likely to find them in your bed sheets and mattress seams. Their exoskeletons are pale yellow in color and to see them clearly, you will need a magnifying glass.
The last sign that you are about to deal with bed bugs is there eggs and eggshells beneath your mattress and bed frame. You might also see them in the crevices of your mattress.
They are very small, so get out your flashlight. Though bed bugs do not create nests, live ones and their eggs are usually found in colonies. Make sure to look in the tight hiding spots if you want to find them.</p>
<h2 id="home-remedies-for-bed-bugs">Home Remedies for Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Though you might think of hiring exterminators, it is a process that might cost a lot of money. There are steps that can be done at
home to rid bed bugs
permanently, and they are outlined below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by removing your beddings and washing them thoroughly. Put them in a clean environment and let them dry for more than thirty minutes. Use a
dryer to kill bed bed bugs
.</li>
<li>Check your room and clear the clutter. Bed bugs look for piles of cloth since they can hide in the easily. Therefore, remove and wash them before you start cleaning the house. You want to ensure that they dont have a safe place to hide in.</li>
<li>After clearing the clutter, use a powerful vacuum attached to a strong hose on areas that
bed bugs use for hiding and laying eggs
. Consider using a
bed bug vacuum or steamer
with a HEPA filter since it will not leave any bed bug,
baby bed bugs
, and their eggs behind.</li>
<li>On your bed frame, use a non-toxic
spray to kill the hiding bed bugs
that could not be reached with the powerful vacuum.</li>
<li>Move your bed a few weeks away from the walls so that you have enough room to clean the house. Also, by moving your bed, you will
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-climb-metal-or-plastic/">remove the cups in which the bed bugs</a>

<p>There is a possibility that your pet might have some bed bugs on their fur. This is true because their body can provide a perfect hiding haven for the bed bugs and other insects.
For safety purposes, you need to ensure that your pet does not have any bed bug on them before you start cleaning.�Check their fur and if you find that they have bed bugs or signs of them, use a non-toxic
spray to kill the bed bugs
.
However, this should be done carefully since some pets might have sensitive skin. Such pets tend to develop allergic reactions when sprayed.
There are special pills that are created for pets that have allergic skin. If your pet falls in that category, give it the pill, and it will form a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">toxic layer so that when bed bugs</a>
try to feed on their blood, they die and fall off.
You can talk to your vet for the best way to administer the pills so that your pet does not get hurt in the process of fighting the best bugs.
<strong>Call an Exterminator</strong>

Simple answer, Yes,
bed bug bomb kills all bed bugs and eggs
that get into contact with the chemical being sprayed. But any beg bug,
baby bed bugs/)
, or
eggs-bug-eggs/)
that are not reached by the chemical wont be killed.
The
Killing power of any bed bug
bomb is determined by the concentration in each can, penetration action, and the area being served. Most bed bug bombs can
reach bed bug hideouts
within your room, especially if there is continuous air circulation. So, lets get into the details.

<h2 id="do-bed-bug-bombs-work-foggers---do-they-work">Do Bed Bug Bombs Work? Foggers - Do They Work?</h2>
<p>Bed bug bomb kills bed bugs by continuously fumigating/spraying the entire room with bed bug killing insecticide - any bed bug or eggs that come into contact with this chemical dies.
The bed bug bombs, also known as foggers, are packed in pressurized can/canister in aerosol form. Most of these
bed bug killers
contain pyrethrins, permethrins, or pyrethroid mixed with other chemicals in a suitable ratio.

<h2 id="how-do-i-safely-use-the-bed-bug-bomb">How do I safely use the bed bug Bomb?</h2>
<p>Simple! You will need to set the bed bug aerosol at a proper point within the bed bugs infested room and activate the canister. Ensure that all the doors and windows are closed for at least 2 to 3 hours during the application time.
Improving air circulation in your room using a fan or air conditioner helps the
bed bug bomb penetrate effectively
into crevices/cracks beneath beds and furniture.
Bed bugs bombs contain flammable
chemicals that can affect
both your humans and pets. However, you must properly identify the bugs - check the
pictures of bed bugs
.
Therefore, the following precautions should be followed during use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read keenly and follow directions given in each aerosol canister during application. You will need to note main things like cautions/warnings,
application procedures, and side effects
.</li>
<li>Cover all food substances in your room and gaming toys for children and pets airtight. Children may put fumigated toys in their mouths. Food absorbs this chemical leading to food poisoning.</li>
<li>Get the accurate area/volume of room you want to
treat with
bed bug bombs. To do this,
<em>measure the length, width, and height</em>
using a foot or tape measure.
Then, multiply the measurements of these sides to get volume. Do the same for other rooms and sum the volumes of each room. Compare the total with the indicated volume in the aerosol canister.</li>
<li>Switch off lights/deactivate sockets from mains and remove anything that can spark. Bed bud bombs are highly flammable due to aerosol propellants used. Ensure that you place your aerosol can/canister at least 7 feet from any spark source within your house/office.</li>
<li>Vacate your humans and pets from the room being treated. When inhaled, beg
bug bombs cause air track discomfort
.
Bed bug bombs can kill
pets such as dogs. Keep off the house for two to three houses.</li>
<li>Use the right number of bed bug bombs in a given area/space. Excess Bed bud bombs are dangerous as it may take long before it leaves your room.
Also, some residuals may be difficult to get rid of. Less quantity of
bed bug bombs will cause inefficient killing
of these bloodsuckers. You will therefore need to stick to application instructions  if you are unable to engage an examiner.</li>
<li>Inform your neighbors about bed bug bomb application  this will minimize any effects that may cause chaos on the eve of application. Recommend them to switch off any spark source during that time.</li>
<li>Keep off people from accessing the room. Ventilate the office/room/s well before entering. Ensure you open doors and windows to let in fresh air for 60 minutes.</li>
<li>Store the unused bed bug bombs in an enclosed place away from children and pets.

<h2 id="why-bed-bug-bombs-wont-kill-all-your-bed-bugs">Why Bed Bug Bombs wont kill all your bed bugs.</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, most bed bug bomb users cannot complete all bed bugs in their place. This is one of the many challenges in
household pest control
.
However, several reasons may lead to the incomplete killing of bed bugs in your room/office/house or warehouse while using a bed bugs bomb. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incomplete Penetration. Bed bug bombs work by
spraying the gaseous insecticide killer
over bed bugs and their egg, thus killing them.
Any
bed bug or eggs
that are not reached is not killed. The insecticide is expected to access the cracks/crevices, mattress seams, and roofs, sealing those points, thus
killing bed bugs
by suffocation.</li>
<li>Incomplete air circulation in your room limits the
bed bug
bobs&rsquo; action from penetrating some bed bugs&rsquo; hideouts such as crevices/cracks, ceiling, inside the mattress, bedding, clothes, or under the carpets.
You will need to turn some of your items like chairs, couches, beds, clothes, picture frames, and drawers to enable killing gas to properly penetrate these sections.</li>
<li>Less quantity application. All bed bug bombs have application descriptions, which also indicated volume capacity, mode, and area that each aerosol canister could serve. Administration of larger space wont kill all bed bugs.</li>
<li>Mutation/chemical resistance. Most bed bug bombs contain pyrethrin or pyrethroid. EPA banned the use of DDT in 1972  this led to the development of synthetic pyrethroids,
which were then used to kill bed bugs
.
According to Economic ecological research, report shows that
most bed bugs
are becoming immune to these chemicals. They undergo mutation, and there these chemicals may not kill them.
By 2010, some
bed bugs species
had gained complete resistance/mutated and could not be killed by these chemicals. In case you find yourself in such a case, ensure your use of an alternative method such as heat treatment.</li>
<li>Using the wrong bed bug bomb. There are varieties of bug bombs in the market. Purchasing the wrong
bug brand wont kill bed
bugs. You will need to be keen on the labels indicating the kind of insects killed by a given fogger.</li>
<li>Less powerful bed bug bomb. The market is currently flooded with
varieties of bed bug
bombs. Check
diatomaceous earth for bed bugs
.
Though they can
kill bed bugs
, these aerosol foggers do not have enough concentration to kill bed bugs. You will need to test various bed bug bombs or get insight through the reviews from other users in the universe.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="which-alternative-bed-bug-killers-will-work">Which alternative bed bug killers will work?</h2>
<p>Bed bug bombs may fail to kill bed bugs in your house/office effectively due to some of the reasons I have highlighted above. Below are some of the alternatives that you can use instead.
1.
<strong>Heat treatment</strong>
. This involves heating the
bedbug-infested
room to a temperature of 125 degrees Fahrenheit.
At this temperature, all
bed bugs and their egg will be dead
. Check the
bed bug steamer
.
This will take a longer time and cost as compared to bed bug bombs. This calls you to
vacuum clean all your bed
bugs-infested�items and house.
The vacuum machine sucks both the adult and their eggs. However, this method may not remove some of the
bed bugs hidden deep in mattresses
and crevices.
2.
<strong>Dry cleaning/using a dryer</strong>
. This requires you to put your bed bug-infested clothes or bedding into a dryer operation at a temperature of 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Here&rsquo;s
how a dryer kills bed bugs
.
This temperature will
kill all the bed bugs
and their eggs. This method may not kill
bed bugs in some items
like couches, mattresses, or beds since these items cant fit in your dryer. The dryer is unsuitable for entire room treatment.
3.
<strong>Using bed bug sprays</strong>
. Spray
bedbug-infested
room or items directly using bed bug spray available in the market.
This method is dangerous as you are directly involved in spraying, and thus you may get affected by these aerosols, which cause nausea, dizziness, breathing discomfort, and stomach upset.
4.
<strong>Dispose of all bed bugs, infested item</strong>
s. This is not easy since you may not be willing to dispose of your newly bought items.
But, it is recommendable to dispose of old bed bugs infested items or burn them. NB: Desist from purchasing any second-hand items  they are one means of transferring bed bugs into your home/office.
5.
<strong>Setting bed bug traps</strong>
. These will
trap bed bugs
that crawl into them. They are not very efficient as they
may not trap bed bugs
that do not come from other hideouts and their eggs.</p>
<h2 id="ways-that-will-make-bed-bug-bombs-kill-bed-bugs-efficiently-">**Ways That Will Make Bed Bug Bombs Kill Bed Bugs Efficiently **</h2>
<p>Though bed bug bomb may not completely kill bed bugs in your bed bugs infested office, home, or warehouse, you can improve its action/performance by doing some of the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring your room/house/office doors and windows are airtight closed during the 2 to 3 hour application time will concentrate the killing gas within all possible
bed bugs hideouts
in the room.</li>
<li>Turning all bed bugs-infested items in your room. Ensure you
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-bed-bugs-spread/">spread bed bugs</a>
infested clothes, bedding, chairs, couches, or footwear and turn the beds and wall units in your room to offer ample penetration of bed bug bombs into those places without obstructions.</li>
<li>Using several small quantity bed bug bombs. Place several bed bugs aerosol canisters at various points in your room. This helps in quick access and penetration of active insecticide simultaneously in the room.
It also prevents
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs from hiding</a>
in one part of the room when they sense danger.
*NB: The total of all these canisters should not be more than the room&rsquo;s volume being served. *</li>
<li>Boosting air circulation. Insufficient air circulation within the bed bugs infested room cause incomplete penetration of the bed bug killing gas to such place as beneath the bed, shelves/drawers, under the table, couches or carpets.
You can boost room air circulation using a fan or air conditioner.
<em>Remember to power these devices from outside to prevent any spark.�</em>

<h2 id="can-bed-bug-bomb-cause-sickness-to-humans--pets"><strong>Can Bed Bug Bomb Cause Sickness to Humans &amp; Pets?</strong></h2>
<p>Chemicals such as pyrethrins or pyrethroids that make bed bug bombs can kill both your humans and pet when taken to a given concentration.
The 2025 research bed bug report on Improper use of Bed bug Bomb done in America shows that most people who get exposed to bed bug bomb had weak immune and were highly susceptible to diseases compared to others who were not.
Bed bug bombed rooms are unsuitable for your humans or pets as the gas may choke or respiratory when inhaled. Chemicals such as pyrethrins or pyrethroids found in bed bug bombs cause toxicity in cats and dogs.
You will see your pet&rsquo;s tremor, vomit, drooling, seizure, or lethargy when under
effects from exposure to a bed bug
bomb. Some
pets such as dogs and cats
have been reported dead in rooms that have been fumigated using bed bug bombs.
NB: If your humans or pets are exposed to bed bug bombs, move the person/pet to a place with fresh air. Once they regain strength, rush them to the hospital/health center/dispensary for medication.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-side-effects-of-using-bed-bug-bombs"><strong>What Are Side Effects of Using Bed Bug Bombs?</strong></h2>
<p>When you are exposed to bed bug bomb in a substantial quantity, you may experience some of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headache, dizziness, and wheezing.</li>
<li>Burning and stinging sensation in the eyes.</li>
<li>Muscle cramp and stomach upset.</li>
<li>Difficulties in breathing and irritation of the upper airway.</li>
<li>Gastrointestinal problems, coughing, or nausea.</li>
<li>It can even trigger Asthma and allergic reaction, especially in children.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-bed-bug-bomb"><strong>How Much Does It Cost to Buy a Bed Bug Bomb?</strong></h2>
<p>The cost of a package of bed bug bombs varies according to quantity, number of canisters in a single kit, or the manufacturers costing system.
However, you will require between 10 to 50 US dollars to purchase a package.� This may vary according to economic shift too.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bug bombs do work by killing all eggs, nymphs, and adult bed bugs that come into contact with it. However, bed bugs that are in unreachable hideouts will not be killed.
This method is affected by incomplete air circulation within the room being treated. Proper administration of bed bug bombs is important to avoid side effects associated with it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first left my parent&rsquo;s house and got my apartment, it was a frustrating hustle to get rid of bed bugs. Just like myself, most homeowners fear and get a chill with the mention of a bed bug infestation. In todays post, I&rsquo;ll be answering this question
<strong>can bed bugs fly?</strong>
<strong>Lets face it:</strong>
Controlling
<a href="https://www.cornellcollege.edu/student-health/bed-bug-info.shtml">bed bugs</a>
can be a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming task given that they&rsquo;ve�become
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35421742">more resistant to insecticides</a>
such as neonicotinoids. But imagine what it would be like if
bed bugs could also fly-hide/)
? Well, this would be a notable horror. So, let&rsquo;s dive right in for more details.
<strong>In short, NO - Bed bugs do not�jump or fly</strong>
but have dysfunctional wing pads. They mainly use crawling to move around looking for a blood meal, a
hiding place
, or a new host.
So, if you&rsquo;ve seen an insect that closely resembles a bud bug flying around the house, most probably we&rsquo;re talking about carpet beetles or stink bugs (bet luckily these don&rsquo;t bite).
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Before we move on with bed bugs and their movement, I recommend that you also view this
guide on stink bugs vs. bed bugs
.</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-fly-bedbug-movement">Do Bed Bugs Fly? Bedbug Movement</h2>
<p>You ever wondered
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-bed-bugs-spread/">how bed bugs spread</a>
? Maybe you previously thought that bed bugs jump/ or fly from one room or house to another.
<strong>Well</strong>
, you were wrong because bed bugs only move through crawling. But do they have wings, or it&rsquo;s equivalent maybe?
Well, bed bugs are wingless insects. However, on the flip side, these bugs winglets make it look like they have wings, but the wings do not develop fully.
So, the flat body (oval too) and underdeveloped wings are the bugs&rsquo; key features. To put it into perspective, bed bugs are something just some inches larger than your largest fleas.
<strong>To avoid confusion</strong>
,� bed bugs are about apple-seed-sized insects living off blood from human beings and animals. Before sucking blood, the bugs will be flat in
shape but swells into a reddish colored
bug after the blood meal. However, since bed bugs only feed on blood, seeing them on your premises does not signify that you have a dirty living.
<strong>What about baby bed bugs?�</strong>
Just like the adult bed bugs, their
nymphs (the Immature bedbugs)
are also wingless but will also shed some skin (molting) 5 times before attaining the adult stage.
So, since they cannot jump around quickly to hide from human beings and other enemies, these bugs will hide in tiny spaces, particularly in a cluster.
For example, you can find the bed bugs and their eggs in headboards, bed frames, box springs, and mattresses. But don&rsquo;t worry, I created an article on
<em>�</em>
how to get rid of stink bugs.</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-climb-walls"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Climb Walls?�</strong></h2>
<p>As noted above, bed bugs and their nymphs will move only through crawling. Their crawling sprees will most likely lead the bugs to climb on different favorable walls and finally getting onto beds, cupboards, and cabinets.
Besides, bed bugs can crawl through drain pipes to get from one house to another. Therefore, its always a good idea to unblocked clogged drains, possibly using one of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaners</a>
.
However, the bugs tend to have reduced crawling ability when it comes to smoother surfaces such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-climb-metal-or-plastic/">metal or plastic pipes</a>
, porcelain, or glass.
For example, bed bugs will have a difficult time climbing up the porcelain walls of your bathtub. However, they can climb up on another nearby (and rough) wall and finally fall off to your bathtub.
But dont be too happy; the bugs can still use electrical runs and pipe chases. Control the bed bugs
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">through spraying</a>
or
bed bug steamers
.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Its clear now that, despite having some wing pads, bed bugs will not jump or fly like your regular insects such as flies and fleas.
The legs of these bugs do not have enough energy to propel it into a distance through jumping. Therefore, the sole method of movement for the bed bugs is through crawling.</p>

<p><em>Bed bugs have un-developed wings</em>
that can&rsquo;t be used for flight. These wings (wings pads), even for mature bed bugs, aren&rsquo;t suitable for flying.
Bed bug&rsquo;s
wings pads are tiny, plus
they&rsquo;re located slightly above their abdomen. However,
baby bed bugs
won&rsquo;t have wing pads or wings.
Bed</p>

<h2 id="how-to-identifybed-bugs">How to Identify�Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>From the onset,
<a href="https://wagner.edu/campus-services/operations/bed-bug-policy/">bed bugs</a>
are brownish, tiny ( 1/4 inches) and oval-shaped insects feeding on a cat or dog blood - but also humans&rsquo; blood. But the adult bed bugs are about the apple seed but a flat body.
Following a full blood meal, the adult bed bugs will become reddish in their color and a swollen body. The bugs will be moving quickly around the ceilings, walls, and floors.
<a href="https://youtu.be/hW4RTY7k2lw">https://youtu.be/hW4RTY7k2lw</a>
Further, you&rsquo;ll notice
females as they&rsquo;ll lay eggs</p>
<ul>
<li>look anything like dust specks. The eggs are off-white in color, have sticky skin &amp; exist in clusters -
can be confused with dandruff.
However, the baby or immature bed bugs (1 millimeter) will take a blood meal each time to progress past each of their 4
life stages</li>
<li>as they also shed skin when molting.
Notably, with high humidity, bed bugs will develop to full adults within a month and get 3+ generations every year. However, bed bugs don&rsquo;t carry diseases but will cause anemia.
Bed bugs
have long antennae plus
their characteristic six insect legs. These blood-suckers will look swollen after taking a blood meal. So any small bugs that&rsquo;ll be jumping around could be
fleas
.
Bed bugs will be hiding
in dark areas like crevices and cracks.

<p>Bad bugs are brown-colored insects that are highly comparable to bed bugs - but also have no wings. Also, bat bugs have heads that are covered with long hairs.
Nasty bugs are oval-shaped and  inches in size, looking like the apple seed. Equally, bat bugs only have wing pads, and hence their &ldquo;wings&rdquo; are not functional.

Further, bat
bugs don&rsquo;t bite
humans, but they do bite on bats. You&rsquo;ll mainly get these

However,
carpenter bees don&rsquo;t bit

<h3 id="4-booklice">4. Booklice</h3>
<p>Booklice are creamy and brown-colored bugs that look like bed bugs or termites (
top termite killers
), plus they have a soft body. They measure about 1 to 6 millimeters in body size or about 1/32 inches.
Booklice have a body and head being separated on their segment body parts. Some Booklice have wings that look like roofs, but dead Booklice can cause asthma.
Booklice will mainly be
hiding around damp places
or high humidity since these bugs tend to be dehydrated easily. Further,
spider beetles are black or reddish-brown with long antennae
plus thin legs.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-fly-into-your-house">Can Bed Bugs Fly into your House?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs
will move into any house, including those that are super clean. Even though bugs enter the house via windows and doors, they will fly since they have no wings.
You&rsquo;ll mainly find bed bugs in areas like schools, households, motels &amp; hotels, homeless shelters, and dorm rooms. They&rsquo;ll hide inside fabrics and move around the house.
You may find bed bugs inside public transportation, rental cars, and taxis - in the indoor spaces, you&rsquo;ll find the bugs moving between rooms or attaching to carpets or household objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, bed bugs can&rsquo;t fly - they have no wings. You&rsquo;ll mainly find them on beds, mattresses, and mattress seams but will also be on headboard, bed frame, cracks, and box spring.</li>
<li>Old or second-hand furniture can also hold bed bugs - particularly on the seams of couches and chairs, curtain folds, and on cushions.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will<a href="http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef636.asp">feed when they&rsquo;re hungry</a>as opposed to just eating only at night. Therefore, the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-your-skin/">bugs will also bite your skin</a>during the day when you get near them.</li>
<li>As compared to fleas and other similar insects, bed bugs can&rsquo;t jump around the house, andspray won&rsquo;t be enough to kill all the bed bugstages, including eggs, nymphs, and adults.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">Can you squish a bed bug</a>
? Well, YES, it&rsquo;ll burst, leaving red bloodstains. Bed bugs will move over distances by hitchhiking on human beings, clothing, or send-hand furniture - particularly around mattress or couch seams.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do bed bugs have wings?�No - bed bugs have no wings - but you can identify them with their oval, flat any tiny body measuring about 1/4 inches but have wing pads as opposed to having fully-functional wings.
Adult bed bugs can be seen with your naked eyes, but babies and nymphs will mainly exist in clusters - you&rsquo;ll find both on crevices and cracks.
Bed bugs measure roughly the size of an apple seed or a pinhead. However,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>
are off-white in color and only exist in clusters.</p>

<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322975297_Non-chemical_methods_of_bed_bug_control_a_case_study">bed bugs</a>
can jump! Well, bed bugs are crafty creatures and youll find them anywhere in the house.</p>
<p>Youll find them on your bed, inside furniture, on walls and even on the celling. But do they jump from one place to another.
<strong>A short answer is  No. Bed bugs cant jump. Their legs are meant for crawling rather than jumping. Their lack of wings also prevents them for flying around. However, they can crawl at relatively high speeds (about 1m per minute).�</strong>

<p>Therere several household pests that look like bed bugs. So, when you see small creatures jumping from one place to another you might be tempted to think you have bed bugs.</p>
<p>Well, the first pests you should rule out are bed bugs. Unlike fleas, bed bugs cannot jump around. Their short limbs and flat bodies are designed for crawling  Not jumping. Thus, you dont expect them to jump into your clothes or items.</p>
<p>However bed bugs can crawl into items you bring home such as old furniture, bedding and luggage among other items. These items only act as a means of transportation. Or they can crawl from an adjacent house if you live in an apartment or college hostel.</p>
<p>When bed bugs fall or crawl into items, they might end up covering long distances and infest new areas. In fact they can hitch hike a ride from one country to another! Social areas such as theaters, trains, public buses and hostels are some of the areas youre likely to pick bed bugs.</p>
<p>If bed bugs crawl into your luggage or clothes, you might end up carrying them or their eggs to your house.</p>

<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-climb-on-surfaces"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Climb On Surfaces?</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps their most outstanding means of mobility is crawling and climbing on things like walls, furniture, fabrics, plastic and metal. The hooks on their feet help them in gripping on almost any surface.</p>
<p>However they wont climb on all surfaces. Polished surfaces such as glass and porcelain tend to be too smooth for bed bugs to climb. Also rugged surfaces such as those covered with fur and hair prove difficult for bed bugs to navigate.</p>
<p>Their small hooks get stuck on these materials.�Thats why you wont find bed bugs on your hairy pets or animals.</p>

<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-have-wings"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Have Wings?</strong></h2>
<p>Theres a popular believe that bed bugs have wings. Some online content will tell you so but thats not actually true. If they had wings, they could already be using them to fly. But as we see them, no bed <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">bug</a> cant fly.</p>
<p>They have wing pads which only suggest that <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs could have evolved to lose their wings. These wing pads are very tiny and cannot be used for flying. Bed bug nymphs have no wing pads and cannot also fly.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you have come across a flying bed bug, that could be a mistaken identity. The fact that bed bugs dont fly is perhaps a good reprieve for homeowners. You can imagine the problem bed bugs could cause if they had the ability to fly.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-bed-bugs-travel-from-room-to-room"><strong>How Do Bed Bugs Travel From Room to Room?</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bugs lack wings and so they wont jump. So, the only way that bed bugs will travel from one room to another is by crawling or catching a ride on people or objects. Knowing how bed bugs travel and spread can be helpful to homeowners in their efforts to eradicate them.</p>
<p>When bed bugs come into your house, theyll stick around as long as they have their favourite meal-your blood. They stay close to the host. Thus you will find them in your bed, mattress and sofa set.</p>
<p>However, bed bugs are not limited to bedroom and living room only. They can harbour any room that is frequented by humans. They get into these rooms by crawling on surfaces and hooking on your body or objects. When items are moved from room to room, therere high chances of spreading these creatures.</p>
<p>Bed bugs can also move from one house to another. When you go on a vacation, bed bugs in a house get starved and start looking for a new host. They have an acute sense of carbon dioxide that humans breathe out. Thus, it wont be long before they discover a new territory in your neighbours house.</p>
<p>Bed bugs may also crawl into other houses as they run away from repellents or chemicals used to eradicate them.</p>

<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-jump-from-one-person-to-another"><strong>Can Bed Bugs Jump From One Person To Another?</strong></h2>
<p>You might wonder how bed bugs ended up in your house. Well, bed bugs are clever pests- they know how to find new hosts. These tiny creatures are so hard to spot when they hook on our clothes. Thats how they end up being transported from one place to another. But, unlike fleas, bed bugs wont stick on your body for long.</p>
<p>The only way bed bugs will move from one person to another is by crawling. They dont jump like fleas do. Fleas have long and powerful hide limbs which help them in jumping around. In fact, they can jump up to 100 times the size of their body length.</p>
<p>On the contrary, bed bugs have flat bodies and small legs which make it difficult for them to jump. So, if you find bed bugs on your clothes or luggage, the only way they could have got there is by crawling.</p>
<p>Perhaps its good news to know that bed bugs cant jump from one person to another. Otherwise, this could provide them with an easy way to hitch a ride into new homes. At least they cant crawl into your clothes fast enough like fleas can jump.</p>

<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-jump-from-the-floor-to-your-bed"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Jump From The Floor To Your Bed?</strong></h2>
<p>As you have seen, bed bugs wont fly or jump around. So, if you find bed bugs in your bed, they should have crawled to get there. If your bed is adjacent to the walls, bed bugs will crawl from other places to your bed at night in search of a blood meal.</p>
<p>They can also access you bed through the legs of the bed, bedding that hang on the floor or furniture that is adjacent to your bed.</p>
<p>You can however prevent bed bugs from crawling into your bed by ensuring that its not adjacent to the wall. Also ensure that items such as lampstands and furniture are not connected to your bed. Do not allow bedding or clothes to hang on the floor from your bed.</p>
<p>One more thing! Block bed bugs from climbing up the legs of your bed by installing climb-up cups. These are cups with polished surfaces which bed bugs cant climb. When placed on each of the legs, bed bugs wont be able to crawl in to your bed.</p>
<p>In addition, bed bugs that are coming from the bed to the floor also get trapped in the inner wall of the climb-up cup.</p>

<p>Bed bugs will go all the way to your ceiling. However they wont intentionally drop themselves from the ceiling. But therere is a possibility of losing grip and falling on your floor, bed or other items.</p>
<p>When youre treating your house for bed bugs, chances are that bed bugs will run way from the chemicals being used. The safest place for them happens to be the ceiling. If you treat your bed, floor, baseboard and other furniture, bed bugs that survive will retreat to safe areas like the ceiling.</p>
<p>Bed bugs are also attracted to the heat emitted by human bodies. But they wait until night we you fall asleep to feed on your blood. So, during the day they can seek warmth elsewhere and that happens to be the ceiling.</p>
<p>Whichever the case, bed bugs will always find their way to the ceiling. However theres no single reason to think that they will intentionally dislodge from the roof to the floor or your bed.</p>
<h2 id="what-time-do-bed-bugs-travel"><strong>What Time Do Bed Bugs Travel?</strong></h2>
<p>Its commonly believed that bed bugs will come out during the night when you fall asleep. Well, they prefer to feed when the host is still. However, bed bugs will come out to feed whenever they are hungry.</p>
<p>Normally bed bugs feed at least once a week. And they require a blood meal in each of their successive life stages. Thus, when they are hungry, theyll travel from their hideouts to where they can get a blood meal.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Whether youre on a hiking trip or at the beach, a <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">bug</a> spray can be a lifesaver. But does bug spray expire? Well, the efficacy decreases over time. Since most products dont have an expiry date, you should use them within 18 to 36 months.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-happens-with-expired-bug-spray">What happens with expired bug spray?</h2>
<p>When the spray passes the expiry date, it may not be useful as a self-defense weapon. Depending on the brand, you may not spray when the aerosol start leaking out.</p>
<p>Theres also a chance that expired spray will do more harm than good. And based on the products ingredients, you could experience skin irritation or rashes. To be on the safe side, you should use a product that has stood the test of time like DEET.</p>
<p>DEET-based bug sprays dont expire. In fact, for more than three decades theres no scientific evidence that shows that this product is unsafe for human. This explains why more than 30% of US citizens use products with DEET as an active ingredient for skin protection.</p>
<h3 id="deet-alternative">DEET alternative</h3>
<p>Another remarkable skin product is Picaridin. It contains synthetic ingredients and has been in the market since the early 1980s. Picaridin is odorless and does not expire. According to the manufacturer, this product is good for children and adults alike. But to be on the safe side, you may want to avoid using Picaridin-based bug sprays on children under 3 years. Keep in mind that the FDA does not require companies that use DEET ingredients to state the expiry date.</p>
<h2 id="is-ir3535-based-bug-spray-safe-after-the-expiry-date">Is IR3535-based bug spray safe after the expiry date?</h2>
<p>This bug spray targets body lice, mosquito, biting flies, and deer ticks. After several toxicity tests, the product has proved to be safe even when ingested. Just like most insect repellents, the IR3535 has a shelf life of 18-36 months. When it reaches the expiry date, it may irritate the eyes or damage your clothes.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-tell-if-you-bug-spray-is-expired">How to tell if you bug spray is expired</h2>
<h3 id="1-read-the-expiry-date">1. Read the expiry date</h3>
<p>As far as expiry information is concerned, you should read the label to get accurate information. If the date is not printed somewhere on the box, you should expect the bug spray to last for three years. Many brands include a customer service number so you should feel free to contact the manufacturer.</p>
<p>You can also type the keyword online to find information about the product. Once you get the right information, write the date with a permanent marker.</p>
<h3 id="2-inspect-the-odor-of-the-spray">2. Inspect the odor of the spray</h3>
<p>Just spray the product on a piece of paper and smell it. If the smell is strong, then it will be effective in eliminating unwanted bugs. However, if the smell is rancid or sour you may want to get a new one. As you perform the test, hold the can away from the face.</p>
<h3 id="3-test-the-texture">3. Test the texture</h3>
<p>If the spray smells normal, rub a small amount on your hands. Does it feel thin or watery? This shows that it has expired and should be disposed of immediately.</p>
<p>A bug spray with altered texture may cause skin irritation. Make sure you perform this test every three months to ensure the bug spray is in good working condition.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-make-your-bug-spray-last-longer">How can you make your bug spray last longer?</h2>
<p>To keep the spray at peak performance, you should follow the storage guidelines. Most manufacturers recommend that you keep your products in a cool dry place. When you store in extreme temperatures or very cold areas, the chemical components may change.</p>
<p>At temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius, the spray may leak due to over pressurization. Avoid placing the bug spray on windows ledges where its exposed to large amounts of heat. To maintain the efficacy of the product, you should store it in cabinets and closets. Of course, the spray should be stored away from children.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-dispose-of-expired-bug-sprays">How to dispose of expired bug sprays</h2>
<p>If the repellent is in a non-refillable container, spray against concrete until its empty. After that, place the container in the regular trash. You can also recycle the empty bottle.</p>
<p>The other disposal method is to place the container in a plastic garbage bag and lock it tightly. If youre not sure of the best disposal method, contact the local waste disposal agency.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Most bug sprays are effective for up to three years. If you use DEET-based repellents, the container will remain usable for you up to 36 months.</p>
<p>How long the product lasts will depend on how often you use it. For the other brands, most manufacturers recommend that you dispose of the product after three years. But regardless of the expiry date, you should avoid using bug spray if it causes skin irritation or rashes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How big are bed bugs? Bed bug bites are painful and
cause excessive irritating
, but most of us don&rsquo;t know the bug&rsquo;s appearance, shape, size, and color.
So, how

are;
*In summary, adult bed bugs (last in the life cycle) measure  inch in length - roughly the size of an apple seed in length - and can be seen with a naked eye with no magnification. *
*Also, bed bugs are oval-shaped (but long and flat), plus they&rsquo;re brown. *
But bed bugs are cryptic and nocturnal - they&rsquo;ll highly avoid detection. They may quickly reproduce (including nymph adults and eggs) and spread all over the house.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bug Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="how-big-are-bed-bugs-identification--removal">How Big are Bed Bugs? Identification &amp; Removal</h2>
<p>The bugs will bite pets and
humans
when they&rsquo;re resting or asleep - which implies that they&rsquo;ll be difficult to notice - but
what causes bed bugs
.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bug-identification">1. Bed Bug Identification</h3>
<p>As noted above, bed bugs are reddish-brown, oval-shaped insects (with thorax and abdomen) with antennae and six legs. But
bed bugs can&rsquo;t jump
, and
they have no wings
.
Despite having a lat body, bed bugs will become rounded, and long when they take a blood meal - they&rsquo;ll be blood-engorged and thus may be
mistaken for stink bugs
.

<h3 id="2-how-big-are-bed-bug-nymphs">2. How Big are Bed Bug Nymphs?</h3>
<p>Bed bug nymphs measure
about 2.5 mm (0.09 in) while mature bed bugs measure 4.5 mm (0.18 in) - their length is about that of an apple seed. But nymphs measure about 1 mm (size of poppy seeds).
In loose terms, the nymph will be translucent in color and measure like a pinhead. But the nymph will change color after the suck blood from pets or humans. The Nymphs will molt within six weeks to become adult bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="3-signs-of-bed-bug-infestation">3. Signs of Bed Bug Infestation</h3>
<p>So, what do bed bugs look like to the human eye? Well, you can see
bed bugs with a human eye, but their bite
marks are even more prevalent.
On the human skin,
bed bug bites
are itchy and sore, but you must consult a medical practitioner for analysis and further treatment if confirmed.
Therefore, examine these
<em>bed bug pictures,</em>
and it&rsquo;ll help you determine if you have a bed bug infestation in your house or home - know how big the bugs can get.
As noted earlier, the baby bed bugs are dark-brown colored, but their color will change as they suck blood and grow through the life cycles.
Therefore, to control these bugs, wash and dry your mattress, bed covers, pillowcases, duvet covers, and other similar bedding.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-see-bed-bugs">Can You See Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are visible to the naked human eye - but most humans prefer not to come across these bugs. The adults will measure about the size of a thumbtack&rsquo;s head.
But the bed bug&rsquo;s actual size may vary with different conditions. For example, considering their life cycle, baby bed bugs are tiny and grows in size as the nymph stages develop.
Despite that you can see bed bugs with naked eyes, it would be impossible to see the bugs without using a microscope or some form of the magnifying glass.
You may definitely mistake it for other insects such as swallow bugs, bat bugs or
confuse bed bugs for mites
. Therefore, it&rsquo;s not recommended to use a
DIY bed bug control
.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esYzPzyXT4E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esYzPzyXT4E</a>
What&rsquo;s the
signs of bed bug
infestation. Well, it is possible to mistake bed bugs with other similar bugs, and thus here are the signs to check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blood-stained pajamas and sheets</li>
<li>Bites and irritating welts that are in rows or zigzag patterns or clusters</li>
<li>Bed bug shells, exoskeletons, or skins</li>
<li>Bed bug poop or feceson bedding and mattress</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="will-size-of-the-bed-bugs-change">Will Size of the Bed Bug&rsquo;s Change?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs will appear like seeds, but they may look anything like oval and brown colored body with some legs. The body size and color will change when they take a good blood meal - brownish to red in color.
The length of your regular bed bugs is about 1/4 - 3/16 inches - this will change as the bug progresses with the life cycle stages. The bugs&rsquo; oval-flat body will become longer and more rounded as the bed bug sucks blood from pets and humans.
After taking a blood meal, and before the female&rsquo;s mate and lay eggs, the bugs will have a cylindrical and long body shape. Being mainly blood-feeders, the bugs will also eat
bed bug poop</p>
<ul>
<li>and survive for several months.
The bloated body is derived from the blood meal, and they&rsquo;ll slowly consume their food reserves (a food conservation tactic) since they might not get another blood meal over some months.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-big-are-bed-bug-eggs">How Big Are Bed Bug Eggs?</h2>
<p>Once the small bed bugs feed on a pet or human blood, they&rsquo;ll get plumb about double their original size. Further,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-eggs/">Bed bug eggs</a>
are even smaller - and off-white in color.
Female
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/">bed bugs will lay</a>
roughly 500 - 600 eggs for their whole life-time. The eggs are white and equally tiny, looking like a salt grain or pinhead on physical appearance.
But the eggs will also be wet - covered by some sticky substance making them get stuck on different objects. However, within a week, the eggs will have a &ldquo;dark eye&rdquo; on their surface.
Bed bug eggs have a tough surface that&rsquo;ll withstand and survive most insecticides - the reason why you must use
steamers (with temperatures over 120 degrees)
-, and thus, over 90% of the eggs will hatch successfully.
Notably,
home solutions for bed bugs
such as�borax, diatomaceous earth, vinegar, baking soda, or rubbing alcohol won&rsquo;t kill the bed bug eggs or even break through their shell.
So, where will you mainly find the bed bug eggs? The eggs will mainly be hidden on some protected sites (like cracks), but equally, this must be close to some food source.
Therefore, please search for the eggs around the bed joints, headboard or mattress seams plus on box spring, or even attach themselves on the wall and wall cracks.
On smell, you&rsquo;ll look for sweetish plus pungent odor coming from areas that bed bugs and their eggs hide - the scent comes from the bug&rsquo;s scent glands.
<strong>Hatching?</strong>
Bed bug eggs tend to hatch within two weeks, given the right or optimal humidity and temperatures (room temperature). Further, for cold temperatures, the eggs will hatch over a longer time.</p>
<h2 id="how-big-are-bed-bug-nymphs">How Big are Bed Bug Nymphs?</h2>
<p>Nymphs may be described as
baby bed bugs
that have not developed fully to become adults. They&rsquo;re visible to humans&rsquo; eyes but won&rsquo;t be brown in color like adults.
After the bed bug nymphs come out, they&rsquo;ll start searching for blood from a suitable pet or human being to allow them to desiccate within a short time.
Blood helps the
bed bug nymphs to gain moisture
but will need to equally hide in some cracks or crevices behind living in the right room temperature. Nymphs will live even up to 4 months without a blood meal.
Nymphs may also look translucent, and thus they may easily camouflage with the environment. Further, Nymphs will grow after taking their full blood meal.</p>
<ol>
<li>1stnymph stage  1.5 millimeters</li>
<li>2ndnymph stage  2 millimeters</li>
<li>3?? nymph stage -2.5 millimeters</li>
<li>4thnymph stage  3 millimeters</li>
<li>5thnymph stage  4.5 millimeters

</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are tiny bugs, but you may see them only clear when there&rsquo;s a huge infestation. To effectively control bed bugs, you must know their average size, color, and shape- try
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">bed bug sprays for control</a>

So, for the question of how big are bed bugs?: Bed bugs are tiny bugs measuring about  inch in length - about apple seed&rsquo;s length - they&rsquo;re visible to the human eye.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-they-spread-so-fast">Why do they spread so fast?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are incredibly prolific insects. During its 6 to 12 month lifespan, a female bedbug can produce 500 eggs, and its offspring can reproduce within a month.
Pest management professionals can save money in the early
stages of infection and prevent bed bugs
from spreading quickly in your home.
Bed bugs also spread through the mattress (you can use
mattress encasements to control bed bugs
). Refurbished old mattresses often spread
bugs to shops and homes
, causing infection. Also,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-mites/">bed bugs can spread</a>
when old and new mattresses are shipped together.</p>
<h2 id="prevent-bed-bugs-from-spreading-in-your-bed-and-house">Prevent bed bugs from spreading in your bed and house</h2>
<p>Prevention is better than cure. Taking precautions against
bed bugs is much smaller than getting rid
of them after pests. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seal and repair any cracks outside the home to prevent any insects from entering. While at this, ensure you use effective
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">sprays against bed bugs</a>
.</li>
<li>Use a mattress cover - a

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-bedbugs-from-spreading-as-you-travel">How to prevent bedbugs from spreading as you travel</h2>
<p>You could do some things to
protect yourself from bed bugs
while traveling: Educate yourself about bed bugs, so you know what to watch out for.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you pack, pack clothes that can be easily washed in water: Pack disposable gloves, a small flashlight, and a series of garbage bags. You may also want to spray your luggage both inside and on the outside.</li>
<li>Install insect
bed and spring mattress on all beds in the home
before you leave.</li>
<li>When you arrive in your hotel room, inspect the room for any evidence of pests. Put your luggage and items in the bathtub; these insects are least likely to be hidden here.</li>
<li>During your stay, place your luggage on a luggage rack at least 4 inches from the wall or on hard furniture such as a desk. If you must put your luggage on the floor, put it in a re-sealable plastic bag. Never place a suitcase or clothing on a bed or upholstered furniture.</li>
<li>When you check out, inspect each item and the surface of the suitcase when packing. Seal the suitcase in large plastic bags before placing them in your car.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you take all precautions and find evidence of these
pests, contact a licensed pest control
company with pest control expertise.
Being aware of these guidelines about bedbugs will help you prevent the discomfort caused by these insects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Could be, you have spotted a beetle, a moth, a grain weevil. All these and others are the common pantry bugs we expect to find in kitchens, stores, and warehouses.
After noting several pantry bugs in my kitchen, this prompted me to know more about these bugs and how long they live.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live---pantry-bugs-life-cycle">How long do pantry bugs live? - Pantry Bugs Life Cycle</h2>
<p>The life span of pantry bugs totally depends on their species. If you want to know how long a pantry <a href="/posts/bed-bugs-vs-other-pests/">bug</a> live, you first need to know its species.</p>
<p>The most common pantry bugs in our kitchen and stores are moths. But which moths are they exactly? I have analyzed some of these common bugs and for easy identification and listed their life cycles.</p>
<h3 id="1-warehouse-beetle">**1. **<strong>Warehouse Beetle</strong></h3>
<p>This warehouse beetle is a very common pantry bug in your food store and kitchen. In most cases, you will find it in cereals, flour, cookies, nuts, cornmeal, dried peas, and beans among others.</p>
<p>This beetle is oval in shape and has a reddish-brown color with a yellow pattern on its wings.
**Life cycle **
The warehouse beetle has a life span of approximately 3-6 months. But its life cycle from egg to adult can take approximately 30-45 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its life cycle begins when a female beetle lays her eggs on the infested food. The female beetle can lay about 90 eggs in its lifespan. These fertilized eggs hatch into larvae after about 6 days.</li>
<li>The larvae stage is the most active stage and also very destructive. When they grow, the larvae develop hair and the abdomen also elongates. They also develop setae which they later shed and leave on the food.</li>
<li>Consuming this seta is very irritating and unhealthy too. If your food is infested by setae, it is advisable to dispose of it.
The larvae later turn into a pupa which takes about 6 days to turn into an adult. After this metamorphosis, the adult mates and can easily be spotted on light bulbs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-indianmeal-moths-">**2. ****Indianmeal Moths **</h3>
<p>This is the most common pantry bug in the kitchen. They are commonly found in North America, Europe among other areas. Their common scientific name is
<em>Plodia Interpuctella</em>
You are likely to spot them in your homestead in foods like cereals, rice, dried vegetables and fruits, flour, nuts, candies, and chocolates among others.
**Life cycle **
This moth has 4 growth stages-egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. The full life cycle takes between 30-300 days from egg to an adult moth.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female Indian meal moth can lay an average of 60-400 eggs in its life span. A female moth lays all the eggs within a span of 18 days. These eggs are laid on the food surface and take about 4-10 days for them to hatch into larvae.</li>
<li>This larvae stage is the most destructive and takes about 2-3 months. It consumes the food while excreting the waste (frass) and webbing which contaminates the whole package making it inconsumable.</li>
<li>The number of days on this stage is also dependent on so many other factors like food and temperatures and some larvae can live up to 210 days.
The larvae then transform into a pupa which is dormant and the non-feeding stage. The larvae make cocoons and live there.</li>
<li>Within 15-10 days, the pupae transform into an adult pantry moth. The adults break from the cocoon and can be easily spotted as they fly over the lights and walls.</li>
<li>The adult stage takes between 5-25 days and its major purpose is mating. Surprisingly, the adult moths do not have mouths and are not able to feed.
In general, the Idianmeal moth has a life span of 27-300 days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-red-and-confused-flour-beetle-">**3. ****Red and Confused Flour Beetle **</h3>
<p>These are two species of small beetle that are very similar and are reddish-brown in color. The red flour beetle and the confused flour beetle.</p>
<ul>
<li>To differentiate them the red flour beetle has the last 4 segments enlarged while the confused flour beetle has the last 3 segments enlarged towards the tail.
These are a common pantry bug in the United States and mostly attack grains, nuts, and milled cereals.
**Life cycle **
The red and the confused flour beetles have an average life span of 1-2 years. Their life cycle begins when a female lays eggs with sticky secretion on the grains and cereals. Its life cycle has 3 cycles-egg, larvae, and adult.</li>
<li>The females lay about 200-500 eggs in their life span. These eggs are small, clear, and white and hatch in a span of 5-12 days.</li>
<li>The larvae take about 30-120 days to mature but this depends on the temperature and food. These larvae feed grain kernels and slowly turn into white pupae. As the pupae grow it slowly turns yellow.</li>
<li>As it turns into an adult beetle, the pupae change color into reddish-brown.
This life cycle from eggs to adults takes about 6 weeks. However, the life cycle of the red flour beetle is shorter than that of the confused flour beetle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adult stage feeds and mates and the cycle continues.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-control-pantry-bugs">How to Control Pantry Bugs</h2>
<p>Most pantry bugs have a very fast multiplication rate-they lay eggs in hundreds and have a very short to average life span. Moreover, some bugs can survive for many days without feeding making it a challenge to control them.</p>
<h3 id="1-use-of-pheromone-traps-">**1. Use of Pheromone Traps. **</h3>
<p>The pheromone stick traps are some of the best ways to control pantry bugs. They are useful if there is already an infestation in your kitchen and food store.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have already spotted moths and beetles in your stores, it&rsquo;s a clear indication that there is a high infestation that needs to be stopped.</li>
<li>Pheromone traps play an important role in stopping any further reproduction and multiplication of the bugs.
It is also chemical-free and also safe for use in your household. You can find these traps in the local retailers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-proper-sealing-and-sanitation">2. Proper Sealing and Sanitation</h3>
<p>Most pantry bugs enter the foods and drugs because of the poor and open packaging. The moment they get inside they get a good chance to feed and multiply.</p>
<p>By keeping your foods tightly sealed and in a properly sanitized area, you are able to control any infestation of your food.</p>
<h3 id="3-disposing-of-the-already-infested-foods-">**3. Disposing of the already infested foods **</h3>
<p>If your food is already infested with pantry bugs, sometimes the best way to prevent any further infestation is through disposing of it.</p>
<p>Disposing of will also prevent any risk of consuming the pantry bugs which could pose a health risk.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>How long do pantry bugs live? Well, there are different kinds of pantry bugs and their life span depends on the species and their life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some bugs are destructive at certain stages of the life cycle-say larvae and others at another stage-say adult.</li>
<li>If you spot these pantry bugs in your home, you can also take a physical action and employ the control measures listed above to stop their further spread.</li>
<li>Most importantly, nobody wants bugs in their home, and proper sanitation and proper and constantly checking your store and foods could minimize the potential of infestation.
Lastly, ensure your food product is tightly sealed at all times.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/bed-bugs-vs-other-pests/">Bed</a> <a href="/posts/how-to-find-bed-bugs-during-the-day/">bug</a> infestations are a significant concern for homeowners, renters, and property managers. These tiny pests can cause both physical discomfort and emotional distress, as they often leave itchy, red bites and are notoriously difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>While DIY treatments might seem like a cost-effective solution, hiring a professional exterminator is often the most reliable and efficient option. However, the cost of bed bug extermination can vary based on a variety of factors. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of what to expect when it comes to the cost of bed bug extermination services.</p>
<h2 id="1-average-cost-of-bed-bug-extermination">1. Average Cost of Bed Bug Extermination</h2>
<p>The cost of hiring a professional exterminator to eliminate a bed bug infestation typically ranges between $300 and $5,000. This broad range reflects several influencing factors, including the size of the property, the severity of the infestation, and the type of treatment selected.</p>
<p>For a typical home with a moderate infestation, you can expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,500 for professional bed bug extermination services. However, larger properties, particularly multi-unit buildings, can incur significantly higher costs. In contrast, smaller homes or apartments with minimal infestations may cost less to treat. Its essential to remember that the cost of extermination is an investment in your health and peace of mind.</p>
<h2 id="2-factors-affecting-the-cost-of-bed-bug-extermination">2. Factors Affecting the Cost of Bed Bug Extermination</h2>
<p>Several factors can influence the final cost of bed bug extermination. Understanding these elements can help you anticipate the potential expenses and make an informed decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Property Size:**The larger the property, the more expensive it is to treat. If you live in a multi-story home or a multi-unit building, the cost of extermination will increase due to the increased square footage. Larger homes with multiple bedrooms or larger common areas require more time and resources to treat, thus increasing the cost.</li>
<li>**Severity of the Infestation:**The extent of the bed bug problem plays a significant role in determining the overall cost. A minor infestation thats confined to a single room will cost less to treat than an extensive infestation that has spread throughout the home. In cases where bed bugs have infiltrated multiple rooms or floors, exterminators will need to spend more time and use more resources, which increases the cost of the treatment.</li>
<li>**Type of Treatment:**Different extermination methods come with varying price tags. For instance, heat treatment typically costs more upfront but may only require a single visit. On the other hand, chemical treatments or fumigation may need multiple visits, which can increase the overall price. The treatment method selected depends on the severity of the infestation, the property size, and the preference of the homeowner or exterminator.</li>
<li>**Location:**The region in which you live can also affect the cost of pest control services. Urban areas, particularly large cities, tend to have higher costs for pest control due to higher operating expenses for pest control companies. In more rural areas, the prices may be more affordable. Its also worth noting that the cost of labor and the availability of pest control services may differ between regions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-heat-treatment-vs-chemical-treatment">3. Heat Treatment vs. Chemical Treatment</h2>
<p>When it comes to bed bug extermination, there are primarily two types of treatment methods: heat treatment and chemical treatment. Both methods have their pros and cons, and the best choice depends on the specific circumstances of the infestation.</p>
<h3 id="heat-treatment">Heat Treatment</h3>
<p>Heat treatment is one of the most effective ways to eliminate bed bugs. This method involves raising the temperature of the affected area to a level that is lethal to bed bugs, typically around 120F to 140F (49C to 60C). The heat is applied to all infested areas, including furniture, cracks, and crevices, ensuring that no bed bugs survive.</p>
<p>Heat treatments are highly effective and typically only require one visit. They are especially useful for severe infestations and for properties where the use of chemicals is not preferred, such as in homes with young children or pets. However, heat treatment can be expensive, typically ranging from $2,000 to $4,000, depending on the size of the property and the severity of the infestation. Despite the high cost, many homeowners opt for this method because it is fast and effective.</p>
<h3 id="chemical-treatment">Chemical Treatment</h3>
<p>Chemical treatment involves the use of insecticides and pesticides to target bed bugs in various stages of their life cycle. This method can be less expensive, with costs ranging from $300 to $1,500. However, chemical treatments often require multiple visits and can take several weeks to fully eradicate the infestation.</p>
<p>The chemicals used in these treatments can also pose risks to human health if not properly applied, making it essential to work with a licensed pest control professional.</p>
<p>While chemical treatments are effective, they may not always eliminate all the bed bugs on the first try. In some cases, bed bugs may develop resistance to certain chemicals, making the treatment less effective over time. For this reason, many pest control experts recommend using chemical treatments in conjunction with other methods, such as vacuuming or heat treatment, for more comprehensive results.</p>
<h2 id="4-diy-vs-professional-extermination">4. DIY vs. Professional Extermination</h2>
<p>Many homeowners attempt to control bed bug infestations on their own, using DIY products such as sprays, powders, and traps. These products typically cost between $50 and $200, depending on the brand and type.</p>
<p>While DIY solutions may seem like a more affordable option, they are often less effective than professional extermination services. In particular, DIY treatments can be insufficient for severe infestations or for areas that are difficult to reach.</p>
<p>Bed bugs are notorious for being challenging to eliminate. Even if DIY products seem to provide some relief, they often dont address the root of the problem. As a result, the infestation may return, leading to additional costs and frustration. Professional exterminators, on the other hand, have the expertise, experience, and tools to provide a thorough, lasting solution.</p>
<h2 id="5-cost-of-follow-up-visits">5. Cost of Follow-Up Visits</h2>
<p>In many cases, bed bug extermination requires follow-up visits to ensure the infestation is completely eradicated. Exterminators typically charge between $100 and $400 per visit for follow-up treatments. These visits are necessary to inspect the property, ensure that the treatment was effective, and reapply any necessary treatments.</p>
<p>Follow-up visits are particularly important if the infestation is extensive or if the original treatment was not fully effective. Some exterminators may include follow-up visits in the initial cost, while others may charge them separately. Its essential to clarify the pricing structure with your exterminator before committing to a service.</p>
<h2 id="6-additional-costs-to-consider">6. Additional Costs to Consider</h2>
<p>In addition to the direct costs of extermination, there are other expenses you may need to account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Pre-treatment preparation:**Some exterminators charge additional fees for pre-treatment tasks such as removing furniture, cleaning the home, or packing away personal items. These tasks can add to the overall cost of the service.</li>
<li>**Cleaning and repair:**After the bed bugs are eradicated, you may need to replace or repair items affected by the infestation, such as furniture, linens, or carpets. Additionally, you may need to launder or dispose of infested clothing and bedding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While bed bug extermination can be costly, its important to view it as an investment in your health, comfort, and property. The cost of professional pest control services varies depending on several factors, including the size of your home, the severity of the infestation, the treatment method, and your location.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although DIY treatments might seem like a cheaper alternative, they are often less effective in eliminating bed bugs. If you suspect a bed bug infestation, its best to consult with a licensed pest control professional to evaluate the situation and recommend the most effective course of action.
Prompt treatment is crucial to preventing the infestation from spreading and to minimizing the financial and emotional impact of these resilient pests.</li>

<li>Finding a bed bug infestation early will aid in its control so that it doesn&rsquo;t spread further - they measure about5 - 7 millimeters in length.</li>
<li>Notably, treating that minor bed bug infestation will be easier and cheaper compared to trying to control a full-blown attack.
But these minor infestations will also be difficult to find or even identify their signs correctly. Check these bed bug killers.

<p>Further, there are many insects such as
*bat bugs, spider beetle, swallow bugs, carpet beetles, ants, book-lice, and roach nymphs that can be mistaken with or for bed bugs. *</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/bed-bugs-appearance-and-life-cycle">correctly identify the bed bugs</a>, that infestation may spread to various places of your residence like the yard or house - or even jump onto some humans and trigger an infestation in their house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-whats-not-truly-indicative-of-bed-bugs">Step 1: What&rsquo;s not Truly Indicative of Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>Bed bug bites may not be the right signs to look out for to acknowledge the presence of an infestation.
This is because the bites are similar to those of other insects such as
fleas
, chiggers, or
mosquitoes
, or even hives, fungal infections, and eczema rashes.
Further, some humans may also not react to bed bug bites - they affect people differently. Some may not even show bite signs or bite marks - that is they&rsquo;ll show no reaction.
But for other humans, signs may include anaphylaxis, painful swellings, and bite marks being enlarged. Also, differences in blood types may cause a disparity in bite numbers.
For instance, if bed bugs are used to O-positive blood type, they&rsquo;ll mainly bite people with that blood - they know and get used to that blood taste.
Will the bed bugs infest all the rooms? Bed bugs may reach one room rater and thus some people may not experience the bites. The female bug will move to other rooms and lay eggs.
They may even hitch a ride on a human to get to another house, room, or area in the same room. After feeding and mating, the female bed bug will lay eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, a bed bug infestation may remain locked in one room for some time. The females will move to another room once all hiding places in one room are occupied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-check-for-bed-bug-signs">Step 2: Check for Bed Bug Signs</h3>
<p>To find the bed bugs in your rooms and spaces, look out for definite physical bed bug signs.
You&rsquo;ll examine this when you&rsquo;ve been away from the house, or when changing or cleaning bedding.</p>
<h4 id="1-live-bed-bugs">1. Live Bed Bugs</h4>
<p>Getting live bed bugs in the spaces and house will be a sure sign of the bug infestation.
But bed bugs will only move around if they&rsquo;re pregnant females avoiding males, or if seeking food.
The bugs will hide in a specific location - and thus you might not notice an attack unless it grows severe.
They&rsquo;ll move also if their hiding areas are disturbed. Further, there are many bugs that you may confuse with bed bugs.</p>
<h4 id="2-shell-casings"><strong>2. Shell Casings�</strong></h4>
<p>The
bed bug life cycle
makes the bugs pass via 5 stages - and before molting onto the next stage, they&rsquo;ll feed on blook and shed the exoskeleton leaving behind the shell casings.
These shell or skin casings or husks will signify the presence of bed bugs in your spaces - this will be an especially growing bed bug infestation.
The casings will be hollow�and translucent falling off from the juvenile stages of the bed bugs. These will be simpler to locate (they won&rsquo;t be moving) compared to bed bugs that&rsquo;ll hide.
You&rsquo;ll find the casings on areas that bed bugs breed and hatch - so I advise you to examine the crevices, cracks, holes, upholstered furniture, and the mattress seams.</p>
<h4 id="3-bed-bug-eggs">**3. Bed Bug **<strong>Eggs</strong></h4>
<p>Bed bugs (their females) will lay about 1 to 7 eggs daily. Notably, the eggs will be ovular, pearl white, and measuring 1 millimeter in length. However, if you&rsquo;re not keen, you may miss the bed bug eggs.
The eggs can be stopped by a naked eye provided they&rsquo;re 5+ days in age -
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/bed-bugs-appearance-and-life-cycle">as outlined by the EPA</a>
. You&rsquo;ll find them stuck loosely on wood and fabric crevices - but they may hide anywhere.
As noted above, the female bed bugs (when pregnant) will wander around seeking hiding places or running away from males. So, they&rsquo;ll drop eggs in different rooms and apartments.
So, is it possible to carry the bed bug eggs on the human body? Well, the bed bugs will bite the human arms, hands, and legs but also the head and neck.
However, the bugs won&rsquo;t live on the human or lay eggs on your body - and so you won&rsquo;t get bed bugs or their eggs in the hair.�So, how should you kill those bed bug eggs? Well, I recommend using
Isopropyl alcohol to exterminate the bed bug eggs plus the adults.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R26-3bKJUEA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R26-3bKJUEA</a>
Further, you can repel the bed bugs using smells that they hate including Cinnamon powder, Lavender, Alcohol, Cayenne Pepper, garlic aroma, and Fresh mint.
Will the bed bug eggs wash away in your shower?� No, the bug eggs won&rsquo;t stay on the human skin and thus they won&rsquo;t be washed off when your bathe or shower. The bugs won&rsquo;t also infest the human
hair like lice or
fleas
, but they&rsquo;ll live in�wall cracks, furniture, and mattress.

<h4 id="4-fecal-marks">**4. **<strong>Fecal marks</strong></h4>
<p>With the bed bug infestation, you&rsquo;ll get bloodstains on pillowcases, mattresses, and sheets. Just like with
flea dirt
, bed bug fecal matter contains undigested blood and hence it&rsquo;ll leave red or dark brown discoloration.
Therefore, the bloodstains you&rsquo;ll find on the sleeping surfaces may be from the fecal matter of the bugs or blood arising from bed bug bites - especially when you scratch them.
However, the fecal marks from bed bugs will be much smaller compared to bloodstains. The dark sport from the fecal matter will look like a dot from a marker or pen.
Since bed bugs will exclusively feed on blood, the fecal matter will smear on the surfaces in a unique way. Further, you&rsquo;ll find these marks challenging to wash out.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may also find rusty stains on the pillowcases or bed sheets - this may be signs that bed bugs are around. The bloodstains are from bites caused by the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-bed-bug-odor">**5. **<strong>Bed Bug Odor�</strong></h4>
<p>Bed bugs will produce a slightly sweet�but musty smell similar to that of coriander or raspberries - with a massive
infestation
. The smell may change with the bed bug&rsquo;s state - and may feel different with various
olfactory senses.
Bed bugs will product alarm pheromones odor - a smell similar to that produced by stink bugs -
see a comparison of stink bugs versus. bed bugs
.
Unless there is a dog inspection for bed bugs, these odors won&rsquo;t be a great indication for bed bugs since its less perceptible to many humans.
Notably, if you&rsquo;re already perceiving the bed bug smell, then the infestation is overly massive and you may already be seeing live bed bugs around.</p>
<h3 id="step-3where-do-bed-bugs-hide">Step 3:Where Do Bed Bugs Hide?</h3>
<p>Bed bugs
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">will hide</a>
in clothes shelves, clothes seams, ceiling, mattress tags, piping, floor or wall cracks, couches, furniture joints, and chair joints.
You may also find the bed bugs&rsquo; eggs, feces, skin castings, and adults in the box spring when it&rsquo;s around the time of day for feeding. Further, check the headboard and bed frame.
For spaces that are heavily attacked by bed bugs, check the screw heads, ceiling/ wall joints, under the wall hangings or wallpapers, in appliances and drawer joints.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, bed bugs will measure roughly the credit-card width and hence they&rsquo;ll easily squeeze in the various small cracks and tiny spaces.

<h3 id="step-4bed-bug-habits-andbehavior">Step 4:�Bed Bug Habits and�Behavior</h3>
<p>You should comprehend the habits of
<a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-bedbugs">bedbugs</a></p>
<ul>
<li>their reproduction, living, and eating behavior. This will help in establishing their location and eliminating them.
The brownish, oval, and small bugs will suck blood from humans and animals too. They&rsquo;ll measure like an apple seed in its size. Once they feed on blood, they become reddish and swell in size.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-feeding">1. Feeding</h4>
<p>Check where the bed bugs are hiding including the ceilings, walls, and floors. Check too for eggs laid by the female bedbugs - they&rsquo;ll be about the speck of dust.
The bed bug nymphs will molt about 5 times to drop their skins as they grow to become mature - but they need to take a full human or animal blood meal before shedding skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs will suck blood from birds, mammals, and humans. They can also move 5 to 20 feet around their hiding places in search of a meal from a suitable host.</li>
<li>When will bedbugs bite - Bed bugs can feed or suck blood during daylight but they&rsquo;ll largely be active and feeding during the night - for about 3 to 12 minutes.</li>
<li>The tarry and rusty spots you&rsquo;ll find on the sheets and other hiding locations denote that about 20-percent of the nymphs and adults feed<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like/">while still pooping</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-mating-or-life-stages">2. Mating or Life Stages</h4>
<p>The bugs will require a minimum of 1 blood meal to enable them to reproduce and molt to the next stage - of all the 6 stages.
The bed bugs will only
survive for about 3 months
without feeding on blood. But, the bugs will feed for more than 1 time a day.
For effective mating and reproduction, both the female and male bed bugs require to feed on blood at least 1 time in 2 weeks.
Every of the female bed bugs will lay roughly 1 - 3 eggs each day and this will total to roughly 200 to 500 eggs over the bugs lifetime - with their lifetime being 6 to 12 months.
Further, the bugs will take about 4-5 weeks to complete the Egg-to-egg life cycle - especially when the conditions such as temperature and humidity are favorable.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf_MSnOnQmA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf_MSnOnQmA</a></p>
<h4 id="3living-conditions">3.�Living conditions</h4>
<p>Bed bugs will survive and equally be active at temperatures from 46F (7C ) but will be dead when the temperatures rise to over 113F (45C ).
Therefore,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-heaters/">killing the bed bugs using heat</a>
requires that you raise the room temperature very high so that it&rsquo;ll exterminate the bugs even in their hiding places.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll find the bugs in many areas of your living and sleeping spaces hiding in bedding, crevices, and crack - which means that the killing temperatures need to be higher.
But the Cimex hemipterus will need higher temperatures to exterminate compared to the regular bed bug that is prevalent in the subtropical and tropical regions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on how to find bed bugs; check for various signs including bloodstains, live bugs, eggs, fecal marks, plus shell casing around the spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>But bed bugs have comparable features to other bugs such as ants and swallow bugs, carpet beetles, ants, book-lice, and roach nymphs.
So, effectively identify the bed bugs to easily and readily exterminate them from the rooms and residence.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/bed-bugs-vs-other-pests/">Bed</a> bugs are notoriously elusive pests that are most active at night when they feed on their hosts. However, they don&rsquo;t just hide at nightthey also spend a significant portion of their time hiding during the day. This can make it difficult to spot them when you&rsquo;re not experiencing an active infestation. In this article, we will guide you on how to find bed bugs during the day, including signs of infestation, tools to use, and the most common places they hide.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-bed-bugs-hide-during-the-day">Why Do Bed Bugs Hide During the Day?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are nocturnal creatures, meaning they are most active at night when they feed on blood. During the day, they hide in cracks and crevices to avoid light and predators. They come out at night to feed, making it difficult to spot them unless you know where to look. Understanding their hiding habits is crucial for detecting them during the day.</p>
<h2 id="common-hiding-spots-for-bed-bugs">Common Hiding Spots for Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are experts at hiding in small, tight spaces during the day. They typically look for places that are close to their food source, which is often a bed or sofa. Here are some of the most common places to look for bed bugs during the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Mattresses and Bed Frames:**Check around the seams, folds, and tags of your mattress and box spring. Bed bugs often hide in these areas because they are close to their food source.</li>
<li>**Cracks and Crevices:**Inspect furniture, baseboards, and walls for cracks where bed bugs can hide.</li>
<li>**Upholstered Furniture:**Bed bugs may hide in the cushions and seams of chairs, sofas, and other upholstered furniture.</li>
<li>**Electrical Outlets:**Bed bugs can squeeze into electrical outlets and other small openings in walls.</li>
<li>**Behind Wall Hangings:**Posters, paintings, or pictures hung on walls can provide hiding spots for bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-look-for-bed-bugs-during-the-day">How to Look for Bed Bugs During the Day</h2>
<p>Finding bed bugs during the day requires a combination of tools and techniques. Follow these steps to thoroughly check for signs of infestation:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Use a Flashlight:**Since bed bugs are small and hide in dark areas, a flashlight can help illuminate hard-to-see places.</li>
<li>**Check for Bed <a href="/posts/how-much-do-bed-bug-exterminators-cost/">Bug</a> Eggs:**Bed bug eggs are small, white, and often found in clusters. Look for them in cracks, corners, and seams of furniture.</li>
<li>**Look for Shed Skins:**Bed bugs molt several times as they grow. Shed skins can be found in places where they hide.</li>
<li>**Check for Fecal Stains:**Bed bug droppings are small, dark spots that resemble pepper or ink stains. These can be found near their hiding spots.</li>
<li>**Use a Bed Bug Detection Kit:**If you are unsure or cannot find any visible signs, consider using a bed bug detection kit, which can help confirm the presence of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signs-of-a-bed-bug-infestation">Signs of a Bed Bug Infestation</h2>
<p>In addition to finding bed bugs during the day, you should also look for other signs of infestation. Some common signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Red, Itchy Bites:**Bed bugs feed on human blood, and their bites can cause itching and irritation.</li>
<li>**Musty Odor:**Bed bugs release a distinct, musty odor when they are disturbed.</li>
<li>**Visible Bed Bugs:**While bed bugs are typically nocturnal, you may see them during the day if the infestation is severe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finding bed bugs during the day can be challenging, but with patience and the right tools, you can uncover their hiding spots. Always check common hiding areas like mattresses, cracks, and furniture, and look for signs of infestation like eggs, droppings, and bites. If you suspect an infestation, it is best to contact a professional pest control service for help with exterminating the bed bugs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs eggs
are oval in shape and measure about 1/16 inches long. A female bed bug lays about 200-250 eggs. The eggs hatch in 6-10 days, and the nymphs suck for a blood meal from humans.
Homeowners are mainly worried about bed bug nymphs and adults  the biting stages. But should they?

<em>In this article, I tackle these questions on bed bug eggs- can you see bed bug eggs - what do they look like? Where do bed bugs lay their eggs? How long do bed bug eggs take to hatch? And finally, how to kill bed bug eggs?�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs--kill-bed-bugs">How to Kill Bed Bug Eggs  Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Female bed bugs lay their eggs on hard surfaces, and theyll hatch in 1-2 weeks to become Nymphs. Nymphs develop to adults, with a blood meal and temperature, within 2 weeks to 1 month.</p>
<h3 id="1-non-chemical-methods"><strong>1. Non-chemical methods�</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt>First, ensure that the technique you use to kill either the bed bugs or eggs is legal, effective, and safe. Check</dt>
<dt><a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/stay-legal-and-safe-treating-bed-bugs">the legal techniques</a></dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>For the non-chemical techniques, use the most appropriate for your situation - some are more effective. Below is the method I recommend to</dt>
<dt>kill the bed bug</dt>
<dt>eggs.</dt>
<dt><strong>- Heat treatment</strong></dt>
<dd>Try the
clothes dryer to kill the bed bug eggs</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>but use high heat - about 39
o
C to 51
o
C for over 30 minutes. Try a closed car under scotching sun - but enclose the clothes in plastic bags (black in color).
However, the effectiveness of the above-discussed method is dependent on your local factors, such as climate. Definitely, the DIY heat-treating techniques may not be effective in different circumstances.
Thus, you&rsquo;ll need to hire an exterminator as they&rsquo;ll come with high intensive options to treat your whole house. However, I would recommend you get yourself a
portable bed bug heater
as an alternative to hiring exterminators.
<strong>- Cold treatment</strong>
: I would recommend using this method for your home by placing infested items in a freezer fixed below -18
o
C.
However, the items under cold treatment must be placed in a sealed bag - this should be a cold treatment for about 1 week.
Also, check regularly that the freezer temperature is at -18
o
C - use a suitable thermometer.
<strong>- Steam treatment</strong>
(dry of wet
steamers
): Steam will very easily kill bed bug eggs that are hiding between bed frames, baseboards, carpets, fabric seams, and crevices.
Ensure that you use steam at a 55
o
C temperature and must not come with a tough airflow - this could make the bed bugs and their eggs to scatter. I would recommend using a diffuser to safeguard.
<strong>Bug bombs (foggers)</strong>
: I would recommend using
bug foggers/ bombs
cautiously, particularly ensuring the product is designed to kill bed bugs. However, bombs may lead to an explosion or fire if used carelessly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C84UEbRZWv4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C84UEbRZWv4</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-follow-up-with-and-inspection">2. Follow-up With and Inspection</h3>
<p>The next step will be inspecting your premises, home, rooms, and items such as furniture or clothes for evidence of any bed bugs, eggs, and
baby bed bugs
.
Any bed bugs evidence will signify that some bed bugs eggs may have hatched after the first clean up or bug treatment. You&rsquo;ll need to use another treatment method for another 1 or 2 rounds.
I would also recommend using desiccants that&rsquo;ll dry the fluids in the body of the bed bugs and their eggs. Luckily, no bed bugs will raise their chemical resistance to these desiccants.</p>

<p>I recommend that you don&rsquo;t dare use the food- or pool-grade diatomaceous earth. These are dangerous because they are manufactured from fossilized diatoms.
The above DE may cause dangerous breathing problems. However, researchers recommend using DE that&rsquo;s approved as a pesticide - these will have diatoms of a different size.
Again, remember that
desiccants will kill bed bugs
and their eggs excellently, but it might take longer to show reliable results in your bug control process.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-bed-bug-eggs-look-like">What Do Bed Bug Eggs Look Like?</h2>
<p>**1. Color - **
Bed bug eggs
are pearl-white or semi-transparent colored &ldquo;beings,&rdquo; measuring about 0.1 inches (or just 2.5 mm).
However, for eggs that are over 5 days old - they&rsquo;ll have a dark mark that looks like an eye.
**2. Shape - **
Bed bug eggs are shaped like a barrel. But can you see them with your eyes?
Yes, in-fact bed bug eggs are about the size of an uncooked grain of rice or pinhead - this is just slightly smaller than
their nymphs
.
**3. Shiny and Sticky�- **
Bed bug eggs have a sticking body that allows them to cluster together easily.
Bed bugs (well, the females
) lay about 1 to 5 eggs each day.
The eggs&rsquo; sticky nature gives them a shiny appearance while also acting as glue to attack different surfaces.
**4. Egg husks - **
Well, the empty eggshells will also appear as if they&rsquo;re live eggs - but won&rsquo;t be shiny and flat plus dry. These husks also show signs of
bed bugs
in your space.
You&rsquo;ll find
bed bug husks on rough surfaces - you can see
them using a magnifying lens. But bed bugs
<a href="https://entomologytoday.org/2016/11/17/which-insecticide-spray-should-you-use-for-bed-bug-eggs/">won&rsquo;t die on their own</a></p>
<ul>
<li>so be sure there are some live bugs around.
<strong>Killing them</strong>
? First, vacuums will not strictly kill the bed bug eggs - but good
bed bug sprays
will do the magic - but ensure you do 2 - 3 treatments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-bed-bugs-lay-eggs">Where Do Bed Bugs Lay Eggs?</h2>
<p>Due to their sticky body, youll find bed bugs moving or
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/how-find-bed-bugs">stuck on cushions, couches, and wooden furniture</a>
, including different fabrics like cotton, wool, denim, and metal or plastics.</p>
<h3 id="1-beds---box-springs-bed-buttons--mattress">1. Beds - Box Springs, Bed Buttons, &amp; Mattress</h3>
<p>Bed bugs have a complete life-cycle - egg, the nymph, and the bugs adult. The name of this bugs denotes why theyll quickly infest your box springs, bed frames, and mattresses.
Youll see bed bug eggs near the bed edges, bed buttons, and mattresses too. However, you can also find them on rough surfaces glued tight.
But since the female adults (fertilized ones) will lay roughly 200 eggs total  which will hatch into Nymphs within 1-2 weeks.�Bed bug eggs will be deposited in protected areas, crevices, cracks, and dark areas.
<strong>Bed Buttons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Youll also find bed bug eggs around egg-laying areas such as the edges, folds, and seams of your mattress, as well as bed buttons. Further, inspect the box springs and the area they touch with your mattress.
I recommend you also inspect the walls, floor, and bed frame as these areas may also hide many bed bug eggs.
Bed bug encasement
has no phthalates, fire retardants, vinyl, or PVC  and are thus simple to clean.
Nymphs start sucking human blood promptly once theyre hatched. If the Nymphs get adequate food and appropriate temperature (just room temperature), theyll molt into adults in 2-4 weeks.
The Nymphs will Instar (shed skins) roughly 5 times until they develop into adults. Interestingly, mature
bed bugs will survive
for multiple months after taking a blood meal.

<dt>Bed bugs may hitchhike your clothes or even the pets</dt>
<dt>but they may eventually hide on your floor or carpet</dt>
<dt>after talking a full blood meal. So, you might want to inspect under chairs, dressers, and bed frame legs.</dt>

<dt>Further, check the around your baseboards and walls at the edges of the floor. Further, inspect and treat the joints and cracks around your hardwood floors. For the carpet, pull it off and check along or below the tack strips.</dt>
<dt><strong>Caution</strong></dt>
<dd>Dont just mop or sweep the floor since this will shift the bed bugs eggs to another location in the room or house.
However, a steamer or vacuum would be a great alternative since itll suck any of the bed bug eggs lying around on the carpet or floor.
<em>Vacuuming or Treating Bare Floors for Bed Bugs:�</em>
For bare floors, I recommend using a vacuum machine plus
diatomaceous earth for cat fleas
. Here are the steps to take while at it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Use a powder duster to spread the DE dust on the bare floor. However, remember to put on a dust mask to avoid hurting your breathing system, including the lungs.</li>
<li>Now, vacuum your floors keenly to remove all the DE. Pay special attention to vacuuming the crevices and cracks that are between the floorboards and the tiles.
*Vacuuming or Wall-To-Wall Carpet for Bed Bugs: *
To clean your carpet (the wall-2-wall), use
diatomaceous earth
, vacuuming, and shampooing the carpet.</li>
<li>Use a duster to spread the DE over the whole carpet. Equally, also put on a dust mask to protect your breathing system from the harsh diatomaceous earth.Next, keenly vacuum your wall-to-wall carpet to remove all thediatomaceous earththat was spread earlier.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dealing with bed bugs in carpets can be a frustrating and challenging task, as these pests hide deep within fibers and along edges. Fortunately, there are effective methods to eliminate them - from natural powders like
<strong>diatomaceous earth</strong>
and
<strong>borax</strong>
to
<strong>heat treatments, steaming, and thorough vacuuming</strong>
.</p>
<p>This guide explores five proven ways to eradicate bed bugs from your carpet, ensuring a pest-free home. Whether you prefer DIY solutions or professional help, these strategies will help you tackle the infestation effectively. Lets dive in!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-bed-bugs-from-carpets">How to Remove Bed Bugs from Carpets</h2>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth"><strong>1. Diatomaceous Earth</strong></h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth is a safe, affordable and easy to use powder that can be conveniently used to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">get rid of bed bug in carpets</a>
. Its a natural ingredient mined from decomposed organisms known as diatoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The microscopic diatoms in the diatomaceous earth are sharp fragments which can easily penetrate into the body of insects including <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs. Once in contact with the bed bugs body, DE powder gets through the exoskeleton and dehydrates the insect of its internal fluids causing it to die.</li>
<li>To use diatomaceous earth, apply a thin layer on the top side of the affected carpet and along the space between the carpet and baseboard. The substance works within a few hours but you can allow a few days to enable more bed bugs to interact with it.
Vacuum the carpet to remove the dead bed bugs and the remnants of the powder. If you have a large infestation you may have to apply the powder several times.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend using only food grade DE powder because it is safe around your kids and pets.</p>
<h3 id="2-borax-powder"><strong>2. Borax Powder</strong></h3>
<p>Another effective treatment for bed bugs in your carpet is the
borax powder and boric acid
. It kills bed bugs in a mechanical action like the diatomaceous earth powder. Once in contact with the bed bug, it rips the outer shell and gets inside. This dehydrates the insect, eventually causing it to die.</p>
<ul>
<li>To use borax powder on bed bugs, sprinkle a sufficient amount on the carpet and the space between the carpet and the baseboard or wall. This will ensure that bed bugs that hide under the carpet get into contact with the powder as they come out.
Vacuum the carpet after a few days to remove dead bed bugs and the remains of the powder. As a precaution, do not use borax powder around kids and pets since it can cause skin irritation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-heat-treatment-and-steaming"><strong>3. Heat Treatment and steaming</strong></h3>
<p>Treating your carpet to certain temperatures will kill bed bugs together with their eggs. One advantage of this treatment is the ability of heat to penetrate anywhere bed bugs may be hiding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat treatment will kill bed bugs even in the gap between your carpet and baseboard or wall.�However, heat treatment comes with high cost for equipment and energy used.</li>
<li>For this reason, you need the services of professional pest exterminators who will utilize specialized equipment to treat your carpet.
Heat treatment involves raising the temperature inside the house to levels which bed bugs, larvae and their eggs cannot survive. Before the treatment, all individuals, pets and everything that is sensitive to heat should be evacuated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-steam-treatment"><strong>4. Steam Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>Steam treatment can effectively kill bed bugs and their eggs when used with a carpet shampoo and a compound that kills bed bugs. The compound of choice should however not react with the cleaning agent or stain your carpet.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a heavy-duty steamer for this task. This treatment utilizes at triple action to kill bed bugs, larvae and eggs. These<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/">bed bug Steamers</a>will be a great addition to your DIY store.
Apart from the steam and the compound, bed bugs will be crushed to death by the physical movement of the steamer brush.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-vacuuming-bed-bugs-from-carpet"><strong>5. Vacuuming Bed Bugs From Carpet�</strong></h3>
<p>Can I use a vacuum cleaner to remove bed bugs in my carpet? This is a common question that I encounter as a pest eradication expert.</p>
<p>Well, while vacuuming can help reduce the number of bed bugs in your carpet, it will not give you a permanent solution to the problem. However, vacuuming can help you achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove clusters or groups of bed bugs in a short time.</li>
<li>Minimize the use insecticides in heavily infested areas that may require several treatment cycles.</li>
<li>Remove bed bugs that are resistant to insecticides</li>
<li>Remove isolated bed bugs.</li>
<li>Eliminate bed bugs in cluttered or hard to reach places.</li>
<li>Convenient removal of bed bugs from areas where it is not safe or practical to use insecticides.</li>
<li>Clean the area of dead bed bugs, feces and other debris to allow easy inspection for bed bugs or proper use of insecticides.
The effectiveness of vacuuming depends on the extent of the bed bug infestation. If the infestation is severe, vacuuming will only reduce the number of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no chemicals are used alongside vacuuming, new infestations will develop shortly afterwards.�Thus, most pest exterminators use vacuuming as a supplement to other bed bug control methods.</p>
<p>A vacuum cleaner cant just suck all bed bugs or even dislodge their eggs for your carpet. There are high chances that many bed bugs will be left on your carpet and will continue reproducing.</p>
<p>Even so, vacuuming is a great remedy for bed bug control. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results when vacuuming your carpet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make use of a handheld vacuum cleaner with a powerful suction. A special attachment can be used to suck the bed bugs that hide along the space between the carpet and the baseboard or wall.</li>
<li>The brush of the cleaner should press gently on the carpet. Pressing too hard might brush bed bugs off the carpet without sucking them.</li>
<li>You can sprinkle some diatomaceous earth powder on the carpet so that the bed bugs are picked up together with the powder. DE powder will kill the bed bugs when they mix up in the attached bag or canister.</li>
<li>When youre done, take the vacuum cleaner outside and make sure no bed bug escapes through the hose. Remove the vacuum bag carefully and seal it in an airtight plastic bag for later disposal.</li>
<li>If youre using a bagless vacuum cleaner, put the debris in a plastic bag and damp them in trash. The canister should then be cleaned with hot water and soap to kill any remaining bed bugs and their eggs. Care should be taken not to short circuit the electrical components.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>For better results, regular vacuuming is inevitable. Usually bed bugs will cluster in their usual favourite locations. These are the areas to concentrate on during subsequent vacuuming. Plus you can keep checking your carpet regularly for any signs of bed bugs.</p>
<p>Experts recommend using vacuum cleaning in conjunction with heat treatment, freezing or steaming to eradicate bed bugs. This improves the overall effectiveness of your vacuuming efforts. To minimise infestation, keep your house free from cluttered stuff. Bed bugs take advantage of this mess to hide and breed.</p>

      <description>Unlike other big animals like mammals, it&amp;#39;s not easy to tell male or female</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike other big animals like mammals, it&rsquo;s not easy to tell male or female
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_bug">bedbug</a>
by just looking.
*On male vs. female bed bugs; female bedbugs have rounded abdomen while male counterparts have pointed ones. Unlike females, males don&rsquo;t lay eggs. *</p>
<ul>
<li>*However, they participate in the reproduction process (mating). Both male and female bedbugs are brown in color and move equally fast - including *baby bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-male-vs-female-bed-bug">Details: Male Vs Female Bed Bug</h2>
<p>Though male and female bedbugs have wings, they are too small to enable them to fly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since bedbugs are risky to human health, it&rsquo;s important to know signs and ways to curb their infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-body-structure-or-layout">a. Body Structure or layout</h3>
<p>Bedbugs (both male and female) are characterized by three body parts (head, thorax, and abdomen) and three pairs of legs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though both genders have wings, they can&rsquo;t help when it comes to flying - the wings are vestigial.
The body structure of male and female bedbugs is covered with an exoskeleton composed of soft body tissues.</li>
<li>*Bedbugs (male &amp; female) have stripe mark patterns on their abdomen and have equal body size. *
<em>Their body layout is made up of the head, thorax, and abdomen. The movement is made possible with the help of 3 pairs of legs that are strategically fixed.�</em>

</ul>
<h3 id="b-color">b. Color</h3>
<p>Male and female bedbugs are brown in color. The color varies from medium brown to dark brown, especially when they suck plenty of blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you pay close attention to their skin color (using a microscope or hand lens), you&rsquo;ll notice a slight variance in male color as compared to the female bedbug.
This is attributed to the internal organs each insect has. A female bedbug has hemocoel and ovaries, whereas a male doesn&rsquo;t have.
Therefore, the female bedbug has dark brown spots along the hemocoel lining towards the back.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-size">c. Size</h3>
<p>Generally, male and female bedbugs are the same. Actually, they are tiny and appear like apple seeds - about 1-2mm long.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since male bedbugs have pointed abdomen, they may appear longer, though that may not be the actual case - the length is negligible.
In comparison, for each stage of the bedbug&rsquo;s life cycle, both genders have similar sizes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-movement">d. Movement</h3>
<p>Female and male bedbugs move equally fast. Also, they scuttle in the same way.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, during the reproduction stage, the female bedbug may move slower than the male one due to the weight of eggs yet to be laid.
Since movement is the major option for bedbugs to escape for safety, the motion could be relatively high for you to catch them with your hands easily.

</ul>
<h3 id="e-shape">e. Shape</h3>
<p>Female bedbugs have rounded abdomen (when viewed side by side). Contrary, male bedbugs have pointed abdomen (towards the rear end).
When bedbugs feed on sufficient blood meal, the shape of the abdomen is not noticed easily - it unifies with the general body shape.</p>
<h3 id="f-bug-pattern">f. Bug pattern</h3>
<p>Both female and male bedbugs have patterns on their abdomen. These patterns are the necessary mechanism used when their body expand after a blood meal - just like an accordion does.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male stripe patterns run from left to right, while females one curve as they cross the ridge.</li>
<li>The female bedbug has a slight ridge at the back area near the hemocoel lining - the organ makes the patterns more conspicuous.
It&rsquo;s difficult to notice patterns on thirsty bedbugs because pattern marks shrink onto the body and camouflage with brown body color.

</ul>
<h2 id="do-male-or-female-bedbug-bites">Do Male or Female Bedbug Bites?</h2>
<p>Both male and female bedbug bites in search of blood meals. The extent or severity of the bite is the same for either male or female bedbugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice reddish-brown swelling on the skin (bedbug bite). Normally, bedbugs bite severally around a given area - this could be your arm, neck, or body.</li>
<li>Unlike a spider&rsquo;s bite, a bedbug&rsquo;s bite won&rsquo;t swell that much - it&rsquo;s just slight, but extended along the surface.
Bedbugs have a mouthpart that has a proboscis, which is sunk into your skin when sucking blood meal.
Bedbug&rsquo;s bite is accompanied by itching effects that make you tend to scratch your skin on that particular surface thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-bedbug-gender-is-more-dangerous">Which Bedbug Gender is More Dangerous?</h2>
<p>The severity of the bedbug&rsquo;s bite is a function of the number of attacks you experience and the degree of infestation.
If you are attacked by a huge number of bedbugs, then, you will have serious injuries or swellings as compared to limited numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male bedbug bites equally as their female counterpart. However, female bedbug tends to suck more blood at a time, especially when about to lay eggs.</li>
<li>Remember, it&rsquo;s a requirement for a female bedbug to have enough blood meal before laying eggs.
Contrary, male bedbugs don&rsquo;t need extra blood when mating and therefore, they bite gently on the skin surface.
We can say that a bedbug colony dominated by females is more dangerous than one with more males - this is just a comparative assumption derived from the above behavior of these insects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-male-bedbug-lay-eggs">Can Male Bedbug Lay Eggs?</h2>
<p>Male bedbugs can&rsquo;t lay eggs whatsoever. Basically, male bedbugs just mate to provide male reproductive cells necessary for fertilization.
In addition, male bedbugs don&rsquo;t have ovaries and hemocoel, which are necessary organs for reproduction and eggs preparation.

<h2 id="do-female-bedbugs-lay-eggs-without-male">Do Female Bedbugs Lay Eggs Without Male?</h2>
<p>Female bedbugs cant lay eggs without males since they need sperms (male reproductive cells) from males for fertilization purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, female bedbugs only lay eggs after fertilization has taken place - this occurs after mating has occurred.</li>
<li>During the mating process, the male bedbug transfers sperms into the female hemocoel, upon which the female ova get fertilized.
However, female bedbugs may not lay eggs immediately, it may take some time until there is the uptake of enough blood meal after which the eggs are laid.
Female bedbugs can store male&rsquo;s sperms for long and allow fertilized eggs to be laid at a convenient time of the year - perhaps when there is plenty of blood meal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-signs-show-you-have-bedbugs-infestation">Which Signs Show you Have Bedbugs Infestation?</h2>
<p>You will be having bedbugs infestation if you notice some of the following signs in your place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presence of dark spots on clothes, couches, or mattresses - these are usually bedbug&rsquo;s waste</li>
<li>Debris of dead bedbugs (exoskeleton) on sheets, mattresses, couches, or furniture</li>
<li>Reddish-brown swellings on the skin surface - they are usually itching and makes one scratch themselves</li>
<li>Live bedbugs moving about at night or partly during the day</li>
<li>Presence of bedbug&rsquo;s eggs on your items - lumps of eggs

</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-bedbugs">How Do You Get Rid of Bedbugs?</h2>
<p>The following are possible ways of getting rid of bedbug infestation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum thoroughly, bedbug-infested items - using a vacuum cleaner</li>
<li>Wash infested clothes or items with super hot water - bedbugs can&rsquo;t survive in very high temperature</li>
<li>Soak infested items in soapy detergents for 12 hours - the detergents over hydrate bedbugs leading to death. At times bedbugs die of suffocation</li>
<li>Heating bedbug-infested room to a temperature above 120 degrees</li>
<li>Steam all bedbugs infested items - use a steam sprayer</li>
<li>Dispose of bedbug-infested items- you can burn them or throw them far away</li>
<li>Using bedbug sprays or commercial killers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-see-bed-bugs/">male vs female bed bugs</a>
, female bedbugs have rounded abdomen while male counterparts have pointed ones. Unlike females, males don&rsquo;t lay eggs.
However, they participate in the reproduction process (mating). Both males and females are brown (medium to dark brown) in color and move equally fast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male &amp; female bedbugs have stripe mark patterns on their abdomen and have equal body size.</li>
<li>Their body layout is made up of head, thorax, and abdomen, while movement is made possible with the help of 3 pairs of legs that are strategically fixed with body structure.</li>
<li>Although male and female bedbugs have wings, they are too small to enable them to fly (they are vestigial).
Bedbugs are risky to human health. Therefore, you should learn signs and ways to curb their infestation as highlighted in this article. Otherwise, this could lead to serious menace if not attended to in time.</li>

<h2 id="comparison-stink-bugs-vs-bed-bugs">Comparison: Stink Bugs Vs. Bed Bugs</h2>
<h3 id="1-feeding-mechanism">1. Feeding mechanism</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are blood-sucking in nature. Bed bugs feed on blood that makes them look round from their initial flat shape.
On the other hand, stink bugs like to feed on fruits, vegetables, and other insects. Stink bugs are often found in vegetable gardens and fruit trees. When found in a garden, stink
bugs can destroy a lot of items
and materials.</p>
<h3 id="2-appearance">2. Appearance</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are flat and round
in shape. The shield shape of stink
bugs makes them different
from their counterpart bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="3-wings---do-they-fly">3. Wings - Do they fly</h3>
<p>Stink bugs have well-designed wings that
<a href="https://www.terminix.com/pest-control/stink-bugs/behavior/do-stink-bugs-fly/">help them to fly</a>
. For
bed bugs, you will find no wings
in their makeup.
Bed bugs do not fly
because they have�dysfunctional wing pads - and not wings great for flying.</p>
<h3 id="4-color">4. Color</h3>
<p>Without any scintilla of doubt, stink bugs come in a gamut of colors. These bugs can either be green, red, purple, brown, and black. However, the easiest way to
notice a bed bug
is its reddish-brown or yellow color. But before they suck blood (this is particularly true for
baby bed bugs
), bed bugs will appear white or yellow and have a flat oval shape.</p>
<h3 id="5-body-odor">5. Body Odor</h3>
<p>Bed bugs may not
unleash any specific smell
when touched. Stink bugs are going to leave a foul odor on your hands when touched. One primary reason for calling these bugs to stink is that they often unleash a foul smell or odor when smashed.
When stink bugs touch anything, they often leave behind a distinctive lousy odor. These
bugs can fly because
they have well-crafted wings. It is essential to know that stink
bugs will also bite
or hurt you when disturbed in any way.</p>
<h3 id="6-living-environment">6. Living Environment</h3>
<p>Stink bugs like light and can be found in places like vegetable gardens and fruit trees. The different colors of these bugs make them adapt and remain comfortable in any environment. Bed bugs
like dark environments
. Since they suck, blood human beings are their final host.
In a living apartment, stink
bugs like hiding
beneath sidings and other hard-to-reach areas. When winter is over, you can
see these bugs
matching out in their multitude from your house. Due to their nature of loving clear lights, you can find stink bugs around your windows and doors.</p>
<h3 id="7-body-size">7. Body Size</h3>
<p>The adult of both bugs maintains around a one-quarter inch long. The babies of a beg bug can be smaller than their counterpart stink bugs.</p>
<h3 id="8-bite-differences">8. Bite differences</h3>
<p>When stink
bugs bite
, there is every possibility to experience an allergic reaction. Besides, the
bite from�stink bugs
can be painful at the same time. One fantastic feature of a stink bug is that it appears in a plethora of colors.
This feature makes it possible for stink bugs to blend and adapt to any environment they find themselves.
Bed bugs will leave red welts
that itch on your skin when they suck and bite.
Also, check this comparison between
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-ants/">Bed Bugs vs. Ants</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The bottom line is that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-bed-bugs-spread/">bed bugs are blood-sucking</a>
in nature and can spread fast like a wildfire. Stink bugs can be irritating, annoying, infuriating, and can make people uncomfortable.
Remember that both bugs can be dangerous to human health and being. Controlling these bugs at the early stage is the only way to prevent infestation.</p>

      <description>Waterbugs</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterbug">Waterbugs</a>
are often mistaken for cockroaches. Mistaking one bug for the other leads to wrong pest eradication interventions -
get rid of cockroaches
.
Although they bear a close resemblance, it is possible to differentiate the two based on some factors.
Ill take you through some of the features you can use to differentiate cockroaches (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">including baby roaches</a>
) from water bugs.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Water Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="water-bugs-vs-cockroaches-7-key-differences">Water Bugs Vs. Cockroaches (7 Key Differences)</h2>
<h3 id="1-appearance"><strong>1. Appearance</strong></h3>
<p>**Waterbug **
The length of a giant waterbug is about 3.8 cm (1.5 inches), and its the one that is mostly confused for a cockroach. Some waterbugs can reach up to 10 cm (4 inches) long. They have an oval-shaped body and three pairs of legs.
The forelimbs are modified to have sharp claws, which they use to pierce and hold on to their prey. Waterbugs are dark brown, almost resembling a dead leaf. They related:
Mold vs. Mildew
.
**Cockroach **
Cockroaches are also oval and possess three legs and one pair of antennae. Most cockroach species are relatively smaller than waterbugs. But at between 3.2 and 5.4 mm long, the American roach will most likely be mistaken for a waterbug.
The best way to differentiate an American roach from a waterbug is to look at the color. Generally, American roaches are reddish-brown in color. They also have a distinct yellowish coloration on their head resembling figure 8.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKWovPWl1O4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKWovPWl1O4</a></p>
<h3 id="2-location"><strong>2. Location</strong></h3>
<p>**Cockroaches **
The German and American roaches are the most common indoor cockroaches. They inhabit warm, humid, and dark places, especially where food is readily is available. You can find them in the kitchen, bathroom, near the sink, food stores, and cabinet, among other places.
Roaches
live near wet places
because their body requires water regularly. But since they are not aquatic, they wont get into the water. Only a few species of roaches are known to survive underwater for long.
<strong>Waterbugs</strong> Water bugs live
outdoors, especially in water or wet places. Thats where they get their name from. Stagnant water, leaking pipes, or wet surfaces around the compound make ideal places for them to thrive and reproduce.
Their ability to adapt to aquatic conditions is made possible by a respiratory tube (siphon). Now and then, they stick the siphon out of the water to breathe in some air, which they store in a small chamber.
It is this air that they use to breathe when hunting for prey under the water. Since only a small amount of air can be stored at a time, they regularly come near-surface to refill.</p>
<h3 id="3-life-cycle"><strong>3. Life Cycle</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cockroaches</strong>
Roaches develop from
eggs to larvae
than to adults. Depending on the species, females lay 10-40 eggs. The eggs are contained in a protective casing, usually referred to as an ootheca.
The egg incubation period ranges between 20 and 60 days for different roach species. Adult roaches can live up to 180 days.
**Waterbugs **
A giant waterbug goes through egg-nymph-adult stages. A female lays eggs on things, just able the water level. Eggs hatch into adults within 1 or 2 months, and the adults live for 3 to 4 years.</p>
<h3 id="4-diet"><strong>4. Diet</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cockroaches</strong>
The diet of a cockroach mainly consists of food substances, especially those containing sugar, fat, and starch. Thats why they like clinging around your kitchen. However, in the absence of food substances, theyll feed on almost anything, including decaying matter, hair, dead skin, small insects, books, and so on.
In insects&rsquo; case, they dont go hunting but will eat any insect they find on their way.
**Waterbugs **
Unlike roaches, waterbugs are omnivorous insects that survive mainly by eating aquatic insects, small reptiles, tiny fish, and amphibians. They kill their prey by hunting it down and sucking their internal organs using a digesting enzyme.

<h3 id="5-temperament"><strong>5. Temperament</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waterbugs</strong>
Waterbugs are aggressive hunters of small aquatic creatures like fish, snails, frogs, etc. However, they wont generally pursue
humans to bite
them. They only
bite humans
when they few threatened or when you invade their habitats.
If you walk in their territories barefooted, you may get a toe bite from waterbugs. For this reason, waterbugs are sometimes called toe-biters. Such bites are very painful, but they wont make you ill.
**Cockroaches **
Cockroaches are timid creatures and will always scamper for safety whenever exposed to light. Therefore, its scarce to sustain a
cockroach bite
. However, they can bite as they go about looking for food, especially when theres no alternative food.
You dont have to be scared of roach bites! These creatures are always running away for humans or light.</p>
<h3 id="6-pest-threat"><strong>6. Pest Threat</strong></h3>
<p>**Cockroaches **
Cockroaches are considered a pest threat when they invade our homes. They tend to contaminate our
food as they scavenge for something to eat
. Cockroaches are carriers of the salmonella bacteria, which may be transmitted to humans when they touch their food.
Salmonella&rsquo;s symptoms appear within 12-72 hours from the time of infection and may include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on.
Roaches can also cause asthma through their fecal excrement and molted skin.
**Waterbugs **
Waterbugs prefer outdoor conditions because they are attracted to dampness. However, they might come into your house in search of food or warmth. Although they are not known to cause a lot of havoc, they can also be considered pests when they get to your house.
Unlike cockroaches, waterbugs are not associated with infections. The main concern with waterbugs is the risk of bites and asthma.

<h2 id="how-to-eradicate-cockroaches-vs-waterbugs"><strong>How to Eradicate Cockroaches Vs. Waterbugs</strong></h2>
<p>Waterbugs are more comfortable to eradicate than cockroaches. That because roaches tend to be invasive and quickly adapt to the environment for their survival. They also live in large colonies and reproduce rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="1-roach-baits-">**1. Roach Baits� **</h3>
<p>However, both pests can be eradicated using the same methods. Below are some of the most effective remedies for cockroaches and waterbugs.
Roach baits
provide an easy and convenient way of eradicating waterbugs and cockroaches. The
best roach baits
contain attractants that lure the insects to the insecticide. Most of the popular roach bait brands contain a slow-acting ingredient that kills insects slowly.
This technology ensures that the insects have enough time to share the poison with the rest of the colony. Such roach baits or
roach foggers
will be ideal for eliminating a whole colony of roaches or waterbugs.
Roach baits can be placed on various locations depending on their type. For instance, roach motels are ideal for low-laying places such as beneath the furniture. Roach gels are suitable for areas above the surface, such as on walls and along baseboards.</p>
<h3 id="2-roach-spray"><strong>2. Roach Spray</strong></h3>
<p>Roach sprays
can be used to kill and repel roaches and waterbugs. Most of the
best roach killers
come as insecticide concentrates, which require diluting water and sprayed directly on the affected areas.</p>
<h3 id="3-boric-acid"><strong>3. Boric Acid</strong></h3>
<p>The boric
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/harris-boric-acid-roach-powder-with-lure-review/">acid powder can be spread on the affected areas to kill roaches</a>
and waterbugs. This powder exists as microscopic particles that can break through the insects exoskeleton, causing dehydration.
You can also make a solution by mixing the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">boric acid</a>
powder with water. This solution can be applied by sprinkling or by using a spray bottle.</p>
<h3 id="4-vinegar"><strong>4. Vinegar</strong></h3>
<p>Vinegar can be used as a natural method for repelling
roaches and waterbugs. Make a vinegar solution and spray on the affected areas to repel these creatures.
Although it wont kill them, it forces them out of place and deters them from coming back. However, due to its short-lasting effect, you need to apply regularly to keep these creatures at bay.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-waterbugs"><strong>How to Prevent Waterbugs</strong></h2>
<p>Waterbugs will thrive in your compound and eventually find their way into your house. So, the best thing to do is to eliminate all possible avenues for breeding and thriving. Getting rid of wet conditions denies waterbugs a place to thrive and breed. Below are some steps you can follow to inhibit their survival.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you suspect that you have awaterbug infestation, ensure that all possible water pools inside the house are drained. These include pet water vessels, flower vessels, sink, and so on.</li>
<li>Get rid of pools of water around the compound. These may include rainwater collection vessels, birdbaths, and ground holes. For ground holes, you can fill them with soil.</li>
<li>If its raining, ensure that the flowing water does not get blocked by debris or items on your compound. The idea here is to reduce the ability of water to pool around.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-cockroaches"><strong>How to Prevent Cockroaches</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches come to your house in search of food, water, and warmth. So, effective prevention measures must be geared towards eliminating anything that attracts roaches. Below are some
tips for preventing
cockroach infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your house clean and free from spilled food or crumbs.</li>
<li>Any cooked food should be kept in covered vessels or the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Always keep your utensils clean.</li>
<li>Uncooked food should be locked in an adequately sealed store.</li>
<li>Dispose of garbage regularly.</li>
<li>Dustbins should have tight-fitting lids.</li>
<li>Clean your sink after use to eliminate food particles</li>
<li>Clean your bathroom and kitchen with a disinfectant</li>
<li>Do not leave pools of water in your kitchen, bathroom, or any other place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">Water bugs</a>
and cockroaches exhibit several similarities that might make it difficult to differentiate. This guide makes it very easy to differentiate the two common household pests.
One notable difference is the presence of sharp claws in waterbugs, which is not the case with cockroaches. Correct pest identification enables you to embark on an effective eradication method.</p>

      <description>Bed bugs</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs/)
(Cimex lectularius) are a fact of life, particularly after
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/ddt-brief-history-and-status">states banned DDT</a>
for its toxicity to humans. So, are bed bugs caused by dirty homes or living quarters? Well, NO!
You&rsquo;ll also find bed bugs in clean environs like high-end quarters and 5-star hotels. So, what
causes bed bugs
?
The short answer is that
bed bugs are caused
by traveling in bed bugs and infested places or acquiring second-hand furniture and mattresses. Bed bugs will hitchhike your luggage, clothing, and legs to suck blood. They&rsquo;re flat-bodied and wingless  it measures 5 to 7 mm.
[bctt tweet=&ldquo;What Causes Bed Bugs?&rdquo; username=&quot;@pestpolicy&quot;]
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Killer for Bed Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Let&rsquo;s get started!
<em>But first</em>
,
here are the signs of bed bugs:
reddish fecal matter, is there a sweet-musty odor?, crushed bedbugs  youll see blood smears, light-brown bed bug skin casting, and white eggs (small in size).</p>
<h2 id="details-what-causes-bed-bugs-causes-and-symptoms">Details: What Causes Bed Bugs? Causes and Symptoms</h2>
<h3 id="1-buying-used-and-infested-furniture">1. Buying Used and Infested Furniture</h3>
<p>You can buy and carry a piece of second-hand furniture to your home or business for cheap. But the bed bugs and
their babies
from the garage sales aren&rsquo;t easy to control.
Equally,
rented furniture may carry bed bugs
if their origin was a place that was infested by the blood-sucking insects. This is particularly common if pest-inspection is not done right.
Sadly,
bed bugs are hardy pests that&rsquo;ll live
for months after taking a full blood meal. Therefore, segregating the infested furniture won&rsquo;t help
get rid of the bed bugs
.
Therefore, for any of us renters and homeowners out here, we&rsquo;ll need to rightly
inspect &amp; treat, for bed bugs
, any old furniture you&rsquo;re to bring home.
<em>How to Treating Used Furniture for Bed Bugs�</em>
To prevent or control the bed bugs, you can use either chemical (
insecticide - like sprays
) or non-chemical ways. But be patient as the eradication may require several treatment cycles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam clean and vacuumall the old furniture and mattress  including the box-spring cracks.�You can usefoggers or bombsthat are approved for killing bed bugs.</li>
<li>Clean the dirt and clutter thats lying around the rooms  this will help cut the number oflocations that the bed bugscan hide.</li>
<li>Also, examine the second-hand furniture for cracks and holes  youll need to seal and caulk these to kill the bed bugs,their eggs, and babies.</li>
<li>Next, treat the bedbug-infested mattress or furniture using heat for about 15 to 30 minutes. If its a fabric, you can use a clothes dryer at medium-high temperatures.</li>
<li>But, you can bag and launder the second-hand items at about 120 F. For box-spring and mattress, youll need to encase them.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-travelling---bed-bugs-hitchhike-clothes-and-suitcases">2. Travelling - Bed Bugs Hitchhike Clothes and Suitcases</h3>
<p>Besides the loss of luggage and food poisoning, most
travelers worry even more about travel bugs and bed bugs
! Bed bugs re-emerged and continued spreading after the banning of DDT.
While traveling, you can pick up bed bugs from hotels and resorts, libraries, movie theaters, retail stores, hospitals, universities, and colleges.
However, the bugs may also hitchhike your clothes either in private homes or other business premises.
In fact, a recent
<a href="https://www.npmapestworld.org/default/assets/File/newsroom/magazine/2015/nov-dec_2015.pdf">NPMA&rsquo;s case study</a>
reported that 75% of the respondents had an encounter with bed bugs in motels and hotels.
<em>How to Prevent and Control Bed Bugs while Travelling�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>First, inspect the hotel room todetect any signs of bed bugs. I note that for this, youll require just a good flashlight. So, examine luggage racks, the headboard, and mattress. Check the mattress seams for signs of spots and stains  change room/ hotel and notify the management.</li>
<li>Inspect the chairs. Sofas and behind beds headboard. This must happen first before starting unpacking. Any<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like/">bed bugs signs</a>will prove enough to change room/ hotel and notify the management.</li>
<li>Avoid changing to a room directly above or next to the oneinfested by bed bugs. Notably, bed bugs will readily hitchhike through wall sockets, luggage, and housekeeping carts to the next room.</li>
<li>Next, during room entry or exit, place your luggage on the luggage racks when youre unpacking or packing. So, dont place the luggage on the rooms floor or even the bed  further let the luggage be very far from the bed.</li>
<li>During your stay in the hotel, enclose your suitcase in some good protective cover or trash bag so that the bed bugs wont hitchhike waiting for you to move with them.</li>
<li>When you arrive home, unpack the language directly into the washing machine while also conducting a thorough inspection. Thehigh temperatures in the dryer will kill the bed bugs.</li>
<li>Clean and dry all the clothes you had during the trip and even those that werent worn or those you purchased on your way home.</li>
<li>Finally, vacuum the suitcase and ensure you store it in the garage or basement  or ensure its a long-distance from your bedroom.</li>

<h3 id="3-dirty-or-clean---bed-bugs-dont-care">3. Dirty or Clean? - Bed Bugs Don&rsquo;t Care!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a fact
<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-are-these-tiny-black-bugs-in-my-house-1968030">bed bugs don&rsquo;t give a fish if you&rsquo;re dirty or clean</a>
. As you already know,
bed bugs mainly feed blood from humans or animals
.
Therefore,
bed bugs will remain in the house
or other premises, be they clean or dirty, provided the host is available - the bed bugs will easily take their blood meal.
So, don&rsquo;t lie to yourself. Wealth won&rsquo;t help you
against bed bug
attacks; also, poverty isn&rsquo;t a ticket for getting a bed bug infestation. However, it&rsquo;s also a fact that poor people could lack the finances to
prevent or control bed bug
infestations.</p>
<h3 id="4-bed-bugs-will-hide-inclutter">4. Bed bugs will hide inClutter</h3>
<p>Clutter forms an excellent
hiding place
for bed bugs - this will include switch plates, wallpapers, baseboards, furniture, beds.�Therefore, reducing the clutter will guarantee that the bugs won&rsquo;t spread.
Further, it would help if you did not carry objects to a non-infested area from the already infected area. Sadly, if you do the contrary, the bloodsuckers will quickly move around, hiding in clothes and furniture.
Ensure to throw all the bed, bug-infested objects into some plastic trash bags. Also, ensure that you take the plastic bags when it&rsquo;s full of infested items. Don&rsquo;t throw clothes on the bed or the floor - discard the items you no longer wear.
Have plastic boxes to replace the cardboard boxes you have. Notably, cardboards are a great hiding place for the
blood-sucking bugs - bed bugs
. Further, throw away any newspapers and magazines lying around.
Sadly, a mature and fertilized female bed bug will
lay about 200 to 250 eggs
in its life. So, definitely, any clutter will benefit the bed bug as they reproduce and grow their babies. Get rid of the annoying clutter now!</p>
<h3 id="5-bed-bugs-love-high-human-traffic">5. Bed bugs Love High Human Traffic</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in an area with high human traffic - you should be worried since the bugs will easily hitch-hike humans in military barracks, motels and hotels, homeless shelters, dormitories, and apartment buildings.
Therefore, for all the large number of people you&rsquo;ll see entering and exiting a location, there is an even higher risk of bringing and leaving a few bed bugs, their eggs, or babies.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>First,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs mainly hide</a>
in closets, second-hand furniture, upholstery, upholstery, bed frames, box springs, and mattresses seams.�But as weve noted, bed bugs are caused by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">old- furniture and second-hand mattresses</a>
, infested luggage while on international travels.</p>

<ul>
<li>This will in a great way help minimize their presence and also<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live/">control any further infestation</a>.
That said and done, this article provides us with necessary information on how to deal with these pantry bugs.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-causes-pantry-bugs-what-you-need-to-know">What Causes Pantry Bugs?-What You Need To Know.</h2>
<p>The most common cause of pantry bugs infestation is brought processed foods and dry foods into your house. This dry food could be, grains, cereals, fruits, vegetables, nuts, bran and others in your store.</p>
<ul>
<li>Processed foods like floor, chocolate, spaghetti, macaroni, bread, cookies, cheese, and candies are also possible attraction points.</li>
<li>Their infestation can occur either at the store or in your kitchen and therefore the need to constantly check on the packaging.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-cereal-and-grains-">**1. Cereal and grains **</h3>
<p>As earlier stated, bugs come into our house because they are looking for food. It is hard to find them if there is nothing to eat. Cereals like maize, rice, barley, wheat among others mostly attract weevils and beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, weevils infest open cereals and grains where they lay eggs and continue in their multiplication.</li>
<li>They feed on these cereals where they lay eggs inside the grains where their life cycle starts. Their larvae stage eats and develops in the grain before the metamorphosis into adults.
Idianmeal moth, rice weevil, beetle, lay hundreds of eggs in the infested food making it inconsumable. The damage by these bugs is more of contamination than the food they consume.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-flour-mix-">**2. Flour mix� **</h3>
<p>Flour mix and other processed foods are very susceptible to attack by
floor weevils, wheat bugs, rice bugs and flour
. They are also visible on pasta, cakes, and any other mixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their destruction of flour and other foods leaves web-like traces, larvae and eggs making them inconsumable.</li>
<li>Some other times, you will also notice tiny brown insects on your floor as a sign of their infestation.
Among the many reasons why these bugs attack your flour is also keeping in humid and moist conditions. The other reason is leaving flour and other foods open and exposed to the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-other-processed-foods-">**3. Other processed foods **</h3>
<p>Spaghetti, noodles, biscuits and cookies, pet food, powder milk, processed chicken and fish among others are also subject to attack by these bugs.
If you have any of them in your house, keeping them open and disposed of is an invitation to the bugs.
Another possible invitation for
pantry bugs is dirt
. Though you may doubt this most pantries will thrive where the kitchen is poorly cleaned.</p>
<ul>
<li>That unemptied litter bin can easily attract the bugs and before you know it, your whole kitchen is full of bugs.
There are favourite foods that will draw them from miles away into your kitchen? Lets have a close look at what each of these foods will attract.

<h3 id="what-are-these-common-pantry-bugs-in-the-kitchen"><strong>What are these common pantry bugs in the kitchen?</strong></h3>
<p>There are certain bugs that you are most likely to find in your kitchen as compared to others. Some of these include beetles, Idianmeal moths, rice/grain weevil among others.</p>
<h3 id="1-bean-and-rice-weevils-">**1. Bean and Rice Weevils **</h3>
<p>Though there are very many weevil species, the most notorious pantry bug weevils are bean and rice weevils.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you find Small holes in the beans or rice grain, its already a sign of infestation by these weevils
One similarity with these weevils is that they both attack cereals and lay their eggs inside the grains and cereals.
<strong>But their differences are;</strong>
Rice weevil attacks, corn, rice cereals, wheat, dried fruits, apples, pears while bean weevil commonly attacks beans and peas.
In size, rice weevils are slightly bigger than bean weevils.
Also, rice weevils have a snout while bean weevil doesnt.
Bean weevils have a light brown colour and are oval-shaped while rice weevils are white and slender in shape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-idianmeal-moth"><strong>2. Idianmeal Moth</strong></h3>
<p>This is most probably the most visible pantry bug in our kitchen.� Unlike the weevils, the moths show up in your kitchen when searching for the best site for mating and lay their eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their most destructive stage is the larvae which are easy to find on flour, cereals, rice, nuts, and dried fruits among others.
The larvae leave behind a trail of webbing, poop and dead skin making it hard to consume the infested food. As the larvae mature and turn into moths that can be easily spotted flying around.
Though the food infested by these moths is not harmful, it is also not good for consumption and should be disposed of immediately.

<h3 id="3-beetles-">**3. Beetles **</h3>
<p>There are different species of beetles that you are likely to find in your kitchen. Flour beetle, drugstore beetle are the most common in our kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find these beetles on flour, grains, nuts and other cereals.
They poop and leave behind excretion that causes a foul smell on them making them hard to eat. They also create moulds on your food.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-do-i-get-rid-of-bugs-in-my-kitchen"><strong>How do I get rid of bugs in my kitchen?</strong></h3>
<p>There are different methods that you can
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-pantry-moths/">use to control pantry bugs</a>
in the kitchen. Most of these methods are more on preventing bug infestation than control
<strong>Check for open food packages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>open food is susceptible to infestation by these bugs. Whether it&rsquo;s deliberate opening or accidental opening. Food packaging should be properly and tightly sealed at all times.
<strong>Cleaning your kitchen-</strong>
most pantry bugs thrive in dirt, moist and humid environments. With proper cleaning and disposal of kitchen garbage, you eliminate their chances of survival in your kitchen.
<strong>First in, first out protocol-</strong>
to avoid packed food going bad in your store or kitchen, use the food bought first before you can embark on the last bought food.</li>
<li>On the same, use the food with closer expiry first as compared to those with a longer expiry date.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are still wondering what causes pantry bugs, now you know. Next time you have that packaged food, cereals and vegetables ensure they dont have holes that can cause easy entry of these bugs into your kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining proper kitchen hygiene with routine cleaning, the timely garbage disposal is among other things that you can do to control bugs entry into your kitchen.</li>
<li>That said and done, if an infestation occurs, use traps and other techniques to rid them.
Though the bugs are barely harmful, they should not be entertained within the pantry area</li>

      <description>Bed bugs have</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs have
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-eats-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">many predators</a>
.</p>
<p>So might wonder that <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs eat a variety of foods - from human blood, skin or the crumbs of food. So, what do bed bugs eat?
<strong>Summary: Most bed bugs species mainly feed on blood of mammals like human. For example, Cimex lectularius only feed on human blood.�</strong>
<strong>NB: Bed bug lack teeth and tongue for chewing and swallowing food - and thus they&rsquo;ll only eat blood.</strong></p>
<h3 id="does-food-attract-bed-bugs"><strong>Does Food Attract Bed Bugs?</strong></h3>
<p>When I say food, I am referring to the food we eat. Many household pests such roaches, mice and rats will hang around your house as long as theres something for them to eat. On the contrary, bed bugs arent attracted to any of the food we eat.</p>
<p>Thats why it is very rare to see bed bugs in the kitchen. Their most preferred places are bedrooms and living rooms where people spend most of their times.</p>
<p>It is common to find cockroach eggs on your food and inside the places where food is kept. However, bed bugs will not lay their eggs on food since they have no business there. They lay their eggs near their host especially under the mattress and the seams of sofa set.</p>
<h3 id="how-often-do-bed-bugs-feed"><strong>How Often Do Bed Bugs Feed?</strong></h3>
<p>The frequency with which bed bugs eat depends partly on the prevailing temperatures and partly on the availability of food. And though their feeding schedule is quite unpredictable, adult bed bugs feed at least once a week when food is readily available.</p>
<p>Basically bed bugs will require a blood meal to produce eggs and to survive in each of the 5 successive nymph stages. However, in the absence of a host, bed bugs can survive for a very long time.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that under favourable conditions, bed bugs can go without a meal for up to 400 days. However, when the conditions are unfavourable, they can barely survive 3-5 months without a meal.</p>
<p>Bed bugs have the advantage of a waxy exoskeleton that keeps them from excessive dehydration. And similar to many other insects their body requires very little water. Another reason why bed bugs stay long without feeding is because most of the nutrients they get from blood are meant for growth rather than for survival.</p>
<p>That means more nutrients are required as bed bug transforms from one stage to another. Once the lifecycle is complete, bed bugs feed less frequently.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, you cant eradicate bed bugs by vacating your house for a long time so as to starve them. People have inhabited their houses for more than one year but the bed bugs reappear once they return.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-on-each-other"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed On Each Other?</strong></h3>
<p>Some people have resulted to starving bed bugs by vacating their houses for more than one year only to return and the bed bugs resurface. Does it mean that the bed bugs survive by feeding on each other while youre away?</p>
<p>Not at all. In the absence of a human host or other hosts such as pets or bats, bed bugs will survive without their favourite meal for up to 400 days. They lack teeth and tongue for chewing and swallowing food. So, they wont even feed on the food crumbs or any food that you left in the house.</p>
<p>Bed bugs feed only on blood from humans and warm blooded animals. Instead of blood, a bed bugs body contains a fluid known as hemolpymh in which all the internal tissues are bathed. Since hemolpymh does not contain haemoglobin, it not possible for bed bugs to feed on it.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-on-other-animals"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed On Other Animals?</strong></h3>
<p>Bed bugs and especially Cimex lectularius have adapted to feed on human blood and blood from other warm blooded animals. In your absence, bed bugs will lodge themselves on your pets, rodents and other warm blooded animals around. However, they prefer human host to other warm blooded animals because of the following reasons.</p>
<p>Human skin is not covered by fur, meaning it is easier for bed bugs to pierce and feed. In contrast, the fur in other warm blooded animals, deters bed bugs from easily targeting them as hosts.</p>
<p>In addition bed bugs like to bite you when youre sound asleep. Unlike other animals, humans wont respond to bed bug bites when they are asleep. Pets and other mammals tend to respond with haste to bed bug bites. Thus bed bugs will find easier to bite humans compared to other animals.</p>
<h3 id="are-bed-bugs-attracted-to-certain-blood-types"><strong>Are Bed Bugs Attracted To Certain Blood Types?</strong></h3>
<p>While there are speculations and publications purporting bed bugs are attracted to certain blood types, there is no proof to ascertain that possibility. Your blood may fall within any of these types O+, O-, A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, or AB-. However, theres no reliable indication that bed bugs are attracted to one or two of these blood types.</p>
<p>New research has however shown that bed bugs prefer blood that has less alcohol concentration. That means a person who has been taking alcohol will have less bed bug bites compared to a person who has not been drinking.</p>
<p>However, I would not advice that you knock a few glasses of your favourite alcohol before you retire to bed. On the positive, this observation can help scientists in developing new ways of eradicating bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-eat-anything-else-apart-from-blood"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Eat Anything Else Apart From Blood?</strong></h3>
<p>The persistence of many household pests in your home depends on the availability of food. For example, roaches and rats will hang around as long as there are food crumbs and trash they can feed on.</p>
<p>Unlike other household pests, bed bugs solely depend on blood. Since they lack teeth and tongue, they wont feed on anything else apart from blood. They use their straw like mouth to pierce your skin and suck blood.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-eat-insects"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Eat Insects?</strong></h3>
<p>Studies have shown that some pests can be used to feed on some of the most nagging pests in our homes. For example, some species of cockroaches and spiders have been documented to feed on bed bugs for many years. But can bed bugs feed on insects or other small creatures?</p>
<p>Well, bed bugs will not eat insects or other small creatures. Bed bugs will only survive on blood from warm blooded animals. Their mouth parts are designed like a straw, meaning that they can only suck. They neither chew nor swallow food. Thus, it is in order to conclude that bed bugs cannot insects.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-on-wood"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed On Wood?</strong></h3>
<p>Bed bugs like hiding in wooden furniture especially in your bed. Thats why people often replace their wooden beds with metal beds as a way of eradicating bed bugs. So, does this suggest that bed bugs feed on wood?</p>
<p>The answer is no. Unlike metal furniture, the configuration of wooden furniture allows bed bugs to hide and avoid human interference. Although you might see bed bugs coming out of holes in wood, these holes belong to other insects like termites.</p>
<p>Metal furniture discourages bed bugs because therere usually few or no hiding places for bed bugs. Thus they feel very exposed and relocated to safer places.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-on-your-hair"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed On Your Hair?</strong></h3>
<p>If you have had a severe bed bug infestation, you might have suffered bites all over your body including your head. So, you might be worried that these creatures are feeding on your hair.</p>
<p>No need to freak! Bed bugs wont feed on your hair. Only cockroaches are known to eat hair and dead skin. Your hair only acts as a habitat for parasites such as mites, fleas and bed bugs, where they hide as they feed on blood on your head.</p>
<p>Bed bugs in particular will find it easier to crawl and suck blood on a bald head than a hairy head. They get entangled in hairy hair.</p>
<h3 id="for-how-long-do-bed-bugs-feed"><strong>For</strong>** How Long Do Bed Bugs Feed?**</h3>
<p>Basically bed bugs will spend the least time possible to complete a meal to avoid being detected by you or a natural predator. They survive by feeding and retreating to their safe-havens without being noticed.</p>
<p>They dont waste time searching for particular areas to bite. Once they locate the nearest area, they pierce the skin and suck blood until they are satisfied. Depending on its size and the last time it had a meal, a bed bug might bite you severally before satisfaction. In such instances, the bed bug bites in a straight line pattern in order to save time.</p>
<p>Once satisfied, they retreat to their hiding place, usually in crevices below the mattress. They take approximately 10 minutes to come out of hiding, get their meal and return into hiding. This is quite a short time for you to realize especially when youre in deep asleep. In fact their saliva contains analgesic which they use to ease the pain of their bite.</p>
<p>Ten minutes is the time taken by a single bed bug to feed. That means you are likely to experience multiple bites, as individual bed bugs in a colony come out to feed at different times.</p>
<p>Naturally, a bed bug will feed at least once a week. So, if you have a huge infestation, chances are that you and your family will suffer bed bug bites each and every night.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-during-the-day"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed During The Day?</strong></h3>
<p>It is usually assumed that bed bugs are nocturnal. Not at all! Their feeding schedule does not depend on the time of the day. So you expect them to come out even during the day whenever there is a host they can feed on.</p>
<p>Similar to other animals, bed bugs feed whenever they feel hungry. That means they will come out to look for a meal regardless of the time of the day. If they cant find a host to feed on, they will of course go back into hiding and wait for the right chance.</p>
<p>However, they prefer to feed at night and spend most part of the day hiding. This is a survival tactic they have adapted, to avoid being detected by humans and natural predators.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-at-night---with-lights-on"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed At Night - With Lights On?</strong></h3>
<p>The preference for feeding arises from two scenarios. The need to and the availability of a still host. While bed bugs survive by coming out in darkness, they wont skip a meal simply because theres light. They take meals when necessary and when conditions are right.</p>
<p>Youve already seen that bed bugs come out to feed even during the day. The same applies when you sleep at night and leave the lights on. Youre motionless during sleep. So, if bed bugs feel like feeding, they will come out and feed on you even if the lights are on.</p>
<p>Naturally, bed bugs will avoid light to evade possible threats from humans and natural predators. Initially, you may sustain few bites when you sleep with the lights on. However, these creatures will feel starved and come to feed on you regardless of the lights.</p>
<p>If you have a large infestation, bed bugs will come out to feed in broad daylight and at night even when lights are on. This is because, the larger the infestation, the more the sequences of feeding from individual bed bugs. That means, at any given time, you have bed bugs that want to feed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You have seen that bed bugs will eat nothing else apart from blood from warm-blooded animals. So, when they get into your house, their only source of food will be you and your family including pets.</p>
<p>Therefore, its advisable to prevent bed bugs or act quickly to eradicate them whenever they appear in your house.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the question, what do bed bugs look like? Bed bugs are wingless, oval-shaped, flat, and small-bodied bugs - adults have wing vestiges (the wing pads) - but
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)-fly/">bed bugs can&rsquo;t fly</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The brown-colored or orange adult <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bug tends to turn red once they suck blood. On size, they&rsquo;re about 4 - 5 mm (or 3/16 an inch) - and they somehow slow.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>The oval-shaped and six-legged bugs will also appear relatively flattened on their top when they&rsquo;ve not sucked blood recently.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bed bugs can be seen with your naked eyes (you&rsquo;ll get them in crevices and cracks) but their nymphs could be too small - check their hiding places.�</strong>
Further, the nymphs that have hatched recently will have the size of a pin&rsquo;s head (or apple seed) - they&rsquo;ll be tan or white in color until their feed on blood.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-will-i-identify-thosebed-bugs">How Will I identify those<strong>Bed Bugs?�</strong></h2>
<p>**Hiding Locations **</p>
<ul>
<li>Clothing, on pets, curtains, mattresses, seams, bedding, beds, and other furniture - they hide at day time.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will hide both in dirty or clean spaces - and thus cleaning will not fully prevent these bugs.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re excellent in hiding and hence you might only notice their bites</li>
<li>Bed bugs cause red &amp; itchy welts on human skin - but they don&rsquo;t spread diseases. They find humans through the CO2 smell from their respiration.</li>
<li>The bugs bite to inject saliva into humans (painless bite) - while also producing that anticoagulant and anesthetic effect. Its allergic reaction causes bumps that are raised.
**Color - **
The reddish-brown or orange bugs will change to red once they&rsquo;ve had their blood meal. As the bugs continue digesting the blood, they&rsquo;ll change to paler orange.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will feed on blood from humans (their best choice) among other warm-blooded animals like cats and dogs.</li>
<li>But they can also remain dormant for about 6 - 18 months without sucking blood.
<strong>Shape -</strong>
Tapered and oval body shape - it&rsquo;ll remain flat on their body shape until they&rsquo;re full of blood.</li>
<li>These flat bodies enable the bugs to effortlessly squeeze themselves into tiny cracks &amp; crevices - including spaces that measure the width of a credit card.</li>
<li>Bed bugs undertake repeated bites in their single feeding session.
**Shape - **
Lenght of 4 - 5 mm (or 3/16 an inch)</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll only see bed bugs in the daytime during food scarcity (fewer blood meals) or if there are heavy infestations - otherwise the bugs are mainly active at night.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll get bed bugs in homes, motels, and hotels - and thus knowhow to vacuum for bed bugs.

</ul>
<h2 id="signs-or-indicators-of-bed-bug-problems">Signs or Indicators of Bed Bug Problems</h2>
<p>Below are the key indicators of the bed bug problems you&rsquo;ll get in your spaces.
<strong>1. Bed Bug Bites</strong>
-Bed bug bites may be
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">confused with mosquito bites</a>
. Bed bugs will bite humans on multiple sites that are close together - this differentiates them from mosquito bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bug bites mainly happen on exposed skin - especially on the shoulders, arms, necks, and upper body.</li>
<li>When bitten, you&rsquo;ll experience swelling, red welts, or itching - but it might not be obvious for some people or for several days.
**2. Fecal stains **</li>
<li>Bed bugs can also become evident when you notice their excrement (or fecal stains) - they&rsquo;ll appear brown, black, or red - mounds or stains.</li>
<li>The black feces that create stains are mainly digested blood - and will dry to create that raised spot.</li>
<li>The fecal spots will also appear like feces from the German roaches - check theseroach killers for apartments- but they&rsquo;ll be smooth-textured as opposed to being rough.
<strong>3. Molted exoskeletons</strong></li>
<li>Bed bugs will molt or drop their exoskeleton/ shell as they progress between the larval stages - the exoskeleton is light-colored and translucent.</li>
<li>Check the rooms or around the box spring to see if the area has molted bed bug exoskeleton - this is indicative of population growth among the bed bugs.</li>
<li>Once the bugs feed on that blood meal, they&rsquo;ll begin growing and will finally molt to develop to another stage. Molting allows them to grow larger in body size.</li>
<li>On color, these exoskeleton shells will appear lighter-colored but will be empty - but they may have different colors and sizes.
<strong>4. Physical evidence</strong>
(
flashlight inspection
) - Bed bugs can also be identified with physical evidence - being present in carpeting, upholstery crevices, headboard, box spring, on the bed frame, and mattress.</li>
<li>For heavily infested spaces, you can find the bed bugs around the coach or chair seams, oncurtain folds, and under the cushions.</li>

<p>Bed bugs are great hitchhikers - but they
won&rsquo;t jump or fly, unlikefleas
. Bed bugs don&rsquo;t love hiding in the human body and thus you&rsquo;ll find that on various house objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, you&rsquo;ll simply require to check the cardboard boxes, furniture, and luggage.</li>
<li>Bed bugs may equally survive in your luggage on a plane - and thus they&rsquo;ll easily spread over many world locations.
Further, check on various second-hand items like furniture - these may carry bed bugs into your home.</li>
<li>From your traveling, you can also carry bedbugs from your various motels or hotels - especially for the low-budget hotels.</li>
<li>These low-quality hotels tend to have high guest turnover - and thus there is a high possibility of some dropping bed bugs.</li>
<li>Thus, if the bed bug that&rsquo;s dropped is a female and also fertilized - it&rsquo;ll lay eggs leading to the major population growth of the bugs.
Since bed bugs tend to spread easily, you&rsquo;ll find these bugs in many places.</li>
<li>Such places you may pick the bed bugs include concert halls, movie theaters, buses, planes, airport lounges, bars, and coffee shops.</li>
<li>Further, for the city, you can find the bed bugs inlibrary books.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identifying--treating-bites">Identifying &amp; Treating bites</h2>
<p>To identify bed bugs - you should know that they are a swollen and red bump that has a dark center.</p>
<ul>
<li>These bites are grouped together and in a line - they can have hives and blisters.
Bed bugs will be on any of your body parts that they&rsquo;ll mainly be on the exposed body parts (especially while you&rsquo;re sleeping) such as face, legs, arms, and hands.</li>
<li>The bite areas could appear like flea or mosquito bites - and they&rsquo;re slightly swollen.
You&rsquo;ll notice the bites will be aligned in a single straight line or in groupings - but flea bites will be on the ankles or lower legs while the mosquito bites will appear more sporadic.</li>
<li>However, other individuals won&rsquo;t be allergic to the bite from bed bugs and hence won&rsquo;t show bite signs.
<strong>Treating bites�</strong>
To treat the bed bug bites, you&rsquo;ll use a myriad of methods - but you may require a few weeks to achieve great results.
<strong>1. Ice Pack</strong></li>
<li>Besides using those over-the-counter treatments, ice packs can help relieve the pain from bed bug bites.</li>
<li>The ice tends to soothe the bite area - but you can also use some cold cloth or some water+baking soda paste.</li>
<li>The towel-wrapped ice will help relieve burning and itching sensations on the bite while also cutting the swelling.
<strong>2. Anti-itch Cream</strong></li>
<li>First wash the bite areas with some water + soap - this reduces itchiness and prevents further skin infection.</li>
<li>Next, to reduce the skin itchiness, apply some over-the-counter corticosteroid cream or calamine lotion onto the bed bug bite area.
**2. **
<strong>Oral medication</strong></li>
<li>Some of the approved over-the-counter (OTC) treatments for bed bug bites include hydrocortisone lotion or cream that&rsquo;ll relieve the swelling and itchiness.</li>
<li>Also, you can take some diphenhydramine (OTC antihistamine - also known as Benadryl) to help reduce the bite itchiness - but first, try some anti-itch cream.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, adult bed bugs will be oval-or flat-shaped but small and wingless (have wing pads, however) with a 4 to 5 mm length.</p>
<ul>
<li>The brown-colored bugs will turn orange or red as they feed on blood - they&rsquo;re visible with most naked eyes while the nymphs may not be visible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-do-bed-bugs-smell-like">What Do Bed Bugs Smell Like??</h2>
<p>There are many signs that an infestation of bed bugs might be present; some things you might commonly notice are blood spots and the bed bugs dropping, which appear as specks.
You may also notice that you suffer from irritation and itching as a result of these creatures. However, one of the giveaway signs that you have some unwelcome guests could be their scent - check these
bed bug nymphs
.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdntsIC2kCs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdntsIC2kCs</a>
It is more common to notice bed bugs&rsquo; odor when there is a much larger infestation; due to their small size, they need to be in a larger number for the smell to be potent enough to be detected by human nostrils.
There have been suggestions that the smell of
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef636">bed bugs</a>
can be compared to berries&rsquo; scent and has a musty yet sweet aroma. Some people have remarked that the smell is similar to the herb cilantro (or coriander, depending on where you come from).
That being said, there are various smells linked with bed bugs, and it is somewhat down to your personal ability to pick up on scents as to what you might smell. Some of the most common comparisons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotting wood</li>
<li>Must-similar to what you might smell in a damp building</li>
<li>Something along the lines of cinnamon</li>
<li>Crayons</li>
<li>Almonds</li>
<li>Stink bugs (check stink bugs vs. bed bugs)
It is quite likely that if you enter into a property where bed bugs are present with an odor, you will pick up on this right away; however, if you have an infestation in your home, you may become immune to the smell.

<h2 id="what-is-the-reason-for-bed-bugs-having-a-distinct-scent">What Is The Reason For Bed Bugs Having A Distinct Scent?</h2>
<p>There are many reasons that various
animals have an odor and the reason for bed bugs
is rather interesting. One of the main reasons is similar to a homing device.
On top of this, they will let off a scent when they are fearful; for example, when exposed to light, their bodies will react and emit a chemical that releases a scent - even for the
eggs
.
This is a defense mechanism seen in quite a few species across the animal kingdom, most famously the skunk. The bed bugs will leave their scent on their home so that they can quickly return to it later.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-best-way-to-identify-a-bed-bug-infestation">What Is The Best Way To Identify A Bed Bug Infestation?</h2>
<p>We briefly touched on how you might spot a bed bug infestation aside from their scent - e.g.,
flea bites vs. bed bugs bites
. Let&rsquo;s look in a little more detail at the signs you should be looking out for.
As we mentioned, to properly smell bed bugs, you will need to be met with a rather large gathering of these pests, so it is best to tackle the problem earlier or spot any of the following signs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The shells of bed bugs may be found on your soft furnishings or flooring.�You might find dead bed bugs.</li>
<li>You may notice that you have bite marks on your skin or find that your skin is irritated and itchy.</li>
<li>Bed bug fecal matter anddead bed bugs may be present in the home; this�is usually black, dust-like particles that will leave a red smear when rubbed or crushed.

<p>You are probably beginning to understand that the smell of bed bugs can differ significantly from person to person, but some myths surround their odor far from being truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might have heard that these creatures give off an odor of urine, but this is not true.</li>
<li>It is also said that bed bugs smell similar to mothballs, but there is no truth in this.</li>
</ul>

infestation, one of the things that you might wonder is whether the deceased
<a href="%25view_link%25">bed bug</a>
s will leave a worse odor.
The odor certainly won&rsquo;t be putrid, you may notice the scent of cilantro to begin with, but if the bug was crushed whilst still digesting a feed, you might also pick up an aroma of blood.
Another thing to be mindful of with large infestations is that the buildup of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like/">bed bug poop</a>

</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-stink-bugs-eat-food">What Do Stink Bugs Eat? Food.</h2>
<p>Stink bugs eat a lot of things in our garden and also in the house. But their favourite food is tomatoes, ears of corn, leaves, flowers, fruits and soya beans.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="1-fruits-">**1. Fruits **</h3>
<p>Stink bugs are fond of fruits especially those on trees because they are soft and sweet. They like sticking around fruits like pears,
apples
and peaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because of their soft skins that are easy to penetrate and also suck the juice and the delicacy out of it.
To most farmers, this attack by the stink bugs results in huge losses because the affected fruits cannot be sold. Infested fruits develop scars that make them hard to consume.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="3-corn"><strong>3. Corn</strong></h3>
<p>This is yet another favourite food for the stinky bugs. With corns, the bugs target the ears and the husks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like they do with other food sources, they project their needle-like mouth on the soft ear and suck the nutrients from the husk.
Infested corn appear withered and dehydrated too. For those with corn, stinky bugs can really be a menace causing huge losses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-stems-leaves-and-flowers-">**4. Stems, leaves and flowers **</h3>
<p>Apart from feeding on fruits, stink bugs are also capable of consuming other parts of the plant like leaves, stems and flowers.
The damage on orchards and farms can be extensively leading to huge losses.</p>
<h3 id="5other-pests-">5.**Other Pests **</h3>

      <description>*What does bed bug poop look like?*</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What does bed bug poop look like?</em>
First, they&rsquo;re not solid and difficult to pick up - they&rsquo;ll readily smear like toothpaste since it looks like a liquid.
<a href="https://nysipm.cornell.edu/whats-bugging-you/%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/bed-bug-faqs///">Bed bugs</a>
will feed every 5 to 10 days and numb your pain using its anesthetic saliva (
see bed bug images
). You may notice eggs,
<em>feces</em>
, and skin castings on bed or old box spring.
<strong>In summary, bed bug poop looks like tiny-spot clusters that you&rsquo;ll find on your bed. The feces are made up of digested blood - but they won&rsquo;t be red because the blood has dried. The feces appear darker, black, or rust-colored. Check quality bed bug sprays below.�</strong>

<h2 id="what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like-7-tips">What Does Bed Bug Poop Look Like? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>*When smeared on different surfaces, bed bug poop leaves some dark or pink-colored stains - mainly, it&rsquo;ll go smooth and tiny drop when not absorbed by your fabric. *

.</p>
<h3 id="1-dark-colored">1. Dark-Colored</h3>
<p>Bed bug feces will be dark-colored as it&rsquo;s composed of the host&rsquo;s blood that&rsquo;s digested - hosts include human beings and pets like cats and dogs - check for
bed bug nymphs
.
Does old bed bug
poop smear? The fecal
matter of the bed bugs
leaves some dark marks when smeared. Once
bed bugs suck blood
, bed bugs combine into clusters in mattress seams (crevices, furniture, &amp; carpets.
You&rsquo;ll rarely get bed bug feces on your sheets. The
bugs won&rsquo;t digest their blood meal fast</p>
<ul>
<li>even a few days. After feeding,
bed bugs hide
under the mattress where they&rsquo;ll digest the blood and poop.
Bed bugs don&rsquo;t catch illnesses from the bed bug poop, and hence they&rsquo;ll drop their feces everywhere - particularly on areas that they digest on under mattresses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-smooth--whatdoes-bed-bugpoop-feel-like">2. Smooth -�WhatDoes Bed BugPoop Feel Like?</h3>
<p>Further, the fecal matter is smooth - compared to the
cockroach waste
that feels very granular. The feces will smear very quickly and thus stain chairs, sofas, furniture, drapes, bed sheets, mattresses.
The bugs will drop their poop,
eggs (hatched or live)
, and skins in their hiding places in the clusters. Further, the bugs collect into a big cluster that&rsquo;ll be easy to identify.
You&rsquo;ll mainly find the bed bug feces and also bed bugs around mattress seams. The mattress tufts will be an excellent concealing area for the bugs to molt and breed, waiting to suck blood.
Therefore, I would recommend using
bed bug mattress encasements
to prevent and treat the bugs - besides treating crevices and cracks plus box springs.

<h3 id="3-does-bed-bug-feces-smell">3. Does Bed Bug Feces Smell?</h3>
<p>Bed bug feces
will be different from fecal matter from various animals - considering their smell. But the poop will have a musty smell due to having a large amount of digested blood.
It is comparable to the smell you feel to the scent of blood when you cut your skin. However, the scent of bed bug droppings will be overtaken by other bed bug smells.
Bed bugs use the harsh smells to get them around different objects - the smell will come from their harbor-age. You&rsquo;ll feel the rusty smell like
coriander from the bed bugs</p>
<ul>
<li>including under mattresses.
Further, some humans consider
moldy &amp; wet smell
that would occur when you leave wet clothes in the washer for a long time. You&rsquo;ll notice the rusty smell like that of blood.
However, you&rsquo;ll notice the smell when you get near the bed bug feces or disturb the bed bugs like if you get under the mattresses&rsquo; sheets - check
flea spray for yard
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-you-pick-bed-bug-feces">Can you Pick Bed Bug Feces?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s relatively impossible to pick up bed bug feces since they&rsquo;re liquid and not solid like human feces or droppings. The wastes are soft and liquid and hence will only smear on surfaces.
Bed bug feces will smear like
toothpaste and soak into the sheets or mattress fabric to leave a tiny stain. Further, the droppings are about the size of small crumbs, and thus it&rsquo;ll be challenging to pick them.
But any of the droppings that&rsquo;ll be allowed to lie around for a long time will dry up and thus may be easy to sweep them off. The droppings need to be resting on some non-absorbent surfaces such as wood.
However, it won&rsquo;t be essential to pick
bed bug feces to control
the bugs from your house. You&rsquo;ll need to use a cleaning solution to clean them off after soaking.</p>
<h2 id="bed-bug-feces-on-mattress">Bed Bug Feces on Mattress</h2>
<p>A bed bug will drop their feces, particularly under your mattress - and they&rsquo;ll have the same appearance as those on the bedsheets. Hence, the feces, if wet, will smear over the mattress.
However, dried
bed bug feces will get absorbed into the
mattress fabric. Further, they&rsquo;ll occur on fecal matter clusters - particularly under the mattress.
You&rsquo;ll find most of the fecal matter
around the bed bug&rsquo;s harbor-age</p>
<ul>
<li>this as noted above the sheets and mattress - they&rsquo;ll signify that bed bugs are around their living areas.
However, you&rsquo;ll also find the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bug-bombs-work/">bed bugs around zipping</a>
, buttons, or mattress piping. You may notice
bed bug shells
that drop when the bugs molt.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYoDF2Uoec">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYoDF2Uoec</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-black-spots-or-stains-on-my-sheets-frombed-bugs">Are Black Spots or Stains on my Sheets fromBed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Have you seen some black spots on your bed - well, these don&rsquo;t bed bug feces? Sure, bed bugs will leave tiny and bright stains - but they&rsquo;ll appear in a line.
The tiny bloodstain is from hosts&rsquo; blood - the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dead-bed-bugs/">bed bugs</a>
drop the blood from their mouths as they move from harbor-age. Thus, the blood is undigested and hence will be brighter than bed bug feces.
You may also notice more significant bright red stains (equally on the sheets) that&rsquo;s irregularly shaped. These stains occur when you
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">crush the bed bugs</a>
after they&rsquo;ve taken their fresh blood meal.
Further, some blood spots may happen when you crash the bed bugs as you turn and twist in your sleep. However, any other tiny black spots on your sheets may be from
fleas
.
Further,
flea dirt
or bed bug feces may equally have some black spots if they&rsquo;ve dried - so conduct the right searches to ensure that you have or don&rsquo;t have bed bugs in your home.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-up-bed-bug-droppings">How to Clean Up Bed Bug Droppings</h2>
<p><strong>Hydrogen peroxide</strong>
further uses hydrogen peroxide as it&rsquo;ll work like an oxidizer or bleaching agent to clean the bed bug feces and remove stains on your fabrics.
Using the dilute hydrogen peroxide will, besides bleaching the mattress fabric, help loosen the feces stains, and thus it&rsquo;ll be effortless to wipe them off.
<strong>Dish soap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the all-time good dish soap would be an appropriate
remedy for cleaning bed bug
feces. Soak the fabric with feces - this will loosen the fecal matter, clean, and remove mild stains.
Let feces dry - Besides, you may let the bed bug feces to rest on the surface for some time and dry. So, you&rsquo;ll only need to wipe them off before encasing the mattress finally.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, what does bed bug poop look like? In summary, the fecal matter is brown or rusty-dark colored in color - NB - something that&rsquo;s dark than the color of fresh blood.
Also,
bed bug
feces will soak in your fabrics to leave a regular and tiny stain. This will look anything like you dropped some ink drop on your bed sheet.
Finally, bed bug poop will smear on your sheets to form a shape like that created by ink stains. Read Also:

<em>Bed bugs, like cooked pea or beans, will be easy to squash. But baby bed bugs will be easier to crash - when they&rsquo;ve sucked blood.�</em>
<em>You may squash or burst bed bugs with your fingers or shoe leaving behind a red stain from the host&rsquo;s blood.�</em>

<h2 id="details-what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug">Details: What Happens When You Squish a Bed Bug?</h2>
<p>When you squash a bed bug that has freshly fed from its host, it&rsquo;ll leave blood and bloodstains on your finger. Any bed bug that hasn&rsquo;t sucked blood for some time will have a hard shell - this means that it won&rsquo;t squash easily.
But the nymph&rsquo;s exoskeleton is soft and thus makes it easy to squash.
Bed bugs only have wing pads
, and you can use Ammonia to kill bed bugs.
You can squash bed bugs unconsciously. For example, when you&rsquo;re sleeping, you can quickly squash some
bed bugs that will bite
you. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll see some large blood smears on your body - besides
bed bug bites
, clothes, and bed sheets when you wake up.

<h2 id="are-bed-bugshells-soft-or-hard">Are Bed BugShells Soft or Hard?</h2>
<p>The bed bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton (outer part of its body) is a hard casing that&rsquo;s rigid to give the insect its body structure. Bed bugs will also shed or molt their exoskeleton as they grow.
However, the bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton can&rsquo;t prevent you from squashing the bug at will. Further, the back part of the bed bug is highly flexible - this allows an easy busting when you crush the bug.
Bed bugs feed, and their backside tends to expand, allowing the insect to take in more. Therefore, the bed bug&rsquo;s rear side will expand to hold more blood, food, and water.
The bugs will pop easily when they&rsquo;ve sucked blood - particularly when their backside has expanded. Notably, before sucking blood, bed bugs&rsquo; exoskeleton will be hard to crash like a raw pea or bean.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-easy-to-squash-bed-bug-eggs">Is it Easy to Squash Bed Bug Eggs?</h2>
<p>Well, just like the nymphs, bed bug eggs are soft, and thus, you&rsquo;ll find them equally easy to squash - they have a soft exoskeleton. But crashing eggs will only leave a clear fluid as opposed to red stains.
However, you&rsquo;ll find that bed bug eggs will be challenging to lift or scrape off the ground or
mattress encasements</p>
<ul>
<li>they&rsquo;ll be hidden off in dark places or small cracks.
But when in hidden areas, bed bug eggs are covered in the glue-type liquid that allows them to hide in wood or fabric. Thus, it&rsquo;ll be hard to pick up eggs and squash them. But bed bug spray will be the only sure weapon against bed bug eggs.
However, it&rsquo;ll be challenging to scrape off or pick bed bugs eggs from most surfaces. The eggs will mainly be hidden in crevices and cracks to avoid unnecessary disturbance.

<h2 id="what-aboutstains-from-squashed-bed-bug">What aboutStains from Squashed Bed Bug?</h2>
<p>Squashing bed bugs will leave blood-stained drops on your fabric, fingers, and clothes. The blood will be from the blood-meal from human beings.
Further, the bloodstains left behind will also come from any digested blood already in the bed bug&rsquo;s body - bust such blood will be thicker and darker.
Therefore, don&rsquo;t squash bed bugs, particularly if they&rsquo;re on fabrics, leaving hard stains. If not, you can clean the material to remove the bloodstain, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a fresh bloodstain, pour cold water on the stain as this will allow easier scrubbing and removal.</li>
<li>Next, now use some soap on the blood stain to create some lather,some little salt, and wash thoroughly.</li>
<li>However, for a dry blood stain, use a stain remover to pre-treatment the area and thoroughlysprinkle some ammoniaand launder.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-smell-when-squashed">Do Bed Bugs Smell When Squashed?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs will smell
around to realize what&rsquo;s in the surrounding. For example,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs will sense the human skin&rsquo;s smell and hide</a>
under the mattress - you&rsquo;ll feel the strong, pungent odor.
The bugs have alarm pheromones,&rsquo; particularly when they are exposed or sense some danger. This mainly happens when the mattress is flipped - to avoid being eaten or caught.
Other smells like moldy and coriander in clothes will also attract the bed bugs. Further, bugs fed on blood will have some metallic and sweet smell - due to having iron and sugars.</p>
<h2 id="bugs-causing-blood-stains-when-smashed">Bugs Causing Blood Stains when Smashed?</h2>
<p>Can you pop a bed bug bite? The simple answer is No. You can&rsquo;t pop a bed bug bite. The bite doesn&rsquo;t build pressure since their pores are not blocked - and hence can&rsquo;t pop.
The bites are allergic reaction sites that lead to swelling mainly due to the bed bug saliva and histamine, causing the concentration of white blood cells.
So, which bugs will cause blood stains like bed bugs if squashed? So, here&rsquo;s the bugs; flies, mites, lice, ticks, midges, mosquito, and fleas-check
flea foggers

For protection, put on protective clothing like and tuck the pant legs plus avoid tick-infested areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bug eggs will be cemented into the crevices and cracks using glue-like substances, including inside wood and fabric. Therefore, it&rsquo;ll be difficult to pick or squash the bed bugs.
Squashing the bed bugs will work great when you do it on the location where they&rsquo;re laid. Pinch the eggs using some tissue paper. So,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">spray the bugs</a>
