<p>Dakota Alert is a small family-owned company from South Dakota that has been making the best driveway alarms for years.
The Dakota alert VS wired vehicle sensor is a pioneer in detecting any type of vehicle movement within 12 feet of its radius.</p>
<p>As instructed, you need to place the wire carefully inside an electric conduit to protect it from breaking under the weight of the vehicles or being damaged by animals that love to trespass the property at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the security system is installed, the sensor starts to work.</li>
<li>It immediately detects any kind of movement by vehicles on your driveway, and then the transmitter sends the signals to the receiver, which is installed inside your home.</li>
<li>As soon as the receiver receives signals, it triggers the alarm, which is not too loud.
If you have a big house and want to hear the alarm from anywhere in the house, you need to purchase volume controller add-ons. The transmitter works on a 9V battery, and an AC adapter powers the receiver.
Pros:</li>
<li>Easy to install</li>
<li>Adjustable whistle alert</li>
<li>Fewer false alarms
Cons:</li>
<li>Cannot adjust the volume of alarm
