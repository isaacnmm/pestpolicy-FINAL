latex paint ( with these sprayers)
or oil paint.

<p>Zinsser B-I-N Bonding is effective for use in removing
musty odors, smoke, and seals pet. Luckily, the bonding primer will stick on
different surfaces with no sanding required.
On consistency, the primer is milk-thin, and thus it&rsquo;ll easily spray over your kitchen cabinets but may cause splatter with
rolling (even for textured walls
) or brushing.
For sanded and cleaning cabinet surfaces, the primer will easily layout and nice. While you&rsquo;re spraying the door horizontally, this primer creates a grainy oak with excellent seepage into the cracks.
The kitchen cabinet primer is also great as a wood sealer with a faster drying time. Within an hour, you can sand lightly and thus go-ahead to the second coating.
I must note that this primer is among my top-recommended products in its class for painting varnished or stained trim and wood, including doors, spindles, stair risers, baseboards, and casings.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick-drying bonding primer</li>

<p>Zinsser 03504 is an oil-based bond coat, primer, or cover stain for your kitchen cabinets. Buy this one is budget-friendly, but you may require to use a respirator and gloves for rolling and spraying.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Zinsser 03504 is thicker compared to shellac, and thus you&rsquo;ll require to apply a lighter coat to prevent heavy texturing that would demand surface sanding.
While using an
airless sprayer
, the primer will give you a fine spray. But you can use spray tip that&rsquo;s sized about 0.015 - 0.017 to get a better-atomized spray and hence reduce fingering during spraying.
This Zinsser 03504 is also an o
il-based sealer, primer, or stain killer that&rsquo;ll give your kitchen cabinets that fantastic shine. When used on
exteriors, the primer allows for incredible
flexibility and full penetration.
Zinsser 03504 won&rsquo;t level excellently compared to the shellac-based primers. However, for rolling and brushing, you&rsquo;ll have longer drying time.
The bonding primer will generate a suitable
enamel undercoating while also drying quickly for the interior surfaces. I love this one for
priming, repainting, remodeling, and new constructions.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product is excellent in hiding various formal blocks caused bynicotine stains and smoke while also sealing water.</li>
<li>Further, it&rsquo;ll sand easily and stick evenly onto the exterior and interior surfaces.</li>

Further, the stain-blocking primer will work well for bare or unfinished wood, including on furniture such as cabinets doors that could have noticeable knots.</p>
<h3 id="2-oil-based-primers">2. Oil-Based Primers</h3>
<p>Next is the oil-based primers that&rsquo;ll have more pungent odor compared to the stain-blocking primers. Therefore, you must avoid these primers when you&rsquo;re painting on rooms with closed windows.
Further, the oil-based primers will be challenging to clean up, and thus you&rsquo;ll require using
paint thinners
or mineral spirits. One of the excellent oil-based furniture primers is the Zinsser Cover Stain.</p>
<h3 id="3-shellac-based-primer">3. Shellac-Based Primer</h3>
<p>These shellac-based primers will excellent cover various types of odors and stains, leaving a transparent and white surface on your kitchen surfaces.
But this model won&rsquo;t be as stinky like your oil-based primers, and thus it&rsquo;ll be simple to clean with just denatured alcohol and some water mixed.

Similarly, this primer has extraordinary hiding abilities and can be used both on the exterior and interior surfaces with easy sanding.
On exterior surfaces, this primer is mostly preferred for its great flexibility and penetration on surfaces.
Apart from the new constructions, you can also use them for remodeling,

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/rustoleum-galvanized-metal-%5Bprimer%5D(/posts/can-you-paint-fiberglass-without-primer/)/">priming process</a>
is done before actual paint application is undertaken in order to boost adhesive contact of the finish coat. Some painters tend to skip primer and directly apply finish paint.
*So, what happens if you dont paint over primer? Well, the surface (under paint application) experiences low-paint adhesion, non-uniformity between paint color and sheen, while the surface demands several coats before attaining an excellent finish. *</p>
<p><em>In addition, the low stickiness action (associated with the unprimed surface) leads to peeling and scuffing, while uneven surface coating may initiate chipping or flaking. More so, the finish coat ends up having leakage on damaged sections.�</em></p>

<h2 id="details-what-happens-if-you-dont-paint-over-primer">Details: What Happens If You Don&rsquo;t Paint Over Primer</h2>
<p>The unprimed surface has low service life &amp; a poor finish impression. Quality paint coat is a function of right primer selection, finish coat matching, and appropriated solvent preparation.</p>
<h3 id="a-low-paint-adhesion">a. Low Paint Adhesion</h3>
<p>Primer solvent is meant to seal primary surface material and boost the adhesive contact over which finish paint will stick.
However, without
priming your surface
, paint adhesion is reduced by over 50%. In such cases, paint forms drains and runs, which are more cumbersome to cut with a paintbrush or a roller.
Moreover, the paint molecules may not be highly compatible with the primary surface material  the primer is formulated to create a suitable bond between finish paint and surface material.</p>
<h3 id="b-non-uniformity-on-paint-color-and-sheen">b. Non-Uniformity on paint Color and Sheen</h3>
<p>Unprimed surface forms a non-uniform finish impression (between paint color and sheen) due to unmatched paint seepage over the primary surface material.
Usually, the paint is absorbed (by the primary surface material) unevenly from point to point upon application, thus leading to non-uniformity.
The primed surface material has sealed poles and highly quenched porous section and thus wont cause uneven paint absorption during paint application  primer act as a leveler solvent that eliminates low surface contact and boost the sheen impression.</p>

<h3 id="c-onset-of-peeling-and-scuffing">c. Onset of Peeling and Scuffing</h3>
<p>Due to low paint adhesion, the finish coat tends to peel or scuff after sometimes. The primer solvent boosts the contact stickiness and improves the paint contact surface life.
Moreover, a primed surface has a high resistance to peeling and scuffing agents and offers full proof to wear and tear when exposed to abrasive force.
Unprimed painted surfaces are not sealed or coated to improve surface material strength and hence the primary surface grains or structure has less adhesive force towards paint molecules.
Peeling occurs when the finished paint layer detaches from the wall or surface material.</p>
<h3 id="d-may-lead-to-chipping">d. May Lead to Chipping</h3>
<p>Unprimed surfaces chip often (especially for surfaces that are found in humid environments) due to low stickiness level and uneven paint coat layer.
Usually, the paint layer begins to disintegrate at a particular section due to low contact and humid integration.
As the chipping agents (dust, lime, water, acid) accumulate, the chipping rate increases and ends up pulling down the entire paint coat.
The primer provides a surface area over which the paint coat sticks. Moreover, the primer seals the primary material and prevents chipping agents such as lime, acid, water, or dust from reaching the primary surface material.</p>

<h3 id="e-cause-leakage-on-damaged-surface">e. Cause Leakage on Damaged Surface</h3>
<p>Paint solvent applied over an unprimed surface is susceptible to damage, especially when subjected to exterior abrasive forces.
Besides, the paint coat may break under extreme solar radiation and crack abnormally due to internal surface strains.
Paint layer damage that results from unprimed surface leads to leakages  for sealed sections. The primer acts as a sealer (acrylic primer) and prevents internal leakages from an occurrence.</p>
<h3 id="f-demand-for-several-paint-coats">f. Demand for Several paint Coats</h3>
<p>Apart from being used as a sealer and adhesion booster, primer works as a primary paint layer  it works as an undercoat and thus improves surface strength for subsequent paint coat applications.
Unprimed surfaces demand more paint coats than primed surfaces  this is due to the fact that the first paint layer is used as a primer (not a primer), while the rest of the paint layers adds to stickiness until the required finish is attained.
Since finish paint doesnt contain a primer composition, more paint coats are needed to attain intended quality results.
Therefore, its more expensive to paint over an unprimed surface than painting over a primed surface.�See Also:

<h2 id="how-to-prime-surface-for-painting">How to Prime Surface for Painting</h2>
<p>When carrying out the paint application process, priming your surfaces is a crucial step in boosting not only the surface&rsquo;s paint stickiness but also sealing porous sections and damaged surfaces.
To prime your surface, you will need to follow the steps highlighted below:
<strong>Materials and Tools Required</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Primer and Thinner</li>
<li>Empty bucket and a paintbrush</li>
<li>Stirrer and a roller</li>
<li>Waterpoint and piece of cloth</li>
<li>Test board and dust coat</li>
<li>Respirator and gloves</li>
<li>Boots and goggles

<strong>Steps to Follow</strong></li>
<li>Wear protective gear  boots, respirator, goggles, dust coat, gloves- for your personal safety</li>
<li>Pour primer into an empty bucket gently  measure quantity in response to the surface you intend to paint</li>
<li>Add thinner little by little as per the manufacturers instructions</li>
<li>Stir the mixture using a stirrer to attain uniform solvent</li>
<li>Dip a paintbrush and test the loading capacity. The well-thinned primer should load onto a paintbrush without forming a lot of drains or runs</li>
<li>Carry out a drop test experiment over the test board to ascertain the primers stickiness level before actual priming is done</li>
<li>Dip a paintbrush into the primer and load sufficiently. Cut excess solvent</li>
<li>Gently, apply the primer, back and forth, over the surface</li>
<li>Repeat the previous step until the entire surface is coated
Leave the primed surface to dry naturally. Surfaces found in dusty environments should be covered with a polyethylene bag to prevent them from dirt staining.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Precautions and Safety Measures</strong></p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Always put on protective gear when thinning primer for your safety purpose</li>
<li>Never smell primer or thinner directly  the solvent may contain components that can irritate your respiratory system if inhaled</li>
<li>Do not thin primer near the fireplace  most thinners are highly flammable</li>
<li>Always check primers expiry date before thinning occurs</li>
<li>Follow manufacturers instructions when preparing your primer</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="when-do-you-use-primer-before-painting">When do you Use Primer Before Painting?</h2>
<p>Though primer is crucial when painting your surface, sometimes, finish paint and other surface materials dont really need priming.
However, the following surfaces and conditions require priming before paint application is carried out:</p>
<h3 id="a-new-dry-wall">a. New Dry Wall</h3>
<p>A newly constructed drywall should be primed (before painting) to seal porous sections and eliminate surface pores.
Moreover, the primer also acts as an undercoat for better adhesive contact for the subsequent paint coat.</p>
<h3 id="b-wood-surface">b. Wood Surface</h3>
<p>Just like drywall, wood has a porous surface that required sealing prior to paint application.
Therefore, the wooden surface should be primed to seal and protect the paint solvent from seepage when painting.
Moreover, primer reduces the number of paint coats that could be used in order to attain a quality wood finish. See Also:

<h3 id="c-when-painting-over-dark-colors">c. When painting over dark colors</h3>
<p>In case you want to transit from dark to lighter color, priming the surface would be the best approach  the primer covers the dark color sufficiently without creating any translucent impression.
You may need to apply two or three primer coats, as per the dark color intensity of the previous surface layer.</p>
<h3 id="d-gloss-finish">d. Gloss Finish</h3>
<p>Gloss finish coat wont retain paint well upon application due to low adhesive paint contact.
Therefore, you will need to prime the surface in order to attain a quality finish and reduce peeling or scuffing from occurring with time.</p>
<h3 id="e-painting-metal-or-plastics">e. Painting metal or plastics</h3>
<p>Newly manufactured metal or plastic structures can be painted after priming to boost surface strength and improve overall service life.
Moreover, the primer also seals the primary coat layer from rust agents (in metal) and protects the material from direct abrasion effect in case of scratch.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To wide up, on what happens if you dont paint over primer, you will experience low paint adhesion, non-uniformity between paint color and sheen, while the surface demands several coats before attaining an excellent finish.
Besides, the low stickiness action initiates peeling and scuffing, while uneven surface coating may lead to chipping or flaking. Further, the finish coat is easily damaged and causes uncalled-for leakages.
Notably, the unprimed surface has low service life and poor outlook appearance.�To attain a quality paint finish, you must select the right primer, match the finish paint correctly, and prepare the solvents according to the manufacturers instructions.</p>
