Well, the most straightforward answer is a cockroach. &ldquo;Palmetto bug&rdquo; is a common term heard most often in the Southeastern United States, especially in Florida.
The name can encompass a whole group of large cockroaches. It is usually connected to the Florida woods cockroach, Australian cockroach, the American cockroach, smoky brown cockroach, brown and the death&rsquo;s head cockroach.
Palmetto bugs are so-named because they like to hang out among the leaves of palm trees in the Southeast. Read also:

**How Can You Identify a Palmetto Bug? **
For one thing, in the cockroach vs. palmetto bug wars, at around 1.5 inches long, palmetto bugs are among the giant cockroaches and often make themselves unwelcome guests in people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<ul>
<li>These reddish-brown bugs develop two spots behind their head as they age and have wings, but are not excellent fliers, so instead, they will sail along in the air from the surface to surface.</li>
<li>It can be quite comical when people assume they are being attacked by palmetto bugs because when you open your house door, they sail right is headed for the light.
While they are not the most sanitary creatures and admittedly can come off as a bit frightening, palmetto bugs aren&rsquo;t hazardous.
They seldom
bite humans
, and their bites are nothing to worry about as they show up as tiny, red marks but are not poisonous or painful.
It might seem that the worst these pests can do is cause disruption in your home, but beware!
Due to their love of hiding in dirty, unsanitary locations, they can infect your food with bacteria like salmonella. Furthermore, they can set off asthma and allergies.�Read Also:

<h2 id="where-do-they-make-their-home-">**Where Do They Make Their Home? **</h2>
<p>When it comes down to the cockroach vs. the palmetto bug, both are very versatile. They don&rsquo;t perish quickly.
In the case of the palmetto bug, if the weather takes a sudden turn for the worse, maybe turning suddenly cold or becoming too hot or wet, they will head indoors to find refuge in your home.
The tropical climate of Florida is a paradise for palmetto bugs. As a homeowner, you need to be vigilant because if a house is left empty for too long, or you have an outside infestation, pretty soon they will find their way indoors.
What you have to do is a thorough check of your property. Look for palmetto bugs in these places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under palm leaves, inside hollow trees, throughout woodpiles and shrubs</li>
<li>Lurking in sprinkler systems</li>
<li>Sink and tub drains</li>
<li>Beneath your roof shingles.</li>
<li>The foundation of your home</li>
<li>Inside basements and crawlspaces, mainly if it is damp</li>
<li>Hidden in baskets of dirty laundry
Any damp, warm, dark place is a fair game for these insects, and they like to collect in large groups in one spot. This doesn&rsquo;t mean ten or so but groups containing hundreds, even thousands.
Since palmetto bugs will happily dine on any organic matter that they can get to, they will eat garbage, decaying bodies of animals, paper, hair, and even glue!

<li>They shed their skins and leave droppings similar to pepper flakes in crevices and cracks</li>

<h2 id="best-palmetto-bug-killers">Best Palmetto Bug Killers</h2>
<p>If you want to get rid of palmetto bugs without further ado, make use of these effective bug killers to quickly eliminate the creepy crawlies in your house.</p>
<h3 id="1-boric-acid-killer">1. Boric Acid Killer</h3>
<p>Using boric acid is one of the most effective techniques to kill palmetto bugs. Its a natural mineral thats able to kill the palmetto bugs. The acid disrupts the digestive system and nervous system of the bugs causing death. The downside is that you wont see its effect right away. Patiently wait for a few days to notice the bugs disappear over time.</p>
<h3 id="2-non-toxic-roach-traps">2. Non-Toxic Roach Traps</h3>
<p>Using roach traps is a maintenance-free method to get rid of palmetto bugs. These are quite different from the conventional roach traps. These traps employ non-toxic ingredients to bait the roaches towards the sticky glue surface. These traps should be placed strategically in the kitchen, cupboards and garage.</p>
<h2 id="getting-rid-of-the-palmetto-bugs">Getting Rid of the Palmetto Bugs</h2>
<p>We know youre disgusted by them and dont want to go anywhere near them. Learn ways by which you can free your house of the palmetto bugs before you start seeing them everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="1-roach-glue-traps">1. Roach Glue Traps</h3>
<p>Get hold of sufficient amount of roach glue traps and set it in multiple positions all over the house. Its better and safer if you use non-toxic roach traps, especially if youve got toddlers or pets at home.</p>
<p>Some areas where you must place these traps are the kitchen, cupboards, wardrobes, bathroom, basement and garage. The higher the number of traps, the more effective they will turn out to be.</p>
<h3 id="2-homemade-boric-acid-roach-baits">2. Homemade Boric Acid Roach Baits</h3>
<p>This is definitely the most efficient and cost effective way to deal with palmetto bugs. Although you wont see on the spot results through this method, but we assure you that the palmetto bugs stand no chance against it once theyve consumed it or are exposed to the mineral.</p>
<p>There are two ways through which boric acid works on the palmetto bugs. One of it is through its consumption. In case the palmetto bug digests the boric acid, it would result in the disintegration of its digestive system. Over time, it can lead to even more disruption inside the nervous system of the bug.</p>
<p>The other way is through the abrasive property of the mineral. The boric acid creates an itchy sensation on the exoskeleton of the palmetto bug and it gradually dries out. As the bug is unable to maintain the internal fluid balance, it doesnt last for a long time.</p>
<p>Cover your hands with a pair of gloves and mix different ingredients to make bait for the palmetto bug. Use the boric acid and mix it with a small quantity of flour, sugar and Crisco. The mixture would end up with a sticky dough-like texture. Leave the mixture alongside familiar insect-entry points.</p>
<p>Although boric acid is a naturally occurring mineral, keep in mind that it has a mild level of toxicity. So in case youve got pets or little kids, its best to avoid this method, as accidental ingestion could be dangerous for their safety. There are other safer alternatives available that you can opt for in that case.</p>

<h3 id="3-food-grade-diatomaceous-earth">3. Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>This is also an organically occurring white powder and is used to achieve the same result to boric acid. Similar to boric acid, it also comes with a naturally-abrasive property.</p>
<p>Diatomaceous earth has a painful effect on the bugs that come into contact with it. Its sharp microscopic edges feel like stepping on shards of broken glass for them.</p>
<p>Take hold of a sack of food-grade diatomaceous earth and cover the areas where you think palmetto bugs are likely to pass from with sufficient amounts.</p>
<p>Ensure that you dont accidentally get pool-grade powder instead, as its extremely poisonous. Food-grade diatomaceous earth is fairly safer, unless you somehow breathe in large quantities of powder.</p>
<h3 id="4-sealing-cracks-and-gaps">4. Sealing Cracks and Gaps</h3>
<p>Gaps, holes and cracks along the house walls provide an easy entrance point for these insects. Simply seal these entry points and youd notice the number of palmetto bugs decreasing overtime.</p>
<p>Although they are reasonably bigger in size, theyre still somehow able to slip though the little cracks and gaps, and sneak into your house.</p>
<p>Carry out a detailed inspection of your entire house. Check if all the openings are blocked with materials such as caulk. These bugs can even make way in your house via the electrical outlets.</p>
<h3 id="5-a-pet-cat">5. A Pet Cat</h3>
<p>As surprising as it may sound, a pet cat can be a lot of help against the palmetto bugs. So in case you were planning to bring a pet cat home, heres one more reason why you should.</p>
<p>If youve got friends who have cats at home, youd notice that youve never seen palmetto bugs roaming around their houses. Thats because cats do a killer job to get rid of them. Cats not only play with them, but also at times eat them.</p>
<p>We know it sounds disgusting as you can imagine those bugs crawling in unhygienic places. So you should train your cat to only catch the palmetto bugs and not consume them.</p>
<h2 id="what-draws-in-palmetto-bugs">What Draws in Palmetto Bugs?</h2>
<p>As the famous saying goes, prevention is better than the cure, and it fits perfectly for pest control.</p>
<p>Itll be easier for you to get rid of the palmetto bugs if youre aware about the things and conditions that attract them originally. These are a few things that you need to be careful about to keep the palmetto bugs at bay.</p>
<h3 id="1-wet-and-warm-environments">1. Wet and Warm Environments</h3>
<p>Warm and humid environments are an ideal hideout for the palmetto bugs. This is why youd notice that the number of palmetto bugs inside your house start to increase when the weather outside becomes cool and dry.</p>
<p>Create an environment inside your house that isnt preferred by them. You can make use of a dehumidifier as itll help to dry out the inside air.</p>
<p>Inspect your house and look for potential water leakages coming from the broken pipes, broken faucets and roofs. Anything that might cause some areas of the house to become wet; even blocked drains, should be fixed on an immediate basis.</p>
<h3 id="2-leftover-food-wastage">2. Leftover Food Wastage</h3>
<p>Make sure that all the food scraps in the kitchen is discarded in an enclosed trash bin. Always use airtight sealed containers to store food that isnt placed in the refrigerator, making sure that the palmetto bugs are unable to reach the food. You dont want them feeding on your food and surely wouldnt enjoy the sight of them as toppings on your food.</p>
