They are usually preferred because of their low-calorie level and high water content -

.
But can bearded dragons eat cucumber?
<strong>A simple answer is YES. Cucumber gives you a means of hydrating and nourishing your bearded dragon since it contains some minerals and vitamins.�</strong>
<strong>But since cucumbers are not very nutritious, they should not constitute the main diet for your bearded dragon.�</strong>

<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-cucumbers---7-top-picks"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cucumbers? - 7 Top Picks</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-bearded-dragons-eat-cucumbers---7-top-picks">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cucumbers are among the vegetables
<a href="https://cvm.ncsu.edu/documents/caring-for-your-bearded-dragon/">approved for feeding bearded dragons</a>
. They contain some minerals and vitamins which will go a long way to nourish your beardie.
The most important of these include vitamin C, vitamin K, potassium, magnesium, and manganese.
Cucumber also provides a fiber diet to your pet which allows effective digestion.
Plus it contains about 96 % water which helps in
hydrating your bearded dragon
. Notably, bearded dragons dont have an appetite for water. But with cucumbers, you have a good chance of hydrating your beardie.
Another reason that makes cucumber
suitable for bearded dragons
is that it isnt too acidic. The ratio of calcium to phosphorous in cucumber makes it less acidic, meaning it wont harm your beardie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1xNvAduR5M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1xNvAduR5M</a>
When
feeding your bearded dragon
with cucumber, be sure to remove the skin to make it easy to chew and digest. It should also be sliced into small pieces since your beardie wont be able to chew large chunks.
Note that cucumbers are not very nutritious. Therefore, its advisable not to
feed your bearded dragon
with a lot of cucumbers.
You should rather use them to supplement other nutritious foods like Dubai roaches, crickets, collard greens among others.

<p>Cucumber peels arent good for your bearded dragon. Theyre too hard for them to chew even when sliced into small pieces.

<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-cucumbers-seeds"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cucumbers seeds?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-bearded-dragons-eat-cucumbers-seeds">¶</a></h2>

<p>While cucumber contains some useful minerals and vitamins, it does not merit being adopted as the bearded dragons main diet.
Thats because it lacks some important nutrients such as calcium, vitamin A and so on.
Therefore, cucumbers should be fed only a few times a month or once a week.
Typically, it should be given as a means for hydrating your bearded dragon rather than a source of nutrients. Therere two reasons why its good for hydration.
First, it contains about 96% water. Secondly, bearded dragons are not very fond of drinking water. However, theyre able to effectively get the required water by eating cucumbers.

<h3 id="1-washing-the-cucumber"><strong>1. Washing the Cucumber�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-washing-the-cucumber">¶</a></h3>
<p>Below is a guide for preparing cucumbers for your bearded dragon. This guide applies to all types of cucumbers and squash.
As with other raw fruits or vegetables, cucumbers should be washed thoroughly to remove dirt or any chemicals used in
pest control
.</p>
<h3 id="2-peeling-the-cucumber"><strong>2. Peeling the Cucumber</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-peeling-the-cucumber">¶</a></h3>
<p>Place the cucumber on a board or hold it in your hand. Trim both sides using a kitchen knife. Then use a vegetable peeler to remove all the skin while ensuring minimal flesh wastage.</p>
<h3 id="3-cut-into-half"><strong>3. Cut into Half</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-cut-into-half">¶</a></h3>

<p>Getting your
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-cabbage/">bearded dragon to eat</a>
cucumber or other plant matter can sometimes be tricky. Some bearded dragons wont start eating cucumbers right away.
So you might need to train your beardie to get used to cucumber. Below are tips to guide you on how to train our beardie to eat cucumber.</p>
<h3 id="1-introduce-cucumbers-to-your-baby-dragon"><strong>1. Introduce Cucumbers to Your Baby Dragon</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-introduce-cucumbers-to-your-baby-dragon">¶</a></h3>
<p>A saying goes by, You cant teach an old dog new tricks. Well, its advisable to introduce cucumber or any other vegetables at an early age so that your beardie gets used to it.
Baby beardies are especially hard to give new food. But with a little patience and trick, its only a matter of time before they start eating cucumber.
Typically, the
diet of a baby
beardie should constitute 80% proteins and 20% plant matter. But the plant matter should be increased as the animal progresses to adulthood.
The best way to introduce cucumber to your baby beardie is to give it early in the morning before it eats anything.
But you dont want to starve the little thing. If it refuses to eat at all, you can give them its favorite food. The intention is to make it used to cucumbers. Eventually, itll bear results.</p>
<h3 id="2-offer-cucumber-and-insects"><strong>2. Offer Cucumber and Insects</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-offer-cucumber-and-insects">¶</a></h3>
<p>Treating cucumber slices with their favorite insects will gradually make your bearded dragon used to a plant diet.
This trick works best in the morning when the beardie is hungry.
Introduce one or two wax worms or Dubai roaches into the bowl containing cucumber slices.
The bearded dragon will immediately pick on the insect and in the process, theres a chance of getting a bite on the cucumber slice.
You can repeat this trick several times until your beardie gets used to cucumber.</p>
<h3 id="3-mix-cucumber-with-sweet-fruits"><strong>3. Mix Cucumber with Sweet Fruits</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-mix-cucumber-with-sweet-fruits">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fruits such as apples, strawberries, and papaya can be mixed with cucumber to entice the beardie with their sweet taste.
Mix the cucumber with fruits that the beardie is used to. It will be drawn to the food by the smell of the fruits and immediately begin to bite.
Make sure the fruits and cucumber are sliced into small pieces and mixed thoroughly. This ensures that your beardie doesnt miss a bite of the cucumber as it picks on the sweet fruits.
