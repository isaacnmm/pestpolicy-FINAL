<p>The ideal pick should feature natural ingredients free from phosphate compounds, toxins and non-biodegradable substances. This is the key to ensuring that the solution is safe to use for both beginners and professionals.
To get the best value for money, the ideal pick should be capable of cleaning multiple surfaces such as ceramic, tiles, fences, and concrete in addition to Trex composite decks.</p>
<h3 id="2-no-scrubbing-and-bleach-free-cleaning-solution">2. No scrubbing and Bleach free cleaning solution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-no-scrubbing-and-bleach-free-cleaning-solution">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ideal pick should not require rubbing or scrubbing. For ease of application, the ultimate choice only needs to applied and wiped out to regain that natural look on your Trex deck surface.
Bleach cleaning solutions should be avoided at all costs due to their harmful effects on vegetation and the fact that it only kills mildew spores but falls short of eliminating them.</p>
<h3 id="3-type-of-deck-cleaning-solution-and-application">3. Type of deck cleaning solution and Application<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-type-of-deck-cleaning-solution-and-application">¶</a></h3>
<p>The type of stain is a crucial determinant of whether to go for a water-based or solvent-based solution. Whereas water-based solutions tend to be colorless and are unlikely to alter the color of the deck, solvent-based cleaners tend to amber the color of the cleaning surface.
The ideal pick should give you the convenience of application with a sponge, a tank sprayer, a roller, or a garden sprayer. Also, the formula should be ready to use.</p>
<h3 id="4-speed-of-drying-up-and-scope-of-project">4. Speed of drying up and Scope of project<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-speed-of-drying-up-and-scope-of-project">¶</a></h3>
<p>On application, the ideal washing solution should not take too long to dry out. This feature is particularly significant if you are dealing with outdoor deck surfaces.
If you are dealing with a large project, you might want to go for a cleaner with a larger capacity to avoid refilling the spray can every once in a while. With smaller projects, you only need a spray canister with a capacity of one gallon.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
