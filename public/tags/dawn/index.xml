on your dogs or cats?
<strong>Certainly! Dawn dish soap can kill fleas on your cats and dogs, but it&rsquo;s a less effective flea control method compared to IGR sprays. Although it can easily remove grease and oil from wild birds, the flea-killing process is different.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>According to Dr. Andrea Miller, Dawn <strong>dish soap works by degreasing the fleas&rsquo; protective exoskeleton waxy <em>through the</em>surfactant effect</strong>, essentially drowning them. Also, the fleas become susceptible to dehydration, and other environmental stressors.�</em></li>
<li><em>Also, Dawn dish soap reduces the surface tension of water, which means that when you use it to bathe your pet, fleas lose their ability to stay afloat on the water&rsquo;s surface. This causes them to sink and drown - drowning agent.</em>
Let&rsquo;s get into the details!
<strong>But first, check these alternative flea shampoos for cats and dogs.��</strong>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-will-dawn-dish-soap-kill-fleas">How Will Dawn Dish Soap Kill Fleas?</h2>
<p>Dawn dish soap works to clean oil, grime, and grease on wild birds and pets through a chemical reaction called emulsification.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emulsification with Blue Dawn is the result of a chemical reaction between hydrogen peroxide and fatty substances, such as oils from food residue; as explained by a certified veterinarian<a href="https://libertypethospital.com/our-team/">Dr. Andrea Miller</a>.
**However; **
The flea-killing process uses a different process than emulsification.�Like all dish detergents, Dawn Dish Soap is a surfactant.</li>
<li>A surfactant will reduce the surface tension of water and other liquids with which it comes into contact.
<strong>Method 1: Reduces surface tension of water  makes fleas sink and drown.</strong>
<em>�</em>
Typically flea treatments come in the form of topical pesticide solutions such as sprays or powders that need to be used directly on your pet.</li>
<li>Dawn dish soap doesnt kill fleas directly (as pesticides do) - but does so by reducing the surface tension of the water and hence makes the flea sink to its death.</li>
<li>The flea&rsquo;s exoskeletons are made of a protective waxy layer that enables the adult fleas to float on water.
So, dawn (plus other comparable soaps) will reduce surface tension that yields the exoskeleton, and hence the adult fleas will sink and drown.
Dawn dish soap (compared to dog flea shampoo) destroys fleas&rsquo; exoskeletons and kills them. B
<em>ut first: How Soap Reduces the Surface Tension Of Water.�</em>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfXZEpw0qrQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfXZEpw0qrQ</a>
Notably, ordinarily, fleas have a waxy layer, and their small size prevents them from the break the surface tension of water.
But with dish soap, the surfactants will make the fleas sink and drown quickly. The dawn soap makes the pet&rsquo;s waxy cuticle absorb water and thus drown.
If Dawn Dish Soap is not available, you can substitute any other type of dish detergent, but dish soap is usually more concentrated and will work better.
<strong>Method 2: Breaks the Waxy Layer of the Fleas&rsquo; Respiratory System</strong>
Drowning fleas under normal circumstances is difficult. This is mainly because the respiratory system of fleas has a waxy layer that prevents water from entering.
Further, the wax is also in the trachea and bars water from moving into the respiratory system.
The application of dawn dish soap breaks the wax layer and allows the entry of water into the fleas respiratory system.</li>
<li>Fleas trigger some skin irritation, anemia (blood loss), or may kill puppies and kittens. But commercial<a href="https://nysipm.cornell.edu/whats-bugging-you/bed-bugs/bed-bug-faqs///">flea treatments</a>can be harsh on kittens&rsquo; or puppies&rsquo; skin and their young immune system.</li>
<li>The most effective method of using the Dawn dish soap will be to give the pets a dish soap + water bath.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-wont-dawn-dish-soap-help-control-flea-infestations">Why won&rsquo;t Dawn Dish Soap help Control Flea Infestations?</h2>
<p>Blue Dawn Dish Soap will kill adult fleas, but it does nothing to reduce the risk of flea re-infestation or repel any fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the drowning process, just a few of the fleas in the house (actually only those on the pets) will be killed by the Blue Dawn Dish Soap</li>
<li>Therefore, the fleas that&rsquo;ll be left running around the surrounding like the<em>yard</em>will jump back and restart the flea re-infestation cycle.
Also, fleas are fast reproducers, so even if you get rid of all the fleas in your house, new ones can easily move in from other parts of the home or yard.
What to do instead: You&rsquo;ll need an insecticide that&rsquo;s strong enough to kill both adults and larvae for a serious pest infestation.
Fleas will lay 50 eggs daily, and those eggs will hatch into larvae in a few weeks with most of them being females.
Therefore:</li>
<li>Killing adult fleas does nothing to reduce the risk of re-infestation or repel any fleas at all.</li>
<li>Soapy water is not enough, you&rsquo;ll need an insecticide that&rsquo;s strong enough to kill both adults and larvae for a serious
Dawn dish soap was made to wash dishes and cannot kill or be used as flea treatment, especially for long-term extermination.

</ul>
<h2 id="does-dawn-kill-flea-eggs--larvae">Does Dawn Kill Flea Eggs &amp; Larvae?</h2>
<p><em>Dr. Andrea Miller</em>
notes that Dawn dish soap is only suitable (in its limited capacity) to kill adult fleas and not
kill fleas&rsquo; eggs
and larvae.
The blue Dawn will mainly drown and kill some of the adult fleas. This will not get rid of all the other
3 flea life stages
. They will still be in your house.
Adult female fleas will lay their eggs in the yard or similar surroundings. The eggs will hatch in a few days to give a larval form (lasting a few days) and it develops into a pupa.
The main problem with killing fleas just using dawn or other traditional methods is that you wont get rid of all the other stages.</p>
<ul>
<li>*You&rsquo;ll need an insecticide with different active ingredients to kill all flea life stages for long-term prevention. *
**Therefore, **</li>
<li>If you wash your dogs or cats with blue Dawn dish soap, it won&rsquo;t cut down the flea population significantly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-blue-dawn-irritate-my-pets-skin">Will Blue Dawn Irritate My Pets Skin?</h2>
<p>Dr. Andrea Miller noted that dish soap is not intended to be used as a dog or cat shampoo (including for flea treatment) due to skin-related issues. For puppies especially, veterinarians recommend only
puppy flea shampoo
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent skin irritation, a burning sensation, and hair loss are possible side effects of Dawn dish soap if it comes in contact with your dogs or cats skin.
If the pet already has irritation from fleas, and you put Dawn on a part of their skin that is already irritated, it will get worse.</li>
<li>Dawn Dish Soap can&rsquo;t be used as a shampoo for feline or canine pets and should only be used on dishes.</li>
<li><strong>Veterinarians recommend using these <strong><strong>dog flea shampoo</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>cat shampoo</strong></strong> for your dog and cat respectively.�</strong>
When used for routine bathing of your�pets,�dishwashing soaps will�quickly strip your�pet&rsquo;s skin�of the natural oils that help to nourish and protect it.
This leaves the�skin�less well-hydrated and decreases its ability to keep bacterial, yeast, and allergic irritants at bay.
If used on the pet&rsquo;s skin for routine bathing, Dawn Dish Soap can strip the natural oils off and decreases the ability to fight allergic irritants, yeast, and bacteria.
Natural oils work to protect and nourish the skin. Too much Dawn dish soap can cause the skin to become dry and irritated.

<h2 id="so-should-pet-owners-use-blue-dawn-dish-soap-for-fleas-control">So, Should Pet Owners Use Blue Dawn Dish Soap for Fleas Control</h2>
<p>Dawn dish soap is not an effective way to remove fleas, but it may be used rarely on severely flea-infested puppies or kittens for fast flea removal.
This is because these puppies or kittens may be too young to use commercial pet products.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have young puppies or kittens, make sure to use a small amount of Dawn Dish Soap and dilute it with water before using it.</li>
<li>Be sure not to leave any Dawn dish soap on the animal for more than 30 minutes at a time because this can change the pH level in their fur.</li>
<li>Afterward, use aflea combto remove any fleas from the animal.
When Dawn dish soap is used on a healthy adult pet without complications and with massive flea infestations, it may be more effective than using water alone to remove fleas.
Dawn dish soap can kill and exterminate (removes dead skin and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-flea-dirt/">flea dirt</a>
) at the same time. It&rsquo;s only recommended if the pet is exposed to the bugs from locations such as pet daycare or boarding facilities.
**Otherwise: **
**Use year-round (prescription)�topical and oral�flea treatments **</li>
<li>Effective year-round flea treatment for adult pets typically involves a topical flea medication applied to the animal&rsquo;s skin.
In the event that you find fleas on a pet in your own home, it is best to purchase over-the-counter
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">Capstar flea killers</a>
for emergency use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, and No, any dish soap will kill fleas  itll lower the surface tension (a surfactant) and kill fleas but it isn&rsquo;t very effective.
If you have any questions please post in the comments section below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My brother and I are neighbors and we have lawns that are green and well-manicured. So we are always worried about the idea of pests like <a href="/posts/dawn-dish-soap-for-fleas/">fleas</a> taking over the yards.
So, on the question of spraying the <a href="/posts/how-to-treat-fleas-in-the-yard/">yard</a> with dawn for fleas, I note that spraying
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dawn-dish-soap-for-fleas/">dawn dish soap</a>
might be all thats required to eliminate those fleas from your yard. So just mix dish soap (1 ounce) with water in a garden sprayer and spray.
*I recommend that you repeat the spraying using a similar dawn dish soap solution every 10 to 12 days so that we exterminate all the fluids that could have survived and arents hatched yet. *
Despite that dish soap is an effective technique for controlling fleas there are other effective methods you can use to remove the bugs from your yard.</p>
<ol>
<li>Clearing the yard remove those shady areas that have leaves and up.</li>
<li>Identify the spots that fleas love to hide.</li>
<li>Kill the fleas using chemicals such as insecticides like the flea insecticide</li>
<li>Use an IGR-based insecticide that will ensure the fleas won&rsquo;t be coming back for longer.</li>
<li>Use natural remedies such as diatomaceous Earth that you&rsquo;ll sprinkle in the yard or on carpets.</li>
<li>Use natural predators and allow sunlight to shine on the spaces.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="details-steps-of-using-dawn-dish-soap-to-control-fleas-in-the-yard">Details: Steps of Using Dawn Dish Soap to Control Fleas in the Yard</h2>
<p>So much of the alternative flea control methods but how long will Dawn dish soap take to kill fleas in your yard?
<em>Well, dawn dish soap will kill fleas within a few hours but its residue effect will remain on the yard for about 24 hours.</em></p>
<h3 id="1-mix-dawn-dish-soap-with-water">1. Mix Dawn Dish Soap With Water</h3>
<p>Take that sprayer and in it mix about 1 oz of the Dawn dish soap and water.
Shake the soap water mixture thoroughly to make sure that it is well prepared.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the sprayer is not leaking or was used to handle other hazardous chemicals that may cause harm to humans and pets in the yard.
Check the sprayer part that it is working well so that you won&rsquo;t get challenges while you trying to flea treat the yard.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-spray-your-lawn-or-yard">2. Spray your Lawn or Yard</h3>
<p>Next, it&rsquo;s time now to treat the lawn and garden to make it safe for humans and pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you are spraying, put emphasis or concentrate more on areas that you think have many fleas such as under shades.
Other areas to concentrate on include the best hiding or sleeping area as they may have dropped adult fleas, their larvae, or even eggs.
Continue spraying various areas of the yard to ensure you cover all its inches.</li>
<li>Experts recommend that you do the flea-spraying around evening hours since this is time you might get many fleas.
Also, you should respray the yard or garden using the Dawn dish soap mixture weekly in the month that you&rsquo;ve begun the application.
But on natural flea control in the yard nematodes will work effectively as they will eat those flea larvae and flea eggs.</li>
<li>Luckily these nematode worms will be safe for your garden, grass, vegetation, pets, and humans.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-inspect-the-yard-further">3. Inspect the Yard Further</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to go back to the yard and inspect it if you&rsquo;ll find any other fleas or even flea eggs let me have hatched.
So, if you can find traces of the fleas, you&rsquo;ll need to continue respraying they had every evening.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopting this flea control schedule you will ensure that the outdoor garden becomes free of these bugs.
To exterminate the flea larvae and flea eggs you&rsquo;ll need to use chemical treatments or continually spray the yard using Dawn dish soap and
later apply diatomaceous Earth
.
For a thorough and effective control of their bugs, you&rsquo;re required to respray the yard or garden monthly using those DIY treatments (like dish soap), or chemical solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-will-the-dish-soap-affect-your-yard">How will the Dish Soap Affect your Yard?</h2>
<p>Already we have seen that Dawn dish soap is effective in controlling fleas
and weeds
but what is its effect on plants and grass in the yard.
In summary dish soap (depending on its concentration) can harm grass and plants in the yard. The soap strips natural oils from the plants which cause their shriveling and death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spraying the soap on the yard to act as a DIY pesticide will help you control some weeds and also exterminate various insects including fleas.
However, the chemicals in the dish soap are not selective.
So, this is not a solution that you can use over the long term since the chemicals in that so we&rsquo;ll strip off the oils from the plants and thus kill them off.</li>
<li>Also, the soap may end up killing beneficial insects in your yard and that may deny you the men of it that could have been derived from having such animals around.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-safely-use-dish-soap-in-the-yard">Is It Possible To Safely Use Dish Soap In The Yard?</h2>
<p>Despite that the dish soap could still cause damage to your plants, homeowners have derived a way you can use it but have lesser damage in the yard.
The basic formulation is using a mixture of dish soap, vegetable oil, and water in a very diluted form.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply measure out equal volumes of vegetable oil and dish soap with one cup of water. I note that just one teaspoon of vegetable oil and dish soap will be enough.</li>
<li>Put the dish soap mixture into a spray bottle and spray the areas of the yard that are infested with weeds and insects.
Spray in a way that there before plus vegetable oil mixture will directly touch the pest - so continue respraying the yard until you can&rsquo;t find more fleas.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Wait for some hours and then wash down the yard to ensure that all the dish soap + vegetable oil mixture are washed off.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dish-soap-alternatives-for-killing-fleas-in-yard">Dish Soap Alternatives for Killing Fleas in Yard?</h2>
<p>First I note that this hope is an easy-to-use and cheap DIY remedy for killing fleas but we&rsquo;ve also noted that it might harm the yard plants.</p>
<ul>
<li>The safer and yet really effective alternative for using dish soap for controlling fleas in your yard is the insecticidal soap.
With the insecticidal soap, you won&rsquo;t be concerned about killing off your yard grass and plants since this remedy is less toxic.</li>
<li>Luckily the insecticidal soap is more specific in its flea-killing action compared to the dish soap.</li>
<li>Therefore the pesticide soap won&rsquo;t kill all the insects indiscriminately
I find this a very important aspect of the pesticide soap as you use it in the yard since not only insects can be classified as harmful while others are beneficial such as the bees and some bugs in the yad.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You can&rsquo;t remove fleas from your yard or garden using natural solutions like diatomaceous earth and nematodes without harming your pets like cats &amp; dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can also recommend that you insure the yard is always trimmed neatly as these will help keep the pests away.
However, Dawn dish soap is also an effective remedy that you can use to remove the fleas from your yard despite that it is less effective compared to other chemical remedies such as
IGR yard flea sprays
.</li>
