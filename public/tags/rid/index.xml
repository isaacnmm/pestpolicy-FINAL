outdoor working space wondering how do I get rid of sweat <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-carpenter-bees-without-killing-them/">bees</a>? A common method to kills sweat bees is a killing spray.
But are there situations where it would not be appropriate?
I conducted a quick research.
<strong>To get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ground-bees/">rid</a> of sweat bees, you may repel, trap or kill the bugs.�Sweat Bees are�attracted to salts present in human sweat. Obviously, a similar threat faces street athletes,� gardeners, and construction workers.�</strong>

<p>This is not a very efficient method as it constitutes eliminating isolated bees as and when they make contact through the use of household insecticides.</p>
<p>It is a short-term solution that also has the disadvantage of exposing you to the same pesticides you use to kill the bees. Most pesticides can be extremely dangerous if used for extended periods.</p>
<h3 id="2how-to-repel-sweat-bees-using-your-best-sweat-bee-repellent">2.�How to Repel Sweat Bees using your Best Sweat Bee Repellent</h3>
<p>A humane way to eliminate sweat bees is to repel them. However, not all repellents are made equal, which is why you need to go for a product whose ingredients have been registered with the EPA.</p>
<p>Talk to a doctor if any member of your household is negatively affected by the type of repellant you are using. Exterminators can also recommend a host of superior quality options for the same purpose.</p>
<p>You can also keep sweat bees away from you by rubbing some mint soap on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="3how-to-trap-sweat-bees-using-your-best-sweat-bee-catcher">3.�How to Trap Sweat Bees using your Best Sweat Bee Catcher</h3>
<p>Another humane and effective method to eradicate of sweat bees is to trap them. There are many resources online that tell you how to build your sweat bee trap; it is advisable to go for commercial options.</p>
<p>This is because traditional and some DIY sweat bee traps will not work with these tiny insects. Search online for options and dont forget to look at customer reviews before settling for any particular product.</p>
<h3 id="4-preparing-the-ground">4. Preparing the ground</h3>
<p>A sure way to keep sweat bees away from your home and property is to locate the areas in which they like to build their nests. Once you find the potential nesting ground, you need to make it unconducive for sweat bee habitation.</p>
<p>Sweat bees like to colonize dry and thin soil and will mostly show up in humid weather. As they love to burrow under the ground, adding layers of mulch is sure to dissuade them from colonizing the area any further. It makes the soil much harder to penetrate.</p>
<h3 id="5-hire-a-professional-exterminator">5. Hire a professional exterminator</h3>
<p>In most instances, it is wise to leave the job to exterminators as they have the training and experience to deal with dangerous insects and pesticides.</p>
<p>Exterminators will take all precautionary measures, including wearing protective clothing. Make a shortlist of reputable exterminators who know how to wipe out sweat bees in your pool, yard, or garden.</p>
<p>Do your groundwork before hiring an exterminator and ask if you need to do anything to prepare for the extermination.

<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef602">can&rsquo;t reach deep down</a>
where they hide.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking for effective ways of getting rid of fleas in the carpet - we&rsquo;ve got lots of ideas!�Maybe it&rsquo;s through vacuuming or steam cleaning?</p>
<p>In this PestPolicy guide, this is what I&rsquo;ll be exploring:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do fleas end up in your carpet?</li>
<li>How long do fleas live in carpets?</li>
<li>What Should I Do with <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas/">Flea</a>-Infested Furniture and Carpet?</li>
<li>3 steps to getting rid of fleas in the carpet - fastest way</li>
<li>What Can I Use for Fleas on my Furniture?
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Flea Killers for Carpets&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-end-up-in-your-carpet">How do fleas end up in your carpet?</h2>
<p>The simplest explanation for how fleas (and flea eggs) end up on your carpet is that they jump from one dog or cat to another, or even worse, from the outdoors into a home.</p>
<p>Or people might
bring them home unknowingly
inside their own shoes from walking through an infested area outdoors (for example near other flea-infested homes).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also find that your furniture is another source of fleas if you don&rsquo;t vacuum it regularly, as some pet owners neglect to do.</p>
<p>Flea larvae are the initial stage in a flea&rsquo;s life cycle and will hatch from eggs on carpets or other surfaces where they&rsquo;ve landed.</p>
<ul>
<li>They enter into a pupal state which can last anywhere between one day up to two weeks before emerging as adults.</li>
<li>This time frame depends on factors such as temperature (warm temperatures speed up their development) and humidity levels.
Adult female fleas feed by biting animals like cats, dogs, etc., this helps them produce more eggs (20 - 50 daily). The eggs will roll onto the carper (they&rsquo;re less sticky) as the pet lies down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The flea eggs hatch in 1-2 weeks. So, the carpets provide a warm temperature allowing the fleas to hatch faster.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, there will develop a fully-grown infestation with eggs, nymphs, and adults on the carpet and on the floor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-fleas-live-in-carpets">How Long Do Fleas Live in Carpets?</h2>
<p>Fleas can live in carpets for an average of two to three months with a suitable host - cat or dog. If they don&rsquo;t get a blood meal, the flea&rsquo;s lifespan might only last a few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>The flea eggs in your carpet hatch in two to three days.
After the egg hatches, it takes about six days for a flea larva to develop.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have small children or pets in your home, there is a higher chance that they will be bitten and infected with parasites from these bugs. Pets might even bring them into your home on their fur!</p>
<p>The best way to get rid of them would be using natural remedies like garlic oil or Diatomaceous earth which kills pests but is safe for humans and animals alike!</p>
<p>Adult fleas live on average anywhere from 1 day to two weeks, depending on the animal they&rsquo;re living off of. When a long-haired host is available they can survive roughly 8 days.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-with-flea-infested-furniture-and-carpet">What Should I Do with Flea-Infested Furniture and Carpet?</h2>
<p>If you have a lot of fleas on your furniture and carpet, you may need to call an exterminator - or undertake DIY flea control.</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem is usually solved by spraying the house with insecticide which will kill all the fleas in your home - including those that are hiding out in dark corners or under carpets.
The next step is to vacuum thoroughly to remove any eggs left behind from larvae so they don&rsquo;t hatchback into adults later on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Carpets should be professionally shampooed as well because it&rsquo;s hard to get at the flea egg deposits beneath the fibers without using a special product for this purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure not only to spot-clean (or steam clean) upholstery but also floors: In some cases, eggs can survive for months when laid on hard surfaces like tile or linoleum.
If you&rsquo;re having trouble with fleas in the home or in the carpet, a three-step process is essential.</li>
<li>First, treat your cat or dog for fleas using either anover-the-counter remedy or prescription treatmentas prescribed by your veterinarian.</li>
<li>Next, apply chemical treatments to carpets and furniture (unless it will damage the finish) to kill any adult fleas left on these areas of infested surfaces anduse a flea spray.</li>
<li>Finally,vacuum all floorsand wash bedding and other items that cannot be laundered in hot water.
&hellip;but fleas eggs may also fall on the pet bed, furniture, couch, or carpet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flea eggs can hatch in a matter of days or weeks, depending on the conditions where they&rsquo;re present including humidity and temperature - and thus a fresh re-infestation.</p>
<p>Flea eggs are the only stage of fleas that is not killed with adults-killing insecticides, so it&rsquo;s best to avoid using these products including
flea bombs or foggers
.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, exterminators recommend treating carpets with insecticides that haveinsect growth regulators (IGR)ssuch as Precor that has (S)-Methoprene andPermethrinIGRs.
To prevent re-infestation, you will need to
give them a flea collar
and scrub your pets with a
quality flea shampoo
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-steps-to-getting-rid-of-fleas-in-the-carpet---fastest-way">3 Steps to Getting Rid Of Fleas in the Carpet - Fastest Way</h2>
<p>When taking on a flea infestation, one of the most important places to focus is your home&rsquo;s carpet.</p>
<p>Below are the key steps to take when you&rsquo;re perplexed as to how best to handle their flea problem on their floor or in their carpets.</p>
<h3 id="1-vacuum-cleaner-for-fleas-on-carpet">1. Vacuum Cleaner for Fleas on Carpet</h3>
<p>Hi, everyone! What&rsquo;s this? It looks like a vacuum cleaner. Can you hear that sound it makes?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yep, that&rsquo;s the sound of your carpet being sucked up into its tank to keep fleas from riding around on top of your floor and biting you when you have bare feet.
Maybe vacuuming the carpet won&rsquo;t kill all the fleas in your home, but it&rsquo;ll play a great role.</li>
</ul>
<p>A vacuum cleaner will remove fleas on the carpet, but it can&rsquo;t replace a professional pest control treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the contrary, I recommend using an IGR flea fogger such as Precor - about a week after flea-treating your pets.
However, vacuums will reduce the flea population in your home, especially those fleas and eggs that just won&rsquo;t die and are hanging out on the carpet.</li>
</ul>
<p>An unexpected side effect of vacuuming is that you might actually be trapping fleas and their eggs in your vacuum.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, when you&rsquo;re done vacuuming, remember to throw the bag or empty out your vacuum so that fleas can&rsquo;t take up residence in it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-steam-cleaning-the-carpet">2. Steam Cleaning the Carpet</h3>
<p>A steam cleaner is a great way to get rid of fleas- it kills the eggs and larvae. However, it is not something that you should do without taking precautions.</p>
<p>Steam Cleaning the Carpet for Fleas is a process that uses high-pressure steam to remove dirt - plus
flea dirt
, fleas, and organisms like bacteria from carpets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step One: Fill up your clean pot with water and then boil it on the stove until it reaches all of the safety marks; you can now turn off the stove because we are ready for step two.</li>
<li>Step Two: Pour some dish soap into a bucket or container full of hot water (you should have already boiled this) so that you create bubbles in there if needed.</li>
<li>Next, add twelve ounces worth of white vinegar before pouring out about eight inches deep into your carpet cleaner machine to mix with the soap.</li>
<li>Step Three: Fill up your carpet cleaner machine with hot water and then add in two to three ounces of dish detergent for maintenance cleaning, or one scoop of powdered enzyme cleaner if you want a deep clean.</li>
<li>Lastly, pour out about eight inches worth of this mixture into your carpet cleaner machine before turning on the power button so that it starts heating up.</li>
<li>Plugin the steam cleaner hose, as well as turn on its heat until some fog, comes out from it; now you can start pulling away any stains by attaching an accessory like a scrub brush.</li>
<li>Step Four: Once finished, let everything dry for at least 24 hours before vacuuming so that dirt isn&rsquo;t re-deposited onto your carpets.
It&rsquo;s too soon to start living with your pets again after chemicals like IGRs have been sprayed.</li>
<li>You should wait an entire week before letting them back into the areas that were treated or it could trigger a flea infestation and put you on the fast track to suffering from allergies.

<h3 id="3-kill-fleas-on-carpet-with-baking-soda">3. Kill Fleas on Carpet with Baking soda</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a creative way to kill fleas that live on your carpet, then look no further! Baking soda is an unusually effective and inexpensive solution.</p>
<p>When used alone, baking soda may not be as effective as it should be. So in order to make the treatment more potent, mix equal parts of baking soda with finely ground salt (salt and pepper would work too).</p>
<p>To test the potency and freshness of your baking soda, mix 1 tsp. with vinegar and see if it bubbles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dab the baking soda and salt solution into the carpet using little strokes.</li>
<li>Make sure to cover the entire surface of the carpet evenly with some mixture remaining on a small area that can be rubbed into the fibers.</li>
<li>You can use a brush to thoroughly cover the entire surface of your carpet with baking soda.</li>
<li>Treat the flea-infested area and let it settle for at least 12 hours before you vacuum.

</ul>
<h2 id="what-can-i-use-for-fleas-on-my-furniture">What Can I Use for Fleas on my Furniture?</h2>
<p>Sometimes fleas choose to go into your furniture for a hiding place. Thankfully, killing fleas on your furniture doesn&rsquo;t need to be complicated or expensive.</p>
<ul>
<li>The flea larvae and eggs will also drop on the dressers, table, and couch as the cat or dog moves around the house.
That being said, the first thing you should do to control fleas on your furniture is by using an insecticide that comes with an IGR (Insect Growth Regulator).</li>
<li>IGRs will prevent the eggs and larvae from hatching or hinder maturing of pupae, which will help keep your home free of fleas.
Your last step is to vacuum your furniture, which will remove the fleas. The right tool for the job will depend on what type of flooring and furniture you have;</li>
<li>But in general terms, a good attachment should work well across many surfaces.
If you want a more natural solution for getting rid of fleas in carpeting, then try using diatomaceous earth (DE). DE is made from the fossilized shells of ancient sea creatures and it&rsquo;s toxic to fleas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DE will work by sucking out any moisture in the carpet, which coupled with its sharp edges prevents flea eggs from hatching; this is because the DE scratches up their exoskeleton.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the only way to get rid of fleas is by using a tool that can reach the deepest parts of your carpet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other times, all you need are some simple tips and tricks like vacuuming regularly or spraying insecticide onto fabrics where they might be hiding.</li>
<li>IGR Insecticides will kill adult fleas on contact but will also prevent eggs from hatching.
I hope this post was helpful.</li>

<h3 id="1-vinegar-trap-apple-cider-vinegar-or-white-vinegar">1. Vinegar Trap (apple cider vinegar or white vinegar)</h3>
<p>Vinegar trap is my best homemade Trap that will trap over 70% of fruit flies in your house or compound.
You will need to have the following requirements: vinegar (either apple cider or white vinegar), a glass jar or bottle with a narrow entrance (20 cm to 30 cm depth), a piece of cellophane, or polythene paper, and a rubber band.
Once these are in place, carry out the following procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pour 10 to 30 ml of vinegar in either glass or bottle gently.</li>
<li>Tilt the container slightly and shake to ensure some vinegar sticks on the wall.</li>
<li>Close/seal the glass or bottle (for the container, it&rsquo;s not necessary to seal always) with cellophane or polythene paper. Then tighten with the rubber band.</li>
<li>Using a sharp narrow device, make a few tiny holes on the cellophane or polythene paper.</li>
<li>Place the vinegar trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
You will require to make two or three vinegar traps in case the swam of the fruit flies is large.</li>
<li>This Trap&rsquo;s principle is that vinegar emits an attractive scent that lures the fruit flies into the bottle or glass).</li>
<li>Once the fruit flies enter the container (through the tiny holes), they cannot come out (they get trapped inside).
Apple cider vinegar is more potent than white vinegar due to nectary spices added to it. You will require to empty the Trap after every 2 to 3 days. Check these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fly-trap/">commercial fly traps</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-old-wine-or-beer-bottle-trap">2. Old wine or beer bottle Trap</h3>
<p>A bottle of old wine or beer can be used as a fruit fly trap since the old fermented wine or beer releases a scent that attracts the fruit flies.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will require to leave your wine/beer bottle after use for 1 to 7 days (to allow wine/beer leftovers to ferment).</li>
<li>Then, seal the bottle with cellophane or nylon/polythene paper.</li>
<li>Poke few beautiful holes on the paper with a tiny sharp object.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
The fruit flies attracted by the fermented scent will be trapped inside the bottle. You can even leave the bottle without sealing (though this may not catch 100% of the fruit flies that get in  some may manage to escape).
Alternatively, you can ferment wine or beer (leave 10ml of wine/beer in an open jar for five days).</li>
<li>Pour it into a bottle (Trap) and shake well to ensure it sticks on the wall before setting the Trap in the area manifested with fruit flies.</li>
<li>You will need to empty the wine trap daily by rinsing the trapped fruit flies.
Avoid
placing the Trap in the living
room since it may pull some fruit flies around (even if it&rsquo;s in the corridor or kitchen, the scent is strong enough to attract fruit flies).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fruitsfruits-peel-jar-trap">3. Fruits/fruits peel jar Trap</h3>
<p>Fruit jar fruit fly trap is made up of many fruit types cut and put together in a jar. To make one at home, you will need to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut into small pieces of various fruits such as mangoes, oranges, sugarcane, pawpaw, avocado, watermelon, etc. Place them in a basin or glass jar.</li>
<li>Seal the basin/jar with cellophane or polythene/cling paper colorless (this enables the fruit flies and owner to view inside).</li>
<li>Poke the seal with a tiny sharp object to create a path for fruit flies to get in and also fermenting scent to leave the jar/basic.</li>
<li>Place the inappropriate Trap place near fruit flies infestation (kitchen, compound/field).
When ripe fruits begin to rot, they release a sharp scent that can attract fruit flies over 20 feet away.
They will enter the jar and get trapped there. Therefore, you will not need to put too many pieces in a given jar for economic purposes.
Alternatively, you can place the peels from fruits such as mangoes, bananas, pawpaw, avocadoes, or potatoes in a jar, seal, and poke tiny holes.
These peels begin fermenting in a day and emitting a scent that attracts fruit flies in the vicinity. After a substantial amount of fruit flies are trapped, it is necessary to empty the Trap and fill it with fresh fruits/peels.

<h3 id="4-dish-soap-trap">4. Dish soap Trap</h3>
<p>You can use
dish soap
to clean utensils, kitchen, sinks, and showers to make a homemade fruit fly trap. The fragrance and diethanolamine chemicals act as attractants of fruit flies into the Trap.
To make a homemade dish soap fruit fly trap, you will need to follow the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect/fetch available dish soap and place it in a glass jar/container (diameter of 20  30 cm and a depth of 30  40 cm).</li>
<li>Add some little water to dilute it slightly (ensure you form a sticky and viscous substance that will help stick the fruit flies).</li>
<li>Seal the glass jar with colorless polythene or cellophane and poke tiny holes on it.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near a fruit fly&rsquo;s manifested areas.
The working principle in this Trap is using a sticking mechanism. Once the attracted fruit flies land/step on the sticky, viscous dish soap, they will get stuck/trapped and die there.
Normally, the Trap may take 3 to 7 days to trap a substantial number of fruit fries. The attractant smell will intensify as days go by due to the fermentation process.
It is not advisable to hold long trapped fruit flies as they may decompose, thus messing with the Trap. You will, therefore, require to empty the Trap after every 5 to 8 days of use.
In such a case, you can scoop the top layer of the dish soap and top up the remainder with a fresh one, or else you replace the entire decoy (dish soap).
Alternatively, you can spice your dish soap trap with some vinegar or ripe fruits to boost the bait&rsquo;s attraction strength. This is usually in a cold area where low temperatures highly inhibit scent diffusion.

<h3 id="5-banana-jar-trap">5. Banana jar Trap</h3>
<p>Banana jar trap is one of its own kind, an independent fruit fly trap that doesn&rsquo;t require any spicing attractant (apple cider or fragrance) for quality performance.
A ripen banana emits a sharp scent that pulls fruit flies over 20 to 30 feet away. Carry out the following to create your homemade banana trap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peel the well-ripen bananas (1 to 3 pieces) and cut them into small sizes (about 2inches).</li>
<li>Put the banana slices into a clear glass jar or container (at least 15 cm deep).</li>
<li>Seal the jar with colorless polythene paper or cellophane.</li>
<li>Poke tiny holes on the seal to allow the fruit flies in and expel the banana scent into the vicinity.</li>
<li>Place your banana trap near a fruit flies infested area.
The attracted fruit flies will get in and get trapped (they won&rsquo;t be able to fly out). This Trap can also be used in the living room without interfering with the comfort of the occupants.
Empty the Trap after every 2 to 3 days of use. This Trap may be uneconomical if you spend more bananas (stick to a minimum of one or two per Trap).
Alternatively, you can slice the banana peels and repeat the same procedure above.
However, the peels may take slightly longer to rot and release an attractant smell. When banana peels decompose, they may emit an unpleasant odor and leave a dirty spell in your jar (though they are useful too).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-red-wine-trick-trap">6. Red wine trick Trap</h3>
<p>Red wine is known to emit an attractant smell that pulls fruit flies from the packaged/crate. Therefore, you can make a red wine trick fruit fly trap by carrying out the following step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle little red wine on the red wine bottle (closed/not used).</li>
<li>Place the bottle in a colorless glass jar (about 30 to 50 cm deep).</li>
<li>Seal the container with colorless polythene paper or cellophane and poke the tiny holes on the seal.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pour any red wine at the bottom of the jar or container.</li>
<li>Place your Red wine trick trap near fruit flies infested area or living room.
Once the fruit flies are attracted to the glass jar or container, they tend to cling to the red wine bottle as they try to get into the feast on the sweet scent (trick).
The smell released by red wine is strong enough to attract fruit flies over 40 feet away.
Once a large number of Fruit flies have accumulated on the red wine bottle wall, seal the glass jar once more (to close the holes) to suffocate the trapped fruit flies for 1 to 4 hours.</li>
<li>Then, empty the jar by rubbing off the dead fruit flies stuck on the red wine bottle&rsquo;s wall.</li>
<li>The advantage of this fruit fly trap is that you can re-use the red wine bottle before drinking the content (red wine).
It can also be used in the living room without disturbance to occupants (the fruit flies always flew in and get trapped  no external movement).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-paper-cone--oldrotten-fruits-trap">7. Paper cone &amp; old/rotten fruits Trap</h3>
<p>To make a paper cone &amp; old/rotten fruits Trap, you will need a white/purple/pink pain-writing pad, a Glass jar (60 cm depth and 20 cm diameter), and old or rotten fruits. Carry the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the old fruits (could be rotting avocado, oranges, pineapples, grapes, mangoes, or pawpaw) in a colorless glass jar.</li>
<li>Make a cone (with a narrow opening at one of its ends) using plain paper and place it on a glass jar/container.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
This trap work by preventing fruit flies from getting out once they flew in. The colorless glass jar (help in observation) and rotting/fermenting smell pulls fruit flies into the Trap through the entrance (cone opening).</li>
<li>The cone&rsquo;s conical shape prevents the fruit flies from flying back once in (hence trapping them).</li>
<li>This Trap is not suitable for the living room.
Though it can be used in the kitchen, it&rsquo;s supposed to be kept in an enclosed place (the rotting old fruits smell is not pleasant). The Trap
is best suited for outdoors
and near decomposing materials, near the bins or flowerbeds.
Empty the Trap after every two to 4 days to reduce the adverse effect of rotting fruits on the surroundings.

<h3 id="8-heated-milk-sugar--pepper-trap">8. Heated Milk/ Sugar &amp; Pepper Trap</h3>
<p>In this kind of Trap, you will require to have milk (powder or liquid form), black/red peppers (around five pieces), sugar (a quarter kilogram), and a glass jar or basin (depth 30cm and 50cm diameter - approximate).
Follow this procedure to come up with a trap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 80ml of milk (add water if you are using milk powder) with sugar and heat for 3 to 7 minutes while stirring until the entire sugar dissolves.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into the glass jar and shake to allow it to stick to the container&rsquo;s sidewall.</li>
<li>Grind the pepper, sprinkle in the mixture and stir for a few seconds.</li>
<li>Make sure the milk foams form a sticky top layer.</li>
<li>Set the Trap near the fruit flies infected area. In case the infestation is massive, make two or three of these traps.
The sugar acts as a spice, which, when mixed with milk, will emit an attractive scent that pulls the fruit flies into the Trap. The milk has a sticky substance that traps and drowns fruit flies on landing/stepping. The pepper will emit a spicy scent that poisons the surface of the milk-making fruit flies to fall faster. This Trap should not be kept near the kids (pepper emission will make one shed tears).
You will need to empty the Trap after 4 to 6 days by pouring the entire mixture. Though expensive, heated milk/sugar &amp; pepper trap can kill many fruit flies (it may eradicate the whole colony of fruit flies with a subsequent number of times).

<ul>
<li>The combination of pesticide sprays and vacuum is another effective method of removing fleas from your home.</li>
<li>Areas such as those under the bed, furniture, and even hard-to-reach areas cannot be treated.</li>
<li>Vacuuming these areas will ensure that no traces of dead fleas and eggs will remain -check flea eggs vs. dandruff.</li>
<li>You can also use flea traps to remove fleas. There are many brands of flea traps available in the market. The lighteasily attracts fleas.
Flea bombs with IGRs like S-methoprene in Precor Plus will also inhibit the flea&rsquo;s life cycle, killing the flea larvae and their eggs - check the

</ul>
<h2 id="2-flea-combs-">**2. Flea Combs **</h2>
<p>Combs provide alternatives to
topical treatments

Dog flea-killers
. Use the
flea comb on the cats
(or even the
Electronic Flea Comb
) and run it through the fur of your pet.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also check for more fleas by looking into black specks in the fur and skin of your dog. If there are indeed, then it&rsquo;s time to act.</li>
<li>In the battle against these creatures, time plays an important part.There are alternativetreatments for puppy fleas- comb the dog thoroughly.
While combing your dog&rsquo;s hair, you should have a standby bowl with you so that you can have something to place the contents of the comb after. Once you&rsquo;re done, you could drown the remaining material in the toilet.</li>

<ul>
<li>Diatomaceous Earth(DE) is a finely ground powder with sharp edges that rapture the flea&rsquo;s skin and absorb its moisture. The powder is sourced from the ocean floors from algae.</li>
<li>There is no doubt that DE plusboraxis an excellent natural flea control method that can offer all-year-round protection against fleas.
You&rsquo;ll need to sprinkle the DE powder in the pet houses. Further, do not assume that locking your pet will prevent fleas from infestation. It is important to control the fleas inside the pet house too.</li>
</ul>

      <description>*What&amp;#39;s the best way to kill roaches*</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What&rsquo;s the best way to kill roaches</em>
? Well, here&rsquo;s a summary; Traps, Baits, Sprays, and Growth Regulators (IGR) with their method of roach killing.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-killer-for-apartments/">Contact roach killers</a>and Roach Repellents,</li>
<li>Roach killers with secondary kill effect and Gel baits (contain both an attractant and roach poison), and</li>
<li>Diatomaceous earth powder(breaks the roaches&rsquo; exoskeleton and fatally removes its body fluid).
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Get Rid of a Heavy Roach Infestation&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
<em>Side note: To control German roaches effectively, cut the bug&rsquo;s access to water by cleaning clogged drains or repairing leaking plumbing work.</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Further,* for roach prevention, you can use secure food storage and thoroughly clean your spaces daily.*</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-step-1-use-glue-strips-and-flashlight"><strong>1. Step 1: Use Glue Strips and Flashlight</strong></h2>
<h3 id="i-flashlight"><em>(i) Flashlight</em></h3>
<p>First, it&rsquo;ll help do a roach examination at your house. For this, pick some flashlights to check the hidden places for roaches.
Such areas include bathroom closets and cabinets, closet door corners, cracks in shelves and cabinets, under the kitchen sink, and behind your refrigerator.</p>
<h3 id="ii-roach-glue-strips"><em>(ii) Roach glue strips</em></h3>
<p>Next, you can apply roach glue strips to determine if you have a massive roach infestation in your home.
Considering the observation, you made using the flashlight, you&rsquo;ll need to put the roach glue strips on the highly strategic places. So, maintain the strips in those areas while monitoring for 4-7 days.
Therefore, the strips that&rsquo;ll catch more roaches will signify the highly infested areas in your house and thus must get more aggressive roach treatment.</p>
<h2 id="2-step-2-seal-any-crevices-and-cracks-with-caulk"><strong>2. Step 2: Seal any Crevices and Cracks with Caulk</strong></h2>
<p>The roach
killers, such as traps, will help exterminate the bugs
. However, these products won&rsquo;t significantly prevent roaches that are outdoors from getting into your house.
Installing caulk on any openings that roaches might use will help limit roach re-infestation through areas like entry holes, tiny cracks and crevices, and gaps in your tiles and walls.
Further, you can install weather stripping on your operable trunks, windows, and doors.</p>
<h2 id="3-step-3-set-up-roach-baits-and-roach-traps"><strong>3. Step 3: Set Up Roach Baits and Roach Traps.</strong></h2>
<h3 id="a-roach-baits"><em>a. Roach Baits</em></h3>
<p>Roach bait is an indoor roach killer or poison that exploits <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/">cockroaches</a>&rsquo; emetophobic, coprophagic, and cannibalistic trends.
Gel bait stations will come in tubes that you can squeeze into crevices and cracks and under baseboards.
The roaches that&rsquo;ll be poisoned go back to their roach nest, vomit, or even die. Therefore, the roaches in the nest will cannibalize (eat the dead roach) or eat their vomit, and hence this will pass the active bait poison to them.
There are different types of roach bait for various roach species you can use for indoor and outdoor spaces.
But roach baits may make many roaches die in several areas of your house - and thus, you&rsquo;ll need to vacuum thoroughly in 3-7 days.
Also, Granular baits are mainly used in outdoor spaces such as mulched areas where roaches hide and breed in the house.
But they can also be used in wall voids and attics. To control the roach colony, the baits should contain Hydramethylnon 2% and Fipronil 0.05%.
Avoid using baits in combination with other insecticides. The insecticide can spoil the bait and thus would neutralize the domino impact/ secondary kill effect. Also, the roach would die before scattering the bait poison to the nests.</p>
<h3 id="b-roach-traps"><em>b. Roach Traps</em></h3>
<p>Roach tarps of bait stations provide a no-mess
method to control
the roaches in your apartment. The baits attract the roaches with an enticing chemical smell, and thus they eat the bait and die.
Further, roach traps employ both a trap and a containment technique to control the roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>The roach trap will also injure and contain the roach if it tries to escape if the poison bait does not kill it.</li>
<li>Bait stations are designed to kill the roach slowly. After consuming the bait, the roach carries the poison back to their nest and disperse it to other insects.
Equally, use the same principle while baiting insects. The foraging worker ants need to be the bait to carry the poisonous bait back to the ant nest.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-step-3-sprinkle-boric-acid-and-use-roach-sprays"><strong>4. Step 3: Sprinkle Boric Acid and Use Roach Sprays.</strong></h2>
<h3 id="a-boric-acid-powder"><em>a. Boric Acid Powder</em></h3>
<p>Boric Acid is created from boron plus water, making it extremely toxic to roaches but is safe for pets and humans. Normally boric acid occurs in toothpaste and washing detergent - but it&rsquo;s in powder form for roach control.
Avoid placing the boric acid powder near places with air currents, and this would blow it away from roaches or onto places with pets and kids.
Boric acid is naturally found in the ground, and they act through contact and ingestion. Borax will stick to the bug&rsquo;s body, or they&rsquo;ll eat it and damage its nervous system, causing a fatality.
Some of us sometimes need a product that&rsquo;ll work with no complications, such as becoming toxic to kids and pets.
If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you&rsquo;d thus go for some of the powdered roach killers such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">Boric acid/ borax powder</a>
.
However, the interesting bit is that the roaches will carry the boric acid back to their nest, poison the other insects, and help wipe the whole roach population.</p>
<h3 id="b-roach-sprays"><em>b. Roach Sprays</em></h3>
<p>Most of the users love roach spray apart from some that have pungent smells. The sprays have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenothrin">D-phenothrin</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prallethrin">prallethrin</a>
as the active ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li>The roach sprays can be used on cracks, crevices, and furniture to effectively reach the roach nests.</li>
<li>The pyrethrum ingredient enters the roaches cuticle to bind the nerves sodium channels and thus stopping body activities such as heartbeat and breathing in the apartment.
Despite being a very harmful nerve agent to roaches, the pyrethrum is nontoxic to human beings and other mammals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-roach-killer-bombs"><em>c. Roach Killer Bombs</em></h3>
<p>Roach
bombs or foggers
are effective in treating a large cockroach infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, youll need to learn when to use thebest roach bomb for the houseas it can be less efficient in roaches hidden in voids.
Place the roach bomb in the middle of the room and set it off to allow the insecticide to move up and settle down, killing roaches on contact.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-insect-growth-regulators-igrs"><strong>5. Insect growth regulators (IGRs)</strong></h2>
<p>IGRs are categorized as insecticides that do not kill the roach instantly but adversely affect its ability to grow and mature naturally.
IGRs block the cockroaches ability to reproduce or grow into an adult.</p>
<ul>
<li>The IGRs will ensure that the roaches in your house do not develop another generation in their population as it will decrease their capacity to grow or reproduce.</li>
<li>Some IGRs mimic the natural growth hormones and are thus named juvenoid IGRs.
They affect the length in which the roach remains in the larval or nymphal stage and the time when it turns into an adult.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you expose the cockroach nymphs to the juvenoid IGRs, they develop infertile adults or will not molt into adults.
Also, the chemicals can affect the roaches adult life by blocking the creation of
viable roach eggs
. As a birth control method, the IGR will help prevent the development of

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you sighted a streak of <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">ants</a> crawling around in your car? Well, rest assured that you are not the only one wanting to get rid of ants in the car and
avoid their bites
.</p>
<p>Even though you may normally come across ants in your house devouring food crumbs or colonizing your back yard, but when ants invade your car they can be a hazardous distraction.</p>
<p>If you are tired of all the failed attempts to get rid of ants in your car, read our detailed guide to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why ants get in your car</li>
<li>How to identify different kinds of ants</li>
<li>What techniques to apply to get rid of ants in the car
Ants are not too picky when it comes to choosing a place to nest. Theyll feel at home anywhere as long as it is moist, warm and has a food supply nearby  even if its your car! And when this happens, you should be prepared to be bugged and have damaged wires, switches or cables in your dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-ants-invade-your-car">Why Ants Invade Your Car</h2>
<p>To be able to effectively get rid of ants in the car, it is important to understand why they infested there in the first place. Cars are an uncommon place for ants to nest, but when they do it is due to either one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your car was parked near an <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-naturally-outside/">ant</a> colony for a long time. Ant colonies are normally near a kitchen or trash cans, so if your garage is nearby, this is probably why they got into your car.</li>
<li>You have water leaking in or near your car. Many ants like to nest near water sources just like they do near food sources.</li>
<li>Your car has the odor of stale or sweet-smelling food. If ants detect this smell they will quickly invade the car.
Whatever the reason, it all comes down to food. But if you have found ants in your car, will they stay there forever? Ants usually have two main motives when taking over any place.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accidental-infestation">Accidental Infestation</h3>
<p>It is possible that some ants accidentally stumbled across your car in search of food. Even if you threw away the food cans or cleaned all the leftovers in your car, the smell of food probably stayed for some time and attracted some ants meanwhile. If you have found ants in the car during this phase, theres no need to worry. Their stay is only temporary and will leave when they find no food.</p>
<p>Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-naturally-outside/">How to Get Rid of Ants Naturally Outside??</a></p>
<h3 id="permanent-infestation">Permanent Infestation</h3>
<p>It is hard to get rid of ants in the car when they decide to inhabit your car permanently. This happens when ants have evidence of food sources being present in the car. They may either start transferring the food to their colonies or just simply colonize your car instead. Anything ranging from food wrappers to sticky soda residue can attract ants in the car. Some experts have suggested that even the insulation of wires is enough to attract ants because it emits a slight scent of vanilla when its warm. The trick is to instantly take measures to get rid of ants in the car as soon as you see ants crowding.</p>
<h2 id="identify-the-type-of-ants-in-your-car">Identify the Type of Ants in Your Car</h2>
<p>You may feel that it is useless to put time and effort in the identification of ants. But did you know that out of thousands of ant species, only a few species are likely to nest in cars? Even the slightest knowledge of ant species can spare you plenty of time when deciding which technique to use to get rid of ants in the car.</p>
<h3 id="carpenter-ants">Carpenter Ants</h3>
<p>Appearing in shades of red and black, a carpenter ant is a quarter to half an inch in size. These can mostly be found near trees and tend to eat insects and anything with a sweet taste. Carpenter ants are usually active at night and if you disturb them they emit a strong smell to warn other ants. So you will have to devise a plan that could trap all carpenter ants at once.</p>
<h3 id="pharaoh-ants">Pharaoh Ants</h3>
<p>These light-colored ants can appear to be anywhere between yellow to light brown. Pharaoh ants are smaller in size  almost 1/16 inches long! They feed on insects, sweets, fats, and proteins, but prefer to nest near a water source. Their size allows for fast reproduction and enables them can quickly change locations if they get too crowded or disturbed.</p>
<h3 id="thief-ants">Thief Ants</h3>
<p>Extremely small in size, thief ants love greasy foods and proteins. These light brown ants live near other ant nests so that they can easily steal food.</p>
<h3 id="pavement-ants">Pavement Ants</h3>
<p>These dark-colored ants are aggressive to other ants. They can be found nesting near lawns or under stones or wood. Pavement ants feed on both greasy and sweet food.</p>
<h2 id="5-simple-ways-of-dealing-with-ants-in-the-car">5 simple Ways of Dealing with Ants in the Car</h2>
<p>Now that you know why and what kind of ants infested your car, choose one or a combination of the following ways to get rid of ants in the car for good.</p>
<h3 id="1-change-parking-locations">1. Change Parking Locations</h3>
<p>This is the first thing to do when you spot ants in your car. If your parking spot is near trees or bushes, it is likely to make it convenient for ants such as carpenter ants to check out for food.</p>
<p>We suggest that you keep changing your cars parking location now and then to discourage ants from nesting. And dont forget to keep your windows closed at all times to restrict access.</p>
<h3 id="2-thoroughly-clean-the-car">2. Thoroughly Clean the Car</h3>
<p>The easiest way to get rid of ants in the car is by thoroughly cleaning it. A spotless and properly vacuumed car will not only be free of any attractive food source for the ants but will also force them to move away. To ensure that your car is clean you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove any food wrappers, packaging or leftover food items in your car.</li>
<li>Vacuum the crevices of your car seats</li>
<li>Wash out any surface and car floor mats</li>
<li>Dust off all the interior edges and surface of the car</li>
<li>Clean all the food stains on seats, dashboard or center console using a chemical cleaner</li>
<li>Slide the seats backward to access the floor underneath

</ul>
<h3 id="3-wash-the-car-exterior">3. Wash the Car Exterior</h3>
<p>If parking at a different spot doesnt help, chances are that the ants had already set up a trail to follow. All kinds of ants leave behind traces of pheromones that help them to direct other ants toward the food source. So your car will still be accessible to these ants if it is not too much out of the smelling range of ant colonies.</p>
<p>Washing the exterior body of your car will eliminate these pheromones and clean out any tracks that the ants could use to trace back in the car. This technique will help you to get rid of ants in the car if you:</p>

<li>Properly wash the tires. To deter ants from climbing the tires, use a certified chemical to clean the wheels of your car.</li>

<h3 id="4-try-natural--diy-remedies">4. Try Natural &amp; DIY Remedies</h3>
<p>Non-toxic remedies can be an efficient way of getting rid of ants in the car. These are ideal to opt for if you have children who frequently travel in your car or play around it. Some of the best options to choose from are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cayenne Pepper. Spread this pepper around the tires of your car and even inside it. Its deterrent properties will keep the ants away.</li>
<li>**Lemon extract.**Squeeze lemons in a bottle of water and then spray the mixture in areas where there are colonies of ants. Because ants hate the smell of lemon, they will soon vacate the car.</li>
<li>Chalk. Draw lines around your car and its tires with chalk. It is made up of calcium carbonate which acts as an ant repellent.</li>
<li>Table salt. Boil water and add some salt in it. Then spray this mixture over infested areas.</li>

<h3 id="5-set-up-ant-traps">5. Set Up Ant Traps</h3>
<p>If cleaning is not keeping the ants away and you dont have time to carry out the home remedies, you should probably resort to ant traps.</p>
<p>If the infestation is really bad and you want to get rid of ants in the car immediately, you will need toxic traps or pesticides to eliminate the problem. The pesticides are easy to use and can be placed near the entry points of ants or on their trail.</p>
<p>Ant traps will trap any ants in your car by using baits to attract them and since these baits are poisonous, the ants will be killed in the process. Some benefits of using ant traps instead of pesticides are:</p>
<ul>
<li>They dont contaminate the inside of your car.</li>
<li>They are odorless so you will not experience any unpleasant smells.</li>
<li>They come in different forms including granules, liquid, and gels.</li>
<li>If one ant eats the bait, it carries the poison back to its colony where it destroys the ant population

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You must have noticed some
<a href="http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Formicidae/">ants</a>
, maybe little or black, in your bathroom. Did the ants in the bathroom appear at the same time last year? Are the ants also in the upstairs bathroom?</p>
<p>Well, this is a worrying issue, mainly when you have yourself, kids, and pets around the house and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-%5Bant%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-car/)-killer/">kitchen</a>
. Therefore, how do you get rid of <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-naturally-outside/">ants</a> in the bathroom?
<strong>First:�</strong>
Ants appearing in the bathroom is not an uncommon occurrence. They are attracted by
human hair
, stagnant water, or drains. Also, ants are attracted by lotions, perfumes, and toothpaste due to their sweet taste and smell.</p>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Ants Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="characteristic-features-of-ants-">**Characteristic features of ants **</h2>
<p><strong>-</strong>
Ants can bite and sting, but most are harmless, with no venom. Ants measure about a length of 0.6 to 0.9 cm and have six legs and 3-4 abdominal segments.
<strong>-</strong>
A characteristic feature of ants is the metapleural gland that produces phenylacetic acid to fight bacteria and fungi.</p>
<ul>
<li>The metapleural gland is created from 2 cell clusters that point to 2 chambers at the back of the insects middle section. However, the metapleural gland is not present in all ants, particularly among the arboreal species.
<strong>-</strong>
The ants head connects to the thorax through the as thin neck. Further, the thorax connects to the abdomen through a thin &ldquo;waist.&rdquo;
<strong>-</strong>
However, the main distinguishing feature of ants is their waist pinched down at the back in the link with its abdomen.</li>

<h3 id="1-understand-the-ant-colony-">**1. Understand the ant colony� **</h3>
<p>Knowing the specific insect that is in your bathroom will be important, particularly when determining which
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flying-ants-vs-termites/">pest control</a>
product of the method to use.</p>
<p>Notably, ants have over 12,000 species globally. For example, there are black and red ants. Ants are considered
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality">eusocial insects</a>
that are in the Formicidae family.</p>
<p>Other insects in the Formicidae family and order Hymenoptera are ichneumons, sawflies, and wasps.
Where is the queen?
Ants live in a colony with the drones, soldiers, queen, and worker ants. The queen bee is a critical part of the ant colony as it lays all the eggs that hatch into ants. The queen does not leave its nest and is thus difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>However, to wipe out the ant colony from your bathroom, you should devise ways to kill the queen and stop the ants&rsquo; reproduction process.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you only
spray the visible ants
, the ant colony will continue growing.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-attracting-the-trailing-ant"><strong>2. What is attracting the trailing ant?</strong></h3>
<p>Youll need to trail the ants and determine what is attracting them to your bathroom. Therefore, youll need to watch the ants determine their origin and destination in your house.</p>
<p>Notably, an ant that finds food leaves a trail on its way back to its nest, and thus, other ants will follow the same trail to come for food at the same location.</p>

<p>Though hardly noticeable at first, these bites end up becoming irritable and embarrassing scars. So, how can you treat bed bug bite scars?
<strong>In summary, to get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-bed-bugs-fast/">rid</a> of <a href="/posts/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/">bed</a> bug bite scars, use (1) over-the-counter medications like corticosteroid creams and lotions, retinoid creams, Mederma advanced scar gel, vitamin E oil or (2) home remedies like baking soda, aloe Vera gel, and lemon juice.</strong></p>
<h2 id="use-over-the-counter-medications">Use Over-The-Counter Medications</h2>
<p>Wash the skin area with an antiseptic soap and clean water. This will help reduce the itching and also prevent occurrence of a skin infection.</p>
<h3 id="1-corticosteroid-creams-and-lotions">1. Corticosteroid creams and lotions</h3>
<p>Corticosteroid creams and lotions have antipruritic properties that make them potent remedies for skin allergy and itchiness.
They reduce histamine release to the areas that have been bitten by bed bugs, thus minimizing inflammation and itching. One of the best corticosteroid cream in the market is Cortizone 10 Maximum Strength.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash the affected area with cool water and allow it to dry naturally</li>
<li>Apply a thin layer of the cream and massage gently until it disappears</li>
<li>Do not exceed 1-2 applications in a day</li>
<li>If you are using other skin treatments, allow about 30 minutes before applying to avoid them mixing on your skin</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-retinoid-creams">2. Retinoid creams</h3>
<p>Retinoid creams can be used to reduce scarring and improve the appearance of scars from bed bug bites. Retinoids are not meant to treat the scars, but to diminish them. I recommend using Retinol Serum.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>

<li>Do not use the gel on fresh bed bug bites- wait until the bites have closed up</li>
<li>Also do not use it on children below 6 months old</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-vitamin-e-oil">4. Vitamin E Oil</h3>
<p>Vitamin E has been proven to be a potent remedy for skin rejuvenation. When applied to a bed bug scar, vitamin E cream will promote skin healing, thus reducing the scarring.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the scar thoroughly to remove oils and bacteria</li>
<li>Break the capsule with a pin and squeeze out the oil on a cotton ball</li>
<li>Dab the oil on the scar lightly without rubbing</li>
<li>Do not touch or spill the oil on clothing.</li>
<li>If you have to cover the wound, let it be for a while, to avoid trapping bacteria and fungus.</li>
<li>Allow 4-5 hours and wash within 8 hours</li>
<li>Use Vitamin E oil once every day until your scars disappear</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-witch-hazel">5. Witch Hazel</h3>
<p>Witch Hazel contains natural Salicylic Acid which has a drying effect on scars. When used on bed bug scars, this natural remedy will disinfect them and promote the healing and scar reduction process. It is enhanced with Aloe Vera for soothing and easing the itchiness.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash the affected skin thoroughly and allow to dry</li>
<li>Test the sensitivity of your skin on a small portion of your skin. You know that your skin is sensitive if theres irritation, redness or rashes. Do not use witch hazel if you have a reaction</li>
<li>Use a cotton ball or pad to apply witch hazel on the affected skin</li>
<li>If you are using witch hazel for the first time, apply once in a day. Once your skin becomes used to it, you can apply 2 times a day

<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Put argan oil and shea butter in bowl. Mix them thoroughly to get a creamy mixtureAdd salicylic acid powder and whisk thoroughly</li>
<li>Add organic lemon oil and mix evenly to get a fine cream.</li>
<li>Apply a small amount of the cream to the affected areas every night until you get satisfactory results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-silicone-gel">7. Silicone Gel</h3>
<p>Silicon gels are some of the newest scar treatment products in the market. Though new, silicon gels have proven to be very effective at improving the appearance of scars resulting from insect bites, sunburns, rashes etc. One of the best silicon gel in the market today is the ScarAway Scar Treatment Gel.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>

<li>How to Identify Bed Bug Bites
Although bed bug bites resemble those of other insects, it is possible to distinguish them using the following observations.
Bed bug bites exhibit a unique pattern. They appear in straight lines or zigzag.
Bed bugs like to attack the exposed parts such as hands, neck shoulders, arms, legs and face. The bites appear as either flat or raised, inflamed, itchy, blistered or red areas on the skin.
Bed bug bites can take as little as a few hours to as much as a whole week to appear on the skin.

<h3 id="1-baking-soda">1. Baking Soda</h3>
<p>The chemicals in a bed bug bite can easily be neutralized using baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate. Being an inflammatory agent, baking soda also helps in reducing the swelling and redness of the bite.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mix one teaspoon of baking soda with three teaspoons of water</li>
<li>Clean the area to be treated.</li>
<li>Apply the mixture evenly to the affected areas and allow about 10 minutes before washing it off</li>
<li>In case the discomfort persists, the process can be repeated after one hour</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cucumber">2. Cucumber</h3>
<p>The anti-inflammatory nature of cucumber peelings and slices makes it an ideal remedy for easing pain and inflammations. They contain vitamin C and caffeic acid, both of which are capable of relieving itching and swelling.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the areas that have been bitten by bed bugs.</li>
<li>Gently place the cucumber slices or peels on the scars</li>
<li>Retain the slices on the affected area for at least 15 minutes</li>
<li>This process can be repeated until the effects of the bite go away.</li>
<li>For a more soothing relief, you can use the slices or peels after they have been chilled in a refrigerator</li>

<p>These bugs suck blood from humans and leave them with itchy welts.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-lavender-kill-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-bed-bug-bite-scars/)/">Bed bugs</a>
can invade your headboards, box springs, bed frames, and even sleeping mattresses. It&rsquo;s no surprise that my readers asked me to craft a comprehensive guide on h
<a href="https://www.bedbugs.umn.edu/bed-bug-control-in-residences">ow to get rid of bed bugs.</a></p>
<h3 id="1-vacuuming-to-kills-bed-bugs">1. Vacuuming to Kills bed bugs</h3>
<p>An excellent step to
eliminating bed bugs
is by vacuuming your home. Concentration should not only be in your bedroom but in other areas of the house. Also, you can use a
bed bug steamer
that&rsquo;s appropriate for the job.
Remember that
bed bugs
can move from one room to another within an apartment.
On this note, it is wise to stop their tracks by vacuuming every item in each roomseal photo frames, toys, books, clothes, and other materials at home when vacuuming. Also, you might need to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">check drain cleaners</a>
that&rsquo;ll help you clear drain clogs.</p>
<h3 id="2-while-traveling-take-proper-caution">2. While Traveling Take Proper Caution:</h3>
<p>It is easy to
pick bed bugs
around metros, hotels, planes, buses, and trains in most developed nations. Theres a common saying that reads, prevention is better than cure. This means that avoiding any way of adult or
baby bed bugs
getting into your property can stifle them to death.
Prominent and reputable motels are
battling with bed bug
issues. So when lodging in a hotel, ensure that your luggage is not exposed on the floor or bed.</p>
<h3 id="3-diatomaceous-earth-powder">3. Diatomaceous Earth Powder</h3>
<p>It is important to note that the
diatomaceous earth powder
will not pose any health threat to human beings. This is because the powder remains safe and
designed to only kill bed bugs
.
Besides, not allowing pets and children to play in an environment where the DE powder is applied makes it safer. Besides using diatomaceous earth, you can use
flea foggers
to kill fleas and bed bugs.
Pour the power inside your box springs, headboards, furniture legs, bed frames, and other hard to reach areas of the home. One thing about the DE
powder is that it will kill the bed bug
in an ephemeral time. Other options include
rubbing alcohol
, and
Ammonia,
steamers
.</p>
<h3 id="4-pest-management">4. Pest Management</h3>
<p>In the battle against
bed bugs
, using only one method may not resolve the problem. Like the DE powder,
spraying
, vacuuming, and other pugnacious ways, the pest management control method can also help kill bed bugs.
By hiring
pest control experts
to clean your home, you can finally end the infestation of bed bugs. These
experts know where to find bed bugs
in your house and do away with them for good.</p>
<h3 id="5-treat-crevices-and-cracks">5. Treat Crevices and Cracks</h3>
<p>The ability of
bed bugs to hide in secret
places is beyond despicable. In window sills, electrical sockets &amp; outlets, curtains, sofas, mattresses&rsquo; lining, carpets, floorboards, crevices of furniture, and cracks, there is no
place difficult for bed bugs to hide
.
Ensure to check the mentioned areas and cover any cracks on items in your house. Crevices of furniture and wall cracks can keep bed bugs alive for several years. Use sealants, cement, and other tough measures to cover crevices and cracks.</p>
<h3 id="5-hot-water-treatment">5. Hot Water Treatment</h3>
<p>If you suspect an item in your home to be infested by bed bugs, then waste no time to wash it in hot water. Washing with hot
water will help to destroy the larvae and eggs of bed bugs
.
Ensure that the affected item is placed into hot water for better results. Pillow covers, bed sheets, linen, clothes, and other apparent items should be put into both the dryer and washer and run through the highest temperature.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Apart from the methods mentioned above, you can
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-traps/">trap bed bugs</a>
and dont pick up things in awkward areas. Ensure not to make use of
bed bug pesticides and bombs
. Repeating the treatment process every three weeks can also help.
Items that are under serious infestation by bed bugs
should be discarded. Knowing the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-see-bed-bugs/">signs and symptoms of bed bug</a>
presence is the first way to get rid of them. Give it a try now.</p>

; start with a vacuum for removing webs, get some sticky traps, and spider repellent on hiding places such as garages, attics, and basements.
Brown recluse is venomous and you&rsquo;ll mainly find them hiding in dark places on the yard and home.� - and they&rsquo;ll be equally challenging to control.
These brown recluses will seek shelter in hidden areas - comparable to the venomous Black Widow - and you&rsquo;ll get them in locations like North America.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders">Details: How to Get Rid of Brown Recluse Spiders</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-inspection-for-brown-recluse-spiders">Step 1: Conduct Inspection for Brown Recluse Spiders</h3>
<p>The fiddle-back spider or Brown recluse have markings but will also have many shades such as light or dark brown - you can get them in Kentucky, western Georgia, and central Texas.
These nocturnal hunters will prey on mosquitoes, and flies among other insects. But they won&rsquo;t harm humans - but act in self-defense and they&rsquo;ll use their bites.</p>
<p>You may confuse the Brown recluse with wolf spiders but these ones have eight eyes and larger in body size. The recluse has fine hairs and six eyes but smaller in size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite that bites from brown recluse are rare, they are itchy and become reddish - and may become<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spider-bites/symptoms-causes/syc-20352371">an open sore</a>taking even a weak to heal.
On the body shape, these spiders are violin shape (and dark brown) on their cephalothorax - the section where the bug&rsquo;s legs are attached.</li>
<li>The spider has a uniformly-colored abdomen and legs - it has no multiple abdomen pigments.</li>
<li>It has no spines� but some fine hairs on its legs
The bug has 6 (not eight) eyes arranged in pairs but has some small space that separates the egg pairs. But don&rsquo;t confuse these spiders with the spitting spiders in the Scytodes genus.</li>
<li>Conduct an effective inspection for the spiders - check cobwebs in clutter, in wall voids, and under insulation. Check for irregular and loose webs - destroy them.
Get some vacuum hose - this will help remove spider webs and fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-remove-propitious-favourable-conditions-for-brown-recluse">Step 2: Remove Propitious (Favourable) Conditions for Brown Recluse**</h3>
<p>**
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef631">Brown recluse naturally live</a>
in
debris, woodpiles, logs, and rocks -
outdoors spaces. They&rsquo;ll live in
indoor spaces - even in attics or
unheated basements during winters with no
water or food.
The spiders will hunt during the night for their dead or living prey.� - they may employ suspended webs around outdoor vegetation, ceilings, corners, and walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, to get rid of these Recluse Spiders, ensure to first remove the propitious (favorable) conditions in the yard or home - such acts will remove their shelter of preying areas.</li>
<li>The Brown recluse will hide in locations that are warm, dark, and dry such as in rubber tires, bedding, furniture, shoes, clothing, and boxes - including in cellars, basements, and closets.
The adaptable Brown recluse is largely active (but non-aggressive) in temperatures around 45F to 110F - they&rsquo;ll survive for about 6 months with no water or food.</li>
<li>You can repel the spiders using essential oils such as tea tree, lavender,� and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-peppermint-oil-repel-spiders/">peppermint oil</a>- spray the oils and you may also use Hedge apples to repel the spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3inspect--clean-brown-recluse-hiding-places">Step 3:<strong>Inspect &amp; Clean Brown Recluse Hiding Places�</strong></h3>
<p>Inspect your spaces and clean - using some good vacuum cleaner, and use some suitable aerosol such as Zenprox (with longer residue effect) or CB 80.
As noted earlier, Brown recluse will take refuge in warm and dark places - and hence cleaning practices that&rsquo;ll hit such places will help remove the bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, clean all the objects that could attract Brown recluse such as food sources - don&rsquo;t drop crumbs around the spaces as they&rsquo;ll attract the bugs.</li>
<li>Next, move any boards, lumber, firewood that&rsquo;ll be around your house. Cover these objects and store them away from the ground - and cut all dense vegetation near structures.
Next, cut the tall grasses and trim the bushes - remove items on the garage floor and clean that space. But remove all the clutter that could harbor any brown recluse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-setup-multiple-brown-recluse-traps">Step 4: Setup Multiple Brown-Recluse Traps</h3>
<p>Next, its trap-time - set up multiple spider traps in the house - locate the traps around the bed, water heater chamber, and under your bathroom sink.
The glue traps set up for the spider will help capture the bugs - in the apartment or house. I recommend using a Catchmaster trap - as approved by Kansas University researchers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The glue traps will help identify the type of bugs that are insider your residence or house.
The sticky traps are excellent bug or pest controller gadgets - these will kill or immobilize the spiders that are wandering in your spaces.
Most of the traps are &ldquo;passive&rdquo; and hence it won&rsquo;t require complicated setting-up or attending - just check them occasionally and dump them if they&rsquo;re full of spiders.
But, a major drawback with glue traps is that they trap or even kill both harmful and helpful insects. For example, arthropods and Centipedes may be trapped.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5dust-and-spray-the-brown-recluse">Step 5:<strong>Dust and Spray the Brown recluse</strong></h3>
<p>Dust and also spray the spiders&rsquo; hiding spaces using some
residual ins
ecticide like Onslaught and Suspend Poly Zone (perimeter sprays).</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply sprayunder furniture andinsidebaseboards - places that the brown recluse run. Theresidual insecticides likeZenprox or Suspend Poly-zone - combined withdusting and cleaning.</li>
<li>Ensure the dust or spray (for Brown recluse) gets to the places that are difficult to reach. The Talstar bifenthrin insecticide is a pyrethroid that will repel the brown recluse.
The spayed or dusted surfaces will influence how long the insecticide will remain active. For example, masonite and wooden surfaces allow the insecticide to keep its power for about 7 days.</li>
<li>However, spraying or dusting the insecticide (even with handheld dusters) on vinyl surfaces will maintain the residue active and powerful for about 60 days.
**Residual sprays: **</li>
<li>These insecticide sprays are liquid and you should use them on room perimeters, storage areas, closets edges, eaves, and exterior foundation.</li>
<li>Sprays offering a residual-killing activity that is long should be chosen. Avoid sprays made from oils and botanical extracts that have not been proven to work on the brown recluse.
<strong>Residual dust:�</strong></li>
<li>Dust (such as D-Fence Dust) created to work as residual insecticides must be applied on your crawl spaces that are inaccessible, attics, and also wall voids.</li>
<li>The insecticide dust will easily penetrate those places that won&rsquo;t be easy to hit with spider sprays - and thus give longer brown recluse control.</li>
<li>Treating the attics (area-wide) won&rsquo;t work well because you might contaminate the storage places or even drift to your house through ventilation or light-fixtures.
<strong>Aerosol or ULV sprays:�</strong></li>
<li>The aerosol or ULV (ultra-low volume) sprays that have resmethrin or pyrethrins will effectively control the brown recluse.</li>
<li>The ULV treatment will be effective for controlling spiders in the shingle roofing, attics, and under the wood. They&rsquo;ll irritate the recluse as they contact and move on surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-6-sanitationnon-chemical-treatment">Step 6: Sanitation<strong>Non-Chemical Treatment�</strong></h3>
<p>Sanitation will effectively help clear the Brown Recluse - as it&rsquo;ll remove them from different structures like homes and buildings - including various�hiding places.
I approve of the subsequent practices to get rid of the brown recluse.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut short the different tall grasses around the various structures. Check the garages and basements - improving storages - don&rsquo;t store objects on the floor.</li>
<li>Check the building foundation and cut the heavy vegetation plus remove the piles of debris, boards, stones, firewood, and lumber.
Remove the spiders with egg sacs and webs of the brown recluse - use a vacuum after spotting the spiders during the inspection step - and remove the vacuum bag.
Use caulk to seal gaps and cracks in the cables, wires, pipes, vents, surrounding eaves, and building exterior. Inspect stored items and boxes - and use some vacuum hoses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-7-usediatomaceous-earth-food-grade">Step 7:� Use�Diatomaceous Earth (Food-Grade)</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth
has proven effective and safer for controlling the brown recluse - they have an abrasive effect that&rsquo;ll break the exoskeleton of the spiders.
Sprinkle the powder onto the gaps and spaces on the bedroom closets, inner bedroom spaces, under cabinets in the kitchen, and wall cracks - but avoid damp situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove food sources loved by brown recluse including water, food, and shelter - just like with the moths,ants, flies, and roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lastly, on how to get rid of brown recluse spiders remove all the external openings and gaps.
This will block the brown recluse from getting into the house. Also, cover the gaps around the doors and windows.
Further, lessen the amount of indoor humidity as this will repel the spiders - you may use a dehumidifier - manage the humidity in the storage spaces, bathrooms, and closets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike bumble/honey bees, carpenter <a href="/posts/compare-carpenter-bee-vs-bumblebee/">bees</a> do more than just carry out pollination - they bore woods and create nests. Also,
female carpenter bees may sting humans
if provokes.
<strong>So, on how to get rid of carpenter bees without killing them; you can install a sacrificial piece of wood, install carpenter bee traps, use a Sweep net, adopt preventive measures like WD-40, or make some noise to scare bees away.�</strong>
<strong>Alternatively, hanging wind chime works incredibly, while painting wooden surface prevents carpenter bees from boring.�</strong>
<strong>Further, you can opt to wait for the bees to leave on their own, vacuum them, or use almond/citrus oil as well.�</strong>

<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-carpenter-bees-without-killing-them">How to Get Rid Of Carpenter Bees without Killing Them</h2>
<h3 id="1-using-a-sweep-net">1. Using a Sweep net</h3>
<p>This a device which is weaved or manufactured using a tough loose network that forms a tiny mesh, though which insects such as bees can&rsquo;t pass.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sweep net comes with a handle or extender, depending on the place you intend to use it.</li>
<li>Hang/pin the sweep net with an opening facing the carpenter bees&rsquo; nest/holes and create a disturbance from beneath.</li>
<li>As the bees leave to escape, they get trapped in the sweep net. Later, empty the sweep net in open fields - far away from your home or office.
In case you spot flying carpenter bees, use a sweep net with a long handle - swing/sweep the net in the air in order to capture the flying carpenter bees and dispose of them as advised previously.
NB: Sweep nets are common in the local market and relatively cheap as compared to options such as vacuuming.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-installing-sacrificial-piece-of-wood">2.� Installing Sacrificial Piece of Wood</h3>
<p>A sacrificial wood is a standard lumber piece, which is highly visible and attracts carpenter bees preferentially.
The wooden size may change (varying lengths and widths) depending on the bee colony at your place� - small sizes are meant for medium colonies, while large sizes should be used to trap large bee colonies.</p>
<ul>
<li>The piece of wood should be built using softwood trees such as redwood, pine, or cedar.</li>
<li>Moreover, the selected piece should also be untreated with any chemical or unvarnished/unpainted (paint /varnish prevents carpenter bees from chewing the softwood).</li>
<li>Upon preparation, hang the piece of wood in an open place/exposed (Hunker suggests so) such that the carpenter bees can locate it easily.
The idea is that the carpenter bees will chew softwood and boreholes in it as many as the population is.
Once the entire piece of wood is fully nested, remove and relocate/dispose of it far away from your house. Re-install another piece of wood until the decoy gets rid of the entire carpenter bee infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-use-preventive-measure-like-applying-wd-40">3. Use Preventive Measure Like Applying WD-40</h3>
<p>The use of preventive measures such as vinyl siding keeps off carpenter bees from your house.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, you can apply a spray, like WD-40, which repels carpenter bees.</li>
<li>By avoiding the use of wooden interior lining and instead substituting it with a composite or metallic counterpart; then, you will be a notch high in carpenter bees prevention.
Furthermore, keep carpenter bee repellant plants in your house/office or plant similar species in the compound.
In whatever situation, you must incorporate a defensive approach instead of killing the entire bee colony - have hardwood furniture that can&rsquo;t be chewed by carpenter bees.

</ul>
<h3 id="4-making-noise---create-sound-vibrations">4. Making Noise - Create Sound Vibrations</h3>
<p>Loud noise scares carpenter bees away - they don&rsquo;t like the disturbances and sharp pitches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a piece of metal or wood, bang near the bees&rsquo; nest continuously - the sound vibrations will drive the bees away, one after the other.
You can opt to use an electric siren (within legal sound limit) connected and aimed at the carpenter bees&rsquo; nest/ hole - leave the device on for some time and inspect the nest later for effectiveness.
Repeat this after some time until the colony is removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-hang-wind-chime">5. Hang Wind Chime</h3>
<p>Windchime produces a sound that scares and drives carpenter bees away. All you need is to hang a wind chime freely near bees&rsquo; nests and leave the decoy to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the wind blows over the chime, it will cause it to vibrate, thus causing a sound that scares bees - this act makes them leave the nest completely.
In case your room has not enough wind flow, you can connect a fan near the chime to boost the air needed to cause sound vibrations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-use-almond-or-citrus-oil">6. Use Almond or Citrus oil</h3>
<p>The scent generated by almond or citrus oil repels carpenter bees away upon inhaling. Dilute either almond or citrus oil in a beaker.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle the liquid on the bees&rsquo; nest or pour it into holes bore on the wood. Leave the bees to escape at their own pace.
Later, inspect the nest and seal the holes with caulk or vinyl in order to attain initial aesthetic beauty.
You can mix the two solvents (almond and citrus oil) in order to boost scent concentration as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-painting-wood">7. Painting Wood</h3>
<p>Painting wooded structures is a sure way of getting rid of carpenter bees since paint forms a thin layer, which is cumbersome for bees to chew through.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, the scent generated by paint repels carpenter bees too.</li>
<li>When undertaking your paint works, it&rsquo;s advisable to coat your wooden surface with at least two paint layers.
Alternatively, you can apply varnish, which acts equivalently like paint too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-vacuum-the-bees">8. Vacuum the Bees</h3>
<p>A vacuum machine can suck carpenter bees from their nest without killing them, especially when the right suction velocity is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>All you need is to connect your vacuum machine to a power source and aim the suction pipe at the bee nest.</li>
<li>Press the switch button on and start vacuuming - the vacuum machine will suck the bees into the tray. Empty the live bees in the tray far from your compound.
NB: Avoid using too much suction pressure as it may kill live bees, especially baby bees.

</ul>
<h2 id="are-carpenter-bees-dangerous">Are Carpenter Bees Dangerous?</h2>
<p>Carpenter bees, just like other bees, are dangerous due to some of the following reasons:</p>
<h3 id="a-they-destroy-properties">a. They Destroy Properties</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees bore and chew wooden structures as they create their nest - this act weakens the entire structure, which eventually caves in.
Materials that are chewed by carpenter bees are usually challenging to repair and hence end up being disposed of.</p>
<h3 id="b-sting-and-harm-peopleanimals">b. Sting and Harm People/Animals</h3>
<p>When disturbed, carpenter bees sting and instill pain in both animals and human beings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, bees would attract the assailant as a group and sting severally - the stings cause swellings that may lead to death if not attended to immediately.</li>
<li>Unlike male carpenter bees, female carpenter bees are more violent when they sense danger lurking.
You should therefore be careful when getting rid of the carpenter bee colony in your place - wear protective gear.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-psychological-problems">c. Psychological Problems</h3>
<p>The mention or presence of carpenter bees infestation causes fears to many people as they generate a certain degree of phobia (melissophobia/apiphobia - fear of bees).</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, the situation is worse for those individuals that have ever been attacked by carpenter bees in the past.</li>
<li>Animal pets such as dogs and cats fear carpenter bees (apiphobia) in the vicinity - this could affect their normal psychological life.
Pets that have ever been attacked by carpenter bees bark loudly when they spot any carpenter bee in the vicinity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-attracts-carpenter-bees-into-your-place">What Attracts Carpenter Bees into Your Place?</h2>
<p>Unlike bumblebees, carpenter bees are attracted into your place by either of the following things:</p>
<h3 id="a-untreated-wood">a. Untreated wood</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees fly around searching for wood/location to create their nest - untreated wood is a possible item bees would stop infesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carpenter bees would chew woods to create channels (their hideouts) or bore sizable holes.</li>
<li>In addition, carpenter bees love an untreated stack of firewood, old fences, sheds, and decks among other structures.
Treating your wooden structures will go a long way in eliminating carpenter bees.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-old-carpenter-bees-nests">b. Old carpenter bees nests</h3>
<p>If your place has an old carpenter bee&rsquo;s nest, chances are that a new bee colony may come and settle there.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scent left in the old bee nest attracts passing bees, which end up colonizing and expanding the new nest.
It&rsquo;s always recommended that you destroy old carpenter bees&rsquo; nests as soon as they leave - you can throw the log/wood far away or seal holes with caulk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-flowers">c. Flowers</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees eat nectar and pollen (just like bumblebees) - they are therefore attracted by nectar-producing flowers in your place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flowers such as hibiscus, morning glory, sunflower, lavender, and banana flowers often attract carpenter bees in large numbers.
Since bees are a critical part of plant pollination, you need to uptake measures that will prevent them from creating a nest in the vicinity - you can grow repellant plants amongst flowers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-untreated-plank-ends">c. Untreated plank ends</h3>
<p>Often, carpenter bees boreholes at the end of the untreated plank and create a nest or tunnel inside.
For plank ends, it&rsquo;s advisable to treat them and terminate with metal flashing such as aluminum.</p>
<h3 id="d-unpainted-wood">d. Unpainted wood</h3>
<p>Paint or varnish prevents carpenter bees from chewing or boring through woods - the scent and tough coat layer keep them off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpainted wood is highly attacked by carpenter bees, especially those woods that are left in the open fields.
It&rsquo;s recommended that you coat wooden structures (which are made using softwood) with varnish or paint since they are more prone to carpenter bees infestation.

<h2 id="what-is-the-importance-of-carpenter-bee">What is the Importance of Carpenter Bee?</h2>
<p>Carpenter bees play a great role in every day to day life which includes:</p>
<h3 id="a-pollination">a. Pollination</h3>
<p>Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, carpenter bees step on pollen grains as they search for nectar in flowers. On the other hand, wings also rub against pollen grains and act as carriers.
Later, the pollen grains are rubbed against stigma as the bees get into the nectary gland to sip nectar.
Through this action, the flowers get pollinated. Carpenter bees help in both self-pollination and cross-pollination.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-source-of-food---honey">b. Source of food - Honey</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees produce honey as they excrete - this is food to both human beings and other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>If well taken care of, carpenter bees could produce more honey, which can be of commercial value.</li>
<li>In this regard, you can cut softwood logs and lay them off in open fields (far away from human habitation) in order to attract carpenter bees there.
Alternatively, you can build carpenter beehives and hang them in strategic points.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-animal-feeds">c. Animal Feeds</h3>
<p>Animals such as birds like woodpeckers feed on carpenter bees - these are their main source of food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, badgers kill and eat carpenter bees just like mantises do.
As a direct source of food to other animals in the ecosystem, carpenter bees provide continuity in the food chain - support life longevity.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on how to get rid of carpenter bees without killing them, you can use a sweep net, install a sacrificial piece of wood, adopt preventive measures, or wait for bees to leave on their own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Making noise and hanging chime will scare carpenter bees completely while painting wooden surfaces prevents them from boring through.</li>
<li>More so, you can spray almond/citrus oil, knock off the bees from their nest, or vacuum the nest and release bees into open fields (far away from your home).
Proper protection gear should be worn when getting rid of bees - for personal safety. Furthermore, if you are new to the task, it&rsquo;s recommended that you contract a bee professional to help you out.</li>

<h3 id="step-1-eliminate-food-water--hiding-places">Step 1: Eliminate Food, Water, &amp; Hiding Places</h3>
<p>For cockroaches, such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/">German Roaches</a>
, to survive, they must have a consistent supply of food and water. Therefore, the key to getting rid of them is cutting off any food and water source in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by cleaning food crumbs, washing dishes before retiring to bed, putting food away after meals, and cleaning up spills. Also, avoid leaving uncovered food for extended periods and keep all food containers sealed.</li>
<li>Cockroaches love hiding in the fridge and munching on food crumbs back there. Clean the refrigerator as well, and always keep it locked. While at it, dont forget to wipe the range tops as cockroaches are attracted to grease as well.</li>
<li>Take out the trash regularly while ensuring the garbage bins are well sealed.</li>
<li>Any water leaks must also be fixed. Cockroaches can live for a month without food but no more than one week without water.
Roaches also prefer dark and damp where they hide and breed. These include under the sink, behind refrigerators, underfloor drains, in cracks/crevices, inside significant appliances, and others.
Target these areas when doing a thorough cockroach clean up. Also, seal cracks and crevices on the walls with caulk. All openings around the pipes in the kitchen and bathroom must also be filled. This will prevent the
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/faq/roach.html">roaches from entering your home</a>
.

<h3 id="step-2-use-roach-baits-roach-sprays--igrs">Step 2: Use Roach Baits, Roach Sprays, &amp; IGRs</h3>
<p>The triple-action of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-bait/">cockroach baits</a>
, sprays, and Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) will kill and prevent cockroaches from reproducing.
As the name suggests, cockroach baits help draw these pests out of
their hiding places
. The baits contain a high-consumption bait matrix with killer ingredients like fipronil and hydramethylnon.
Upon consuming the bait, the ingredients disrupt their nervous system, leading to their ultimate death in a matter of minutes. You may also consider
top roach bombs
.
Pesticide sprays contain active ingredients like Pyrethrin, which produce a knockdown effect on bugs like cockroaches - killing roaches even back in the
roach nest
. Basically, the sprays interfere with the bugs nervous system, which results in major paralysis and speedy death.
How to Use Baits, Sprays, and IGRs for Cockroaches</p>
<ul>
<li>If using the combination, spray a small amount in targeted areas like cracks, crevices, behind and beneath the sinks, behind and under refrigerators aroundpipes and drains, etc.</li>
<li>Ensure the spray penetrates well to ensure the pests are quickly eliminated
IGRs, on the other hand, cause sterility in adult roaches, making reproduction impossible.�When used together, the three treatment methods can quickly eliminate any roaches lurking in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-dust-with-boric-acid-powder">Step 3: Dust with Boric Acid Powder</h3>
<p>Boric acid
is one of the best natural remedies for eliminating roaches. When ingested,
boric acid
kills cockroaches in just a matter of minutes.�Although highly toxic in cockroaches, boric acid is completely
safe for humans and pets
.
The powder is best applied in areas where cockroaches are likely to walk through. Upon contact, the powder sticks on the cockroach and is absorbed into its body. Once inside, the acid destroys its digestive and nervous system, causing death.
The cockroach may also die from ingesting the powder.�Boric acid is a suitable natural
cockroach treatment if pesticide sprays
and baits are not an option.
How to Use Boric Acid for Cockroaches</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean all targeted areas, including cabinets, countertops, sinks, drawers, behind and under the refrigerator, and others</li>
<li>Lightly dust boric acid powder all over these areas. If dealing with a severe infestation, a heavy application may be necessary</li>
<li>Vacuum the remaining powder in the morning</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-thoroughly-clean-house-vacuuming">Step 4: Thoroughly clean house/ Vacuuming</h3>
<p>Its not unlikely to find a few roaches in a clean home. As long as there are cracks on the walls and perfect hiding places, youll still deal with a few of them crawling around
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-cockroaches-fly/">since roaches don&rsquo;t fly</a>
.
However, a clean home is more unlikely to experience a severe
roach infestation
than a dirty and cluttered home.
Even with countless treatments, roaches will still infest your cluttered home.�Regularly vacuuming and decluttering your
home is key to keeping these bugs
at bay.
How to Get rid of Cockroaches Through Vacuuming/Cleaning</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly vacuum and clean the floor, kitchen countertops, drawers, cabinets, insider appliances, behind and under the refrigerator, ovens, and other areas.</li>
<li>Declutter your kitchen, sitting area, laundry room, closets, cupboards, drawers, and any other potential hiding place.</li>

<h3 id="step-1-keep-your-bathroom-and-kitchen-clean-and-dry-at-all-times">Step 1: Keep your bathroom and kitchen clean and dry at all times</h3>
<dl>
<dt>We have discovered that German roaches thrive best where there are favorable conditions like good humidity, food, shelter, and water.</dt>
<dt>Unfortunately, your house offers all these favorable conditions.</dt>
<dt>To get rid of the German roaches in your house, keep all kitchen and bathroom surfaces and sinks clean and dry. Wash all your cabinets and appliances regularly. You should also pay close attention to your backyard by removing all unused items or woodpiles.</dt>
<dt>You can also install a dehumidifier in your home. �When your house is less humid, the German cockroaches will find it less attractive to settle in it.</dt>
<dt>Also, ensure you store food in airtight containers. Also, throw away your garbage regularly. Set aside time to do general cleaning in your house; you may mop, sweep, or vacuum regularly.</dt>
<dt><strong>Remember To</strong></dt>
<dd>(1)
Dry up all surfaces (1)
Keep the roaches hungry-put foods in tight containers and eliminate leftovers (1)
Do not offer them any shelter- seal all cracks and small holes in your house.
Besides cleaning, you can also seal all cracks and small holes in your home to block all pathways the bugs might be using to access your home.
If these measures are followed correctly, your house will be roach free. However, if the German cockroaches still find their way into your house, then its time to take more drastic measures to eliminate these annoying creatures!!
<strong>What are German cockroaches?�</strong>
The German cockroach has a unique ability of high reproduction compared to other cockroach species. The female German
cockroaches produce many eggs
per capsule; thus, they undergo a short time from hatching to sexual maturity, leading to quick population growth.
If not stopped in time, they can be difficult to control. These roaches are pretty smaller than other roaches species and can easily hide in numerous places inaccessible by humans. You can easily recognize this roach species as they are small in size (roughly  an inch) and contain two dark stripes on their back.
Like most cockroaches, German roaches prefer to settle in warm and dark places. Unfortunately, your home offers these favorable conditions, and they can easily create their habitat in your house. The availability
of food, water, and harborage increases the German roach&rsquo;s ability to develop populations and reduce growth quickly.
This disgusting creature loves to settle in an environment that is moist, warm, and dark. Hence, they are mostly found in bathrooms and kitchens where water and food leftovers are readily available. German roaches are scavengers that consume sweet foods, meat, grease, and garbage.
To eradicate these tiny creatures from your home, you should always keep kitchen surfaces clean,
use�drain cleaners
to keep all drainage and pipes clean, and repair leaking pipes. You can also fix all cracks and small holes where they are likely to hide.</dd>

is a natural and effective home remedy to kill German roaches. Sugar acts as an important bait for a German cockroach as it likes sweet products. On�the other hand, the baking soda acts as a poison that destroys the roaches digestive system.
Baking soda
works by creating huge amounts of gas, causing the stomach of roaches to burst, hence die instantly.
When using this mixture, ensure the cockroaches have access to little water. Water reacts with baking soda to give a bad solution that acts on
roaches to kill
them completely.

<li>Sprinkle the mixture containing sugar and baking soda in various locations infested with the roaches</li>
<li>Ensure you refill the water and sprinkle more mixture from time to time to kill all the roaches completely</li>
<li>Be patient and watch the roaches
When using sugar and baking soda bait, youll need to be patient as the process might take a lot of time before achieving the desired results. This mixture may not

In this article, I outline How to Get Rid of Cockroaches in Apartments. If roaches find shelter, food, and water in your apartment, they are staying for as long as they want to!
<strong>First, notify the property manager about any roach activity on their property so that they can take action against this pest infestation. Next up, try using some baits (roach traps), dusting with silica powder or diatomaceous earth (DE) as well as a boric acid solution for long-term control measures.�</strong>
<strong>You may also want to set some glue traps around your apartment if you&rsquo;re not too keen on using toxic chemicals. Finally, if you want to get the roaches out for good (and your landlord doesn&rsquo;t have any better ideas), hire an exterminator!�</strong>

<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches-in-apartments">Details: How to Get Rid of Cockroaches in Apartments</h2>
<h3 id="1-notify-the-property-manager-or-landlord-know-your-rights">1. Notify the property manager or landlord; Know Your Rights</h3>
<p>To control them, first, notify the property manager (or the landlord).�The property manager or landlord will handle the roach infestations as outlined by their lease agreement or offer some quick tips on how to deal with these bugs themselves (for example, sealing up cracks around doors).
It&rsquo;s important to know your rights as a tenant in regards to pest control.
Some leases may require the landlord or property manager to provide roach extermination services, while others just offer some tips on how you can manage them yourself (or not!). Read your lease agreement carefully!
For example, if you pay monthly fees to cater to pest control - the property manager may owe you some roach control rounds for that month.</p>
<h3 id="2-locate-the-roach-nest-and-seal-it-off-from-human-contact">2. Locate the Roach Nest and Seal it off from human contact</h3>
<p>Find that elusive
roach nest</p>
<ul>
<li>their breeding and hiding location; and eliminate it. The inspections for these nocturnal bugs must be undertaken at night.
Try to identify if you have a high infestation in one area or if there are scattered sightings throughout your apartment; different strategies need to be used for each scenario.
An Integrated Pest Management approach would work better for a low-level infestation while complete elimination may require hiring exterminators with stronger chemicals like Cypermethrin.
Dispose of any exposed food or water sources, including anything that is spilling out of your garbage can (in particular those moist foods) - as they will also be attracting more roaches.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kXfEmupXc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kXfEmupXc</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-clean-up-the-apartment">3. Clean Up the Apartment</h3>
<p>The most important thing is getting rid of the food sources roaches are looking for in your apartment: crumbs on counters, pet food bowls, spoiled produce (especially potatoes), dirty dishes left overnight&hellip;anything that might attract roaches!
Dispose of garbage properly-use more than one bag if necessary because roach infestations usually start from trash cans outside that have been improperly disposed of away
Remove clutter and provide a clear path for these pests as they roam around seeking out food or hiding places (for example, keep dishes on top of shelves).
Make sure all surfaces are clean - including floors, walls, window sills, countertops/sinks&hellip;everything! Not only will this help with any infestations but it also
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">helps prevent ant</a>
s and other insects from coming inside.
Roach droppings can carry diseases like E-coli so be careful not to stir up dust bunnies while cleaning too close to where people eat when mopping up spills.
Clean up behind the cabinets, dishwasher, fridge - these would make great hiding places for cockroaches.
Keep your counters and sinks clean - this also helps prevent ants from making their way inside.
Don&rsquo;t leave dishes in the sink to collect dust or harbor bacteria, rinse them off as soon as possible after each use.
Clear away clutter (think pantry shelves) that could be hiding cockroaches or other pests like spiders! Cockroaches are opportunistic so they will take any opportunity to come inside if there are food sources available for them.</p>
<h3 id="4-seal-all-holes-and-cracks-in-plumbing-windows-and-doors">4. Seal all Holes and Cracks in Plumbing, Windows, and doors</h3>
<p>Roaches can get into small spaces, so sealing up as many of these areas as possible will help. You should also look for other potential openings or cracks in your home&rsquo;s foundation.
Covering any gaps with steel wool is a good temporary solution to keep them out while you seal the area permanently.
Use a caulk gun to fill cracks and holes where cockroaches could enter. Make sure you are sealing all sources of entry, including plumbing or electrical outlets - roaches will make their way inside if they smell food!
Inspect your home for any drafts that might be coming from the window sealings or door frames. Tighten up these areas using weather strips, caulking, or foam insulation to keep the roaches insects out.
Look around windows as well for signs of insect pests such as small piles of sawdust near them which may indicate an ant infestation right outside the wall in between things like wood siding and brick homes.
Seal openings in the plumbing system (particularly under the sink) - as the roaches will be attracted by water and food droppings.</p>
<h3 id="5-use-baits-sprays-and-treatments">5. Use baits, sprays, and treatments</h3>
<p>Consider a pre-emptive bait that will create an environment lethal for roaches - one well-known in particular is Combat Roach Killing Bait Gel which can be purchased at most hardware stores.
The process usually starts by placing bait stations such as apple cider vinegar &amp; soap in areas that roaches frequent (though these can also attract other pests like ants).
In a few days, they will come back with either poison bait or glue traps for capturing them alive so they may not pose any future problems if released into the wild. This is important because some poisons used in extermination could lead to secondary poisoning among pets who eat poisoned bugs.
Keep it out of reach of children as, if handled improperly, this could lead to poisoning or even death!
Sprays and other treatments will also work to kill roaches but are not always as effective. Some effective roach sprays include the Bengal Gold and the Ortho Home defense.
The insecticide sprays mainly contain Permethrin�or pyrethroids (comparable to botanical�insecticides�- pyrethrins). Sprays will also kill other insects, so be careful with where you are spraying.</p>
<h3 id="6-sprinkle-diatomaceous-earth">6. Sprinkle Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Some people have noticed success by using
Diatomaceous Earth (food grade)
sprinkled around their house but this treatment can take months for visible results. This should also only be used when pets are excluded from the spaces.
Diatomaceous earth�powder will create that abrasive effect which will break the roaches&rsquo; exoskeleton and exoskeleton.
Sprinkle the DE in areas where roaches are present, including all cracks and crevices around cabinets, behind refrigerators (baseboards if possible), along walls underneath appliances, especially under sinks.
Consider pouring it into any holes or gaps found on your countertops so that they can not crawl back out again. You should also sprinkle some inside of drawers for those places hidden from sight.</p>
<h3 id="7-cockroach-traps---boric-acid-or-dish-soap">7. Cockroach Traps - Boric acid or Dish soap</h3>
<p>For an extra effect set a trap with either boric acid or dish soap mixed with apple cider vinegar as bait by placing them at strategic points like corners and near drains.&quot;
You can make the DIY roach killer - from boric acid ( Cup)�&amp; peanut butter ( Cup).
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">Boric acid powder</a>
, if ingested, will exterminate the roaches while the peanut butter acts as an attractant.</p>
<h3 id="8-roach-treat-the-perimeter-walls-and-environment">8. Roach Treat the Perimeter Walls and Environment</h3>
<p>If you have already been successful with getting rid of them from inside the house but are still seeing signs outside (like small piles of sawdust), then you may need to take care of some around the perimeter.
This might involve using insecticides like cypermethrin on trees or shrubbery near. You may apply some insecticide dust on the exterior walls, inside the wall void, electrical outlets, and the light switch plates.</p>
<h3 id="9-hire-a-roach-exterminator">9. Hire A Roach Exterminator</h3>
<p>If you have tried everything else and are still seeing signs of cockroaches, it might be time to hire an exterminator that uses bait stations and commercial grade insecticides with pyrethrins or cypermethrin like Tempo Ultra Max Insecticide Spray Concentrate.
The pest control company will inspect your home for any areas where there is activity -including inside walls- before beginning treatment in those locations.
They typically spray along baseboards, cracks in corners (especially near doors), door jams, window frames.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on how to get rid of cockroaches in apartments - If you are a tenant in an apartment, be sure to notify the property manager immediately when roaches are spotted.
Use baits like boric acid or traps including apple cider vinegar mixed with soap and placed near drains. Also, conduct a thorough cleaning of the apartment.
Consider using diatomaceous earth as dusting under your appliances and along walls for more protection against them. Finally, if all won&rsquo;t work, hire that roach exterminator.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crabgrass is one of the most persistent and frustrating weeds for homeowners striving for a pristine lawn. This annual grassy weed, identifiable by its coarse, light-green blades and distinctive crab-like growth habit, quickly spreads to form unsightly patches that can overwhelm desirable turfgrass. Its resilience lies in its prolific seed production and its ability to thrive in the hot, dry conditions that stress out many cultivated lawn grasses.</p>
<p>Effective crabgrass control requires understanding its life cycle, employing both preventative measures and, if necessary, strategic elimination methods. Whether you prefer natural approaches or require chemical solutions, a multi-pronged strategy is often the key to reclaiming your lawn from this invasive pest. This guide will delve into the nature of crabgrass, detail various methods for its eradication, and most importantly, equip you with the knowledge to prevent future infestations.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-crabgrass">Understanding Crabgrass</h2>
<p>Before tackling crabgrass, it&rsquo;s essential to understand its characteristics and life cycle. This knowledge will guide your control and prevention efforts.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-crabgrass">What is Crabgrass?</h3>
<p>Crabgrass (<em>Digitaria spp.</em>) is an <strong>annual grassy weed</strong>. This means that individual crabgrass plants complete their entire life cycle within one year: they germinate, grow, produce seeds, and then die, typically with the first hard frost in fall. However, the seeds they leave behind ensure their return the following year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Young crabgrass plants have wider blades and a lighter green color than most desirable lawn grasses. As they mature, they develop a distinctive growth pattern, spreading low to the ground with multiple stems radiating outwards from a central point, resembling a crab&rsquo;s legs.</li>
<li><strong>Root System:</strong> It has a shallow, fibrous root system, which can make it relatively easy to pull when young.</li>
<li><strong>Seed Production:</strong> Each crabgrass plant can produce tens of thousands of seeds (up to 75,000-150,000 seeds per plant for large plants), which remain viable in the soil for many years, waiting for the right conditions to germinate. This enormous seed bank is why crabgrass is so persistent.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Conditions:</strong> Crabgrass thrives in hot, sunny conditions and often appears in thin, stressed, or bare spots in lawns. It loves compacted soil, areas that are mowed too short, and frequently watered shallowly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-crabgrass-life-cycle">The Crabgrass Life Cycle</h3>
<p>Understanding this cycle is crucial for timing your control efforts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Germination (Spring/Early Summer):</strong> Crabgrass seeds begin to germinate when soil temperatures consistently reach <strong>55-60�F (13-15�C)</strong> for several consecutive days, typically around the time when forsythia bushes bloom or lilacs are in full flower. This usually occurs after the last frost of winter, but before the peak heat of summer.</li>
<li><strong>Growth (Summer):</strong> Once germinated, crabgrass grows rapidly during the warm summer months, especially in areas with full sun and thin turf. It spreads quickly, outcompeting desirable grass for water, nutrients, and sunlight.</li>
<li><strong>Seed Production (Late Summer/Early Fall):</strong> As summer progresses into early fall, mature crabgrass plants produce abundant seed heads. These seeds drop into the soil, replenishing the seed bank for the next year.</li>
<li><strong>Death (First Frost):</strong> With the first hard frost of autumn, the individual crabgrass plants die, turning brown and shriveling. However, the legacy of their thousands of seeds remains, ready to sprout next spring.</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing this cycle emphasizes that <strong>prevention is key</strong>, as stopping the seeds from germinating is far easier than trying to kill mature plants.</p>
<h2 id="natural-methods-to-eliminate-crabgrass">Natural Methods To Eliminate Crabgrass</h2>
<p>For homeowners preferring an eco-friendlier approach, several natural methods can be effective, especially for smaller infestations or as part of a broader prevention strategy.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hand-Pulling:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Highly effective for small, isolated crabgrass plants, especially when they are young (before they produce seeds).</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> Pull plants when the soil is moist (after rain or watering). This makes it easier to remove the entire root system. Ensure you remove the plant before it develops seed heads.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Labor-intensive for larger areas. If any part of the root remains, the plant can regrow. If the plant has already produced seeds, disturbing the soil during pulling can scatter them, worsening the problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boiling Water:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Excellent for killing individual crabgrass plants in cracks in driveways, sidewalks, or isolated patches.</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> Carefully pour boiling water directly onto the crabgrass plant. The heat will scorch and kill the plant tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Non-selective, meaning it will kill any surrounding desirable grass or plants. Best for targeted applications away from your main lawn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vinegar (Acetic Acid):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Horticultural vinegar (20% acetic acid or higher) can act as a contact herbicide, scorching the foliage of young crabgrass. Household vinegar (5% acetic acid) is less effective.</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> Spray directly onto the crabgrass plant on a sunny, dry day. Reapply if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Non-selective, so it will harm desirable grass. Can temporarily lower soil pH. Handle horticultural vinegar with extreme caution; it can cause skin and eye irritation. Wear protective gear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corn Gluten Meal (CGM):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Primarily a <strong>pre-emergent</strong> herbicide, meaning it prevents crabgrass seeds from germinating. It also acts as a natural fertilizer.</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> Apply in early spring <em>before</em> crabgrass germinates (when soil temps are consistently 55-60�F). Water lightly after application.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong> It does not kill existing crabgrass. Requires precise timing for effectiveness. Results may not be as immediate or complete as synthetic pre-emergents. Can also prevent other seeds (like new grass seed) from germinating, so avoid using if overseeding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smothering/Solarization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Good for large, heavily infested areas where you plan to restart your lawn.</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> Cover the crabgrass patch with a thick layer of cardboard, newspapers, or black plastic sheeting. Secure the edges to block all light. Leave in place for several weeks to months. Solarization (using clear plastic in direct sun) heats the soil to kill seeds and plants.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Kills all vegetation in the covered area. Takes time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Natural methods are generally safer for the environment, pets, and children, but often require more effort, precise timing, and patience compared to chemical alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="chemical-solutions-for-crabgrass-control">Chemical Solutions for Crabgrass Control</h2>
<p>For widespread or stubborn crabgrass infestations, chemical herbicides can offer more effective and convenient solutions. These fall into two main categories: pre-emergent and post-emergent.</p>
<h3 id="1-pre-emergent-herbicides-your-best-defense">1. Pre-Emergent Herbicides: Your Best Defense</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These herbicides create a chemical barrier in the soil that prevents crabgrass seeds from germinating. They do not kill existing crabgrass.</li>
<li><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Look for active ingredients such as prodiamine, dithiopyr, or pendimethalin.</li>
<li><strong>Timing is Crucial:</strong> Apply in early spring <em>before</em> soil temperatures consistently reach 55-60�F (13-15�C) and <em>before</em> crabgrass seeds sprout. This is usually around the time forsythia blooms or lilacs are in full flower.</li>
<li><strong>How to Apply:</strong> Apply evenly across your lawn, typically in granular form using a spreader. Water immediately after application to activate the chemical barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will Prevent All Seeds:</strong> Do not apply pre-emergent if you plan to overseed or lay new grass seed, as it will also prevent your desirable grass seeds from germinating. Wait at least 2-4 months after application before seeding, depending on the product.</li>
<li><strong>Breaks Down:</strong> The chemical barrier breaks down over time, so a single application may not last the entire growing season in some climates. A second application in late spring/early summer might be necessary depending on the product label and your local climate.</li>
<li><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t Kill Existing Crabgrass:</strong> If you already see crabgrass, it&rsquo;s too late for a pre-emergent to kill <em>those specific plants</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-post-emergent-herbicides-for-existing-crabgrass">2. Post-Emergent Herbicides: For Existing Crabgrass</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These herbicides kill crabgrass plants that have already germinated and are actively growing.</li>
<li><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Look for active ingredients such as quinclorac (often for larger crabgrass), fenoxaprop, or MSMA (often for Bermudagrass lawns, but use with caution).</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply when crabgrass is actively growing, usually from late spring through summer. It&rsquo;s most effective on young, small crabgrass plants. Mature crabgrass is much harder to kill and may require multiple applications or stronger products.</li>
<li><strong>How to Apply:</strong> Typically applied as a liquid spray directly onto the crabgrass. Spot treatment is recommended to avoid unnecessary chemical application to desirable turf.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selective vs. Non-Selective:</strong> Ensure you choose a selective herbicide that kills crabgrass but is safe for your type of lawn grass (e.g., specific formulas for Kentucky Bluegrass, Fescue, or Bermudagrass lawns). Non-selective herbicides (like glyphosate) will kill everything they touch.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature Restrictions:</strong> Many post-emergent herbicides have temperature restrictions. Applying when it&rsquo;s too hot can damage your lawn. Read the label carefully.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Applications:</strong> Larger, more mature crabgrass plants often require 2-3 applications spaced 7-14 days apart.</li>
<li><strong>Stress:</strong> Applying post-emergents can stress your lawn, especially during hot weather.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Always read and follow the label instructions of any chemical herbicide carefully. This includes application rates, safety precautions, and restrictions on when to apply.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-crabgrass-infestations">Preventing Crabgrass Infestations</h2>
<p>The most effective long-term strategy for crabgrass control is prevention. A healthy, dense lawn is the best defense, as it crowds out weeds and leaves no room for crabgrass to establish.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintain a Thick, Healthy Lawn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proper Mowing Height:</strong> Mow your grass at the highest recommended height for your turf type (typically 2.5-4 inches). Taller grass shades the soil, keeping it cooler and blocking sunlight that crabgrass seeds need to germinate. This also promotes deeper root growth for your desirable grass.</li>
<li><strong>Correct Watering:</strong> Water deeply and infrequently. This encourages deep grass roots and keeps the top layer of soil (where crabgrass seeds germinate) drier. Shallow, frequent watering keeps the surface moist, favoring crabgrass.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Fertilization:</strong> Follow a proper fertilization schedule for your grass type. A well-fed lawn grows vigorously and outcompetes weeds. Get a soil test to determine specific nutrient needs.</li>
<li><strong>Overseeding:</strong> Regularly overseed thin areas of your lawn, especially in the fall for cool-season grasses. A dense turf leaves no room for crabgrass.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply a Pre-Emergent Herbicide Annually:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even with a healthy lawn, a pre-emergent herbicide is your best preventative measure against crabgrass. Apply it in early spring before soil temperatures consistently reach 55-60�F. This creates a barrier that stops seeds from sprouting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Address Bare Spots Promptly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any bare patch in your lawn is an open invitation for crabgrass. Fill these areas by seeding, sodding, or plugging as quickly as possible. Prepare the soil, plant new grass, and nurture it to establish a dense cover.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid Excessive Compaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compacted soil stresses desirable grasses and creates ideal conditions for crabgrass. Aerate your lawn regularly, especially if you have heavy foot traffic or clay soil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean Equipment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you mow your lawn or borrow equipment from others, clean mower decks and other tools to avoid transferring crabgrass seeds from one area to another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage Thatch:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A thick layer of thatch (dead organic matter between grass blades and soil) can harbor weed seeds and impede water and nutrient movement. Dethatch your lawn if the thatch layer exceeds 1/2 inch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By focusing on these preventative measures, you can significantly reduce the need for reactive chemical treatments and maintain a healthier, more beautiful lawn.</p>
<h2 id="professional-lawn-care-services">Professional Lawn Care Services</h2>
<p>For homeowners facing extensive crabgrass infestations, persistent problems, or simply lacking the time or expertise for DIY solutions, professional lawn care services can be a highly effective option.</p>
<p><strong>What Professionals Offer:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Expert Diagnosis:</strong> Lawn care professionals can accurately identify the type of crabgrass, assess the severity of the infestation, and diagnose any underlying issues contributing to the problem (e.g., poor soil conditions, improper watering).</li>
<li><strong>Precise Timing and Application:</strong> They have the knowledge to apply pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicides at the optimal times for maximum effectiveness, considering local climate, grass type, and product specifics. This precision is crucial for crabgrass control.</li>
<li><strong>Professional-Grade Products:</strong> Professionals have access to stronger, more effective herbicides that are often not available to the general public. These products are formulated for specific weed types and turfgrass species, minimizing harm to your lawn while maximizing weed kill.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Pest Management:</strong> Reputable companies often employ an integrated approach that combines chemical treatments with cultural practices (fertilization, aeration, pH adjustment) to improve overall lawn health and reduce future weed pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Programs:</strong> Many services offer annual programs that include multiple applications of pre-emergent, spot treatments for weeds, fertilization, and sometimes even pest and disease control, ensuring consistent care throughout the year.</li>
<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> They use specialized equipment for even application and efficient service delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When to Consider Professional Help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large, Widespread Infestations:</strong> If crabgrass has taken over a significant portion of your lawn.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Problems:</strong> If you&rsquo;ve tried DIY methods without success year after year.</li>
<li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> If you don&rsquo;t have the time to dedicate to precise applications and ongoing monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> If you are uncomfortable handling strong chemicals.</li>
<li><strong>Desire for a Pristine Lawn:</strong> For those who want a truly weed-free, high-quality lawn without the personal effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting a professional lawn care service, inquire about their specific approach to crabgrass control, their use of integrated pest management, and their guarantees for results. Reading reviews and getting multiple quotes can help ensure you choose a reputable and effective provider.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Crabgrass is a formidable adversary for any lawn owner, but it is far from unbeatable. Understanding its life cycle and weaknesses is the first step towards successful control. While natural methods like hand-pulling and proper cultural practices can help manage small infestations, chemical pre-emergent herbicides are often the most effective tool for preventing its widespread germination.</p>
<p>The most powerful long-term strategy, however, lies in cultivation. By maintaining a dense, healthy lawn through proper mowing height, deep watering, consistent fertilization, and regular overseeding, you create an environment where desirable turfgrass thrives and crabgrass struggles to find a foothold. This proactive approach reduces the need for reactive treatments and builds a more resilient and beautiful lawn over time. Whether you choose to tackle the problem yourself or enlist the help of professional lawn care services, a consistent, informed strategy will ultimately help you win the battle against crabgrass and enjoy a greener, weed-free outdoor space.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you tired of the incessant chirping of <a href="/posts/are-crickets-decomposers/">crickets</a> keeping you up at night or invading your
outdoor spaces
? You&rsquo;re not alone! Many people seek effective ways to get rid of crickets outside.
Creating and maintaining a serene outdoor environment is essential if you&rsquo;re looking for relaxation or simply an intimate connection with nature.
In this comprehensive DIY guide, we&rsquo;ll explore various methods and strategies to help you reclaim your peace and quiet. I&rsquo;ve done the research for you, so let&rsquo;s dive deep into the world of <a href="/posts/are-crickets-good-or-bad/">cricket</a> control.</p>
<h2 id="the-answer-effective-ways-to-get-rid-of-crickets-outside">The Answer: Effective Ways to Get Rid of Crickets Outside</h2>
<p><strong>The simplest way to get rid of crickets outside is to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>**Maintain Proper Lawn Care:**A well-maintained lawn is your first line of defense against crickets. They thrive in tall grass and weeds, so keeping your lawn well-groomed discourages them from setting up camp.- <strong>Regular Mowing</strong>:Frequent mowingof your lawn keeps the grass short and less attractive to crickets. Aim to mow your lawn at least once a week during the cricket season, which typically peaks in late summer. Additionally, consider adjusting your lawnmower&rsquo;s blade height to ensure you&rsquo;re not leaving the grass too long.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removing Debris</strong>: Clear away leaf litter, dead plants, and any other debris from your yard. Crickets are drawn to hiding spots, and these items provide them with ideal shelter. Regularly cleaning your yard also helps reduce other potential pests that crickets feed on.</li>
<li><strong>Proper Watering</strong>: Crickets are attracted to moist environments, so avoid overwatering your lawn. Water your lawn early in the day to allow it to dry before evening, reducing the cricket-friendly moisture levels.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>**Reduce Exterior Lighting:**Crickets are attracted to light, so consider using less outdoor lighting at night or switching to yellow or sodium vapor bulbs, which are less attractive to them.- <strong>Use Yellow or Sodium Vapor Bulbs</strong>: Replace white or bright outdoor bulbs with yellow or sodium vapor bulbs. These emit light that is less appealing to crickets and other insects. The wavelength of light produced by these bulbs is less attractive to crickets, making them a practical choice for outdoor lighting.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit Outdoor Lighting</strong>: Consider reducing the amount of outdoor lighting you use at night. Only use lighting when necessary, and turn it off when you&rsquo;re done to minimize cricket activity. Motion-activated lights are a great option, as they only illuminate when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Position Lights Wisely</strong>: If you must use outdoor lighting, position the lights away from doors and windows to draw crickets away from your home. Placing lights closer to the perimeter of your property can help keep crickets at bay.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>**Seal Entry Points:**Cricket prevention starts with sealing any potential entry points into your home.- <strong>Caulk and Seal Cracks</strong>: Inspect the exterior of your home for cracks, gaps, or holes. Use caulk or sealant to fill these openings, preventing crickets from finding their way inside. Pay close attention to areas around windows, doors, utility openings, and where utility lines enter your home.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Install Weather Stripping</strong>: Ensure that doors and windows are properly sealed with weather stripping. This not only keeps crickets out but also helps with energy efficiency. Replace any worn or damaged weather stripping promptly to maintain a secure barrier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="natural-remedies-for-cricket-control">Natural Remedies for Cricket Control</h2>
<p>In addition to the core strategies mentioned above, you can explore natural remedies to deter crickets:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: This natural, powdery substance made from fossilized aquatic organisms can be sprinkled around cricket-prone areas to create a barrier that damages their exoskeletons, ultimately leading to their demise.- <strong>How to Use Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: To applydiatomaceous earth, simply sprinkle it in areas where you suspect cricket activity. Focus on spots near potential entry points, hiding spots, and areas where crickets congregate.</li>
<li><strong>Neem Oil</strong>: Derived from the neem tree, neem oil has insect-repelling properties. Mixing neem oil with water and spraying it on outdoor surfaces can help deter crickets and other pests.- <strong>Creating a Neem Oil Spray</strong>: Mix one part neem oil with ten parts water and add a few drops of liquid dish soap. Pour this mixture into a spray bottle and apply it to outdoor areas where crickets are a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Cedarwood</strong>: Cedarwood emits a scent that repels crickets and many other insects. Consider placing cedarwood chips or cedar oil-soaked cotton balls in strategic outdoor locations, such as near entry points or in your garden.- <strong>Using Cedarwood</strong>: Scatter cedarwood chips in your garden or place cedar oil-soaked cotton balls in containers near entry points to create a natural cricket barrier.

</ol>
<h2 id="dealing-with-a-cricket-infestation-indoors">Dealing with a Cricket Infestation Indoors</h2>
<p>If crickets have already made their way inside your home, swift action is essential. Here&rsquo;s a DIY approach to handle indoor cricket infestations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Cricket Traps</strong>: Place sticky traps or glue boards in areas where crickets are frequently seen indoors. These traps can help capture and eliminate crickets that have invaded your home.<strong>How to Set Cricket Traps</strong>: Position traps along walls, near windows, or in dark corners where crickets tend to hide. Check the traps regularly and replace them as needed.</li>

<li><strong>Homemade Cricket Bait</strong>: Create a homemade cricket bait by mixing molasses with water in a shallow container. Crickets are attracted to the sweet smell and will be drawn to it. Once they enter the container, they will get stuck in the mixture.<strong>Making Cricket Bait</strong>: In a shallow container, combine equal parts of molasses and water. Place the container in an area with cricket activity. The sweet scent will attract crickets, and they will become trapped in the sticky mixture.</li>

are both a health hazard and a nuisance.
The moist conditions including the organic matter in the septic tank allow the drain flies to reproduce fast. But fear not, I&rsquo;ll delve into ways you can use to get rid of drain flies in your septic tank.
Drain flies have a length of about 1/4 inch - they&rsquo;ll love the organic matter in the septic tanks,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/">bathrooms</a>
, sewage systems,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-basement/">basement</a>
, and near drains.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-septic-tank">Details: How to Get Rid Of Drain Flies in Septic Tank</h2>
<p>First, I&rsquo;ll need you to understand the cause of these drain flies. These bugs thrive and reproduce fast in the septic tank due to the moist conditions.
Drain flies will inhabit stagnant water, pipes, and drains. So, it&rsquo;s critical to solve the plumbing issues and septic tank moisture problems.
Check for moth-like, tiny bugs that will be near your septic tank and drains. The pests are brown, gray, or black - but there may also be maggots and larvae.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-an-inspection-and-remove-any-breeding-sites">Step 1: Conduct an Inspection and Remove any Breeding Sites</h3>
<p>First, I recommend you eliminate or remove those drain fly breeding locations. This location will have some decaying sewage and food, and other organic matter- which greatly encourages the breeding of the drain flies.
So, I recommend the process of cleaning the septic tank and drains around it - this will help eliminate the organic matter that would attract and host the bugs.
One method you may use will be cleaning these locations using
drain cleaners such as Bio-Clean
, Green Gobbler, or the Drano Max - these will help you flush out the organic matter that tends to build up in the septic tank and drains.
Besides cleaning the drains and the septic tank, you&rsquo;ll need to eliminate other different locations where the drain flies to breed. Some of these probable areas include fixing those plumbing leaks, and dirty or clogged gutters.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, inspect your spaces (drains, showers,toilets, gutters, or around sinks) using a flashlight to check signs of drain flies. Further, I recommend inspecting the outdoor sewage or drain systems.
Once you&rsquo;ve pinpointed the flies&rsquo; breeding sites, you&rsquo;ll require to fix the plumbing leaks, clean those gutters or drain out the standing water.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-use-drain-fly-traps">Step 2: Use Drain Fly Traps</h3>
<p>After removing those drain fly breeding locations, next,
you&rsquo;ll want to use fly traps
to get hold of any remaining bugs. Some of the approved drain flies include the pheromone traps or the sticky traps.
The pheromone traps employ some scented lure to attract the bugs. These trap&rsquo;s pheromones are created to be like the natural pheromones created naturally by flies - and which they otherwise use in their communication.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pheromones tend to attract the flies and hence they&rsquo;ll get near the trap and they&rsquo;ll get stuck on the sticky traps.
Sticky fly traps employ some sticky substance that&rsquo;ll trap the pests. The sticky substance used in this tool is the trapping item. You&rsquo;ll need to position the sticky drain fly in the right locations where the drain flies tend to land and breed most.</li>
<li>So, I recommend you place these traps near drains, toilets, and sinks - you&rsquo;ll position them near breeding sites, ceilings, and walls.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-apply-insecticide">Step 3: Apply Insecticide</h3>
<p>For a massive drain fly infestation in your septic tank, I recommend you use some insecticide. You may use either foams, dust, or sprays. But for each, adhere to the product description and follow the safety directions such as eyeglasses and ensure the spaces are adequately ventilated.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an effective technique if the other DIY drain fly control methods fail to control the bugs fully. You may have pellets, foggers, or sprays.
I suggested you get advice from a
professional exterminator or pest control technician</li>
<li>those that are near your residence or home.
Further, once you&rsquo;ve applied the insecticide, you&rsquo;ll require to sanitize or clean the spaces to remove the drain flies that are dead and also the residual chemicals.
You may use foam insecticides to treat locations that prove hard-to-reach like inside cracks, and pipes. The insecticide will expand to fill the deep gaps and thus they&rsquo;ll suffocate the bugs.</li>
<li>The dust-form insecticide for drain flies will work by coating the object surfaces while also the chemicals kill the gnats that come into contact with it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-seal-the-drains">Step 4: Seal the Drains</h3>
<p>Also, make sure that you keep great hygiene of your septic tank and the drains. This will hinder more of the drain flies from returning.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require to clean the septic tank and the drains - this will help to get rid of the organic matter - which would otherwise host the drain flies. In addition, cleaning the drain may also require you to employ bacterial treatments.
You must seal the septic tank and the drain to prevent their re-entry and breeding further. You may use a drain cover or plug for this.</li>
<li>Drain plus or covers may be of various sizes and materials including silicone, metal, or plastic - you can get them in the local home improvement shop or hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-hire-drain-fly-exterminators">Step 5: Hire Drain Fly Exterminators</h3>
<p>Finally, if all the techniques outlined above have not helped to remove those drain flies from your septic tank, you&rsquo;ll need to hire a drain fly exterminator.</p>
<ul>
<li>The technician will come with advanced equipment and also expertise that&rsquo;s targeted to specific pests including drin flies.</li>
<li>Such equipment will assist in the clear identification of the drain fly source and also in the efficient control of the infestation.
For the exterminator, you&rsquo;ll prefer, to get one that is experienced in tackling drain flies and also well reputable from client reviews. So, I prefer you enquire for review from family and friends, especially with the local exterminators they&rsquo;ve used.
Get the exterminator to inspect your septic tank, drains, and home in general for drain flies. This will assist in determining the level of infestation and hence knowing the treatment plan to employ -
could be fumigation
or insecticides.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drain flies in drains and septic tanks can be a nuisance. These locations provide an excellent location for breeding - due to the organic matter and water - you can use exterminators, seal drains, apply insecticides, clean the breeding sites, and use drain fly traps.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re tired of the nuisance brought by the tiny nuzzling insects (drain <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-septic-tank/">flies</a> also known as sewer flies) in your basement drains in your residence, it&rsquo;s time we go rid of them!
The basement has many attractants (moist areas and organic material like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-%5Bdrain%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/)-cleaners-work/">sewage</a>
) to these bugs including clogged drains, leaky pipes, and standing water where they&rsquo;ll lay eggs and multiply quickly.
Below, I&rsquo;ve explored some safe and effective methods on how you can remove drain flies in the basement -including ways to prevent any possible infestations.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-the-drain-flies-in-my-basement">Why Are The Drain Flies in My Basement?</h2>
<p>First, how and why did the drain flies get into your basement? Well, as noted earlier, drains flies are attracted to organic material and damp or moist environments. Therefore, your basement may have these conditions and thus promoting the development of these bugs.
A key reason for this is leakage of water in the basement - this may be from some leaking pipes. Also, clogged drains and standing water - will offer moisture and organic material for the drain flies and
gnats to thrive</p>
<ul>
<li>lay eggs, and reproduce.
However, drain flies can also arise from materials that came from outside the basement. Some of these conditions may include the bugs hiking onto pets, or clothing. So, it&rsquo;s important to fix the source of the drain flies and their nutritional source.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-method-of-removing-drain-flies-from-the-basement">7 Method of Removing Drain Flies from The Basement</h2>
<h3 id="1-clean-the-basement-drains">1. Clean The Basement Drains</h3>
<p>First, cleaning the basement drains will help remove the organic matter that builds up - and which acts as a good ground for bugs laying eggs. You may employ DIY or commercial methods and products to clean these drains.
a.
<strong>DIY Drain Cleaning</strong>
The DIY technique I recommend to clean the basement drains is using vinegar plus baking soda - luckily these products are effective but also safe to use around pets and humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply, pour the ingredients into the drains in equal measures - 1 cup of each - vinegar &amp; baking soda.</li>
<li>The chemical will produce bubbles and fizzle as it eats away the organic matter in the drains - so allow it to work its magic for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Finally, once the vinegar and baking soda works its magic, flush it down using hot water.
However, you must repeat the drain-cleaning process regularly - this will hinder the build-up of organic matter. I also recommend the use of drain covers as they&rsquo;ll help hinder the build-up of debris.
b.
<strong>Commercial Drain Cleaning</strong>
You can also use
commercial drain cleaners
to clean the basement drains and this will ultimately assist you to remove the drain flies. The chemicals in the cleaners will dissolve the debris and gunk (breaking it into small particles) that&rsquo;s clogged inside pipes.</li>
<li>But it&rsquo;s important to get a drain cleaner that won&rsquo;t harm your pipes - for example, check if the chemical is appropriate for pipes made of clay, metal, or PVC.</li>
<li>Notably, using a damaging drain cleaner (depending on the pipe type) will harm the pipes and lead to leakages.
Further, ensure to adhere to the manufacturers cleaner usage instructions for safety and effectiveness in cleaning the basement drains. For example, ensure to put on protective equipment such as eyewear and gloves.
Enzymatic drain cleaners would be excellent such as Bio-clean Drain Septic will be safe and not hard on the pipes - besides being eco-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-remove-standing-water">2. Remove Standing Water</h2>
<p>Having standing water in the basement will work to attract and breed drain flies. So, I recommend that you drain all the water including the small water puddles that may have collected in a corner after a cleaning exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you should remove water and clean the faucets and fix any pipe leakages in the house basement. To achieve this, you can use a dry or wet vacuum, mop the floor, or dehumidifier.
Also, examine the basement for any water seepage signs and this will require that you also seal any gaps or cracks. For example, you may also install a French drain system or a sump pump as this will assist you in removing the accumulation of water.
Besides, you can also eliminate the basement dampness and water by removing humidity and enhancing air circulation. Simply install some ventilation system, use fans, and open any available windows for better air circulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-use-sticky-drain-fly-traps">3. Use Sticky Drain Fly Traps</h2>
<p>Next, you can use drain fly traps in the basement to remove those bugs. You can use light traps or sticky traps. Light traps will use UV light to attract the bugs while the sticky substance in sticky traps will get hold and kill the bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fly traps will operate to deuce the drain fly population by catching them. Simple, you&rsquo;ll require to place the drain fly traps near those debasement drains or areas that have moisture.
Fly traps will effectively trap the fly larvae and the adults - however, using this technique is a short-term remedy for the bugs.
You should use this method in combination with other techniques such use of drain cleaners and regular removal of standing water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-use-fly-insecticides">4. Use Fly Insecticides</h2>
<p>Another option would be using insecticides to remove drain flies from the basement. The market has a number of effective insecticides that you can use on these bugs. However, their effectiveness will depend on correct usage and following the product label instructions.
Below are the guidelines and instructions you must follow while using the drain fly insecticides inside the basement area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put on some eye protection, a mask and gloves - and any other recommended protective clothing.</li>
<li>Ensure that the insecticide had ingredients that target drain flies specifically.
Also, considering that the insecticides are chemical based - you&rsquo;ll need to consider critical safety precautions when fighting the drain fly infestation.</li>
<li>So that you or your pet don&rsquo;t intake harmful pesticide fumes, you&rsquo;ll need to properly ventilate the basement.</li>
<li>Check the product instruction for the time to allow before going back to the basement after treating the area using the pesticides.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require to apply the insecticide directly on the moist areas including the drains.
To fully eliminate the drain flies, you&rsquo;ll require to repeat the bu-treatment process regularly or as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, drain flies have proven a nuisance especially when they invade your basement or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/">bathroom</a>
, mainly because these areas have moisture, dampness, and organic matter - conditions that promote the fast breeding of these bugs.
I hope the above DIY and commercially acquired products will help your get rid of the drain flies in your residential or commercial building basement.</p>

just like moths
) will mainly invade areas that have standing water including the kitchens and bathrooms.�In this article, I&rsquo;ll outline all you need to know how to get rid of drain flies in your bathroom.
<strong>But in summary; here&rsquo;s how to get rid of drain flies; Clean the Bathroom Drains,�Pour Boiling Water Down the Drain,�using a drain cleaner (such as Bio-Clean or vinegar + baking soda),�Use Baking Soda &amp; Vinegar,�Address Moisture Issues and Leaks, or�using bleach to clean drains.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="7-easy-ways-how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-bathrooms">7 Easy Ways How To Get Rid Of Drain Flies in Bathrooms</h2>
<h3 id="1clean-the-bathroom-drains">1.�Clean the Bathroom Drains</h3>
<p>To remove the drain flies from the bathroom, begin by cleaning all the spills and the drains. I recommend using a suitable
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner/">drain cleaner</a>
such as Chemical Drain or Bio-Enzymatic Drain to help destroy the organic matter in your drains.
However, incorporating a brush will also assist in removing the debris in the bathroom drains. This process will also help in removing any soap or food debris inside the drains.</p>
<ul>
<li>I recommend you repeat the drain cleaning process severally to reduce the drain flies plus themold and mildew- you may also use dehumidifiers to get rid of moisture.
But it&rsquo;s critical to ensure that the chemical components of the drains are cleaner are safe for your pets and humans in the space. Ensure to adhere to the drain cleaner usage instructions - which may include also wearing eye protection and gloves.
Here&rsquo;s the process to properly use the drain cleaner and get rid of the drain files from the bathrooms and moist areas such as bathrooms.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>First, remove the food waste and moisture (plus liquids) inside the drains - as these will be an attractant to the drain flies.</li>
<li>Cover the bathroom drains using some cloth or towel to avoid the splash of your drain cleaner as the chemicals would corrode the skin or eyes.</li>
<li>Finally, pour the drain cleaner into the bathroom drains and allow it to work on the organic matter for roughly 30 minutes before pouring hot water down.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-pour-boiling-water-down-the-drain">2. Pour Boiling Water Down the Drain</h3>
<p>Next, pour some boiling water into the bathroom drains (ceramic or metallic drains only) to help kill those drain fly larvae - this will be more effective if done about 30 minutes after pouring drains cleaners into the drains.
The water at high temperatures will kill those fly larvae but it&rsquo;ll also flush out the organic matter and other debris from the bathroom drains - these could otherwise attract other drain flies.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, be cautious that you must pour the hot water slowly into the drains to avoid splashing it onto your skin or eyes.
However, this technique of pouring hot water must only be applied to ceramic or metallic drains. This is because the hot water will damage your PVC or plastic pipes.</li>
<li>Hot water is an effective technique against drain flies but will also hinder the emergence of other drainage issues - especially blockages and clogs. This is because the water will dissolve the hair, grease, and soap.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3use-baking-soda--vinegar">3.�Use Baking Soda &amp; Vinegar</h3>
<p>Next, you may use baking soda &amp; vinegar (a combination) to remove drain flies from your bathroom. Baking soda and vinegar will combine to form a chemical compound that&rsquo;ll break down all the organic matter in the drain.</p>
<ol>
<li>The steps to use these ingredients will require you to combine - a 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup of baking soda &amp; vinegar respectively.</li>
<li>Pour this mixture down the bathroom drains - you&rsquo;ll notice bubbles and fizzling. Cover the drain using a rag or plug - this will help trap the chemical reaction inside the drain.</li>
<li>Allow the chemicals to sit in the drain for about 15 minutes before pouring hot water to flush down the drain flies - the chemical reaction will also break down the buildup and debris inside the drains.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll require to repeat the drain treatment process using baking soda and vinegar for a few days to fully get rid of the drain flies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-address-moisture-issues-and-leaks">4. Address Moisture Issues and Leaks</h3>
<p>Drain flies love moisture (or they&rsquo;re attracted to moisture) and thus it&rsquo;ll be advisable to address the moisture issues and leaks you have in your bathroom. This will include addressing the leakage issues under the bathtub or sink - and thus removing any standing water.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin with an inspection of the under areas of the bathtub and sink - check for any moisture or leakage as this may attract the drain flies.</li>
<li>Any leakages or moisture that is noticed in these areas must be eliminated immediately as it would as breading grown for drain flies or the liquid may damage different household structures.</li>
<li>Besides, I also recommend that you dry the mats and wet towels that are in the bathroom once you&rsquo;re done using them or clear them from the bathroom (if the items are wet). Don&rsquo;t leave wet fabrics and items on the bathroom floor or even piled in a corner or a basin - drain flies may breed fast in these conditions.
In addition to not leaving wet items around the bathroom, you&rsquo;ll require to drain any standing water in that space - this may be in the shower, bathtub, and sink.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to address the moisture problems such as fixing any leaking pipes - this will hinder the build-up of moisture that would ultimately attract drain flies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-use-bleach-to-remove-drain-flies-in-your-bathroom">5. Use Bleach to Remove Drain Flies in your Bathroom</h3>
<p>You may also clean the bathroom drain using bleach - it&rsquo;ll disinfect and remove the organisms and bacteria that tend to attract the drain flies.
These are the steps I recommend you use to effectively remove the drain flies from your bathroom using bleach.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, measure out a single cup of bleach and pour it into the bathroom or shower drain - ensure it does not pour onto the edges.</li>
<li>Let the bleach mixture sit inside the shower drains for about 20 minutes - this will be enough time for the chemical to get inside the pipes killing the organisms and bacteria.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to use hot to flush out the bleach, debris, and organic matter that&rsquo;s stuck inside those shower drains.
Finally, inspect if the shower drains still have drain flies - if these pests are still present., I suggest you repeat the application process by trying any of the above methods.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, sewer flies, gnats or drain flies can be a nuisance when they attack your kitchens and bathrooms.
Luckily, you can begin by getting rid of any standing water, unlocking the drains, and using chemicals such as black, drain cleaners, vinegar, and baking soda.
Cheers!</p>

<p>But, what color are flea eggs on a cat? Well, flea eggs have a rounded oval shape. If freshly deposited,
flea eggs
will look translucent white but change to pearl-like and opaque with time. Experts consider
flea eggs as dandruff
flakes, salt grains, and tiny pearls shaped.</p>
<h3 id="1-bathe-the-cat-with-a-flea-shampoo">1. Bathe the cat with a flea shampoo</h3>
<p>The kittens under 12 weeks old use ordinary
dish soap
to clean them up of any debris, fleas, and flea eggs.
However, mature cats, use cat
flea shampoo
to undertake the same role, mainly because adult cats can withstand insecticides and smell.
Cat flea shampoo has insecticides that will kill the adult frees and break their life cycle to stop them from further egg-laying. In this early bathing process, some
flea eggs will be washed
off the�cats fur.</p>
<h3 id="2-brush-the-cats-fur-using-aflea-comb">2. Brush the cat&rsquo;s fur using aFlea comb</h3>
<p>Next, take the special
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-combs-for-dogs/">flea comb</a>
. The flea comb must be designed to create closely spaced tines to comb the small fleas and any cat flea eggs present.
Therefore, upon running the
flea combs
a few times in the cat&rsquo;s fur, youll notice some back fleas and some rice-looking flea eggs coming off.
Ensure that the combing process is thorough on the cats chest and neck since fleas love the area - try

<h3 id="3-give-oral-cat-flea-preventative">3. Give oral cat flea preventative</h3>
<p>Also, cover the flea comb with some petroleum jelly so that the flea eggs and small fleas can stick to it.
To clean off the fleas and their eggs, ensure that dip the comb into soapy water or some
rubbing alcohol
which also will suffocate and kill them.</p>

flea population
will be scattered all over your house (including in the bed) with the pets hosting just 5% of the pests.
So, if you think bed bugs are the only disturbing pest you can have in your bed, then think again.</p>
<ul>

In this article, Ive outlined how to get rid of fleas in bed.

<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-bed">Details: How to Get Rid of Fleas in Bed</h2>
<p>Fleas will reproduce at a quick rate and after laying eggs the growth of the population will be very fast.
But you can remove fleas from your bed without hiring an exterminator -
even during winter
. Here are the steps you must take.</p>
<h3 id="1-verify-that-its-fleas">1. Verify that its Fleas</h3>
<p>Correct identification is a critical step while controlling pests including fleas.
So you have to respond to this question &ldquo;are these pests on my bed really fleas?&rdquo;
In summary here are the signs that will show the presence of fleas in your bed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Live Adult fleas</li>
<li><a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-flea-eggs-on-cats/">Flea</a> skin</li>
<li>Flea larvae</li>
<li>Flea eggs</li>
<li>Flea bite marks</li>
<li>Flea dirt</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="a-live-adult-fleas">a. Live Adult fleas</h4>
<p>Adult fleas will be visible to your naked eyes and will bite humans - they aren&rsquo;t microscopic or too tiny like the
dust mites
.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you can easily spot the fleas on your bed provided the eyes aren&rsquo;t too weak.
On physical appearance, fleas measure about 0.3 inches and they are reddish-brown or brown in color.
One distinguishing feature between fleas and bed bugs is that fleas can jump high thanks to their long hind legs which are visible.</li>
<li>Bed bugs luck the hind legs and they&rsquo;re also flat and oval-shaped.
You can check for fleas on the headboard, bed frame, or under pillows and mattresses.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-flea-skin">b. Flea skin</h4>
<p>Flea larvae will shed skin (twice) during the molting or growth process as they graduate to become pupae.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you see some flea skin on your bed it is enough to sign that there are larvae and adult fleas around.
But the flea skin casings (exuviae) will be seen easily using some magnifying glass.</li>
<li>The skins casings (when viewed using a magnifying glass) will appear like some soft white tube that is soft.
You can check for the flea skin on the bed frame headboard and under the mattress.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c-flea-larvae">c. Flea larvae</h4>
<p>Flea larvae may be challenging to spot because they are microscopic, measuring about 2 mm to 5 mm.</p>
<ul>
<li>The tiny worms will have an off-white color and some hairy bristles.
The flea larvae will be hiding most of the time (in cracks and gaps) since they don&rsquo;t crawl regularly on the bed.
But the worms will come out occasionally to
eat flea dirt
. They won&rsquo;t live on or bite humans.
The flea larvae will molt through different stages to become pupae (cocooned fleas).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="d-flea-eggs">d. Flea Eggs</h4>
<p>Without a magnifying glass, it will also be challenging to see flea eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>But these eggs will look like some salt grains measuring about 0.55 mm -quite tiny.
The flea eggs will have an oval shape - a feature that will help appreciate them from salt grains.
Qualify any grains that you find on the bed as flea eggs then they must be off-white, oval, and soft.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e-flea-bite-marks">e. Flea Bite Marks</h4>
<p>The presence of flea bite marks on a human who was sleeping on a bed can signify the presence of these pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Characteristic features of the flea bite marks are that they are red, tiny, and random on the human skin and tend to itch.
On comparing
flea bites vs bed bug bites
; bed bug bites will be spread all over the human body but flea bites are mainly found on the lower extremities (part) of humans.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll find flea bite marks on knee bends, uncles, and lower body
Flea bite marks are also comparatively smaller compared to the marks of bed bug bites.
Bed bug bites will look like some form of swelling while flea bites will appear like pimples or acne.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLxExsHhV2I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLxExsHhV2I</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-dont-allow-pets-on-the-bed">2. Dont Allow Pets on the Bed</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fond of allowing pets including cats and dogs to sleep next to you in the bed, it&rsquo;s time you either flea-treat animals or keep them off your sleeping area.
Cats and dogs (if not properly flea-treated) will drop fleas and their eggs on your bed.
The pests will be hiding in the pet&rsquo;s hair or fur and will drop off once the animal is resting or sleeping on the bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notable signs of these fleas on your bed will include the presence of flea dirt or just flea poop.</li>
<li>If you sprinkle the flea dirt with some water when laid on some white fabric they will return reddish brown.
If you notice fleas bites on your body after you&rsquo;ve slept next to your pet, then it is clear you must reject the enemy from the bed until it is treated.
You should flea-treat the cat or dog to avoid the emergence of a massive flea infestation.
Products I can recommend include;</li>
<li>Thetick and flea collars for dogswill offer protection to the dog for about 6 months.</li>
<li>Flea cleaning shampoowill also be appropriate to increase the protection for humans and pets against fleas.
You should retreat the pet, your home, and the yard to ensure your spaces won&rsquo;t hold fleas and they won&rsquo;t end up in your bed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-wash-all-the-bedding">3. Wash all the bedding</h3>
<p>Next, wash both your bedding and your pets and don&rsquo;t forget the clothes.
I recommend that you wash the bedding in cold water (plus some liquid detergent) first before washing them with hot water.
Another chemical that you can use with the washing water is bleach - this will kill flea eggs and adult fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add some of this bleach into the washing machine before rotating it at high speeds.
Washing the washable bedding materials will help dislodge the flea larvae eggs and adult fleas.
I also recommend that you launder the area rug, pillows, sofa throws and pets bedding using the highest temperature allowable for the materials.
Finally allow the bedding materials that can&rsquo;t be placed in the dryer to dry in the sun outside.
Other items that you must wash at temperatures over 95 degrees Fahrenheit include comforters, blankets, pillowcases, and sheets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-vacuum-the-mattress">4. Vacuum the Mattress</h3>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, you should vacuum the mattress to remove fleas from the bed. But ensure to check that your mattress can be vacuumed and its average drying time.</p>
<ul>
<li>After vacuum cleaning the mattress, don&rsquo;t sleep on it within 6 hours.
Flea eggs will be hiding inside the mattress seams since I don&rsquo;t stick on various offices including the fur of the pet.</li>
<li>This allows the flea eggs to fall off easily from the pet&rsquo;s fur and land on the bed, the carpets, or bed cushions.</li>
<li>Search activities can promote the development of a new and massive flea infestation.
So you should clean the mattress to prevent the advancement of the flea cycle. So, repeatedly vacuum the whole surface of the mattress to help remove the flea larvae, flea eggs, and adult fleas.
The last and the most important part of vacuuming the mattress will be disposing of the vacuum bag correctly to avoid reinfestation of the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-de-flea-the-bed-and-mattress-fully">5. De-Flea The Bed and Mattress Fully</h3>
<p>After vacuuming the mattress and washing the bedding fully, can fleas could still escape and hide in cushions and carpeting waiting to jump back in your bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, experts recommend that you fully deflea the bed area and the mattress.
First, avoid using boric acid because it could be toxic to humans who will be sleeping on that bed.
Below are effective and safe flea killers that you can use around the bed area.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Diatomaceous Earth (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas/">food grade DE</a>
) will kill fleas by breaking their exoskeleton to dehydrate the pests.
Luckily, DE is effective yet non-toxic and so it will help remove that free infestation in just a few days.</li>
<li>The next technique is to de-flea the mattress completely by using quality mattress encasement.
I recommend that you use a
mattress encasement
continuously until there are no more signs of fleas.</li>
<li>Use a quality flea spray such as the Vet&rsquo;s home spray to exterminate the pest.
Some of these sprays will kill the flea eggs and the adult fleas on contact. So if you need a quick and effective solution for the fleas around your bed, go for home flea sprays.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas are irritating pests and they&rsquo;ll have painful bites plus have different health effects.
It&rsquo;s common for home homeowners to find fleas on the carpet, their pets (dogs and cats).</p>
<ul>
<li>However, finding fleas on your bed or that of your kids might be surprising (including other living areas) but it still happens.</li>

<p>Vacuuming Carpet[/caption]</p>
<h2 id="disinfect-the-items-on-the-carpet">Disinfect the Items On the Carpet</h2>
<p>Gather all the cushions, pet bedding, and other fabrics that are lying on or near the carpet -
with or without a host
. Wash thoroughly and dry them off at the highest setting. The fleas that are hidden in the items will get killed from the heat of the washer and dryer.</p>
<p>In case you cant wash an item, properly vacuum it. Dont forget to vacuum the underside of the furniture.�Remove the cushions from the upholstered furniture, wash and dry the covers at the highest setting and vacuum all of it.</p>
<p>Put in some extra effort and steam clean it  the heat helps to kill the fleas as at any stage of their life as they cant endure temperatures over 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The dormant flea pupae also wake up because of the heat, making it easier to kill them.</p>
<p>Do this and you can get flea free carpets- Almost 95% of the flea infestation resides in the carpets; hence disinfecting the carpet when theyre in their developing stage is necessary to permanently get rid of them.</p>

<h2 id="disinfecting-the-carpet">Disinfecting the Carpet</h2>
<h3 id="method-1-vacuuming">Method 1: Vacuuming</h3>
<p>Your vacuum cleaner is the most important tool when it comes to getting rid of fleas in carpet. Its not only the simplest but also the best method to disinfect the carpet of fleas.</p>
<p>The vacuum is powerful enough to suck up adult fleas, their eggs, larvae and most of the pupae as well. Vacuuming not only eliminates the adult fleas but fleas from all stages of their life.</p>
<p>It also sucks up the disgusting pre-digested blood feces that appear like coarse ground black pepper.</p>
<p>Moreover, the vibrations the vacuum cleaner creates can cause flea pupae to come out of their cocoon, making it easy for the vacuum cleaner to suck them up.</p>
<p>Cocoons are hard to kill or eliminate as theyre insecticide resistant and usually attached to the base of the carpet fibers. Bringing them out is the most effective method when dealing with them.�When vacuuming, make sure you cover every inch of the carpet in the room.</p>
<p>Spend some more time and effort on the corners, or dark, humid parts of the room and areas where your pet spends time. Make sure you empty out the vacuum bags outside of your home, to prevent them from sneaking back. Do this each day for at least 2 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="method-2-steaming">Method 2: Steaming</h3>
<p>Like we mentioned before, fleas cannot bear temperatures above 95 degrees. Steam can kill the fleas hiding in the carpet or at least cause dormant flea pupae to leave their cocoons, making them vulnerable and an easy kill.</p>
<p>If youve got little ones around and are looking for non-toxic cleaning methods, steaming can eliminate fleas and sanitize the carpet in a natural way.</p>
<p>You can get buy or rent a home steam cleaner or hire a professional cleaning service. The steamer creates strong hot steam that can be used over unholstered furniture and carpets. Continue vacuuming to capture the new born fleas that emerge after the steam cleaning.</p>
<h3 id="method-3-use-different-flea-killers">Method 3: Use Different Flea Killers</h3>
<p>You have plenty of options to choose from which you can use to eliminate fleas in carpet. Your choice depends on whether you want to opt for a natural or chemical method.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Also, on how extreme the infestation is or the sensitivity of your pets.�These are some of the options you have at hand,</dt>
<dt><strong>1. Baking soda and salt</strong></dt>
<dd>Its a natural and safe way to deal with light to medium infestations. Sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda and salt on the carpet and leave it for 24 hours. Check on the situation to see if most of the fleas are killed, after which you can vacuum them up. If you dont see a lot of progress, let it stay for about a week.
<strong>2. Diatomaceous earth</strong></dd>
<dd>Other than severe infestation, this method will work in all the situations. Get hold of food-grade diatomaceous as it is natural and safe.</dd>
<dt>Scatter a thin layer of it over the carpet, with high concentration in your pets favorite hangout spots and beneath furniture. Let is rest for a good 4 to 5 day period and then vacuum it all up.</dt>
<dt><strong>3. Natural flea spray</strong></dt>
<dt>:The spray is also a safe and natural way to deal with light to medium infestations. Spray the flea treatment on your carpet and let it do its work. Vacuum it once the spray has dried off.</dt>
<dt><strong>4. Insecticides</strong></dt>
<dd>These are packed with chemicals and come in different levels of toxicity. Insecticides work best when youre dealing with severe infestations. Adulticides are specially made to kill adult fleas but wont work for others.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you want to wipe out the infestation, you must kill fleas from all stages of life. So, get an insecticide that has both adulticide and insect growth regulators in it. A combination of these will kill the adult fleas and the larvae as well.</p>
<p>Although boric acid works well against fleas in carpets, it can be toxic for your pets and cause discoloration, so its best to not consider it as an option.
**5. Lemon Spray: **
You can use lemon as a natural home remedy against fleas.�In order to eliminate fleas from your home, you need to make a citrus spray which can be sprayed over the infested furniture and carpet.</p>
<p>Just add thin slices of a lemon to a small quantity of water and bring it to boil.</p>
<p>Allow the citrus solution to rest overnight and place it in a spray bottle. Spray this solution all over the infested areas in your house. Make sure that you only dampen the carpet and not soak it with the solution. Vacuum up the residue after a few days.
<strong>6. Fogging:</strong>
This technique is the most effective way to get rid of fleas quickly. The fog manages to reach even the tiniest of cracks and crevices, wiping out the infestation completely.</p>
<p>Professional pest controllers use this method in case of severe infestations. It needs to be carried out more than once. The downside of this method is that the fog is extremely poisonous, and you will have to vacate the house for a few hours along with your family and pets.</p>
<p>Ensure that food items and utensils are kept covered. Close all the windows and doors and put off the smoke alarms momentarily. Once the process is over, open the windows and door and let it ventilate for a couple of hours before you step in. Along with fleas youll find other dead pests as well.</p>
<h2 id="surveying-the-situation">Surveying the Situation</h2>
<p>Carrying out any of these methods can help you to successfully eliminate fleas in carpet. Leave out flea traps on the carpet so you can keep check on the situation.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-use-flea-traps">Step 1: Use <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-flea-eggs-on-cats/">Flea</a> traps</h3>
<p>Flea traps offer an easy method to remove fleas from your home. They contain a chemical that attracts insects, which then die on their sticky surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common type of trap is &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; as it has glue on one side or both sides for catching the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be used easily anywhere at all-around your home - under furniture, behind appliances like washing machines and dishwashers, along baseboards, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Place these near where you find them to have the highest concentration (like carpets).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may also place them next to animal habitats such as couches, pet beds/crates if they&rsquo;re present in your home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a DIY flea trap, you&rsquo;ll require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Night lights</li>
<li>Dinner plates or Bowls</li>
<li>Dishwashing liquid</li>
<li>Warm water
To make a DIY flea trap, fill bowls with warm water mixed with dishwashing liquid and place a candle at the center of the bowl.</li>
</ul>
<p>Position the dinner plate or bowl on some wood and turn on the Night Light. Fleas will jump towards the night light and be stuck in the liquid soap. So, dispose of those traps which have done their work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYKOkaZN9cU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYKOkaZN9cU</a></p>
<p>Flea traps are essentially heat scares with a light bulb turned on, so that the fleas can be attracted to them.</p>
<p>This DIY flea trap takes less than a minute to make and is perfect for minor infestations. All thats needed are dish detergent, water, and an LED lightbulb (non-heat emitting).</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the basic or bowl&rsquo;s edge is shallow to allow easy jumping for the fleas.</li>
<li>Also, position the flea trap near the floor to allow easy access by the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-use-flea-sprays">Step 2: Use Flea Sprays</h3>
<p>You can
apply flea sprays for homes
such as the Vets-Best Spray on pet&rsquo;s bedding - pillows, blankets, couches, rugs, and carpets to exterminate fleas &amp; flea eggs on contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, avoid spraying on sensitive pet areas such as around their face - use abrush or flea comb instead.
What many people don&rsquo;t know is that most flea sprays are also topically applied to any areas of concern such as furniture where they might reside during non-active hours.</li>
<li>Fleas become active at certain times of the day so spraying outdoors and inside while there&rsquo;s activity should do the trick for now!
You may not need to use many different products, but it will depend on how severe your infestation is!</li>
<li>If unsure of any product&rsquo;s toxicity or if there are children or pets in the home, please contact a vet before using.
Flea treatment is tricky for pets. All the eggs, which will hatch soon after they are laid, need to be killed at the same time as the adult fleas.</li>
<li>So, use a flea spray + flea tablets to ensure that any future infestation is dealt with immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-use-flea-tablets">Step 3: Use Flea Tablets</h3>
<p>Flea tablets�such as the
Novartis Capstar are fed on cats
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-dogs/">dogs</a>
to remove fleas with fast results - exterminating the bugs in about 30 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea tablets are used in combination with a good flea shampoo.
The flea tablet helps to kill the eggs and larvae of the insect on contact, while the shampoo helps remove live fleas that may be stuck on your pets skin or fur.</li>
<li>The best way to tell if an animal has been bitten by a tick is through its behavior �- such as lethargy, having decreased appetite, not grooming properly (or dong it excessively), etc.
Flea tablets work well for dogs especially because they can get very dirty at times and hard to wash off effectively enough without some assistance from medication like this!</li>
<li>But flea tablets won&rsquo;t exterminate flea eggs, pupae, and larvae - plus they&rsquo;ll only be effective for 24 hours and thus require re-treatment after this time.
Flea tablets will work best when your pet is visiting areas with a high risk of fleas like pet parks, pet hotels, grooming salons, or vet clinics. But it would help to combine flea tablets + flea sprays.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-flea-foggers">Step 4: Flea Foggers</h3>
<p>In contrast to sprays and powders, which can reach only a small area at one time, fogging (e.g. with Hot Shot No-Mess) kills any visible insects in the room or house where it is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>IGR fogging also has the benefit of killing off any eggs before they ever hatch.
For safety, you&rsquo;ll require to cover up dishes, utensils, and food plus seal off the doors and windows for an average of 2 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long does it take a fogger to kill fleas? Foggers are not the quickest method of killing fleas, but they do not take long.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fogger pesticide must absorb into the body before it can take effect enough to cause death.
NB: Flea-treat the pet before taking it back to the house treated with flea foggers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-vacuuming-for-fleas">Step 5: Vacuuming for Fleas</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too uncomfortable with fogging your house,
vacuuming can work
to a certain degree as well.</p>
<p>When we say vacuum, what we mean is a hard floor cleaner with one of those disposable bags (never use a bagless vacuum).</p>
<p>Vacuum all areas where bugs might hide: under furniture, rugs, bedding/curtains, etc., but remember never put anything down the tube; only suck up debris or dust on top of surfaces with no gaps underneath.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, discard the contents of a crevice tool and clean any nooks you can find.
If you have a vacuum with strong enough suction and covering as much space as required, the eggs will be sucked up. Use it on floorboard (crevices or cracks), beds, furniture, and curtains.
**NB: **
*1) Feed your pet (cat or dog) a flea tablet. 2) Vacuum the house to find and kill fleas and dog hair before you start spraying. *</li>
<li>The flea tablet will remove the adult fleas while the flea spray will exterminate the flea eggs.
The vacuum bag needs to be kept outside the house and detached carefully until it can be discarded in a sealed bag, an incinerator, or by other means.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-6-hire-flea-exterminators">Step 6: Hire Flea Exterminators</h3>
<p>A flea exterminator will come to your home and spray, fog, or steam the entire house.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas are small enough that they can easily move through cracks in floors, walls, and furniture.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why many people do not realize they have flea infestations until it starts causing problems like allergic reactions on a child&rsquo;s skin or intense scratching from an animal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some signs of a flea problem include live fleas found near sleeping areas; larvae (immature stages) frequently seen around pet bedding such as dog beds, cat litter boxes, bird cages; fecal pellets - tiny black spots near floor baseboards under furniture where pets sleep or rest their heads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exterminator will use a vacuum to remove any adult fleas from your carpets and furniture. They will also fog, or steam the entire house including inside walls with insecticide.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When they are finished, you should notice that there is little evidence of flea activity in your home. This means less itching for everyone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flea infestations can be controlled by using preventative measures such as monthly spot treatments on pets and vacuuming daily to keep them out of our homes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-fleas-in-your-home">How to Prevent Fleas in your Home</h2>
<p>Preventing fleas is one of the most important ways to take better care of your family and pets. To help you avoid an infestation altogether, read my helpful tips below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean and groom the cats and dogs properly: Ensure that the pets skin and coat are clean and dry before treatment with a product, which helps to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction.</li>
<li>Apply monthly treatments on pets: Spot treatments should be applied from neck to tail at least monthly. This will help prevent fleas from jumping onto your dog or cat when they come in contact with other flea-infested animals or people.</li>
<li>Vacuum daily and wash bedding weekly: Flea eggs hatch within two weeks sovacuuming around the homeis essential for removing any potential breeding ground! Be sure to also vacuum furniture such as couches if possible. It&rsquo;s also important to wash bed sheets weekly in hot water - this kills off any larvae and their eggs.</li>
<li>Yard: Fleas will likely appear on the pet and in your home but they can also live outside year-round if there are no flea treatments applied to this space. Keep grass mowed short, remove any clutter or potential sources of food for the insects such as fallen leaves, pine needles, or other debris that may accumulate near yards where pets spend time outdoors.</li>
<li>Flea collar: These collars work by releasing a chemical called cyphenothrin into an animal&rsquo;s skin when it is worn around its neck. This kills off adult fleas that jump onto them so they don&rsquo;t have access to biting the dog - perfect for houses with outdoor dogs!</li>
<li>Outdoor Insecticides: If you&rsquo;re having trouble with your pet, wash your sheets at least twice a week.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion on how to get rid of fleas in the house fast, there are a number of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, you can use vacuum cleaners to suck up fleas and their eggs from carpets or other areas in your house where they might be nesting.</li>
<li>You can spray surfaces with natural flea repellents, like lavender or rosemary. You could also use a steam cleaner to clean up your house quickly and efficiently, without using chemicals that might be harmful to you or the environment.</li>
<li>Flea-treat the pets in your house and make sure to vacuum or steam clean often.</li>
<li>Finally, in some cases, it may not be practical to get rid of all the fleas at home yourself because of how many there are - so consult professionals who know how best to kill them in order to help make sure they don&rsquo;t come back!
The best way is probably to try out various methods until you find one that works for your household because everyone has different living habits which contribute to how easy or difficult it will be to get rid of these pests.</li>

</ul>
<p>This article will detail all of the steps on how to get rid of fleas in the house forever.</p>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Fleas Killer for Apartment&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step---how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-the-house-forever">Step-by-Step - How to Get Rid Of Fleas in the House Forever</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-flea-treat-the-dog">Step 1: Flea-Treat the Dog</h3>
<p>Fleas are tiny, wingless insects that live in the fur of animals like dogs and cats. One of the best ways to rid your dog of fleas is with flea shampoo.</p>
<ul>
<li>After a bath, take the time to work down his or her legs and under their armpits at which point you will have rinsed away any fleas that are left behind.
Rinse the pet to flash down the fleas into the drain - maybe it&rsquo;ll require another washing - also check these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>For your dogs safety, it is necessary for you to either apply Advantage or Frontline flea prevention between the pet&rsquo;s shoulder blades.</p>
<p>You may need to reapply for this monthly product for three months, in order to keep fleas under control in the house and yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common way to treat a dog with flea-infested is by using topical treatments such as fipronil, permethrin, or selamectin
After applying the treatment, it will take around 24 hours for all of the fleas on your pet&rsquo;s body to die. However, this does not mean they&rsquo;re gone forever!</li>
<li>The fleas may return after some time has passed if you don&rsquo;t maintain regular housecleaning routines which include vacuuming carpets regularly and washing bedding weekly.
Remove and flea-treat all bedding from your dog&rsquo;s crate or kennel as well as furniture items that have come into contact with them (couches, chairs).</li>
<li>This includes blankets of any kind including pillows and stuffed animals.
Anything left may carry live eggs which could hatch before being noticed later when new laundry comes out to air dry.
Vacuum carpets thoroughly
at least twice using a vacuum cleaner with a beater bar attachment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sprinkle borax every two feet on the carpet and let it sit for 12-24 hours to kill any remaining flea eggs that may have been missed in your first vacuuming session.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum up all of the borax after 24 hours have passed, or when you leave the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-flea-treat-the-yard">Step 2: Flea-treat the Yard</h3>
<p>If you have a yard, the environment your Flea-Treat the Dog lives in can be an infestation point. The best thing to do is get out there and Flea-treat it!</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re going to need some water, a hose or garden sprayer, dish soap (optional), cayenne pepper, and baking soda. More importantly than anything else - patience.
Flea-treat the yard. Experts recommend using flea and flea-eggs to control pesticides to treat your lawn and common areas. Spray where the dog walks, and at any other places, it frequents outside.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a yard free of harmful fleas, homeowners have many other treatment options.</p>
<p>Wondercide will kill fleas and other household pests (ants, spiders, and cockroaches) in your yard, but you need to apply it more than once every few months.</p>
<p>Wondercide is a safe and effective insect repellent that can be applied as needed. It has numerous uses, such as for flea-treating the yard, or preventing pests at home.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-flea-treat-the-house">Step 3: Flea-treat the House</h3>
<p>First, you ask, how do I get rid of fleas in my house fast?</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure your home is clean and vacuum all carpets, pet hair, and upholstery.</li>
<li>Treat fleas with a preventative product or liquid insecticide. Be sure the treated areas are not over-saturated so as to avoid the risk of fire hazards.</li>
<li>Remove reservoir hosts from your yard (grasses, leaves) which serve as food sources for flea larvae - and the wholeflea life stages.
If you want a long-term solution to killing fleas, then its best to use pesticides inside your home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum your house thoroughly before going on to the next step - vacuum all crevices and corners.</p>
<p>Once you have vacuumed the carpet, be sure to throw out your vacuum bag.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pets must be removed from the premises for at least 2 - 3 hours before and during house and yard treatment.
Steam clean the pet beds, upholstery, and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/getting-rid-of-fleas-in-the-carpet/">carpets.</a>
Do the laundry. Wash all bedding in hot water and dry on high heat for at least 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Vacuum or sweep floors, including under furniture. Throw out any vacuum bag contents as fleas could survive in them for up to a year if they get stuck inside it
Clean your pet&rsquo;s bowls, litter box, food dishes with soapy dish detergent and rinse well- then scrub clean with a bleach solution of one tablespoon bleach per quart of warm water (or use commercial products designed to kill flea larvae).</li>
<li>Immediately throw away stuffed animals that cannot be washed because their stuffing can harbor flea eggs and pupae alive; seal cracks where pets might have been living or hiding indoors such as along baseboards; Launder infrequently used bedding and other household fabrics in hot water.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-use-flea-igrs-and-flea-bombs">Step 4: Use Flea IGRs and Flea Bombs</h3>
<p>Spray the flea pesticide in the house. Once youve applied the pesticide, it&rsquo;s time to deploy one or more flea bombs in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective pest control for every room of the house and garage is a must. You can place them on newspapers or rolls of paper towels to make cleanup easy after their detonation!
How to use Flea bombs:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the flea bomb in a safe space where pets and children are not likely to get into it, such as on top of a dresser or under furniture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep people and animals out of the room for 4 hours after setting off the flea bomb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pets can re-enter 4 hours later but should be monitored closely during this time period because they may have been exposed to harmful chemicals from the fog created by using a flea bomb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply liquidflea killers with IGRson crevices, cracks, and carpet - this will hinder flea larvae development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, you can sprayflea-killing powderssuch as Fleabusters that&rsquo;ll fully cut down the flea life cycle in 4 - 6 weeks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave windows open so that air is able to circulate without any obstruction throughout your home afterward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an air purifier if possible; this will help remove any lingering chemical residue left behind by the bombs which could cause respiratory issues with dogs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To rid your house of fleas, you will need to vacuum the floors and shampoo the carpets. Repeating these tasks monthly for 3 months is necessary in order to fully eradicate the pests from your home.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-diatomaceous-earth-and-borax-for-fleas">Step 5: Diatomaceous earth and borax for fleas</h3>
<p>No one likes fleas. They are annoying and spread diseases from person to pet, animal to animal, sometimes even across the country but diatomaceous earth and borax can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Especially in hot climates like Florida, where I live with my family during the summers, we&rsquo;re constantly combating them as they seem to come out of nowhere when you least expect it.
Diatomaceous earth is a natural product made up of fossilized remains of diatoms - microscopic algae-like organisms found on our planet since prehistoric times (it&rsquo;s also known as DAP).</li>
<li>It can be purchased at feed stores or online for use against pests such as bedbugs and most types of roaches. One application will kill all bugs present on contact alone; no need for any other pesticide or chemical.
Borax is also a natural mineral, mined from the earth in compounds that make it safe for use around pets and children.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s commonly used as an insecticide because roaches are especially susceptible to its toxic properties - meaning one application typically takes care of all types of pest bugs at once without any need for follow-up applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>The big takeaway: Diatomaceous earth and borax can be combined together to combat fleas with ease!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems that you were looking for how to get rid of fleas in the house forever! Well, there are many ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea-treating the pets is another technique to make sure that little fleas don&rsquo;t come into the house.</li>
<li>Flea-treat the lawn or yard with insecticide to kill the fleas and their larvae.</li>
<li>You can also sprinkle the borax powder into carpets, cracks, upholstery, or other areas where it&rsquo;s possible that eggs may be laid.</li>
<li>Another great idea is to vacuum all carpeting at least once per week because vacuuming removes most adult fleas from carpets as well as their larvae which hatch out of the pupae.</li>
<li>You can also use sprays or foggers that will go into every nook and cranny of your home, killing adult fleas as well as larva in a matter of hours.
If these steps are not enough, call a professional! They will know how to get rid of fleas in the house forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, I hope you found what you are looking for and happy cleaning! Remember: borax powder, vacuum, and sprays or foggers will get rid of fleas in the house.</p>

<h3 id="1-dawn-dish-soap-for-killing-fleas">1. Dawn Dish Soap for Killing fleas</h3>
<p>Do fleas die in water? Generally, flea eggs and adult fleas won&rsquo;t kill fleas - just like most insects eggs will survive underwater for days.�Just taking your pet for some swim won&rsquo;t kill fleas effectively.
But cleaning the pet
using dawn dish soap
mixture - the soap helps break the water&rsquo;s surface tension - enabling the tiny fleas to sink and drown. Place a lamp near the water to attract fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dawn will kill the bugs within five minutes - and thus you&rsquo;ll be ready to rinse the clothes and bedding. For your pet, you may use a handheld showerhead or a cup of water to rinse the dawn soap.
Further, if you thoroughly wet and lather the pet&rsquo;s fur with dawn soap
andflea comb
, you&rsquo;ll drown most of the files eggs. The soap mixture will destroy the bug&rsquo;s
exoskeletons leading to drowning.
<strong>Wash all clothes &amp; bedding for 10 minutes ( in cold water):�</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undertake routine washing and dry clothes and bedding. If there are clothes that can&rsquo;t be washed but can be dried, then you&rsquo;ll need to put them in the dryer and run it on a hot cycle for about 30 minutes - which willkill the fleastoo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flea eggs and adultswill not die easilywhen immersed in water. Fleaswill survive in waterfor about seven days. Further, fleas will only drown in water after 24 hours when submerged as they sit on the water and not break water&rsquo;s surface tension. Fleas have cuticles that are covered with wax, and hence its skin is non-wettable with water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>However</strong>: Dish soap drops have surfactants that reduce water&rsquo;s surface tension and hence make the flea sink in water and drown. Therefore, washing the fabric with your detergent for ~ 10 minutes would make adult fleas drown<strong>but not the pre-adult fleas</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flea eggs + larvae in your bedding and clothes will require the use of more rigorous laundry methods: This drives us to tactic #2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemDY5em-Cg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemDY5em-Cg</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2max-washing-machine-settings-soap">2.�Max Washing Machine Settings**+ Soap�**</h3>
<p>Using a washing machine with water + soap will help remove fleas from your bedding and clothes. The water turbulence and heat plus that laundry detergent helps in exterminating the fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fleas in all the life stages are either exterminated during the washing process, or they&rsquo;ll eventually end up in your drainage and sewer.
Also, any of the fleas or other insects that&rsquo;ll remain in the initial stages of the washing will be killed by the machine&rsquo;s or water turbulence and the heat.
All you have to do is wash the clothing.�The challenge is getting the right ingredients/ temperature and transporting the clothing and bedding to the laundry area (without dropping some fleas), either in your home or elsewhere.
<strong>Wash Clothing and bedding in Hot Water:�</strong></li>
<li>Depending on the type of fabric: Cotton, Silk, Wool, etc&hellip;�Wash the clothes in a washing machine or just hot water in a basin.</li>
<li>However, including a detergent (the mild-type) to the hot water. Check thesevacuums for fleas.</li>
<li>Adult fleas are exterminated at temperatures surpassing 35 C (95F) and when it is under 13C (55.4F). Also,Flea larvaewill die in their cocoon at a temperature of over 35 C.</li>
<li>The mechanical action and the hot water in the washing machine would definitely dislodge the fleas from the clothes and beddings and send them down the drain. The flea adults, eggs, larvae, and pupae would not survive through the laundering &amp; drying process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-clean-with-bleach-water">3. Clean with Bleach Water</h3>
<p>You can efficiently end the flea cycle on your bedding and clothes using bleach - you&rsquo;ll exterminate both fleas and also adult fleas. Fleas jump off the get to the dark, moist, and warm places.
You&rsquo;ll find fleas hiding in the house where pets sleep and live. So, you&rsquo;ll also need to bleach-clean the pet carrier and crates, floors, couches, and bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the bleach and clean your nonporous surfaces like floors and crates or carriers - water plus bleach - put this in your spray bottle or also use some cleaning rag or paper towel.
Wipe the surfaces upon applying the bleach water - you may through the fabrics into your washer with bleach - as opposed to just using the regular detergent.
Check the bleach bottle instructions to know the amount to use on your bedding and clothes - depending on the load. Also, use bleach that&rsquo;s color-safe to protect all colored fabrics.</li>
<li>For safety, ensure pets and humans (including kids) won&rsquo;t ingest the bleach as it&rsquo;s harmful.</li>
<li>Vets recommend keeping kids and pets away from bleach-treated surfaces, bedding, and clothes for a minimum of three hours.
But use bleach only on fabrics that can withstand it, but ensure it is well diluted. Mix water (16 gallons) and chlorine bleach (1 cup) - this will disinfect and kill fleas in clothes.</li>
<li>For bedding, fabrics, and clothes that won&rsquo;t be bleach-safe, use phenolic disinfectants, pine oil, or different antimicrobial detergents.</li>
<li>Remember to wash the fabrics and clothes at maximum temperature, wash cycle, and water setting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-quarantine--flea-treat-the-pets">4. Quarantine &amp; Flea Treat the Pets</h3>
<p>Most fleas (~
<em>90% of fleas</em>

So, practice persistence and vigilance but use a
flea fogger
if you have a massive flea infestation. So, ensure to groom and examine the cats and dogs for fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a different technique for flea treatment on pets including oral medication and topical medication. Also, check to keep the yards and homes free from fleas.</li>
<li>Shampoo and wash the pet bedding, sofas, and carpets regularly using steam and hot water. Some of the medications will target flea eggs and larvae while others will exterminate adult fleas.
Groom the pets to unearth fleas and
ticks
following every walk you make. For ticks, check the pet&rsquo;s ears, neck, and paws and undertake flea-treatment when you&rsquo;re traveling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-flea-clean-the-yard">5. Flea-Clean the Yard</h3>
<p>Housekeeping is a great line of defense against fleas in your house and property. Therefore, trim the shrubs, mow the grass, and clean the yard to control fleas - also try the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">flea spray for the yard</a>

After doing the landscaping, undertake processes that&rsquo;ll dissuade wildlife and feral pets from getting into the yard - as this may allow them to drop fleas.
While at it, control the entry of feral cats, raccoons, and
Chipmunks
, Opossums. Also, don&rsquo;t leave feeding bowls used by cats and dogs in the yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim the high shrubs and trees that may allow the wild animals to crawl into the attic. Also, seal the under decks, sheds, garages, and crawl spaces - try<a href="https://pets.webmd.com/flea-tick-control-15/default.htm">flea and tick killers</a>.</li>
<li>Further, for shrubs planting, ensure the trees will be separated enough from each other and away from the structures including the house.

      <description>Fruit flies</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fruit flies
are tiny flying bugs that&rsquo;s attracted to rotting and over ripened fruits such as grapes, plums, strawberries, mangoes, and watermelon.</p>
<p>Each female will lay 500 eggs in summer and they&rsquo;ll develop to adults within 8 - 10 days.
Fruit flies come
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fruit-flies-come-from/">thrive in warmer temperatures</a>
with rotten fruits and vegetables laying their eggs in wall cracks,
home kitchen, or in cafeterias, hotels, and restaurants. So, how to get <a href="/posts/homemade-fruit-fly-trap/">rid</a> of fruit flies?</p>
<h2 id="1-toss-fruits-and-wipe-them-out">1. Toss Fruits and Wipe Them out</h2>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to too or dispose off the rotting or overripe vegetables and fruits that may be in your house or kitchen. Notably, fruit flies will hatch and then proceed into your foods.</p>
<p>Next, dip the vegetables and fruits that are not yet infested in some soapy water (or apple cider vinegar). Next, wash or use a clean towel to wipe all the produce. Finally, rinse the fruits with clean water and dry them.</p>
<p>This will clean off all the fruit fly eggs that could be lying on the surfaces of the produce. However, put the produce in a sealed contained or the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Wipe out all the possible breeding grounds for fruit flies. These areas include the cabinet surfaces or kitchen tops. In addition, you, must wipe out the bottom and inner sides of the trash cans to remove food residue and spills.</p>
<p>Remember to use trash bags but also dispose them off daily. However, any bag that&rsquo;s not full will need to be covered - at least if you won&rsquo;t be tossing it off.
Finally, clean up the moist drain as it may have fermenting waste - your may use one of the
best drain cleaners
. It&rsquo;ll easily unclog the drains with organic and fermented mater - including those of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<h2 id="2-apple-cider-vinegar--dawn-dish-soap">2. Apple Cider Vinegar + Dawn Dish Soap</h2>
<p>Apple cider vinegar�is the magical best fruit fly trap. But why do fruit flies love v
inegar? Well, vinegar is
<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vinegar/">fully fermented organic matter</a>
(with excellent scent). Fruit flies love broken-down natural ingredients and its acidity.

The bugs will jump into a jar containing Apple cider vinegar and drown in it as they try to drink it with its mouth-parts - acting like a Kryptonite. The requirements to make the vinegar fruit fly traps are just a
<a href="http://www.academia.edu/27434106/How_to_Get_Rid_Of_Fruit_Flies_with_a_Homemade_Fruit_Fly_Trap">plastic wrap and a jar or glass</a>
.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pour a portion of your Apple cider vinegar into a glass. Cover the glass with vinegar using a plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Now, use a pin or toothpick to poke some 2-4 small holes on the plastic wrap. This will allow the smell of your white vinegar to emerge.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to poke a bigger hole at the center of your plastic cover - this is where the fruit flies will gain entry into the glass.</li>
<li>Now, leave the glass with Apple cider vinegar around the area having a fruit fly infestation. To ensure that the fleas won&rsquo;t escape the glass having white vinegar - add 3-10 drops of<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dawn-dish-soap-for-fleas/">dawn dish soap for fleas</a>that&rsquo;ll act like glue on the insects.</li>
<li>The fruit flies will be stuck in the vinegar jar as they can&rsquo;t move out - they&rsquo;ll finally die.</li>
<li>Repeat the Apple cider vinegar treatment daily until the fruit fly infestation ceases.
<em>Alternatively�</em></li>
<li>Pour boiling water or boiling Apple cider vinegar in the infested drains. This will quickly repel the fruit flies from your yard and home.</li>
<li>The boiling liquids will flush out the fruit flies from the hidden and moist places such as toilets, garbage disposals, sink drains, and shower drains.
<em>Why Vinegar + Soap Works:�</em>
Fruit flies will be attached to the Apple cider vinegar due to its great scent. Therefore, the flies will try to land of the vinegar. But the soap will have broken the vinegar&rsquo;s surface tension making the fruit flies to sink and drown.
Luckily,
Apple cider vinegar is e
nvironmentally-friendly, cheap and won&rsquo;t generate harsh fumes. But liquid dish soap isn&rsquo;t&rsquo; safe for human consumption and thus must be kept far from kids.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3beer-or-old-wine-trap">3.*Beer *or Old Wine Trap</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/better-smelling-beer-thanks-fruit-flies">New scientific research</a>
show fruit flies have a unique relationship with yeast that&rsquo;s is beer or old wine. Yeast secretes some sweet scent that&rsquo;ll attract the fruit flies.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply pour half a glass of fresh or old beer into some mason jar that&rsquo;s covered with a lid. Place the bottle of glass with the beer at the area where you saw the fruit flies.</li>
<li>Hammer some holes on the lid of the metal lid covering the bottle, glass or jar. The fruit flies will enter the container, feast on the bear and ultimately drown.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to drop a little bear on top of the glass cover - this will lure the fruit flies into your stale beverage. The bugs will be trapped by the bottle&rsquo;s narrow neck - it acts as a natural barrier as they can&rsquo;t jump out.
<em>Why�Beer (Alcohol) works:�</em>
Similar to the case with vinegar, the smell of beer or wine attracts fruit flies. However, you can also some some drops of the dish soap that&rsquo;ll consequently act like glue.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4-liquid-soap--water--light">4. Liquid Soap + Water + Light</h2>
<p>Our next fruit fly trap will be using water plus liquid soap. For this trap, you&rsquo;ll simply mix the liquid soap and the water in a bowl.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix soap + water in the bowl until is creates a foamy and bubbly bath.</li>
<li>Next, position the bowl with the foamy water under some bright light such as stove lights or other lamps.</li>
<li>The light from your source will create a reflection that&rsquo;ll attract the fruit flies. However, the dish soap will make the flies to drown as it&rsquo;ll have broken the surface tension of the water.
<em>Alternatively:�</em>
Use an old fruit, vinegar plus a paper cone. Thus, simply position a large piece of overly rip fruit and some little vinegar in glass or a jar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, roll down some paper cone into your jar - ensure that it sticks. Place the narrow end of the paper cone at the bottom of the jar.</p>
<p>Thus, the odor of the smelling fruit in the mixture will attack the fruit flies. However, the fruit flies won&rsquo;t easily climb up the paper cone and thus they&rsquo;ll be trapped in the jar.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>How to prevent a fruit fly infestation.�The surest way of preventing a fruit fly infestation is by avoiding to attract them at all. Therefore, the main considerations would be maintaining a clean dining area and kitchen.</p>
<p>Wash Fruits and Vegetables.�As noted earlier, fruit flies will also pitch camp on dirty, overripe or rotting produce - fruits and vegetables. Thus, to prevent an infestation, you&rsquo;ll need to thoroughly wash and dry the produce.</p>
<p>Wash your eggplants, broccoli, apples, or melons etc once you get them from your store. The washing process will remove the eggs and adults of these fruit flies.</p>

<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-ground-bees">Details: How to Get Rid of Ground Bees</h2>
<p>The easiest method to eliminate ground bees is through chemical sprays labeled for ground bees, such as Spectracide.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-ground-bees-and-what-do-they-look-like">What are ground bees, and what do they look like?</h3>
<p>Unlike other wild bees that nest above the ground, ground bees have their residence inside holes conspicuous with the pile of dirt. Colletes inaequalis is one of the most common ground bees. All ground bees belong to the order Hymenoptera.
<strong>Quick Facts:</strong>
About 70% of the 20,000 bees species have their nests in the ground. However, apart from the honeybees, other types of honey bees leave their nests during fall.
Pollen bees are different from other honey bees that pack waxy combs. All the known pollen bees dig ground brood chambers and feed their subterranean young on bee bread, made up of pollen cakes combined with honey and other substances.
Ground bees, unlike other bees species, lead a simple life. They have no worker slavery, overstuffed queens, and no losing individuality.
To have a clear idea of how they look, check the Ground bees pictures below:
Many bees dig underground burrows. Therefore, it is essential to know the unique identifying factors for ground bees.
For example, Bumblebees also use an underground nest, but ones that are left by rodents.
Different from the operation of ground bees
, bumblebees exist as social colonies.
You can quickly identify if they operate as social colonies from a distance. Keenly check if the bees approach the ground nest in multiples or singles. However, be
safe when coming the nest
as the bumblebees as dangerous while defending their colonies.
Further, like Bumblebees,
yellow jackets
live in ground nests but also unoccupied rodent holes. However, ensure to know the difference between
wasps and bees
since some wasps also settle in ground nests. Therefore, approach the nest with caution without assuming that it contains harmless wasps.
**Caution: **
Do not attempt to kill the ground bees by pouring chemicals and gasoline in the ground nest. Such actions will kill both flora and fauna settled in that area.
The female ground bees dig a chamber in dry soil and would loose soil around it. Also, she provides nectar and pollen to the nest. Further, male ground bees fly over the conical dirt piles to check for potential mates.
<strong>Beneficial insects:</strong>
Ground bees fall under the beneficial insects class that play the pollination role. Although many ground bees species are not harmful, they are considered defensive and can harm humans or pets.
There are many wild and characteristically solitary bees. The wild bees are considered very important to the pollination of both domestic and wild plants. Ground bees are one of the wild bees that act as pollinators.</p>
<h3 id="size-and-color-of-ground-bees">Size and color of ground bees</h3>
<p>Ground bees have colors ranging from purple, red, blue, yellow, and black. They are about one inch long.
Ground bees have their mating season between March and May. Female bees in the colony of ground bees function as worker bees. The females dig burrows in the mating season, ready to fill them with eggs and bee bread.

<h2 id="are-ground-bees-dangerous">Are Ground Bees Dangerous?</h2>
<p>Male ground bees like
Carpenter Bees
do not have a sting! Mainly, the male ground bees are the ones that fly over the bee nest. However, male ground bees are very aggressive but will not sting.
On the contrary, female ground bees are not aggressive but can sting. Therefore, ensure that you will irritate them to cause them to initiate self-defense.
Therefore, ground bees will only sting if they are aiming to defend themselves and their colony. However, ground bee nests are as dangerous due to the chemicals that come with the bee sting.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beneath the lush, green surface of your <a href="/posts/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/">lawn</a>, an unseen threat might be silently undermining its health: lawn grubs. These C-shaped, white larvae are the immature stage of various beetles, including Japanese beetles, May/June beetles, and chafers, and they have an insatiable appetite for the roots of your turfgrass. A severe grub infestation can quickly transform a vibrant lawn into a patchy, brown, and spongy expanse that peels back like a rug, leaving homeowners scratching their heads and reaching for solutions.</p>
<p>The key to effectively combating lawn grubs lies in understanding their life cycle, recognizing the signs of their destructive presence, and employing timely control methods. From preventative measures that deter egg-laying adults to targeted treatments for active infestations, a multi-pronged approach is often necessary. This guide will walk you through how to identify these subterranean pests, explore both organic and chemical strategies for their removal, discuss crucial prevention techniques, and advise on when it&rsquo;s best to call in a professional, ensuring your lawn can recover and thrive once more.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-grubs">Identifying Grubs</h2>
<p>Accurate identification is the first crucial step in dealing with lawn grubs. Often, the damage they cause can be mistaken for drought stress, making proper diagnosis essential.</p>
<p><strong>What Grubs Look Like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Grubs are typically C-shaped, milky white larvae with a brown head and six legs near the head. They are plump and soft-bodied.</li>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> They can range in size from about 1/4 inch to over an inch long, depending on the species and their stage of development.</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> They are found just beneath the soil surface, feeding on grass roots.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Signs of Grub Damage:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Irregular Brown Patches:</strong> Initially, you might notice patches of browning, wilting grass that resemble drought stress. Unlike drought, these patches won&rsquo;t green up with watering.</li>
<li><strong>Spongy Turf:</strong> The affected areas of your lawn will feel soft and spongy underfoot due to the roots being chewed away.</li>
<li><strong>Grass Lifts Easily:</strong> In severe infestations, the grass in damaged areas can be pulled back like a loose carpet, revealing the grubs underneath, as the root system has been completely severed.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Animal Activity:</strong> Birds (especially crows), raccoons, skunks, and moles will frequently dig in your lawn, searching for grubs, often causing additional damage.</li>
<li><strong>Beetle Activity:</strong> A large number of adult beetles (Japanese beetles, June bugs, etc.) flying around your yard in early to mid-summer can indicate that egg-laying is occurring, leading to future grub problems.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How to Check for Grubs (The &ldquo;Pull Test&rdquo; and Digging):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a brown, suspicious patch of lawn.</li>
<li>Try pulling up the grass in that area. If it peels back easily, gently like a piece of sod, revealing no roots or very few, it&rsquo;s a strong indicator of grubs.</li>
<li>Dig a square foot section of sod about 2-4 inches deep in an affected area (and also in a healthy area nearby for comparison).</li>
<li>Carefully inspect the soil for grubs. A healthy lawn can tolerate a few grubs (around 5-10 per square foot). If you find 10 or more per square foot, treatment is likely warranted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preventing-lawn-grubs">Preventing Lawn Grubs</h2>
<p>Prevention is often the most effective and least invasive way to manage grub populations.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Healthy Lawn Practices:</strong> A dense, healthy lawn with a strong root system is more resilient and can tolerate a higher grub population without showing significant damage.
<ul>
<li><strong>Proper Mowing:</strong> Mow at the highest recommended height for your grass type (2.5-3.5 inches). Taller grass develops deeper, stronger roots.</li>
<li><strong>Deep, Infrequent Watering:</strong> Encourage deep root growth by watering deeply (1 inch per week) and infrequently.</li>
<li><strong>Balanced Fertilization:</strong> A well-fed lawn is stronger. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can create lush, tender growth that grubs might prefer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Timing Adult Beetle Control:</strong> If you have a severe problem with adult beetles (e.g., Japanese beetles) feeding on your garden plants in early summer, addressing them can reduce the number of eggs laid in your lawn. However, direct adult beetle control on the lawn is generally less effective for grub prevention than targeted grub treatments.</li>
<li><strong>Preventative Insecticides (Chemical):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Look for products containing active ingredients like Chlorantraniliprole (e.g., GrubEx) or Imidacloprid.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> These are applied in <strong>late spring to early summer (typically May to mid-July, depending on your region and specific beetle life cycle)</strong>, <em>before</em> grubs hatch and begin feeding heavily. They work by killing the grubs as they hatch from the eggs.</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Highly effective when applied correctly and at the right time.</li>
<li><strong>Caution:</strong> Read labels carefully. Some preventative chemicals can be harmful to pollinators if applied during bloom times or to plants they visit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-lawn-grubs">How to Get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-crabgrass/">Rid</a> of Lawn Grubs</h2>
<p>Once you have identified an active grub infestation, curative treatments are necessary. The timing of these treatments is crucial for success.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal Timing for Curative Treatments:</strong> The best time to apply curative grub control is in <strong>late summer to early fall (August to October in many regions)</strong>, when grubs are small, actively feeding close to the surface, and most vulnerable to insecticides. They are also causing the most visible damage at this time.</li>
<li><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Look for products containing active ingredients like Carbaryl or Trichlorfon.</li>
<li><strong>Application:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Apply the product evenly according to label directions.</li>
<li><strong>Water In:</strong> Thoroughly water the lawn immediately after application (about 0.5 inches of water) to wash the chemical down to the grub feeding zone. This is critical for effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Post-Treatment Recovery:</strong> After successful treatment, damaged areas may need overseeding or patching (with sod) to help the lawn recover. Continue with good cultural practices to promote healing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="organic-ways-to-get-rid-of-grubs">Organic Ways to Get Rid of Grubs</h2>
<p>For those seeking a more eco-friendly approach, several organic options exist:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Beneficial Nematodes:</strong> These are microscopic, naturally occurring roundworms (<em>Heterorhabditis bacteriophora</em> is a common species for grubs). They are parasites that seek out and kill grubs by entering their bodies, releasing bacteria, and multiplying.
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply in late summer to early fall when grubs are young and actively feeding. Soil temperatures should be between 50-90�F (10-32�C).</li>
<li><strong>Application:</strong> Follow specific product instructions, as nematodes are living organisms. They require moist soil and application during cooler parts of the day (early morning or evening) to survive UV light. Water before and after application.</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Can be effective but are sensitive to environmental conditions and proper application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Milky Spore (Paenibacillus popilliae):</strong> This is a naturally occurring bacterium that specifically targets Japanese beetle grubs. It causes a fatal disease in the grubs, and as they die, more spores are released into the soil, providing long-term control.
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Can be applied anytime when soil temperatures are above 60�F (15�C). It is a slow-acting preventative.</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Very specific to Japanese beetle grubs. Takes 2-3 years to establish sufficient levels in the soil for effective control, but then can last for 10-15 years. Not suitable for immediate relief from a severe, active infestation from various grub types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Reinforce all the good lawn care practices mentioned under &ldquo;Preventing Lawn Grubs.&rdquo; A healthy, vigorous lawn with deep roots can often withstand minor grub populations without showing significant damage. Over-watering and excessive thatch can create conditions favorable for grubs.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Picking (Small Areas):</strong> If you only have a few grubs and very localized damage, you can manually pick them out of the soil when you find them.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hiring-a-professional-exterminator">Hiring a Professional Exterminator</h2>
<p>While many homeowners can effectively manage grubs themselves, there are situations where hiring a professional lawn care service or exterminator is the best course of action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severe, Widespread Infestation:</strong> If your lawn is extensively damaged or the grub population is overwhelming, a professional has access to commercial-grade products and equipment for more effective and efficient treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Diagnosis:</strong> If you&rsquo;re unsure if grubs are truly the problem, a professional can accurately diagnose the issue, saving you time and money on incorrect treatments.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Problems:</strong> If grubs are a perennial issue despite your best efforts, a professional can assess underlying conditions and develop a long-term management plan.</li>
<li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> If you simply don&rsquo;t have the time or physical ability to apply treatments yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Chemical Application:</strong> Professionals are trained in the safe and precise application of pesticides, minimizing risks to your family, pets, and the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>A professional will typically inspect your lawn, identify the specific grub species, and recommend a tailored treatment plan, often incorporating both preventative and curative strategies.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Lawn grubs are a formidable foe for any homeowner striving for a healthy, green lawn. However, by understanding their life cycle, recognizing the early warning signs, and implementing a well-timed strategy, you can effectively minimize their destructive impact. Whether you opt for a preventative approach, targeted chemical treatments, or embrace organic solutions, consistency and accuracy are paramount.</p>
<p>Remember that a healthy, well-maintained lawn is your first and best defense against most pests, including grubs. By fostering strong roots and resilient turf through proper watering, mowing, and fertilization, you not only make your lawn less appealing to grubs but also enable it to recover more quickly from any damage they might inflict. With diligence and the right approach, you can ensure your green space remains a vibrant and grub-free haven.</p>
<h2 id="faqs-about-getting-rid-of-lawn-grubs">FAQs About Getting Rid of Lawn Grubs</h2>
<p><strong>Q1: When is the absolute best time to treat for grubs?</strong>
A1: The absolute best time for <strong>preventative</strong> grub control (e.g., with products containing Chlorantraniliprole) is late spring to early summer (May-July) to target hatching grubs. For <strong>curative</strong> treatments (e.g., with Carbaryl or Trichlorfon) on existing damage, late summer to early fall (August-October) is ideal, when grubs are small and most vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: Will grubs kill my entire lawn?</strong>
A2: A severe, untreated grub infestation can kill large sections of your lawn, potentially causing it to lift up like carpet. However, it&rsquo;s rare for an entire mature lawn to be completely destroyed if damage is addressed in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: Are the adult beetles (e.g., Japanese beetles) the same as the grubs?</strong>
A3: Yes, the grubs are the larval stage of these beetles. Adult beetles lay eggs in the soil, which hatch into grubs that feed on grass roots. Controlling the adults can reduce future grub populations, but direct grub control is usually more effective for lawn health.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: How long do grubs live in the soil?</strong>
A4: Most common lawn grubs (like Japanese beetle grubs) have an annual life cycle. They hatch from eggs in summer, feed through fall, overwinter deep in the soil as larvae, move up to feed again briefly in spring, then pupate, emerging as adult beetles in early summer to start the cycle again.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: Is milky spore effective against all types of grubs?</strong>
A5: No, Milky Spore is highly specific to Japanese beetle grubs. It will not be effective against other grub species like those of May/June beetles or European chafers. Always identify the specific grub causing the problem before choosing a treatment.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-no-see-ums">How to Get Rid of No-See-Ums</h2>
<p>The biting and blood-sucking no see ums bugs are quite dangerous.
You might mistake them for wasps, bees, gnats, or mosquitoes - their features and effects will match those of the biting Midges or No See Ums.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-identify-noseeums">Step 1: Identify Noseeums</h3>
<p>The bugs are very small and you&rsquo;ll find them around the yard, lawn, or your garden. It&rsquo;s critical to correctly identify the noseeums.
This is to ensure that you&rsquo;re truly dealing with or controlling noseeums and not just mosquitoes. This will affect the bug-control technique you&rsquo;ll employ.
<strong>1. Standing water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The No See Ums will be around some standing water as they require it for procreation.
Thus, check if your property or home has standing water that hasn&rsquo;t been drained for long. This can play host or homage to the no see ums.
Further, the bugs love eating nectar - which&rsquo;s largely available in lawns and gardens.
<strong>2. Have saw-like�mouthparts</strong></li>
<li>The mouthparts of no see ums are saw-like since they&rsquo;re created for sucking blood.
Therefore, the bugs will bite humans and pets frequently (painful bites) particularly in the yard or outdoor spaces.
<strong>3. They carry diseases</strong></li>
<li>The No See Ums do carry diseases including Leishmania and Carrions Diseases (Bartonella bacilliformis).
The bites for the bugs around the tropical regions may lead to chronic illnesses like phlebotomus and may equally transmit worms like the Filarial worms.
The noseeums will equally make humans sick (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-no-see-ums-live-in-my-hair/">maybe hiding in your hair</a>
) besides leaving marks that are itchy and painful. Thus, homeowners consider it urgent to control the bugs.
<strong>4. They have winged hairs</strong></li>
<li>The bugs also have varied color patterns and winged hairs. It has segmented antennae (15) that it uses to suck blood from wild animals, pets, and humans.
The tiny bugs measure about 1/8-inch or under and are grey-colored.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-noseeums-inspection">Step 2: Noseeums Inspection</h3>
<p>Inspecting for noseeums will help you in the bug control phase. This phase helps identify the places ( &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;) where the bugs will get attracted to, congregate and breed.
<strong>1. Hotspots to inspect�</strong>
So, if you&rsquo;re wondering about the hotspots to check the noseeums. I noted above that they&rsquo;ll mainly hide around standing water just like with mosquitoes.
So, inspect those swampy and muddy areas - there are the
places they&rsquo;ll lay eggs - also check on moist soil, streams, and lakes.</p>
<p>The bugs will largely attack humans in the outdoor spaces and thus you should start the inspection there. Check for all standing water around the home.</p>
<p>I would check the pets&rsquo; water bowls, uncovered (and undrained) garbage cans, puddles, tree stumps, rain barrels, potted plants, ornamental fountains, rain gutters, and birdbaths.</p>
<p>Indoors, I would inspect the utility rooms, bathrooms, and kitchens as these are also areas that the no see um will hide ready to bite - if there is standing water or leaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vMkQfEVCsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vMkQfEVCsU</a>
<strong>2. Cues to Check for</strong>
But what cues will you be looking for as you inspect for no see um? We&rsquo;ve noted that you&rsquo;re largely checking for standing water.</p>
<p>But since the no see um will be tiny to see clearly, you&rsquo;ll require to check on the hotspots for signs of their breeding or hiding. Also, is there wet mulch, yard debris, or moist soil?</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve identified the breeding area of the no see ums, you&rsquo;ll thus easily apply the bug treatment you&rsquo;ve selected to exterminate them.
<strong>3. No See Um Treatment�</strong>
No wits time for treating the no see ums after you&rsquo;ve identified their activity.</p>
<p>But before going deeper into the bug treatment, carefully read and adhere to the product label instructions such as putting on the PPEs advised.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-no-see-ums-control">Step-by-Step: No See Ums Control</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-removing-standing-water">Step 1: Removing Standing Water</h3>
<p>First, before you apply that no see um treatment, you&rsquo;ll require to remove the bug&rsquo;s breeding grounds.
So, remove the moisture grounds (and water) including the standing water in and around the house or property.
First, drain the yard, unclog the rain gutters, empty the foundations, and turn over the buckets to remove the standing water.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-use-igrs-treatment">Step 2: Use IGRs Treatment</h3>
<p>Nest, you&rsquo;ll need to undertake outdoor no see um treatment using products like Tekko Pro or Reclaim IT IGR.</p>
<p>These insecticides will exterminate or repel a variety of pests including these no see um in the outdoor spaces like the patio, garden, or yard.</p>
<p>For example, the Tekko Pro IGR will exterminate different no see um stages (undeveloped stages) including eggs and larvae that could be lurking in the property.</p>
<p>Mix Tekko Pro and Reclaim IT IGR (1 fl. oz. + 1 ounce respectively); then spray on the outdoor spaces using that pump sprayer on an area of about 1,500 square feet.</p>
<p>Begin spraying on the front and yard including on the ornamentals, groundcover, flower beds, and mulch beds. This must be more on areas with standing water and moist soil.</p>
<p>For safety, avoid letting pets and humans going onto the places treated for no see um until it&rsquo;s fully dry. Next, you&rsquo;ll require to spray around the property perimeter.</p>
<p>Further, spray around windows, outdoor lighting fixtures, tree trunks, garages, foundations, and siding to control the Midges using the Tekko Pro &amp; Reclaim IT.</p>
<p>Further., reapply the no see um treatment within 1-2 weeks to reduce the bug population. But you may require a fogging or misting machine for serious infestations or commercial spaces.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-treat-indoors-usingpyrid-aerosol">Step 3: Treat Indoors Using<strong>Pyrid Aerosol</strong></h3>
<p>To remove no see um in the indoor spaces or also the house, you&rsquo;ll like to use the Pyrid Aerosol. But vinegar plus dish soap can also help in exterminating the bugs.</p>
<p>Pyrid aerosol is excellent for indoor no see um treatment as it&rsquo;s a good space and contact spray that&rsquo;ll easily and fast knock down the bugs. The aerosol will remove or repel the bugs from the pets and humans around your house.</p>
<p>However, ensure to remove all the food objects like pots, bowls, and glasses. Also, ensure to close doors, windows, and your air conditioner.�The Pyrid Aerosol should be applied over 1,050 cubic ft for 1-3 seconds.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t let humans or pets get into the sprayed spaces for 15 minutes - and also undertake proper ventilation before allowing living beings into the spaces. Also, wipe those countertops and the eating surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-no-see-um-prevention">Step 4: No See Um Prevention</h3>
<p>Some of the no see um prevention steps include:
<strong>a.</strong>
Spray Pivot 10 IGR and Reclaim IT prior to the start of the no see um season - especially the time when these bugs are most active in the region. Also, re-apply the insecticides within 1-2 weeks if this is required for an area with massive no see um infestation.
<strong>b.</strong>
Put on long clothing while working, playing, or relaxing in the outdoor spaces to reduces the chances of no see um bites and related infections. I would recommend getting long stockings, long-sleeved shirts and also long pants.
<strong>c.</strong>
Fix all the faulty plumbing and leaky faucets to reduce the habitats or hiding spots for the no see um bugs. Also, install some screens on the doors and windows.
<strong>d.</strong>
Repair, fix, or reduce any moisture areas in and around the house. Further, check that the rain gutters operate effectively, and remove any buckets that may hold storm or rainwater.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The last step on how to get rid of no-see-ums is undertaking appropriate prevention steps.</p>
<p>This can be undertaken without conducting massive changes to the yard or garden environment.</p>

<p>Using boric acid is one of the most effective techniques to kill palmetto bugs. Its a natural mineral thats able to kill the palmetto bugs. The acid disrupts the digestive system and nervous system of the bugs causing death. The downside is that you wont see its effect right away. Patiently wait for a few days to notice the bugs disappear over time.</p>
<h3 id="2-non-toxic-roach-traps">2. Non-Toxic Roach Traps</h3>
<p>Using roach traps is a maintenance-free method to get rid of palmetto bugs. These are quite different from the conventional roach traps. These traps employ non-toxic ingredients to bait the roaches towards the sticky glue surface. These traps should be placed strategically in the kitchen, cupboards and garage.</p>
<h2 id="getting-rid-of-the-palmetto-bugs">Getting Rid of the Palmetto Bugs</h2>
<p>We know youre disgusted by them and dont want to go anywhere near them. Learn ways by which you can free your house of the palmetto bugs before you start seeing them everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="1-roach-glue-traps">1. Roach Glue Traps</h3>
<p>Get hold of sufficient amount of roach glue traps and set it in multiple positions all over the house. Its better and safer if you use non-toxic roach traps, especially if youve got toddlers or pets at home.</p>
<p>Some areas where you must place these traps are the kitchen, cupboards, wardrobes, bathroom, basement and garage. The higher the number of traps, the more effective they will turn out to be.</p>
<h3 id="2-homemade-boric-acid-roach-baits">2. Homemade Boric Acid Roach Baits</h3>
<p>This is definitely the most efficient and cost effective way to deal with palmetto bugs. Although you wont see on the spot results through this method, but we assure you that the palmetto bugs stand no chance against it once theyve consumed it or are exposed to the mineral.</p>
<p>There are two ways through which boric acid works on the palmetto bugs. One of it is through its consumption. In case the palmetto bug digests the boric acid, it would result in the disintegration of its digestive system. Over time, it can lead to even more disruption inside the nervous system of the bug.</p>
<p>The other way is through the abrasive property of the mineral. The boric acid creates an itchy sensation on the exoskeleton of the palmetto bug and it gradually dries out. As the bug is unable to maintain the internal fluid balance, it doesnt last for a long time.</p>
<p>Cover your hands with a pair of gloves and mix different ingredients to make bait for the palmetto bug. Use the boric acid and mix it with a small quantity of flour, sugar and Crisco. The mixture would end up with a sticky dough-like texture. Leave the mixture alongside familiar insect-entry points.</p>
<p>Although boric acid is a naturally occurring mineral, keep in mind that it has a mild level of toxicity. So in case youve got pets or little kids, its best to avoid this method, as accidental ingestion could be dangerous for their safety. There are other safer alternatives available that you can opt for in that case.</p>

<h3 id="3-food-grade-diatomaceous-earth">3. Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>This is also an organically occurring white powder and is used to achieve the same result to boric acid. Similar to boric acid, it also comes with a naturally-abrasive property.</p>
<p>Diatomaceous earth has a painful effect on the bugs that come into contact with it. Its sharp microscopic edges feel like stepping on shards of broken glass for them.</p>
<p>Take hold of a sack of food-grade diatomaceous earth and cover the areas where you think palmetto bugs are likely to pass from with sufficient amounts.</p>
<p>Ensure that you dont accidentally get pool-grade powder instead, as its extremely poisonous. Food-grade diatomaceous earth is fairly safer, unless you somehow breathe in large quantities of powder.</p>
<h3 id="4-sealing-cracks-and-gaps">4. Sealing Cracks and Gaps</h3>
<p>Gaps, holes and cracks along the house walls provide an easy entrance point for these insects. Simply seal these entry points and youd notice the number of palmetto bugs decreasing overtime.</p>
<p>Although they are reasonably bigger in size, theyre still somehow able to slip though the little cracks and gaps, and sneak into your house.</p>
<p>Carry out a detailed inspection of your entire house. Check if all the openings are blocked with materials such as caulk. These bugs can even make way in your house via the electrical outlets.</p>
<h3 id="5-a-pet-cat">5. A Pet Cat</h3>
<p>As surprising as it may sound, a pet cat can be a lot of help against the palmetto bugs. So in case you were planning to bring a pet cat home, heres one more reason why you should.</p>
<p>If youve got friends who have cats at home, youd notice that youve never seen palmetto bugs roaming around their houses. Thats because cats do a killer job to get rid of them. Cats not only play with them, but also at times eat them.</p>
<p>We know it sounds disgusting as you can imagine those bugs crawling in unhygienic places. So you should train your cat to only catch the palmetto bugs and not consume them.</p>
<h2 id="what-draws-in-palmetto-bugs">What Draws in Palmetto Bugs?</h2>
<p>As the famous saying goes, prevention is better than the cure, and it fits perfectly for pest control.</p>
<p>Itll be easier for you to get rid of the palmetto bugs if youre aware about the things and conditions that attract them originally. These are a few things that you need to be careful about to keep the palmetto bugs at bay.</p>
<h3 id="1-wet-and-warm-environments">1. Wet and Warm Environments</h3>
<p>Warm and humid environments are an ideal hideout for the palmetto bugs. This is why youd notice that the number of palmetto bugs inside your house start to increase when the weather outside becomes cool and dry.</p>
<p>Create an environment inside your house that isnt preferred by them. You can make use of a dehumidifier as itll help to dry out the inside air.</p>
<p>Inspect your house and look for potential water leakages coming from the broken pipes, broken faucets and roofs. Anything that might cause some areas of the house to become wet; even blocked drains, should be fixed on an immediate basis.</p>
<h3 id="2-leftover-food-wastage">2. Leftover Food Wastage</h3>
<p>Make sure that all the food scraps in the kitchen is discarded in an enclosed trash bin. Always use airtight sealed containers to store food that isnt placed in the refrigerator, making sure that the palmetto bugs are unable to reach the food. You dont want them feeding on your food and surely wouldnt enjoy the sight of them as toppings on your food.</p>

<h3 id="3-mess-and-clutter">3. Mess and Clutter</h3>
<p>Surroundings that provide ample of space for hiding is usually preferred by the palmetto bugs. It could be as simple as a stack of old newspaper lying in a corner of the house or a pile of leaves in your backyard. Its about time you correct your messy ways of living and develop a habit of keeping the house neat, clean and in order.</p>
<h2 id="plants-that-repel-palmetto-bugs">Plants that Repel Palmetto Bugs</h2>
<p>Some plants can help repel palmetto bugs from your house. These are some of the household plants that arent loved very much by these bugs.</p>
<h3 id="1-chrysanthemums"><strong>1. Chrysanthemums</strong></h3>
<p>The flowering plant has a natural insecticide compound called pyrethrins. After the plant becomes mature, you can squash them and put it all over the house to repel the palmetto bugs. Its not advised for pet owners as it can turn out to be toxic for cats and dogs.</p>
<h3 id="2-catnip-plants"><strong>2. Catnip Plants</strong></h3>
<p>Professionals have found out that these plants have a certain chemical called
<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/08/990827071500.htm">nepetalactone</a>
. These have the potential of repel not only palmetto bugs but its other equally disgusting relatives as well.</p>
<p>Were sure now youre aware of how to get rid of palmetto bugs. With the help of the tips that weve provided you, you can easily disinfect your home and keep it safe from palmetto bugs.</p>

<li>**Storage jars or containers should be washed with plenty of soap &amp; hot water (this helps kill moth&rsquo;s eggs), while infested or contaminated food substances should be disposed of whatsoever. **
<em>Consider changing the current storage method as well and avoid re-stocking your pantry immediately upon cleaning as this may lead to the moth&rsquo;s re-occurrence. Importantly, take thorough measures in your house to prevent future re-infestation.�To gain in-depth insight, let us get into the discussion.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-pantry-moths">How to Get Rid of Pantry Moths</h2>
<h3 id="1-removeclear-everything-from-pantry">1. Remove/Clear everything from Pantry</h3>
<p>Remove and clear all dry food on the shelves or pantry. Whether contaminated or not, you need to clear your pantry sufficiently and inspect the presence of pantry moths.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful to check the larvae too  this can be done using a hand lens or convex lens.</li>
<li>Consider removing crockeries, open cans, and closed items as well before actual cleaning is undertaken. The idea of items removal encompasses opening up space for direct observation of moths and their life cycle.
Further, this approach scares moths from their hideouts, thus making it easier to capture and fumigate them to death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-wipe-pantry-with-a-mixture-of-warm-water-vinegar-and-peppermint-oil">2. Wipe pantry with a Mixture of Warm water, Vinegar, and Peppermint oil</h3>
<p>The mixture of vinegar, water, and
peppermint oil repels moths
away and prevents future infestation.
Further vinegar inhibits moths eggs hatching into larvae, while the solvent disinfects the surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Soak a piece of cloth into a mixture of vinegar, warm water, and peppermint oil. Wipe your pantry gently. Wash your shelves using the solution and clean storage containers in this solvent as well before rinsing them in hot water.
Leave the cleaned surface to dry to touch before restocking your pantry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-remove-and-clean-all-shelf-liners">3. Remove and Clean all Shelf liners</h3>
<p>Carefully, remove all shelf liners. Clean the liners with soap and hot water - to remove and kill moths eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can opt to vacuum underneath liners or dust appropriately.
For old shelf liners, its advisable to remove and replace them with new ones. In case you arent willing to remove your shelf liners, you can opt to wipe the surface with moist clothe soaked in a disinfectant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-dispose-of-non-airtight-storage-cans">4. Dispose of non-airtight Storage Cans</h3>
<p>Loose or non-tight storage containers should be disposed of accordingly - the gap left offers a pathway for pantry moth to access stored dry food.</p>
<ul>
<li>More so, internal threading and folds that come with loose storage cans provide a breeding ground for pantry moths - their eggs hatch and mature without disturbance in such areas.
Those storage containers that have pronounced gaps and holes should be disposed of first as you fix containers with tiny gaps (use seal) instead of disposing of them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-thoroughly-dry-pantry-plus-washed-storage-containers">5. Thoroughly Dry Pantry plus Washed Storage Containers</h3>
<p>Upon cleaning, your pantry should be dried perfectly - this act reduces the chances of re-infestation or further contamination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pantry Moth&rsquo;s eggs may cling on the surface upon cleaning thus hatching later and resulting in a new colony in the process.</li>
<li>Moreover, washed storage containers/plastic bags should be dried in sun or wiped sufficiently with a dry piece of cloth.
Moisture traces will not only attract pantry moths back but also initiate mold formation, which leads to food contamination.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-vacuum-pantry-area-thoroughly---wipe-with-vinegar-and-water">6. Vacuum Pantry Area Thoroughly - wipe with vinegar and water</h3>
<p>By
vacuuming your pantry
, you will not only eliminate adult moths, but youll also get rid of their eggs and larvae. Further, the vacuum cleaner also clears cocoons effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the vacuum cleaner to a power source and turn it on. Gently, vacuum pantry surface, cupboard, shelves, pinholes, cracks, joints, corners, and storage container.</li>
<li>Empty the waste and inspect the presence of pantry moths  this enables you to make the decision whether to discard stored dry food.
Avoid using the very powerful vacuum cleaner as it may destroy the storage containers or your pantry. Upon vacuuming, wipe the shelves and pantry using a piece of cloth soaked in a mixture of water and vinegar.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-change-the-current-storage-method">7. Change the Current Storage Method</h3>
<p>Perhaps your current storage method isn&rsquo;t secure enough and thus ends up allowing pantry moths infestation - alternative methods such as the use of new plastic bags and tightly sealed tins would shield dry food sufficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, you can opt to store nuts and dried grains in a refrigerator/freezer entirely rather than in a cupboard or pantry.</li>
<li>Food items such as groceries should be kept far away from the pantry - they are a key attractant to fruit flies and other insects as well.
Adversely, food bought from the market should be stored separately and monitored for a week to ensure that no traces of moths are present.
Storing dry food together with a tray of eggs is an amazing preventive method since eggs smell repel Pantry moths from the vicinity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-scrub-pantry-thoroughly-with-soap-and-hot-water">8. Scrub Pantry Thoroughly with Soap and Hot water</h3>
<p>Dip a sponge or a piece of cloth in hot water and apply soap. Scrub doors, floor, wall, and liners of your pantry gentry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that door hinges are thoroughly cleaned - try to clean every possible area where moths, larvae, and eggs may be found.</li>
<li>Hot water kills moth&rsquo;s eggsplus its larvae instantly upon contact. Adult moths are scared away from their hideouts by hot water.
NB: Be careful when handling hot water lest you burn yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-wash-storage-jars-or-containers-in-the-pantry-with-soapy-and-hot-water">9. Wash Storage Jars or Containers in the Pantry with soapy and Hot water</h3>
<p>If your store dries food in plastic containers or jars; then, you need to clean them thoroughly in soapy warm water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often, these storage containers may have come into contact with pantry moths. Chances of pantry moths laying eggs in storage containers are high - therefore, you need to presoak all storage items before actual cleaning is undertaken.
Then, scrub the jars/containers with soap and hot water and rinse with clean water before leaving them to dry to touch.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-avoid-re-stocking-your-pantry-immediately---wait">10. Avoid Re-stocking your Pantry Immediately - wait</h3>
<p>By not restocking your pantry immediately after cleaning, you will prevent cases of pantry moths re-infestation. Often, pantry moths eggs may remain in the storage containers, especially if thorough cleaning was not undertaken.</p>
<ul>
<li>If keen measures are not put into place, these eggs hatch and infest the entire storage containers.</li>
<li>By delaying restocking, you will be taking cautious attention towards diagnosing possible occurrences of pantry moths into your storage containers/jars.
Also, larvae may be left in the containers upon which they mature and become adults if not removed before restocking.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-get-rid-of-infested-or-contaminated-food-substances">11. Get Rid of Infested or Contaminated food Substances</h3>
<p>Any contaminated or moth-infested food should be discarded or thrown away. The food may include either recently opened dry food or moth-infested dry food. Its difficult to observe moths eggs with naked eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you need to get rid of the entire container as soon as you notice a single moth.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can opt to store the infested food in a freezer for 7 days.
Then, sieve the dry food before cooking  low temperature inactivates
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live/">the live moths</a>
and kills their egg/larvae. For easier identification, you will notice tiny holes on the packaging container/sack that you never saw previously.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-signs-of-pantry-moths-infestation-in-your-place">What are Signs of Pantry Moths Infestation in Your Place?</h2>
<p>Pantry moths may not be identified easily, especially if the infestation is big enough to form a swam. Therefore, it&rsquo;s always advisable to be keen in looking for other possible signs that are highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-presence-of-adult-moths-or-larvae">1. Presence of adult moths or larvae</h3>
<p>Search for larvae or adult pantry moths in your cupboard or pantry. To do this, you will need to look for gray-colored insects with either white or red strips/patches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly, adult pantry moth measures approximately 1/2 an inch long. Pantry moth larvae (which is about 1.25cm long) appear like a worm with 5 pairs of legs.</li>
<li>You will easily spot adult pantry month flying in your pantry at night often than in day time.
During the inspection, check dry food such as rice, grains, cereals, and even flour - turn the grains thoroughly since some of these pantry moths hide deep inside.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-presence-of-holes-in-dry-food-packaging">2. Presence of Holes in Dry food packaging</h3>
<p>While undertaking your routine inspection in your pantry, the presence of small holes on packaging bags/containers for dry food is a clear indicator of pantry moths infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though other insects such as termites may pierce and make holes on packaging containers, chances are low that they reached your pantry.</li>
<li>Observing two or three holes is too much to let go of before opening the entire containers to inspect if there is any sign of pantry moth contamination. Also, inspect plastic wrapping and boxes as well.
When purchasing sealed dry food, check if there are tiny holes on the surface - such food may be contaminated with pantry moths right from the source.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-visible-cocoon-webbing">3. Visible Cocoon webbing</h3>
<p>By observation, check the presence of cocoon webbing in your pantry or storage containers. For boxes and cupboards, take a keen look at corners and edges.</p>
<ul>
<li>The stringy and clumpy network is left by pantry moths as they crawl along. These insects also build cocoons in which they lay hundreds of eggs.
If you are keen, you will observe webbed cocoons beneath shelves, or at the folds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-brings-pantry-moths-in-your-house">What Brings Pantry Moths In Your House?</h2>
<p>Often, pantry moths come to your home through food substances bought from outside. This may be cereals, grains, or any other type of dry food, which these insects feed on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, infestation or pantry moths contamination occurs during the processing or packaging of dry food.</li>
<li>Eggs, larvae, or adult pantry moths could be packed together with dry food and ends up in your house once you purchase such food items.
Once these contaminated food are stored in your pantry, the adult pantry moths or larvae spreads and multiplies numerously causing serious food poisoning.</li>
<li>Normally, pantry moths exclusively feed/depend on dry food substances.
The presence of high temperatures favors their breeding. Therefore, it&rsquo;s advisable to store your dry food in a freezer or low-temperature zones in order to keep off pantry moths infestation or further breeding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-pantry-moths-from-infestation">How to prevent Pantry Moths from Infestation</h2>
<p>Due to the adverse effects of pantry moths towards stored dried food, its advisable to consider the following preventive measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The store recently purchased dry foods in airtight containers</li>
<li>Place bunches bay leaves in your pantry or shelves  they repel pantry moths</li>
<li>Freezing new dry goods or food for 7 days - prevents pantry moths re-infestation</li>
<li>Store dry goods in glass or plastic cans that are tightly sealed  air-free.</li>
<li>Inspecting your cabinets, shelves, and pantry often</li>
<li>Fumigating your House with pantry moth repellants</li>
<li>Using peppermint leaves, cider, or mint chips in your pantry - sachet</li>
<li>Switching off lights at night  light attracts pantry moths</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on how to get rid of pantry moths, you can start by removing/clearing everything from your pantry, then wipe the shelves with a mixture of warm water, vinegar &amp; peppermint oil, or opt to dispose of non-airtight storage cans appropriately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, you need to remove and clean shelf liners, thoroughly scrub the pantry with soap and hot water, precisely dry the pantry &amp; washed storage containers as well as vacuum your pantry sufficiently before disinfecting the surfaces with vinegar.</li>
<li>For the case of storage jars or containers, they should be washed with plenty of soap &amp; hot water (kills moth&rsquo;s eggs), while contaminated/infested food substances should be disposed of accordingly.
Alternatively, change the current storage method and avoid re-stocking your pantry immediately upon cleaning (this may lead to moth re-occurrence). Notably, take preventive measures highlighted in this article to eliminate cases of future re-infestation in your house.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pine bark beetles are tiny (rice-grain-sized) invasive bugs that&rsquo;ll get into the bark of your pine trees and eat it. Eating the inner bark blocks the passage of food and water - making the trees weaken and die off.
The bugs will target the weak pine trees from injury or stress.
For example, the mountain pine beetle, mainly found in North America, is black or reddish brown in color.
So in this article, I&rsquo;ll get into the details of how you can get <a href="/posts/get-rid-sweat-bees/">rid</a> of the pine bark beetles that have been killing your trees.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I would also recommend any arborist or homeowner get professional exterminators, if DIY pest control is not your thing - tryTerminix,Orkin, orArmored Pest Svc- they&rsquo;ll use specialized and more effective chemicals, baits, or chemicals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identifying-the-pine-bark-beetle"><strong>Identifying the Pine Bark Beetle�</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://ipm.ucanr.edu/legacy_assets/pdf/pestnotes/pnbarkbeetles.pdf">Pine bark beetles</a>
are relatively tiny insects that measure about 2.5 to 6 mm in body length. They have black or dark brown colors with some spines at their back.
I have listed some of the signs that you can check out to know if there is an infestation of the pine bark beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Drying branches:**As pine bark beetles feed on the tree&rsquo;s bark and deny the tree its nutrition, the branches will dry off or have needles.</li>
<li>**Boring Dust:**Signs of some<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r3/forest-grasslandhealth/insects-diseases/?cid=stelprdb5228465">sawdust-like and fine substance that is reddish or rusty-brown</a>near the tree&rsquo;s bark�of the tree will punish the presence of pine bark beetles.</li>
<li>**Pitch tubes: **pitch tubes or sap or resin are produced by the pine trees as they attempt to push the Beatles out.</li>
<li>**Discolored or strained bark: **a yellow or reddish brown pine tree bark may indicate are dying tree due to bugs.
It&rsquo;s crucial to note that June bugs and pine bark beetles may have similar sizes, shapes, and colors. However,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-identify-and-get-rid-of-june-bugs/">June bugs</a>
feed and live on shrubs and grass or lawns, and they don&rsquo;t bore into tree barks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-the-pine-bark-beetle">Details: How to Get Rid of the Pine Bark Beetle</h2>
<p>Weak and sick trees won&rsquo;t survive an attack caused by the pine bark beetles. The sick trees will produce some
<a href="https://henderson.ces.ncsu.edu/2020/05/pest-alert-pine-bark-beetles/">chemicals that attract the pine bark beetles</a>
. So, you must be quick in the treatment of the pine trees to allow them to survive.</p>
<h3 id="1-treatment-1-spraydominion-2l">1. Treatment 1: Spray<strong>Dominion 2L�</strong></h3>
<p>As noted earlier, pine bark beetles will bore holes in the leaves, branches, and trunk of pine trees - especially the weak and sickly ones. With the use of Dominion 2L, any landscaper, arborist, or homeowner can remove these bugs and save the pine tree under attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dominion 2L contains imidacloprid as its active ingredient. Imidacloprid (a systemic insecticide) gets into pine trees through the roots (sapwood) and moves to the trees&rsquo; bark, trunk, and branches through the plant&rsquo;s vascular system.
Once ingested by the bugs, Imidacloprid will paralyze its nervous system causing death or paralysis. This is how Dominion 2L is able to protect the pine trees from bugs such as scale insects, aphids, and pine bark beetles.</li>
<li>Being a systemic insecticide, Dominion 2L is better compared to other insecticides since it&rsquo;ll only require you to apply it around the roots but it&rsquo;ll be absorbed into the whole tree - thus protecting the whole tree.</li>
<li>Second, Dominion 2L offers longer (1 year) protection against bugs like pine bark beetles. And finally, the insecticide is simple to use for either exterminators or DIY homeowners.
However, Dominion 2L may harm non-target insects such as butterflies and bees which are considered beneficial.
To apply this Dominion 2L, just sprinkle the product around the base of the pine tree - don&rsquo;t forget to wear your eye protection and gloves.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-treatment-2-usesylo-insecticide">2. Treatment 2: Use<strong>Sylo Insecticide�</strong></h3>
<p>The Sylo Insecticide on the other hand is applied to the pine tree - you may apply it using a suitable sprayer. The active ingredient, cypermethrin, will kill pine bark beetles fast - just apply this product to the trees&rsquo; bark.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, the insecticide will effectively contact those bugs and also exterminate them. Luckily, this insecticide will also exterminate the pine bark beetles that are lurking just on the tree but have not bored into its bark.</li>
<li>The early prevention measure using this �Sylo Insecticide will ensure that the pine bark beetles won&rsquo;t spread to other trees - giving time for the weak or sick trees to recover while the healthy ones continue thriving without pests.
Further, you&rsquo;ll find Sylo insecticide readily in your local stores or hardware as so you won&rsquo;t have to struggle to get it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3prune-the-infested-trees">3.<strong>Prune the infested Trees�</strong></h3>
<p>Next, I recommend that you prune those trees infested by pine bark beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>But ensure to fully remove the limbs and branches that are infected. This will prevent the number of these bugs that&rsquo;ll transfer to other trees in the neighborhood.
I recommend that you prune the trees during winter or late fall as during this time you won&rsquo;t cause much damage to the trees and the bugs are relatively dormant and so they won&rsquo;t spread much once disturbed.
Further, after pruning, you&rsquo;ll need to dispose of all the limbs and branches in various ways including burning or burying them inside some landfill.</li>
<li>Pruning will also help remove the various life stages of the pine bark beetles including their eggs.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-gnats/">How to Get Rid of Gnats</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4dispose-of-the-dead-pine-trees">4.<strong>Dispose of the Dead Pine Trees�</strong></h3>
<p>Besides pruning, the pine trees, you&rsquo;ll also require to remove all the dead trees that are in the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because the dead pines may act as hosts to other pine bark beetles - promoting their growth and fast reproduction.
The dries pine trees will be easier for the beetles to bore into their bark, feed, and lay eggs. Also, the beetle larvae will develop easily in the tree tunnels created by the bugs.
Ensure an efficient and safe removal of the dried pine trees that are dead. You may need to hire some exterminators for the removal of the dead pine trees.</li>
<li>However as noted earlier, burning the dead pine trees may be an effective technique to control the bugs. But you can also bury the pine bark trees inside some landfill.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-plant-resistant-pine-trees">4. Plant Resistant Pine Trees</h3>
<p>Professionals note that planting pine tree species that are resistant to the pine bark beetles will significantly help control such bugs.
Some of these resistant pine tree species include the ponderosa pine, red pine, and white pine - all these will resist the pine bark beetles naturally.
Besides, to get healthy pines that won&rsquo;t be easy prey for the beetles, ensure you plant a species that is suitable for your land condition and area climate.
So, before you plant any pine trees, talk to experts in a nursery or an arborist.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to grow resilient and healthy pines by giving them adequate sunlight, nutrients, and water. Also, plant the pines with enough spacing to avoid overcrowding.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raccoons are clever, resourceful animals that can be a real nuisance when they invade your home or property. Known for their masked appearance and dexterous hands, raccoons often find ways to enter attics, basements, garages, and even inside walls, leading to damage and health concerns.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with a raccoon infestation, this guide will provide you with effective strategies to safely and humanely remove these pesky animals.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-raccoons-invade-homes">Why Do Raccoons Invade Homes?</h2>
<p>Raccoons are opportunistic feeders and are attracted to areas where food, water, and shelter are readily available. Urban and suburban areas provide them with plenty of opportunities to scavenge, especially when garbage cans, pet food, or compost bins are easily accessible. Raccoons are also known to seek refuge in attics or chimneys, as these spaces provide them with a warm, secure environment for nesting, especially in the colder months.</p>
<p>Common signs of a raccoon problem include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noises in the attic or walls, especially at night when raccoons are most active</li>
<li>Droppings or urine stains around entry points</li>
<li>Damaged or torn vents, shingles, or roofs from attempts to enter your home</li>
<li>Tracks or footprints around your property, especially near trash bins or entry points</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-by-step-guide-to-get-rid-of-raccoons">Step-by-Step Guide to Get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">Rid</a> of Raccoons</h2>
<h3 id="1-identify-the-problem">1. Identify the Problem</h3>
<p>The first step in addressing a <a href="/posts/how-to-repel-raccoons/">raccoon</a> infestation is identifying where they are entering your home. Look for gaps around windows, doors, chimneys, vents, or the roof. Raccoons are known to squeeze through very small spaces, so you may need to inspect these areas thoroughly.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve located the entry points, it&rsquo;s important to check if there are any raccoon nests or young inside. If there are babies, its best to wait until they are old enough to leave before closing the entry points. Raccoons are protective of their young, and removing babies prematurely can lead to dangerous situations.</p>
<h3 id="2-seal-entry-points">2. Seal Entry Points</h3>
<p>After identifying the entry points, the next step is to seal them securely. This will prevent further access to your home. Use sturdy materials like steel mesh, hardware cloth, or metal flashing to cover gaps or holes. Avoid using materials like wood or plastic, as raccoons can easily tear through them.</p>
<p>Be sure to check around your roofline, vents, and chimneys, as raccoons often make their way into these spaces. Also, check if there are trees near the house that raccoons can climb to gain access to upper levels.</p>
<h3 id="3-set-traps">3. Set Traps</h3>
<p>Live traps are one of the most humane ways to remove raccoons from your property. Set up the traps near the entry points or where you&rsquo;ve seen signs of raccoons. Bait the trap with food like cat food, marshmallows, or canned tuna, which raccoons find irresistible.</p>
<p>Check the traps regularly to ensure that any captured animals are not left in them for too long. Once a raccoon is trapped, contact a wildlife control expert or local animal services for advice on how to handle the animal. In many areas, it is illegal to relocate raccoons, as they are considered a nuisance species and may carry diseases.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-repellents">4. Use Repellents</h3>
<p>While repellents can be effective as a deterrent, they should be used in combination with other methods. There are several types of raccoon repellents available:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Chemical repellents:**These are often made from natural ingredients like predator urine or capsaicin (the compound that makes peppers hot), which raccoons find unpleasant.</li>
<li>**Ultrasonic devices:**These emit high-pitched sounds that are irritating to raccoons but are inaudible to humans.</li>
<li>**Homemade repellents:**A mixture of ammonia, vinegar, or garlic can be sprayed around areas where raccoons have been active to repel them.
While repellents can provide temporary relief, they are not a long-term solution and should be used alongside other control methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-remove-attractants">5. Remove Attractants</h3>
<p>Raccoons are primarily attracted to food sources, so its crucial to eliminate any potential attractants around your property. Secure trash cans by using raccoon-proof lids, and never leave pet food outside overnight. If you have fruit trees, pick any fallen fruit promptly.</p>
<p>If you have a compost bin, make sure its properly covered to prevent raccoons from digging through it. Additionally, keep bird feeders out of reach of raccoons, as they will take advantage of the seeds.</p>
<h3 id="6-clean-up-droppings-and-nesting-areas">6. Clean Up Droppings and Nesting Areas</h3>
<p>If raccoons have been living in your attic or basement, they may have left behind droppings, urine, and nesting materials. It&rsquo;s important to clean these areas thoroughly to prevent the spread of disease and to discourage future visits.</p>
<p>Wear gloves, a mask, and protective clothing when handling any raccoon waste, as it can carry diseases like leptospirosis, rabies, and parasites such as roundworms. Disinfect the affected areas with a solution of bleach and water to kill any harmful pathogens.</p>
<h3 id="7-consider-professional-help">7. Consider Professional Help</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unable to get rid of the raccoons on your own or if the infestation is severe, it may be time to call in a professional wildlife control service. These experts have the knowledge, experience, and tools necessary to deal with raccoon problems safely and effectively.</p>
<p>A wildlife control professional can assess the situation, identify all entry points, and implement a comprehensive removal plan that includes trapping, exclusion, and deterrents.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-future-raccoon-infestations">Preventing Future Raccoon Infestations</h2>
<p>Once youve successfully removed raccoons from your property, its important to take steps to prevent future infestations. Here are some preventative measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly inspect your home for new entry points and seal any gaps or holes.</li>
<li>Trim tree branches that overhang your roof to prevent raccoons from climbing onto your house.</li>
<li>Maintain your yard and remove debris where raccoons might find shelter.</li>
<li>Store food securely and dispose of garbage promptly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dealing with a raccoon infestation can be challenging, but with the right approach, its possible to safely and effectively remove these animals from your home. By identifying the source of the problem, sealing entry points, and using traps and repellents, you can keep raccoons out of your home. Remember to always consider humane methods, and dont hesitate to reach out to professionals if the situation becomes overwhelming.</p>

<h3 id="3-non-toxic-trapping">3. Non-Toxic Trapping</h3>
<p>Setting the right bait doesnt guarantee that youll get rid of roof rats in the attic</p>
<ul>
<li>unless you use the right kind of trap. *
*You can find various types and sizes of traps in the market that dont require you to poison the *
roof rats in your attic. Based on the kind of trap you opt for, the rat can be caught without even being harmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more common traps are:</p>
<h4 id="--snap-traps">*- *<em>Snap Traps</em></h4>
<p>These conventional traps have a metal bar that snaps down when it catches a rat. They are extremely effective in getting rid of roof rats in the attic, but it is difficult to set them up and each trap only tends to kill one.</p>

<h3 id="4-block-the-entry-points">4. Block the Entry Points</h3>
<p>While you make efforts to get rid of roof rats in the attic, dont forget to block all the entry passages to discourage the roof rats from entering the attic.</p>
<p>This will not only help you catch the ones inside the attic but also prevent other rats from entering. You may block the passages by spraying or keeping repellant agents near the entry points or covering holes with material that cant be chewed such as steel wool.� Some of the more likely entry passages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaps in shingles</li>
<li>Vent covers that are damaged</li>
<li>Cracks</li>
<li>Holes in the walls or ceilings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-use-natural-predators">5. Use Natural Predators</h3>

<ul>
<li>These tiny parasitic bugs inhabit humid beaches or coastal climates and they&rsquo;re known for their bite, itchiness, and difficulty to get rid of.</li>
<li>Sand fleas can bite both dogs and cats, as well as birds and humans. These itch-inducing bites can cause fatal infections or recurring skin conditions.
So, inspect your pets, luggage, and home for sand fleas and undertake appropriate steps to prevent re-infestation.�Related:

<h3 id="step-1-how-do-you-identify-the-sand-fleas">Step 1: How do you identify the sand fleas?</h3>
<p>A sand flea looks like a sand particle and is the size of a grain of rice or a speck of salt. - you&rsquo;ll find it near the sand-water interface or in moist areas.
While sand fleas are tiny insects that you may not be able to spot with your naked eye, it is still possible to see with a closer look.
When you&rsquo;re walking on sand, sand fleas are most likely to climb onto your legs and feet. If you&rsquo;re wearing shoes, they&rsquo;ll crawl up to your ankles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sand fleas are also known as &ldquo;no-see-ums,&rdquo; because their bites can be difficult to notice when they come in groups and the saliva from the bite is injected deeply into your skin.</li>
<li>This makes it easier for them to feed on blood without being detected.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velEs7LWJHU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velEs7LWJHU</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-do-you-have-sand-fleas-bites">Step 2: Do you have sand fleas bites?</h3>
<p>Sand fleas bite humans and pets to suck blood and embed their eggs. The sand flea bites are often red, round, itchy bumps that look like mosquito bites; see a
comparison on mosquito bites vs spider bites
.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bite of a sand flea can be very painful and always causes some skin irritation if scratched and rubbed.
The bite has a tiny blackhead-like bump in the center or there&rsquo;s a white pustule, around which there is a red spot - this shows that the sand fleas bit the area and deposited its eggs.
Don&rsquo;t scratch the area with the sand flea bite because it will only worsen the itch while also distributing the egg and infected saliva through broken blisters and open wounds.</li>
<li>Wash your hands before touching the area, and then apply a cold compress or ice to relieve some of the itching sensations.
<em>How do sand fleas make me feel?</em>
Sand flea bites cause an intense itching sensation that lasts about 30 minutes after a person has been bitten by one of these tiny insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-rub-some-antihistamine">Step 3: Rub some Antihistamine</h3>
<p>Apply a topical over-the-counter antihistamine such as Neosporin and Benadryl to soothe pain and itching from the sand flea bites.
Rubbing cream or ointment such as calamine lotion, cortisone cream (e.g., hydrocortisone), bisabolol, or aloe vera gel onto the affected area can help reduce itching and inflammation of the rash.
Also, rubbing alcohol will help dry the wound, and the alcohol will kill any bacteria on the skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t scratch itchy skin! This will only cause more irritation to your already sensitive skin and may make you bleed because scratching damages normal skin tissue.</li>
<li>Scratching also could leave open sores which might be infected by bacteria lurking in fingernails or household dirt that has been left behind after scratching so please dont do this! You should try not to touch any part of your body
Sand flea bites, while not serious, can be discomforting to your skin as they&rsquo;ll last for a few weeks.
The bites are itchy and may lead to infections if left untreated. They&rsquo;re also very painful, depending on the bug&rsquo;s bite-size.
Apply essential oils such as tea tree, eucalyptus, cajeput (cassia), clove, and lavender, or thyme, peppermint, and lavender; these have anti-inflammatory properties which can help reduce pain.</li>
<li>Rub a tablespoon of oil into each bite until it is fully absorbed by your skin. This will also kill any larvae that could lead to an infection on your wound.
Get an ice pack and apply it to the bite for 20 minutes at a time, four times per day. You can also use crushed ice wrapped in a clean cloth if you don&rsquo;t have access to an ice pack or freezer gel packs.</li>
<li>Contact your doctor if the sand flea bite becomes very painful or its swelling does not go down in a day or two.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approach-2-get-rid-of-the-sand-fleas">Approach 2: Get rid of the Sand Fleas</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-spray-suitable-sand-flea-pesticides">Step 1: Spray Suitable Sand Flea Pesticides</h3>
<p>Spray pesticides for the sand fleas in different areas of your home such as on furniture, carpets, and floors.
The insecticide will kill the bugs by damaging the nervous systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you buy a pesticide product, it is important that you make an informed decision.</li>
<li>Consider the active ingredient and the strength before purchase - so get an organic pesticide to reduce chemical exposure.
Therefore, I recommend using natural compounds such as salt and
diatomaceous earth to kill fleas
and spiders.</li>
<li>Sprinkle that material onto the various surfaces and areas - but allow it to work for about 24 hours beforevacuuming the surfaces well.
But also avoid toxic pesticides that may harm your pets, kids, or family members.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approach-3-remove-the-sand-fleas-from-home">Approach 3: Remove the Sand Fleas from Home</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-spray-sand-fleas-pesticides">Step 1: Spray Sand Fleas Pesticides</h3>
<p>Steps to prevent sand flea bites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spray your house with pesticides to remove sand fleas.</li>
<li>Make sure you spray the areas where people spend a lot of time like furniture, carpets, and floors.</li>
<li>You can also use organic pesticides that are safe for humans and pets. These will help clear any infestation in just a few hours by damaging the nervous system of these pests.
Spray sand fleas pesticides are not a good idea because they can be harmful to the environment and pets.
Other ways to get rid of sand fleas include diatomaceous earth (DE) powder, salt sprinkled around the house, and boric acid.</li>
<li>Diatomaceous earth is an organic substance that kills bugs by scratching off their outer layer of exoskeleton (a protective coating) as its ingested or touched by them.</li>
<li>This dust-like powder has microscopic jagged edges that damage the insects insides when it gets into its body; this causes death in two ways: dehydration from lack of water, or through poisoning with accumulated heavy metals and other toxins worn away from inside the bug&rsquo;s own body.</li>
<li>DE is harmless to people, plants, birds, fish, and other animals but will kill most insects on contact including ants
Gardens and homes are regularly treated with insecticides and fungicides that can be harmful to pet birds.
To avoid this, use natural products such as
diatomaceous earth (DE)
, salt, or
boric acid
.</li>
<li>Spraying DE around doors and windows, or into cracks in floors where pets sleep can keep sand flea populations down - allow it 24 hours before vacuuming.</li>
<li>Fleas only want to live as close to their host&rsquo;s skin as possible; therefore, a good way of keeping them off humans is by vacuuming regularly (especially rugs) and washing clothes at high temperatures.</li>
<li>Spray Sand Fleas Pesticides may also be sprayed onto pet bedding after it has been vacuumed up. This traps any remaining sand flea eggs that might have escaped when you removed or killed the adult fleas from your home before they hatch again.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-vacuum-upholstery-and-carpets-thoroughly">Step 2: Vacuum upholstery and carpets Thoroughly</h3>
<p>Hire a professional or DIY to vacuum your carpets and upholstery.
Vacuum for at least an hour in all areas that are not upholstered by using length settings on the hose so you can get under any furniture (including corners, stairs, and ceilings).
The professional will also be able to use attachments such as brushes or crevices to pull out fleas that may live in those more difficult places like carpet fibers.
Vacuum thoroughly on a regular basis - especially in commonly used rooms to prevent any further sand fleas infestations.
The vacuum bags should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag, not left sitting on the floor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since sand flea larvae are typically found near ground level or beneath heavy furniture like sofas, it is important that vacuum bags are tightly closed when they&rsquo;re discarded, because this will help prevent them from escaping back into your home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-launder-bedding-and-clothes">Step 3: Launder Bedding and Clothes</h3>
<p>Sand flea eggs that are deposited on clothes or bedding can be removed by laundering these items in hot water. They&rsquo;ll be hiding in folds of bedding and clothes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launder or wash your towels, bedding, and clothes when you get home from the beach to remove sand fleas - and don&rsquo;t reuse the items before washing.
It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that washing those clothing items in cold water may not effectively kill all of the larvae because sand flea eggs have an outer shell that resists heat.
If you share a room, check all of the bedding items and clothing for sand fleas.
Inspect and clean dirty shoes to make sure sand fleas are not being transported back to your home.</li>
<li>Inspect your feet and footwear when getting back home.�Look at the seams, fabric lining, and in-sole of shoes before you enter your house.
If you don&rsquo;t plan to clean the shoes right away, spray them with an insecticide containing permethrin or leave them outdoors; otherwise bag those up as well.</li>

<h3 id="step-1-inspect-cats--dogs-for-signs-of-sand-fleas">Step 1: Inspect cats &amp; Dogs for Signs of Sand fleas</h3>
<p>If cats &amp; dogs spend any time outside, they may bring in sand fleas on their fur. The following are some easy ways to find and remove fleas from your pet before bringing them inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s skin for red, swollen bites as this can indicate a sand flea infestation.</li>
<li>Look at your dog or cat&rsquo;s paws, thick fur, as well to see if they have burrows from sand fleas that can be easily seen in their paw pads.</li>
<li>Also, look under their armpits because this is a popular place for dogs to get bitten by sand fleas while scratching themselves with their hind legs - even when treated!</li>
<li>Check if your pet shows excessive licking, scratching, or chewing behaviors in addition to heavy shedding.
If you find any of these signs, take steps one through three again until you either eliminate them or decide not to do anything more about it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-effectively-wash-the-pets">Step 2: Effectively Wash the Pets</h3>
<p>To control the sand fleas, make sure to groom them thoroughly and give them a bath.
Groom the fur away from their skin before giving them a thorough scrub with shampoo.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blow- or towel-dry the pet until they are completely dry, then comb through any mats in the fur before letting it continue to air-dry indoors for 48 hours as this is the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flea-life-cycle/">fleas&rsquo; lifecycle</a>.
Use an antihistamine on the pet to ease the redness and itching on the sand flea bites.</li>
<li>Contact your vet if you notice the pet has sand flea eggs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-steam-or-vacuum-pet-toys-and-bedding">Step 3: Steam or Vacuum Pet toys and bedding</h3>
<p>To make sure that your house is not filled with sand fleas, you need to scrub clean the pet toys, bedding, and clothes.
You also need to steam clean and vacuum all the soft things like soft-fabric toys, pillows, blankets, and dog beds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuuming will help remove the fleas and eggs; a good steam cleaner will kill more than half of them in just one cleaning session.
If you are not sure about how to use a steamer, take your pet toy or bedding with you when purchasing it from the store so that they can show you how to best clean it at home.
You can also treat the pets using diatomaceous earth or organic pesticides.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Silverfish are small, wingless insects known for their silvery-grey appearance and fish-like movements. Though generally harmless, these pests can become a nuisance due to their tendency to damage books, wallpaper, and clothing, while feeding on starches and sugars.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve noticed silverfish lurking in your home, it&rsquo;s essential to address the issue promptly. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll explore how to identify silverfish, what attracts them, and effective methods to
eliminate them
.</p>
<h3 id="1-why-are-silverfish-attracted-to-your-home">1. Why Are Silverfish Attracted to Your Home?</h3>
<p>To effectively get <a href="/posts/getting-rid-of-fleas-in-the-carpet/">rid</a> of silverfish, it&rsquo;s essential to understand why they invade homes in the first place. These insects thrive in environments where they have easy access to food, moisture, and shelter.</p>
<p>Heres what typically attracts silverfish:</p>
<ul>
<li>**High Humidity:**Silverfish thrive in areas where humidity levels are above 75%. Bathrooms, kitchens, and basements are perfect habitats due to the moisture in these areas.</li>
<li>**Dark Spaces:**Silverfish are nocturnal, preferring dark and damp spaces to hide during the day.</li>
<li>**Starchy Materials:**Silverfish feed on starchy substances such as paper, glue, fabric, and even dead skin cells. Common items they chew on include books, wallpaper, cardboard, and even old photographs.
The best way to prevent silverfish infestations is by making your home less hospitable to them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-preventative-measures">2. Preventative Measures</h3>
<p>Silverfish infestations can be frustrating, but taking steps to make your home less appealing to them will help reduce their presence. Here are some simple measures to prevent an infestation:</p>
<h4 id="acontrol-humidity-levels">a.<strong>Control Humidity Levels</strong></h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, silverfish thrive in humid environments. You can lower your homes humidity by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a<strong>dehumidifier</strong>in damp areas such as basements and bathrooms.</li>
<li>Ensuring proper ventilation in rooms prone to moisture build-up, like kitchens and bathrooms.</li>
<li>Fixing<strong>leaky pipes</strong>or faucets to prevent excess moisture accumulation.</li>
<li>Installing<strong>exhaust fans</strong>in the bathroom or kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bseal-cracks-and-crevices">b.<strong>Seal Cracks and Crevices</strong></h4>
<p>Silverfish can easily enter your home through tiny cracks and crevices. Inspect the exterior of your house for any gaps around doors, windows, or vents and seal them using caulk or weather stripping.</p>
<h4 id="cdeclutter-and-organize">c.<strong>Declutter and Organize</strong></h4>
<p>Silverfish often nest in cluttered, dark areas. By reducing clutter and organizing your home, especially in basements and attics, youll minimize their hiding spots. Store important items like books and clothing in airtight containers to prevent damage.</p>
<h4 id="dregular-cleaning">d.<strong>Regular Cleaning</strong></h4>
<p>Frequent vacuuming and dusting can help remove silverfish food sources like dead skin cells, hair, and starchy materials. Dont forget to clean under furniture, in closets, and other hard-to-reach places where silverfish may hide.</p>
<h3 id="3-natural-remedies">3. Natural Remedies</h3>
<p>For those who prefer non-chemical solutions, several natural remedies can help eliminate silverfish. These methods are eco-friendly, safe for pets and children, and effective when used consistently.</p>
<h4 id="adiatomaceous-earth">a.<strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong></h4>
<p>Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural powder made from fossilized remains of tiny aquatic organisms. The fine particles in DE are sharp enough to cut through the exoskeleton of silverfish, leading to dehydration and death. Sprinkle food-grade DE around areas where youve seen silverfish, such as baseboards, cupboards, and under sinks.</p>
<h4 id="bessential-oils">b.<strong>Essential Oils</strong></h4>
<p>Certain essential oils, like lavender, cinnamon, and clove oil, can help repel silverfish due to their strong scent. Mix a few drops of these oils with water and spray the solution around the house, particularly in areas where silverfish have been spotted.</p>
<h4 id="ccedar-shavings">c.<strong>Cedar Shavings</strong></h4>
<p>Silverfish dislike the scent of cedar. You can place cedar shavings in closets, bookshelves, and other storage areas to deter them. Replace the shavings every few months to maintain their effectiveness.</p>
<h4 id="dhomemade-silverfish-traps">d.<strong>Homemade Silverfish Traps</strong></h4>
<p>You can create
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-silverfish-traps/">simple traps</a>
using materials you likely already have. Roll up a damp newspaper and leave it overnight where silverfish are active. By morning, the insects will have crawled inside seeking moisture. Dispose of the newspaper (and the silverfish) outside or in the trash.</p>
<h3 id="4-chemical-solutions">4. Chemical Solutions</h3>
<p>If natural remedies dont yield the desired results, you may need to use chemical treatments to eliminate silverfish. Be cautious when using chemicals, especially if you have pets or children at home.</p>
<h4 id="ainsecticidal-sprays">a.<strong>Insecticidal Sprays</strong></h4>
<p>There are various insecticidal sprays on the market designed specifically to kill silverfish. Look for products containing pyrethrin or permethrin, and apply them to the baseboards, around windows, and in other places where silverfish are likely to hide.</p>
<h4 id="bboric-acid">b.<strong>Boric Acid</strong></h4>
<p>Boric acid is a popular choice for eliminating pests, including silverfish. It works by poisoning the insect when they ingest it. Sprinkle boric acid powder in areas where silverfish are active, but be cautious as it can be toxic to pets if ingested.</p>
<h4 id="csilverfish-bait">c.<strong>Silverfish Bait</strong></h4>
<p>Similar to cockroach bait, silverfish bait contains a slow-acting poison that attracts the pests. Once consumed, the silverfish will return to their nest and spread the poison to other members of the colony.</p>
<h3 id="5-when-to-call-a-professional">5. When to Call a Professional</h3>
<p>In most cases, silverfish infestations can be managed with the above methods. However, if the infestation is severe, widespread, or recurring, it might be time to consult a pest control professional. A professional exterminator can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the severity of the infestation</li>
<li>Pinpoint exact hiding spots</li>
<li>Use stronger treatments not available to the public</li>
<li>Offer long-term prevention advice
Hiring a professional ensures that the problem is fully eradicated and reduces the likelihood of future infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Silverfish are persistent pests, but with a combination of natural remedies, chemical treatments, and preventative measures, you can effectively get rid of them.</p>
<p>Start by reducing the moisture in your home, decluttering spaces where they hide, and sealing any potential entry points. If silverfish persist, try a combination of traps,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-silverfish-repellent/">repellents</a>
, or even professional help.</p>
<p>By taking these steps, youll safeguard your home from silverfish and prevent the damage they can cause to your belongings.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders will have many benefits, as a homeowner, in your garden including preying on other dangerous insects. But why are spiders among the most loathed pests in the world?
Some spiders can be dangerous, a nuisance, and outright freaky especially black widows and the brown recluse.
Thus, it&rsquo;s terrifying that you may be sleeping under the same roof with these
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/6/%5Bspider%5D(/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/)-sense-fast-facts-on-extreme-arachnids/">arachnids</a>
.
In this article, I&rsquo;m going to show you how to get rid of spiders using a simple Four-Step process. The methods will range from chemical-laden and all-natural techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>As the local temperatures increase, so do the bugs come out in numbers. Hence, you&rsquo;ll require to think seriously consider pest control including getting rid of spiders.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spider Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-spiders-7-effective-tips">How to Get Rid of Spiders (7 Effective Tips)</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-spider-identification">Step 1: Spider Identification</h3>
<p>On
<a href="https://owlcation.com/stem/spider-identification">spider identification</a>
, the 8-legged arachnids (with fangs (chelicerae) and 2 body parts ) belong to the same group as mites, ticks, and scorpions.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-antennae/">Spiders have no antennae</a>
or wing.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are over 35,000 species of spiders worldwide but just a fraction of them will be in your yard or home.</li>
<li>The most common species will be black widows, brown recluses, jumping spiders, orb-weaver, and wolf spiders.</li>
<li>Only black widow and brown recluse have life-threatening venom but other spiders may also leave a nasty and irritating bite.
During the identification process, check the spider&rsquo;s behavioral patterns, color, size, number, and the set pattern of their eyes - but note that spiders will mainly be in some hidden areas.
*Are spiders dangerous? *</li>
<li>Well, most spider species (such as wolf spiders, hobo spiders, orb-weaver spiders, and garden spiders) are harmless.</li>
<li>But, some spiders (including brown recluse and black widow spiders) are dangerous with their venom causing hazardous health issues to humans.
<em>Why do I have a spider problem?�</em></li>
<li>The insects in your home, properties, or yard will attract spiders. They&rsquo;ll move inside during winter and late fall as they prey on insects.
<em>Where will I find spiders?�</em></li>
<li>As reclusive and shy creatures, spiders will live (either outside or inside) in the secluded, quiet, and dark places where they build webs or burrow.
<strong>NB:�</strong></li>
<li>Spiders that build webs such as orb-weaver, garden spiders, or black widows will create such webs in doorways, roof eaves, high trees, shrubs, and decks.</li>
<li>But, the burrowing spiders such as wolf spiders will nest on rockpiles, fallen trees, woodpiles, shrubs, and under bushes.
For the indoor spaces, the spiders will hide in the less-frequented areas such as under furniture and sinks, attics, garage, around windows and ceilings fixtures, closets, and basements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-declutter-and-vacuum">Step 2: Declutter and Vacuum</h3>
<p>Some spider species love dark and damp corners such as rarely-used closets and basements while others will hide in dry plus warm areas like attics.
<em>Declutter�</em>
First, declutter your house - most times spiders will be found in cluttered places such as basements, attics, and garages.
So, reorganize and throw out as many objects as possible - leaving spiders in the open and hence there will be no harborage areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic cleaning and maintenance n your house and spaces will be very important to get rid of spiders. Besides, vacuuming, you must declutter the spaces too.</li>
<li>Decluttering the spaces will remove those hiding places that are in your garage or home. Keenly dust and clean the clutter to reduce the spider-hiding areas.
<em>Vacuum�</em></li>
<li>Since you&rsquo;ve spotted the spiders around your home or yard, there must be some egg sacs lurking around the dark spaces such as crevices and cracks.</li>
<li>So, vacuum the whole house from closet corners and also under the furniture. Further, as you vacuum remember to remove all the spiders and spider webs - and finally dispose of that vacuum bag.
<em>Regular Cleaning:�</em></li>
<li>Regularly clean your spaces, garage, and home regularly to hinder new spider infestations - also dust the tabletops and open spaces to remove cobwebs.</li>
<li>Remove all clutter from the floors, conduct wall-to-wall vacuuming and move objects on countertops, and clean thoroughly</li>
<li>Once monthly, move the small furniture, light fixtures, and dust the ceilings - dusting and vacuuming effectively behind these fixtures.</li>
<li>Also, once monthly, clean under the bed and don&rsquo;t forget any item store beneath there, and for the floor, registers get the vent covers off to dust easily.
<em>Seasonal cleaning:�</em></li>
<li>Clean fire accessories and the fireplace by opening the chimneys flue to remove all cobwebs. Keenly clean and vacuum all items including the screens and fireplace logs.</li>
<li>Check and clean the attic for any cobwebs and leaks. Clean the storage boxes plus your attic floor - and remember to seal all the containers and boxes stored in the attic.</li>
<li>Inspect walls and basement for crack and leaks - fixing all of them while also dusting all the storage boxes and sweeping the surfaces and floors. Clean around the furnace and water heater.</li>
<li>Clean the garage, after getting the car outside to clean it thoroughly and sweep the walls and ceilings plus the exterior door.

<h3 id="step-3-use-terro-t2302-to-kill-any-spiders">Step 3: Use TERRO-T2302 to Kill any Spiders</h3>
<p>TERRO-T2302 gives install-killing results on spiders - quick and easy. Just spray around the holes, garden, crevices, and house or directly on that spider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spider killer will prevent spider re-occurrence for about 6 weeks. It&rsquo;ll kill pests and spiders like black widows and the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">brown recluse</a>, bed bugs, cockroaches, ants, and scorpions.
Spray this TERRO-T2302 on or around the spider&rsquo;s or ant&rsquo;s nest. You can spray it both outdoors and indoors while also controlling cockroaches and Asian-lady beetles.
But is Terro Spider really a spider-killer safe? Well, don&rsquo;t let
pets, kids, and even adults into the sprayed areas before the chemical is dried - avoid direct contact.</li>
<li>With 0.02 % Deltamethrin and 0.05% Pyrethrins as the active ingredients, TERRO-T2302 offers dual function - it&rsquo;ll know down the spiders and also offer 12 weeks bug control.</li>
<li><a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf">Pyrethrins</a>are extracted from chrysanthemum will trigger paralysis and eventual death as it excites the spider&rsquo;s nervous system.</li>
<li>Further,<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/DeltaGen.html">Deltamethrin</a>will disrupt the spider&rsquo;s nervous system killing the insects on contact. But TERRO-T2302 is not waterproof and thus don&rsquo;t use it during the rainy reason.
<em>To use TERRO-T2302 fo spiders�</em></li>
<li>For indoor spraying, use TERRO-T2302 on the non-food locations that pests will hide and pests - remember the spaces behind appliances or shelves and around windows and doors.</li>
<li>But for outdoor spraying, ensure to pint your spray nozzle at a downward angle but away from your body and face - but don&rsquo;t spray in a windy environment.</li>
<li>TERRO-T2302 will kill spiders and other insects on picnic areas and patios surface. The product willkill fleas, silverfish, crickets, ants, and cockroaches.
Ensure that the TERRO-T2302 must come into direct contact with the spider - so spray the outside and inside including the window and door frames.
Remember to spray TERRO-T2302 to get to those difficult spider webs. Also, don&rsquo;t remove the egg sacs and spider webs from those spaces until the spray is fully dried.
Spray the outdoor spaces including on non-crop or bushy areas, and the spider-infested weeds - including on lumber and firewood. Wash the clothes and skin using water plus soap.
Avoid using this spider spray around aquatic animals as it&rsquo;ll be toxic to them including to fish.

<h3 id="step-4-usecatchmaster-72mb-spider-catching-glue-boards">Step 4: Use<strong>Catchmaster 72MB Spider-Catching Glue Boards�</strong></h3>
<p>After monitoring the spider activity, you can use the Catchmaster 72MB as a glue trap to catch multiple insects that&rsquo;ll also capture spiders straying around the room.
Set up these traps around areas that you&rsquo;ve noticed some spider activity - this may include around the closet storage spaces and garage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insects including spider will wall on the glue board and they&rsquo;ll get stuck - ready for disposal. You can also remove the spider webs using the web out spray.</li>
<li>Spray the product under or inside your patio coverings - and this will help break down the spider web and then clean them up using a broom.</li>
<li>Sticky traps are mainly used forcockroachesandrodentsbut will also work against spiders - simply place the traps on hidden spaces such as the attic, basement, closet corners.
Catchmaster 72MB will capture the insects in a non-toxic way (no rodenticides or insecticides ) to get rid of roaches, ants, and mice - but the bugs will be attracted by the scent of the peanut butter.
Ensure to keep the spider traps in some moderate temperatures, avoid freezing or overly hot temperatures. You may also fold the trap to form some tunnel shape - and hence avoids dust.</li>
<li>For indoor use, position your glue boards in a horizontal direction on corners, or against the baseboards. Don&rsquo;t position on the moist surfaces or places near water.</li>
<li>Avoid using on areas with extreme heat. Also, for cold places like the walk-in fridge, get Catchmaster 48WRG which&rsquo;s great for cold temperatures.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a DIY home renovator, you understand that <a href="/posts/can-i-clean-spray-gun-with-denatured-alcohol/">spray</a> paint is a convenient and efficient option to give your living space a fresh new look.</p>
<p>However, the overpowering
<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-%5BRid%5D(/posts/get-rid-sweat-bees/)-of-Paint-Smells">spray paint odor</a>
that lingers after the paint dries can be overwhelming and unpleasant. Fortunately, you don&rsquo;t have to endure the unpleasant smell for long.</p>
<p>With the help of some everyday household items, eliminating the spray paint odor is easy and hassle-free. We will provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to get rid of the spray paint smell and rejuvenate your living space.

<strong>Step 1: Ventilate the area</strong>
The first step in getting rid of the spray paint smell is to open up windows and doors to ventilate the area as much as possible. This will help to dissipate the odor and bring in the fresh air.</p>
<p>If the weather is nice, consider opening windows on opposite sides of the room to create a cross breeze. This will help to circulate the air and speed up the process of getting rid of the smell.

<strong>Step 2: Use a fan</strong>
In addition to opening windows, using a fan to circulate the air in the room can also be helpful. This will help to distribute the odor and make it less concentrated.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a fan, you can also use a portable air purifier with a HEPA filter, which will help to remove the smell from the air.
<strong>Step 3: Use white vinegar</strong>
White vinegar is a natural odor absorber and can be used to neutralize the smell of spray paint. To use it, simply place bowls of white vinegar around the room.</p>
<p>The acetic acid in the vinegar will help to neutralize the odor of the spray paint. You can also add a few drops of essential oils to the vinegar, such as lemon or eucalyptus, for an added boost of freshness.

<strong>Step 4: Sprinkle baking soda</strong>
Baking soda is another natural odor absorber that can be used to eliminate the smell of spray paint.</p>
<p>Sprinkle baking soda on carpets and upholstered furniture, and let it sit for a few hours before vacuuming it up. Baking soda has the ability to absorb odors and will help to neutralize the smell of the spray paint.
<strong>Step 5: Use a deodorizing spray</strong>
If the smell of spray paint is particularly strong, you may want to consider using a deodorizing spray specifically formulated for paint odors.</p>
<p>These sprays contain enzymes and bacteria that neutralize paint odors. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and spray the product directly onto the surfaces that have been painted.

<strong>Step 6: Use activated charcoal</strong>
Activated charcoal is a natural odor absorber that can help to remove the smell of spray paint.</p>
<p>You can find activated charcoal in the form of small bags or pellets, which can be placed in bowls or left open in the room. Activated charcoal will absorb the paint smell from the air and neutralize it.
<strong>Step 7: Clean surfaces with white vinegar</strong>
To remove any leftover residue that may be contributing to the odor, clean the surfaces that have been painted with a solution of 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of water.</p>
<p>This will help to remove any traces of paint and neutralize the smell. Be sure to use gloves and a mask while doing this step if the smell is still very strong.
<strong>Step 8: Repeat as needed</strong>
It may take a few days for the odor to completely dissipate, so be patient and repeat steps 1-7 as needed until the odor is completely gone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that if the smell of spray paint is very strong, it&rsquo;s best to use proper ventilation and mask while doing these steps to avoid inhaling.

Squirrels dont leave anything unharmed, from woods to vegetables; all are vulnerable to their potential of harmful instincts.
They can cause fleas and even tick to your pets.</p>
<h2 id="1squirrels-repellents">1.Squirrels Repellents</h2>
<p>In the present world, there are numerous products available in the market. These products come in a wide variety.

<ul>
<li>A kind of repellent is made from the urine of squirrels predators, which is very interesting and a relatively new concept, adopting recently.</li>
<li>Theserepellents are sprayedaround gardens for the sake of keeping the squirrels away. Their effectiveness has been very impressive and is slowly turning into a go-to option for people suffering from these species.</li>
<li>There are a few kinds of repellents that are made up of black pepper. The advantage with this type of method is that while they are very effective in repelling the squirrels, at the same time, it doesnt take trouble birds, which makes it handful and keep the birds happy and calm.

</ul>
<h2 id="2-dont-feed-them">2. Dont feed them</h2>
<p>Squirrels come to the home because you feed them. Surprised?
Yes, we are feeding these squirrels unintentionally. These squirrels come to our home regularly because they find something to fill their belly up every time they come.
So its high time we figure out what they eat and start keeping such things away from them. Please dont give them an easy meal to have and a party at your place.</p>
<h2 id="3-applyapple-cider-vinegar">3. ApplyApple Cider Vinegar</h2>
<p>The usage of apple cider vinegar has turned fruitful in an attempt to free place from squirrels.
It works very simply by adding apple cider vinegar into a spray bottle and spray it near the holes, open corners, flower pots, or any other place where squirrels frequently visit.
The factor that makes this method useful is its pungent acidic smell, which squirrels couldnt handle.</p>
<h2 id="3-use-electric-fencing">3. Use Electric Fencing</h2>
<p>This method is an old fashioned one but mighty effective. Squirrels find it very easy to nibble the wires and extremely difficult to manage these fences.
Even these fences have been upgraded to an electric type. Therefore, it is highly advisable to use an electric fence around your place rather than mere wires.</p>
<h2 id="4-use-of-safflower">4. Use of Safflower</h2>
<p>Seeds of safflower are very bitter and acidic in taste and can be life-taking in squirrels. If these rodents are to be kept away from bird feeders, put safflower seeds in it.
On the one hand, these seeds are devastating for the squirrels and, on the other hand, harmless for birds, making it a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="5-sprinkle-pepper-chilli">5. Sprinkle Pepper (Chilli)</h3>
<p>A mixture of chili pepper and birdseed has turned into a good natural weapon to free place from squirrels. This mixture can be placed in the feeder for birds.
As the previous method of Safflower, this method keeps the squirrels away while keeping the birds unharmed and normal.</p>
<h2 id="6-hot-peppers-and-garlic-cloves">6. Hot Peppers and Garlic Cloves</h2>
<p>Talking about mixtures, one more mixture has become very useful. This is a mixture of finely grounded hot peppers and garlic cloves in almost equal proportions.
Then add some water to mix it and a paste of it. Once the powdery paste is ready, sprinkle it to the parts where squirrels normally visit.</p>
<h2 id="7-jalapeno-pepper">7. Jalapeno Pepper</h2>
<p>In the list of the mixture, one more mixture has recently gained popularity, i.e., the mixture of jalapeno pepper, water, and vinegar.
Shake it as hard as you can and like the other methods, spray it to the corners and commonly used places by squirrels.

<h2 id="how-to-scare-away-squirrels">How to Scare Away Squirrels</h2>
<p><strong>1. Squirrel Exclusion Collars</strong>
<em>Want to scare the squirrels?�</em>
Scaring the squirrel can be an effective and proactive approach for the exclusion of squirrels. One of the things that really scare out these squirrels is the collar typically made up of sharp metal.
These collars are positioned around the trees, poles, and bird feeders. When this animal tries to
climb up the pole
, it finds it extremely difficult to climb a smooth metal disk. Not only is it difficult to climb up, but it also injures the squirrels, perhaps the reason for their fright.
<strong>2. Usage of chemicals</strong>
As science has evolved, different kinds of chemicals have been explored and used to clear the place from squirrels; at
times, chemicals can be damaging for squirrels also, which aids in creating a fear factor in these species&rsquo; minds.
Attics are dry, warm, and mostly uninhabited. Thus, it makes it an ideal place for squirrels to settle down, build a place for them, a nest, store food, and try to be protected from other enemies outside.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-attic">How to Get Rid Of Squirrels in the Attic</h2>
<p><strong>1. Close Attic Entry Points</strong>
The basic thing to protect an attic from squirrels is to close all possible and visible entry, and exit points squirrels can utilize.
Make sure you use nails and a hammer to seal all such spots. Please dont give them an easy access point to come over and live and build.
<strong>2. Use of mothballs</strong>
Usage of mothballs has gained acceptance and popularity in the ear past, as they have proven themselves enormously useful when it comes to getting rid of squirrels.
Mothballs are made up of naphthalene balls, which is the chief element in driving out these species. The cost of this method is very affordable, hence the grown usage.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-roof-space">How to Get Rid Of Squirrels In Roof Space</h2>
<p>These days, squirrels are regarded as the peskiest of the pests, mainly due to their tenacity coupled with their devastating fretting and chewing on woodwork.
The two options that have proven themselves most effective are Exclusion and Trapping.
Upon removing squirrels, you must sot let them these species come again to your home.
You must carry out repairs and make sure you animal-proof your property, and consequently, more of this creature will come in to replace their evicted numbers.
People are not very aware of this type of trap. Different agencies are marketing it, hoping that this will gather popularity and acceptance.
<strong>1. Cage Traps</strong>
An evergreen method of catching squirrels is to trap them in cages. This method has remained a useful option ever since its inception.
Even today, its being used very aggressively to get rid of squirrels. Again like previous methods, this one also scares and annoys the squirrels.
One way exclusion doors.
As the name indicates, this box has only a way in and no way out for squirrels. This is a slightly newer kind of trap box that has come into the market.</p>
<h2 id="killing-squirrels-with-anti-freeze">Killing Squirrels with Anti-Freeze</h2>
<p>*Have you ever thought anti-freeze can kill these squirrels? Trust me, they can, but the process is risky. *
Anti-freezes active and decisive ingredient is its Ethylene Glycol. Its taste is quite sweet, hence that attraction for squirrels.
Its proven now that anti-freeze works as an outstanding
pest control
poison that curbs or eliminate rodents from your home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Its risky because these are dangerous for our
pets like dogs and cats
, as they also like the sweetness of it and fall in the trap thats being laid, not for the squirrels.
The anti-freeze works as a useful and effective homemade
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-poison-for-squirrels/">squirrel poison</a>
; its dark side is it puts our pets&rsquo; lives at risk also.</p>

      <description>Sugar ants are tiny annoying insects and stubborn household bugs.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sugar <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-car/">ants</a> are tiny annoying insects and stubborn household bugs.</p>
<p>Sugar ants are common during warm seasons when they come out of their nests to search for food.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ve discussed the 5 effective ways on how to get rid of the sugar ants.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-sugar-ants-look-like/">Looks</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-sugar-ants-bite/">Bites</a></p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-sugar-ants">How to Get Rid of Sugar Ants</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll mainly see sugar ants in the yard, under rocks, on trees, and if you are not careful, in your home. They are mainly attracted to sugary foods and scraps and they will do anything to gain entry into your home to find them.</p>
<p>These� insect&rsquo;s body size allows them to gain entry into your home through the tiniest spaces.�Sugar ants can be extremely annoying to most homeowners.�Let&rsquo;s get into the details of how to get rid of sugar ants once and for all:</p>
<h2 id="a-natural-methods">A. Natural Methods</h2>
<h3 id="1-keep-your-house-clean-especially-the-kitchen">1. Keep your house clean, especially the kitchen</h3>
<p>The typical sugar ant diet consists of anything they can find lying around in your home. Even a tiny crumb from a snack you hastily devoured might be enough to attract hundreds of ants to your home. Always keep your home clean and surfaces free from food scraps that might attract ants. Make sure you clean dirty dishes in the sink and dispose of your trash regularly. Wipe down the counters thoroughly, dust your shelves, vacuum your floors, and have professionals clean the carpet regularly.</p>
<h3 id="2-soapy-water">2. Soapy Water</h3>
<p>Dishwashing soap and other detergents can double up as pest killers in various circumstances. Just mix some soap with water and pour it into a spray bottle. Soap has a certain scent that acts as a deterrent against sugar ants and when sprayed directly on the ants, it can kill them.</p>
<h3 id="3-store-your-food-properly">3. Store your food properly</h3>
<p>Leaving your food open and exposed is almost like sending the sugar ants an invitation into your home. Keep your perishable food items such as fruits and vegetables safely locked away in the fridge where the ants can&rsquo;t access them. Your non-perishable food items such as cereals should be stored in airtight containers then kept in cabinets where the ants can&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-vinegar">4. Use Vinegar</h3>
<p>Vinegar can be an effective ant deterrent when used creatively. It contains acetic acid which is a powerful ant deterrent and also removes the scent of ant trails preventing other ants from using the same route to access your home. You just need to combine equal parts vinegar and water into a spray bottle and blitz the areas you&rsquo;ve either spotted ant activity before or where you want to ensure sugar ants never get to, such as kitchen surfaces.</p>
<p>The only drawback with vinegar is that it only keeps ants at bay when its scent is still strong, which doesn&rsquo;t last that long. You will need a full spray bottle if you choose to use this method for a while.</p>
<h3 id="5-coffee-grounds">5. Coffee Grounds</h3>
<p>If you are a coffee lover, you will love this one! Instead of getting rid of your coffee grounds, you can use them to repel sugar ants. Ants hate the burning acidity and smell of coffee grounds. You can sprinkle them around your home or in areas where you want to repel ants, such as near pet bowls.</p>
<h3 id="6-cloves-bay-leaves-or-garlic">6. Cloves, Bay Leaves or Garlic</h3>
<p>The compounds responsible for the strong smell in bay leaves and cloves are also highly effective for repelling sugar ants. Garlic also has a strong odor that throws ants off their scent trails and confuses them. Lay out bay leaves and whole cloves along baseboards and other areas where you want to repel ants.</p>
<h3 id="7-homemade-ant-repellent">7. Homemade ant repellent</h3>
<p>You can easily make your own insect repellent at home by combining water with peppermint or lavender essential oils and spraying it on ant infested areas.</p>
<h3 id="8-homemade-ant-trap">8. Homemade ant trap</h3>
<p>You can easily make an ant trap by smearing a sweet and sticky substance like honey or corn syrup on a plate and placing it in areas where you know sugar ants have invaded. The sugar attracts ants to the plate but since it&rsquo;s sticky, the ants will be stuck giving you a chance to annihilate them.</p>
<h2 id="b-chemical-methods">B. Chemical Methods</h2>
<h2 id="1-ant-killer-sprays-and-insecticides">1. Ant killer sprays and insecticides</h2>
<p>There are commercial ant killer sprays or insecticides that you can use to kill ants in your home. However, remember that such products contain toxic chemicals that can be harmful to you, your kids or pets. Be careful when using them.</p>
<h3 id="2-ant-bait">2. Ant Bait</h3>
<p>This is where you use a poisonous bait disguised as ant food to destroy an entire colony. The idea is to trick the ants into carrying the bait back to their colony as food. Once the ants eat the bait, they&rsquo;ll slowly begin to die. Most ant baits contain borax or boric acid which is a slow-acting ant poison.</p>
<p>If you have tried all these methods and failed( which is highly unlikely), your next best option is to hire a professional exterminator to come in and deal with the ant problem for you once and for all.</p>

<li>particularly after a termite inspection - comprehensive steps for prevention and total termite extermination.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the most common technique includes
soil treatment
and
chemical termite killers
with active ingredients such as fipronil and imidacloprid. Further, you may also directly treat the wood and furniture to get rid of termites�(
check termite images
).
While at it, you may also position baits in the house and lawn. Such chemicals will release IGRs. After contacting the termites, the termites will go back to their colony and kill them through poisoning.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Termite Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Additional methods you can use include fumigation, using dust agents, employing foam agents, and further avoiding disturbing the

<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-termites---pest-control-tips">Details: How to Get Rid of Termites - Pest Control Tips</h2>
<p>Termites have
2,300 species, and they&rsquo;ll gnaw wood in your home and other properties plus included furniture - they&rsquo;ll weaken or damage wooden structures. These bugs have three body parts and six legs.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Subterranean Termites</em>- Subterranean termites (cream-brown colored) create mud tubes to get to wooden structures, particularly in the humid or warm regions. These bugs measure about1/8 inches in length and are largely found in the Southeast.</li>
<li><em>Dry-wood Termites</em>- The dry-wood termites will build nests on and eat dry wood and furniture. These termites are tan- or light-brown colored and measure about3/8 inches in length. The dry-wood termites largely live in coastal states and the Southwest.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYPQ1Tjp0ew&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYPQ1Tjp0ew&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
<li><em>Damp-wood Termites</em>- These termites feed on damaged or wood-soiled damp wood. The damp wood could includelogs, lumber, and stumps. Damp-wood termites are brown in color and measure about inch long plus they&rsquo;re mainly found in Pacific regions like southern Florida.</li>
<li><em>Formosan Termites</em>- Formosan Termites is a highly dangeroussubterranean termite (they love both wet soil and moist wood) and will get into your structures through cracks, unsealed joints, or wood that&rsquo;s in contact with the soil. Formosan Termites are yellow-brown and measure inch long, living in wall nests and underground in the warmer South climates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-inspection---how-to-do-a-termite-inspection">1. Inspection - How to Do A Termite Inspection</h2>
<p>A termite
inspection
is a dirty job requiring you to have a flat-head screwdriver or pocket knife, flashlight, gloves, and coveralls.</p>
<h3 id="i-what-to-look-fobelowow-are-some-of-the-objects-to-look-out-for---including-live-termites-damaged-woods-and-mud-tub-during-the-termite-inspections">i. What To Look FoBelowow are some of the objects to look out for - including live termites, damaged woods, and mud tub during the termite inspections.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Termite wing Piles - Termite swarmers tend to shed wings as they molt to their nextlife stage- and these wings will be piled around light sources such as near windows. Swarmers will have four wings pairs of the same size anddouble in length as the bug&rsquo;sbody.</li>
<li>Damaged furniture or wood - Massive termite infestation will lead to damaged wood when the bugs destroy the structure&rsquo;s joints&rsquo; integrity. Tap the dry wood using a pocket knife or screwdriver - a dull thud will signify termites in wood tunnels.</li>
<li>Mud tubes - Termites, particularly subterranean termites, will build mud tube nests from wet soil, and these will run-up to the wood where they&rsquo;ll get their food. So, if you see the mud tubes running across or around the wooden structure - this shows the presence of termites.
The potential termite infestation places include wooden structures in crawl spaces and basements, window frames and sills, porches, and wooden decks. Additional areas include cement, wood debris, expansion joints, and brick construction cracks and piles, plus wooden porches and slabs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ii-probe-the-ground">ii. Probe the Ground</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to probe the suspected ground using
screwdrivers or picks. Dig into the wood or soil around the house&rsquo;s foundation and examine any mud tubes or wing piles. You&rsquo;ll notice that the mud tubes will measure a diameter of about
inches.
The mud tubes will be moving towards the wooden structures, but you must note that there is also a massive termite infestation for large tubes. Also, termites will escape direct sunlight, and hence they&rsquo;ll be hiding in bushes and shrubs - insulation, floors coverings, and behind walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal weather and behavior - During the warm climates, the termites will go into hiding while they&rsquo;ll start mating and getting new sites insummer and spring.However, in winter,subterranean termites will start burrowing deeper into the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-termite-treatment">2. Termite Treatment</h2>
<h3 id="i-termite-trenching">i. Termite Trenching</h3>
<p>For effective treatment control, termite treat your home&rsquo;s exterior with Taurus SC, among other effective termiticides that&rsquo;ll fully exterminate the termites. The treatment prevents new termites from getting into the structure while also exterminating the termites as they exit their nest.
You&rsquo;ll require a pump sprayer, a medium-sized bucket, and a pickaxe or trench shovel. However, if there is a concrete block on your way, you&rsquo;ll need concrete drill bits (1/2 inches by 24 inches or 1/2 inches by 18 inches) and a hammer drill. Here&rsquo;s the process;</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig trenches that are 6 inches deep by 6 inches wide on then house&rsquo;s foundation and particularly on the external wall - locations that termites bore and build their nests. Make the trench to go a minimum of 10 feet in length or as far as the termite infestation goes.</li>
<li>Next, prepare the termiticide termite treatment. Take your bucket and put water up to about 3/4 of its total level. Next, pour the recommended termiticide treatment to create the right concentration, also using a stirrer to get the right concentration.</li>
<li>Next, pour the termite treatment solution into the trench you&rsquo;ve already created on the wall near the termite nest - this should be done gently for even distribution. Also, pour some of the termite treatment on the soil evacuated from the &ldquo;termite trench.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Spray the soil excavated to ensure that it&rsquo;s an effective treatment as you return it into the termite trench - ensure that the spraying leaves this soil in a moist condition.
If you are drilling any concrete blocks on the way, either on a sidewalk or carport slab - use the tangible drill bits plus your hammer drill to make work easier. Make 2&quot; to 3&quot; drilled holes plus allow distancing of about 12 inches between the holes.
However, ensure you pass through the concrete and make a big hole in the soil under the stone. Finally, fill the drilled holes with the termite treatment solution - a plastic or metallic funnel would also help apply the termiticide into the holes.
Allow the holes and the soil to soak up properly with the treatment solution - come back after 1 hour and repeat the treatment process - this should be some about three times. Finally, patch the holes using concrete using Trebor plugs or a patch filler to get the concrete slat to its initial state.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ii-termite-bait-stations">ii. Termite Bait Stations</h3>
<p>Termite bait stations or Termite traps are excellent treatment options either above or in the ground around the yard or home. The stations have baits (either cellulose, paper, or wood) that contain some poison aimed to kill the termites by design.
Bait stations will be useful in situations where termite trenches are undesirable or impracticable. Luckily, this method is easy to install, cheap (besides using many attractants) don&rsquo;t use harmful chemicals, and it&rsquo;s not labor-intensive. However, the
bait stations require regular inspection -
maybe within three months.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require a post hole digger, 3/4 inches electric, or hand augers (2 in total) for thistermite treatment process. Typically, you&rsquo;ll install the termite bait stations to create a termite barrier around the home - roughly 3-4 feet from the house&rsquo;s foundation.</li>
<li>Install the bait stations in narrow holes (8-10 inches drilled using augers) and spaces them between 8 and 10 feet apart. However, you may reduce the separation between the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/home-remedy-for-termites/">termite bait stations around then home</a>for a massive infestation.</li>
<li>Ensure that the hole you drill is deeper with about 2 inches to 4 inches than the bait station&rsquo;s bottom - this enables any rainwateror otherwise to drainunder the bait station. Don&rsquo;t damage water, utility, or gas lines as you drill the holes.</li>
<li>Also, install the baits at about 1 foot - 2 feet from the house&rsquo;s foundation, and thus it&rsquo;ll be easy to avoid tampering with previously installed soil treatments or termite barriers - or any that&rsquo;ll be installed at a later date.</li>
<li>Ensure that the bait&rsquo;s lip will be flush with the soil. Finally, create a map of your house and each bait station&rsquo;s locations so that it&rsquo;ll be easier to trace them later.
The next step will require monitoring the termite bait station using a pre-bait made from objects such as an inspection cartridge or wood. However, this process may take several months up to even a year (monitor the station every three months) because it will not immediately attract the termites.
Next, when you notice that the termites are feeding or tampering with the pre-bait, it&rsquo;s now time to install an active bait such as dead or live termites or mud tubes. Don&rsquo;t rush to install the poisoned termite bait as you may end up exterminating the workers required to create the feeding.
Finally, it&rsquo;s now time to install the active or poisoned bait onto the termite bait station. However, monitor the bait station as you&rsquo;d done earlier every three months. Keep records of all the changes, particularly of feeding activity, to allow the bait to rest on the station more - repeat the treatment process monthly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-termite-prevention">3. Termite Prevention</h2>
<h3 id="i-seal-off-windows-and-doors">i. Seal off windows and Doors</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to seal off the house or property from the termites - this is especially important for windows and doors. Therefore, the bugs won&rsquo;t quickly get into your wooden house - you&rsquo;ll need to seal up the crevices and cracks in the rooftops and sidings.
Important is you analyze any possible entry areas that the termites can use and seal them off completely. Further, you&rsquo;ll need to inspect the wooden floors and furniture - including beams and joists, to ensure that the termites aren&rsquo;t wreaking havoc on your house.</p>
<h3 id="ii-repair-leaking-pipes-and-tapes">ii. Repair L**eaking **Pipes and Tapes</h3>
<p>Termite prevention will save you both time, money, and furniture or structure integrity in the future. However, the most important fact is avoiding moisture getting ton your wooden structures - this will help kill off the termite colonies.
So, repair any leaking pipes and tapes - including those of the hot water lines near or around the house. Hence, the lack of moisture around the home will reduce the conditions necessary for the thriving of subterranean termites.
Also, mop all the moisture around your house and remove all the water that could be in water puddles around the house or property - or even inside the home. Keep the house plus floors and carpets dry and well-aerated all round then year.
Also, avoid the overflows from the various air-conditioning and hot water lines away from the house and its sides.</p>
<h3 id="iii-clear-idle-wooden-materials">iii. Clear idle Wooden Materials</h3>
<p>Inspect the house for breached or damaged shielding installed to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/top-7-natural-termite-control-can-easily/">control termites</a>
. Further, remove all idle wooden materials, including cellulose, debris, and timber that may be lying inside, under, or around your house or yard - equally use
yard flea treatments
.
Such timber may act as good food for the termites and equally a hiding place for subterranean termites (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">check their treatments</a>
) and may also conceal termites inside the dead leaves and base-work work-spaces. You&rsquo;ll also require to remove all clothes piles lying around idle as they&rsquo;ll provide food (have cellulose) and shelter for termites.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s how to get rid of termites - for the active termite colony in the wooden structure or house, you&rsquo;ll need to undertake appropriate treatment steps.
But first, undertake termite inspection before taking treatment further, including using
termite baits stations
and soil treatment.</p>

<h3 id="1-pesticides">1. Pesticides</h3>
<p>Most pesticides and Insecticides in the local market kill wolf spiders and
hobo spiders
by paralyzing them before death takes place.
The toxic chemicals in pesticides/insecticides also inhibit spider&rsquo;s eggs from hatching and further break down their breeding grounds (webs).</p>
<ul>
<li>When purchasing your pesticides/insecticides, be careful to check on the spider labels or recommendations for killing assurance.</li>
<li>Tempo SC Ultra is a good example of an outdoor wolf spider insecticide that kills over 100 other pests. The product is extra concentrated to boost killing power and allows further dilution to form 30 gallons of effective solvent - covers a wide surface area.
When dealing with pesticides/insecticides, be careful since residue left behind may affect your pets or kids upon contact.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-trap-wolf-spiders-in-a-container">2. Trap wolf spiders in a container</h3>
<p>Wolf spider trap container is an ideal method of capturing one or two spiders. Usually, you need a plastic or a glass container and a piece of cardboard or wood -
spiders have no antennae
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon spotting a wolf spider, cover it with a plastic container immediately. Then, gently slide a piece of cardboard beneath the container - be careful that the spider may not escape.</li>
<li>This method encloses the wolf spider and prevents it from crawling or running away. You can easily release the spider far away from your compound - may be in the fields. Don&rsquo;t throw live wolf spiders into a dustbin or garbage pit.
When trapping wolf spiders, wear protective gloves to avoid the case of being bitten in the process. Though wolf spider&rsquo;s bite is less venomous, it may trigger a reaction, for allergic sensitive individuals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-boric-acid-solvent">3. Boric Acid Solvent</h3>
<p>Boric acid solvent, when inhaled by wolf spider, chocks and suffocate it to death in a couple of seconds. The toxic gas blocks the breathing system, thus denying it the oxygen needed for life support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon contact, boring acid solvent weakens and breaks down the wolf spider&rsquo;s exoskeleton - this action exposes internal tissues, which are further dehydrated leading to death.
During preparation, ensure that the boric acid solvent is super concentrated for excellent action.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-use-an-organic-pesticide">4. Use an organic pesticide</h3>
<p>Unlike
commercial chemical-based pesticides
, organic pesticides are manufactured using a special plant-based solvent (Hexa-hydroxyl), which is a non-pollutant.
Actually, these pesticides won&rsquo;t kill wolf spiders directly; instead, the organic substance destroys all insects in which the spider feeds.
By eliminating the wolf spider&rsquo;s primary source of food; then, you will eventually get rid of spiders in the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, organic pesticides come in powder or dust form - you just need to sprinkle it in an area infested with wolf spiders and leave it for a couple of minutes to act.
The organic substance in the pesticides (Hexa-hydroxyl) is safe for both kids and pets - won&rsquo;t cause intoxication or contact reaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-hunt-wolf-spiders-down">5. Hunt wolf spiders down</h3>
<p>Hunting down wolf spiders is a tactical way of elimination where you physically search for these arachnids in their hideouts. Usually, hunting is successful at night more than daytime due to limited light sources, which eases escape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a torch, flashlight over wolf spiders hideouts intermittently - this could be at corners, holes, cracks, woods, patches, or shrubs.</li>
<li>The disc eye shape found in the wolf spiders reflects light at night making them more visible.
Upon spotting the spider, you can opt to kill or capture them alive using a trap. Remember to wear protective gloves when hunting wolf spiders for your own personal safety. Avoid disturbing other animals in the vicinity when hunting.

<h3 id="6-spider-spray">6. Spider Spray</h3>
<p>Spider sprays are specific products manufactured for wolf spiders elimination - the product may be chemical-based or organic, depending on the manufacturer or intended area of use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spider sprays come in pressurized and concentrated forms that act instantly upon contact. Indeed, the toxic substances in the spray integrate a quick-acting formulation that kills instantly upon contact.</li>
<li>Demon Max is a classic example of spider spray that integrates complex chemical formula, which not only kills wolf spiders but also inhibits their re-infestation.
Terro Spider Spray is a market lead spider killer that comes in a 16oz canister and works both indoors &amp; outdoors. Further, Terror Spray instantly kills spiders and other insects such as cockroaches, scorpions, crickets, and ants in the process.
Remember, spider sprays are user-specific, either indoors or outdoors - consider checking the labels before use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-place-sticky-traps-around-the-house">7. Place sticky traps around the house</h3>
<p>If you suspect that wolf spiders are lurking in your compound or house; then, consider using the sticky traps method. The traps are just cardboard pasted with sticky glue on the surface, which acts as the sticking/trapping agent.</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea in this method is that when the wolf spider steps on the sticky surface, it gets stuck and unable to crawl along - this act denies it food leading to death.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to prepare or purchase several sticky traps.
Then, lay them down strategically at places you suspect wolf spiders may pass or crawl (it may be your bedroom, garage, kitchen, store, yard, or toilet) and leave them for 5 days or so. Later, come and inspect your trap for any capture.
Any trapped wolf spider should be disposed of far away from the compound. Ensure the sticky traps are placed far from kids and pets whatsoever.

</ul>
<h3 id="8-wash-spiders-away">8. Wash spiders away</h3>
<p>Using pressurized water, from a hosepipe or jet stream, you can wash away wolf spider infestation. Usually, you aim water jet at the spiders&rsquo; hideouts - the water pushes the spiders out instantly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon removal, the spiders (plus their eggs) float in water and are easily washed away.</li>
<li>This method is best for outdoor wolf spiders&rsquo; elimination.
Also, the drainage through which the washed spiders flow should be sufficiently linked to sewer or septic to prevent re-infestation.
When washing away wolf spiders infestation, wear protective gear (gumboots, gloves, goggles, etc.) for your personal safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-kill-the-spider-with-a-broom">9. Kill the spider with a broom</h3>
<p>By using a standard broom, you can strike and kill a live wolf spider - as
they lack wings
. Normally, you need to aim and hit the spider fast before it senses danger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wolf spiders are fast running - they quickly pace to their hideouts as soon as they detect danger in their vicinity.</li>
<li>Smaller wolf spiders are likely to slip away when striking; thus, making the broom ineffective - you, therefore, need to check the size of the wolf spider before settling for this method.
Alternatively, you can use a solid object or a pair of shoes to hit the spider too. Dead spiders should be disposed of accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-rid-your-yard-of-clutter-and-debris">10. Rid your yard of clutter and debris</h3>
<p>Clutters and debris in the compound or house are possible hideouts for wolf spiders during the day. Heaps of glass, firewood, mulch, bins, compost, or leaves should be cleared from the compound to eliminate breeding grounds for wolf spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, objects such as grills, unused toolboxes, stones, empty flower vases among others should be removed or inspected regularly.
When undertaking the cleaning process, wear protective gear such as boots, gloves, overalls, and gloves for personal safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-seal-cracks-and-holes-in-the-outer-wall">11. Seal cracks and holes in the outer wall</h3>
<p>By sealing cracks and holes on your perimeter wall or house, you will not only keep off wolf spiders from infestation but also inhibit further breeding ground for other insects too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holes and cracks are immediate hideouts for wolf spiders and often than never, they breed in such areas.</li>
<li>You can successfully seal the cracks/holes using patty or caulk - both indoors or outdoors.
Broken window screens should be removed replaced immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-remove-vegetation-from-the-perimeter-of-the-house">12. Remove vegetation from the perimeter of the house</h3>
<p>Heavy plant cover (vegetation) in your compound provides ample ground for wolf spiders infestation. Shrubs, thick flowerbeds, and untrimmed grass cover shied wolf spiders and offer suitable breeding grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>By trimming vegetable covers and clearing plant waste in the compound, you will be exposing wolf spider hideouts; thus scaring them away, if any.
It&rsquo;s recommendable to trim grass cover sufficiently and avoid crowded flower beds in your compound.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-install-insect-screens">13. Install insect screens</h3>
<p>Insect screen in a fine-mesh framework that is firmly fixed at the vent leading to outside. Basically, it&rsquo;s believed that wolf spiders can get into your house through these vents or chimneys as they search for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to install screens all over the vents in your house or perimeter wall, in order to prevent wolf spiders from crawling in through these points.
Though expensive, this method works excellently and prevents other insects from your home too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-remove-or-change-your-outdoor-lighting">14. Remove or change your outdoor lighting</h3>
<p>The presence of light attracts insects such as flies, mosquitoes, moths among others, which are food for wolf spiders. In response, wolf spiders will come to feed on these insects leading to infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should swift off lights at night, especially if it&rsquo;s not in use. Install light shades in your place instead of floodlights.
Alternatively, go for sodium vapor light in place of a normal/standard outdoor lighting system. As much as you can, maintain dim light at night since wolf spiders love hunting for food at night than daytime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homemade-remedies-for-eliminating-wolf-spiders">Homemade Remedies for Eliminating Wolf Spiders?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for homemade wolf spiders elimination alternative to fix your problem; then, consider the options highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-use-of-hexa-hydroxyl">1. Use of Hexa-Hydroxyl</h3>
<p>Hexa-hydroxyl is naturally blended using plant extracts and oil additives to boots sent. The organic substance can be used to kill wolf spiders by spraying or sprinkling over wolf spider-infested areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>All you need to do ispeppermint, lavender leaves, and red peppers. Mesh these items in a motor and add little water. Sieve the mixture and repeat the process again.</li>
<li>You can opt to add Aloe Vera plant to boost the killing action. The solvent extract kills wolf spiders on contact. Further, the toxic gas released suffocates the spiders to death too
Hexa-hydroxyl is also available in the local market too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-by-using-glue-strips">2. By Using Glue Strips</h3>
<p>Glue can be poured along paths suspected to be used often by wolf spiders. Whether office glue or rubber adhesive, provided that the glue has a substantial adhesive force to hold the spider in place; then, you are good to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>When wolf spiders step on the glue, they will get stuck/trapped and starve to death. Remember, you should use glue that is easier to remove without affecting the primary material upon which it&rsquo;s applied.
Alternatively, you can smear a piece of wood with glue and place it in wolf spiders infested area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-dish-soap">3. Dish Soap</h3>
<p>Highly viscous dish soap act as sticking surface upon which wolf spiders get stuck. However, it&rsquo;s difficult for the spider just to step into dish soap for no reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you will need to have spider&rsquo;s bait placed in the dish soap - this could be a moth, housefly, or any other insect eaten by spiders.</li>
<li>Prepare dish soap sufficiently - add water and stir to form a thick viscous paste. Using a sweep net, capture moths or flies from the fields. Place the dead flies on the dish soap.
Place dish soap in various points where you suspect wolf spider will pass - it may be your garage, shelves, kitchen, or bedroom. Inspect the trap after a day or so to see the presence of trapped spiders.
Scoop and throw away trapped spider. Always refill the dish soap after capture. This method may also traps crawling insects such as ants as well as houseflies.
