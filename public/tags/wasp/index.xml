      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As homeowners, we&rsquo;re often faced with <a href="/posts/do-fake-wasps-nests-work/">wasp</a> attacks and other flying insects, especially in summer and thus it&rsquo;s critical to know all that appertains to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bees-vs-wasps-vs-hornets/">wasps, bees, and hornets</a>
.
<strong>So, what are <a href="/posts/baby-bed-bugs/">baby</a> wasps, what do they look like? Well, a baby wasp is a youngling of a wasp that&rsquo;s between the egg stage to an adult wasp; includes the larvae, pupa, and then virgin queen or young male drone.�</strong>
However, the baby wasp will be helped in their feeding activities by the�adult worker wasps until they&rsquo;re adult enough to take various responsibilities.</p>
<h2 id="details-what-do-baby-wasps-look-like">Details: What Do Baby Wasps Look Like?</h2>
<p>The wasps will move via 4 life stages to get to adulthood - these are Egg-Larvae-Pupa-Adult. However, the baby wasp is a youngling wasp that is between the stages of egg &amp; adult wasp.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the baby wasp is described as a development stage as the insect grows to become an adult.
But the baby wasp is relatively inactive, particularly in its pupae stage since it&rsquo;ll remain domain for a number of days, then change into a virgin queen or male drone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-life-cycle-of-a-wasp---wasp-larvae-hatching">The life cycle of a wasp - Wasp Larvae Hatching?</h2>
<p>Most wasps and their babies will die off during winter and fall when the temperature drops. Thus, their virgin queens will move out and get impregnated to grow the life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>The queen wasps lay their eggs at end of winter when the temperature gets normal.</li>
<li>As the environmental temperatures drop, the queen wasp and wasp males die off and then the virgin queens will get impregnated.
The impregnated virgin queens will then move out and get some other shelter that&rsquo;s appropriate during winter but the other wap colony members will die.</li>
<li>After winter, the wasps will emerge during spring and begin to create their nests that look like a honeycomb - with some small cells</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="baby-wasp-development">Baby Wasp Development</h2>
<p>After the wasp eggs are hatched to become larvae (one stage of the baby wasp), these organisms start to grow.</p>
<p>In 2 - 3 days the eggs that are laid (each queen wasps will lay an unfertilized (drone) egg in one of its nests&rsquo; cells) will hatch.</p>
<ul>
<li>The queen wasp will feed the newly-hatched larvae with some insects inside the nest cells until they&rsquo;re mature.
Within 12 - 18 days, the wasp larvae will spin some silk in the cells to encase themselves. Further, the wasp larvae will emerge from those cocoons after 12 additional days.</li>
<li>At the start of winter, those queen wasp will begin their mating period before they migrate to other places.
In the new location, those queen waps will create some shelter or nest.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-azDxgBEcY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-azDxgBEcY</a></p>
<p>Once the larvae achieve enough energy, they&rsquo;ll transform into a wasp pupa - a stage that is inactive and will stay dormant for about 1-2 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, the wasp pupa will continue storing enough energy for further development and growth.
Finally, once the wasp pupa is fully developed, these baby wasps will emerge from the shell and become young adult wasps.</li>
<li>Next, the worker wasps will continue feeding those young adult wasps for 14 - 21 days until it becomes full-growth was adults.
So, the adult female wasps will then go to lay their fertilized eggs (that will hatch to become drones).</li>
<li>The hatched drones will be tasked to gather food, feed the wasp larvae, and create a nest for the wasp colony.
Further, the wasp queen will move to other places during the mating time to avoid mating the drones in their colony (and avoid inbreeding).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-the-color-size-and-shape-of-baby-wasps">What&rsquo;s the Color, Size, and Shape of Baby Wasps?</h2>
<p>Checking the wasps&rsquo; physical appearance would help you specifically identify those baby wasps.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, you&rsquo;ll need to check some unique physical features of the wasps - you&rsquo;ll mainly locate them in their nest, shelter, or the nest.
The baby wasps will come mainly as hornets, paper wasps, and yellowjackets.
<strong>1. Shape of Baby Wasps�</strong>
Baby wasps of varied species will have different shapes. For example, the baby yellowjacket waps have a�sloped sharp end,�cone-shaped abdomen, and a narrow waist.</li>
<li>Another species is the mud dauber wasp whose baby stage has an elongated (thin) body and a while those of the paper species have long legs and a waist that is spindle-shaped.
Besides the baby wasps of the European Hornet species has a smooth (hairless) body and a narrow waist.</li>
<li>Also, the babies of this species do not turn while developing.
However, in general, the baby wasps will appear as some lump that is inactive and is in those wasp nests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-color-of-baby-wasps">2. Color of Baby Wasps</h3>
<p>The color of the baby wasps will be yellow and black including the Yellowjacket and European Paper that have an abdomen that is black &amp; yellow.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the European Hornet has a tail that has yellow strips (on black) and its thorax is reddish-brown.
In addition, the baby wasps of the mud-daubers species will have black &amp; yellow.</li>
<li>However, the color marks or stripes on the baby wasps could be tiny to be visible - you may require some microscope or hand lens.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-size-of-baby-wasps">3. Size of Baby Wasps</h3>
<p>The size of the baby wasps will be around 0.2 - 1.5 inches in length depending on the species of the wasp.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the length of the baby wasps may be different, it won&rsquo;t be longer than 1.7 inches.
Notably, even some of the adult wasp could also have the same body length.</li>
<li>But the adult wasps can be differentiated since they&rsquo;re more active than the baby wasp.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-wasps-bite-or-just-sting">Do Wasps Bite Or Just Sting?</h2>
<p>Baby wasps won&rsquo;t sting humans and pests; these organisms exist in
the larvae, the pupae, and young adult development stages - all these lack sting tissues that are well developed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notable the wasp larvae will mainly live in the wasp nest cells and thus they&rsquo;ll have less capacity to move around
Next, the pupae are described to be dormant (immobile) while those
baby wasps in the young adult stage will start learning movement on emerging from the pupa.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question of baby wasps, these organisms exist between the stages of the eggs and adult wasp.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, these will be the wasps in the larvae, pupae, and the young wasp adults (including the virgin queen and the young male drone.
The baby wasps will be fed by the worker wasps up to their maturity age. The worker wasps will work to build nests, feed the larvae wasps, and search for food.</li>

<h2 id="bees-vs-wasps-vs-hornets---7-key-differences">Bees vs. Wasps vs. Hornets - 7 Key Differences?</h2>
<p>Well, wasps (non-furry insects) are carnivores, while bees are furry and will east flower pollen to produce honey. Check these
sprays for yellow jackets.</p>
<h3 id="1-color">**1. **<strong>Color�</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
The color of bees can range between yellow and black, depending on the species. But
<a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/honey-bee-anatomy">honey bees share different traits</a>
with various bugs.
For instance, honey bees have a golden-yellow color with a characteristic brown band. Bumblebees are tan in color with yellow or orange coloration. Bees have 3 pairs of legs - and thus may be considered like
<a href="http://www.reachoutmichigan.org/funexperiments/agesubject/lessons/insect.html">insects</a>
.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps come in a myriad of colors. There are over
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/group/wasps/">30,000 different wasps</a>
. Stinging wasps have bright colors that serve as a warning to intruders. For example, the yellow and black color on yellow jackets indicates they have the ability to sting.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Usually, hornets will appear to be black and white. However, the European hornet is brown with either orange or yellow markings. The yellow hornet is yellow and black in color.</p>
<h3 id="2-body-appearance">**2. **<strong>Body Appearance</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Bees have three body parts, just like other insects  Head, thorax, and abdomen. The part connecting the abdomen and thorax is thicker in bees than in both wasps and hornets. Bees come in different sizes depending on the species. Bumblebees are wider and hairy, while honeybees are small in girth and less hairy.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
A wasps body is segmented into three parts with a characteristic thin waistline, distinguishing them from either bees or hornets. They have a slim body, which is less hairy compared to bees.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are close relatives of wasps, although they emerge from different species. They have a larger body and a thicker waist when compared to wasps.
<a href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/housing/pubs/pests/bees.pdf">Hornets look very similar to wasps</a></p>
<ul>
<li>notice their elongated and thin body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-nesting-habits">**3. **<strong>Nesting Habits</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Although all bees live in colonies, their nesting habits vary from one species to another. Honeybees make their nests in voids found on walls or tree hollows. A typical honeybee colony can hold up to 10,000 bees.
On the other hand, bumblebees live in underground burrows, especially those abandoned by burrowing animals. They live in colonies of hundreds of bees.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps build nests using a paper-like substance, which they give out after chewing wood fiber. These nests appear as open-end hexagonal cells similar to honeycombs.
Wasp nests can be found under sheltered building eaves, tree branches, open pipes, and in places like garage and attics. The location of nests depends on the wasp species. While mud daubers prefer building nests in higher areas,
<a href="http://naturemappingfoundation.org/natmap/facts/yellow_jacket_712.html">yellow jackets</a>
will build nests on the ground.
Wasp nest can be as small as a golf ball and grow to as large as football or even bigger. Enormous nests of up to 15000 wasps have been found in Alabama.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/hornet-nest-removal/">Hornet removal</a>
appear as paper-like substances with a grayish color. However, unlike the bee and wasp nests, they are oval-shaped. They construct their nests overhanging from higher places like trees, chimneys, outside buildings, poles, etc.
A hornet nest starts as a small piece but can grow to the size of a basketball.

<h3 id="4-diet-and-feeding">**4. **<strong>Diet and Feeding</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
A bees diet mainly entails pollen and nectar. Since they crave sweet food, they also feed on sweet juices such as those found in fruits and soft drinks. Thats why you might see bees hovering around during your outdoor parties or treats.
The worker bees do the work of collecting nectar and pollen and bringing it to the nests for the rest of the colony.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps forage for their food among invertebrates such as flies, spiders, ants, caterpillars, and other small insects. Some are omnivorous and will feed on honeydew, nectar, and fallen fruits.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are omnivorous  they feed on sugary plant foods such as tree sap and rotting fruits. Theyre also predators of small insects such as flies, among others.</p>
<h3 id="5-aggressiveness">**5. **<strong>Aggressiveness</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Bees are less aggressive than both wasps and hornets - but
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353869">can sting</a>
. Bees will not sting you unless they feel threatened or when defending their nests. But unlike wasps and hornets, they have barbed stingers which bite only once.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps are more aggressive than bees but not as aggressive as hornets. Like others in the Vespidae family, they can sting several times, each time withdrawing their stinger from the victim.
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/wasp-sting">Wasps may also sting</a>
-�they usually sting when provoked or defending their nests.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are very quick at stinging. They will sting at the slightest provocation. They belong to the Vespidae family, whose stingers are not barbed. That means they can sting several times because of the ability to withdraw their stinger.
A hornet sting inflicts a lot of pain and can sometimes lead to fatal allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>
<h3 id="6-nest-behavior">**6. **<strong>Nest Behavior</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
A bee nest consists of the queen, female workers, and the male drones. The queen lays eggs while the drones do the work of mating with the queen. Female workers are responsible for housekeeping, gathering food, protection, and feeding larvae.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Most of the wasp species live a solitary life. In this case, mature females dig or construct nests near food sources to live and lay eggs. A few species exhibit a social behavior where they live as a community. These include yellow jackets and paper wasps.
A colony of social wasps mainly entails the queen and the female workers. Males leave the hive immediately after mating and die due to dehydration. Mating occurs in summer, where the females hibernate only to start new colonies in spring. New males for the next mating season emerge from the unfertilized eggs.
Female workers are tasked with all communal work, including gathering food, housekeeping, feeding the larvae, and protecting the colony.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
At the center of a hornet hive is the queen, whose sole function is to lay eggs for reproduction. The seemingly few males in the nest only do mating and will die soon after mating.
Female hornets perform daily communal jobs such as getting food, building the nest, protection, and feeding the larvae.

<h3 id="locate-the-nest"><strong>Locate the Nest</strong></h3>
<p>If you have been stung several times or suspect you have stinging insects, begin by investigating whether theres a nest around. Common areas where stinging insects construct nests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tree branches</li>
<li>Stacked wood</li>
<li>Utility or fence poles</li>
<li>Anything hollow, including pipes and wood</li>
<li>Underneath the roof awnings or canopy</li>
<li>Underground burrows</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identify-the-insect"><strong>Identify the Insect</strong></h3>
<p>It is important to know which of the three stinging insects youre dealing with. Thats because not all of them pose a threat to your family. For instance, a bee nest in the garden can be left out since it doesnt pose a big threat. Bees are not only less provocative but are also useful in pollinating flowering plants in the compound.
The above comparison will help you identify the insects with ease. In case you have difficulties in identification, you can contact an expert. Correct identification enables you to

<ul>
<li>If youre not sure about your reaction to stings, get an allergy test from your doctor. Do not continue with the removal of the test is positive. Call an exterminator.</li>
<li>Whether youre an expert or a novice in removing stinging insects, ensure you wear protective clothing. Wear long pants, boots, a long-sleeved hoodie, gloves, protective glasses, a scarf, and a heart.</li>
<li>In case of an emergency, you need someone to give you first aid. So ensure theres someone to do that. Also, plan an escape route in case the mission fails.</li>
<li>Nowspray the ant nest with an insecticideof your choice. Be sure to get one that is labeled wasps, bees, or hornets. Also, ensure the product you get is a jet spray. This allows you to spray nests that are more than 10 feet high. The best time to remove these insects is after dusk or at dawn.</li>
<li>Best results will be achieved if you spray a solid jet directly into the nest entrance and any other opening.</li>
<li>If the nest is in a high place, dont stay directly below the nest. You might sustain stings from falling insects.</li>
<li>After spraying, stay away from the area for one day. Afterward, you can remove and discard the nest if therere no signs of insect activity.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://extension.unh.edu/resources/files/Resource000532_Rep554.pdf">control these wasps</a>
.</p>
<p>Could be you have come across Fake Wasps Nests  a perfect designed, non-toxic wasps trap that lure the wasps into death chamber.� So, my question is, do fake wasps nests work?
**Yes! Fake Wasps Nests are designed in a shape that resembles the own wasps made nest. The wasps are tricked to think that there are already existing wasps in the territory. **
<strong>The human-made decoy fools the wasps to fly into the chamber where they get trapped and killed through suffocation.</strong>
Lets get into details.</p>
<h2 id="do-fake-wasps-nests-actually-work">Do Fake Wasps Nests Actually Work?</h2>
<p>YES! Fake Wasps Nest work by fooling wasps into their chambers. They are tricked to think that there are some existing wasps in the Fake Wasps Nests.</p>
<p>Then, the wasps will fly into the chamber where they get stuck and killed by suffocation  you can even remove wasps while alive (this depends on what the fake wasps nest was made for).</p>
<p>The walls of internal chamber of Fake Wasps Nests is reinforce with sticky substance (e.g. glue) that help trap the flying wasps on contact.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Fake Wasps Nest has a doom shaped interior that offers an ample space to accommodate large number of wasps awaiting death. In addition, the Fake Wasps Nests has a narrow entrance at the bottom, which makes it difficult for the wasps to fly out.</p>
<p>The idea of trapping and killing wasps using Fake Wasps Nests is brilliant though highly affected by wasps behavior of life  they prefer living in their own made wasps nest.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-fake-wasp-nest">What is a Fake <a href="/posts/baby-wasp/">Wasp</a> Nest?</h2>
<p>Fake wasps nest is a product/repellent designed to fool the wasps into them. It resemble the actual wasps nest though the material used in making it may differ slightly.</p>
<p>This product operate by trapping the wasps within its chambers. The human made decoy intends to trick wasps to believe that some wasps live in the territory.</p>
<p>The fooled wasps, then, flew in where they get stuck. The Fake Wasps nest may kill wasps by suffocation or allow them to die naturally  this is determined by the purpose for which the fake wasps nest was made.</p>
<p>Fake wasps nests are small in size. They are highly portable and can be hung at different points within your house or compound.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-fake-wasps-nest-in-your-placehome">What is the purpose of Fake wasps nest in your place/home?</h2>
<p>Wasps lives in colonies within your home or compound. They can harm your humans or animals if disturbed at any point. In fact, wasps are no go zone. Unlike bees, they sting repetitively without losing their lives.</p>
<p>Fake wasps nest are supposed to eliminate these insects in a peaceful way. To realize this, the wasps are expected to fly into the Fake Wasps Nest where they get trapped and killed.</p>
<p>This method is a simple way of ensuring that you do not cause commotion in wasps hideouts during eradication.�It is risky to allow wasps infestation in your home/compound/place  they multiply relatively fast posting threats to the occupants.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-fake-wasps-nest-ineffective">What makes Fake Wasps Nest Ineffective?</h2>
<p>The Fake Wasps Nest may not be as effective as you might expect. This is attributed mainly by the behavior of different species of wasps. Research shows that, most wasps do not like living in artificial Fake Wasps Nests. Instead, they prefer to build their own wasps nests.</p>
<p>Though some research showed that wasps could get into the Fake Wasps Nest and live, the number was quite small. You may also find some wasps building their own wasps nest inside the Fake wasps nest  this is a clear indicator that the fake wasps nests are not effective enough.</p>
<p>In some cases, Wasps would build their nest just adjacent to Fake Wasps Nest. Actually. there is a strong bond that lay between the wasps and their own made nests  thats why they often return to them even after you chase them away.</p>
<h2 id="could-the-purchased-fake-wasp-nests-be-more-effective">Could the Purchased Fake Wasp Nests be More Effective?</h2>
<p>The most important thing to consider in a Fake Wasps Nest is the principle of operation. The fact that the artificial idea of fooling wasps into their death cage is ineffective, tells you that any fake wasps nest will yield similar results.</p>
<p>Your purchased Fake Wasps Nests may be more appealing than the homemade option. However, the killing/trapping idea is already incorrect or inefficient.</p>
<p>Importantly, the wasps are not attracted by the color or quality of your fake wasps nest  they have the inborne attraction to their own made nests.</p>
<p>You must opt for suitable alternatives if you endeavor to experience great impact in wasps eradication.</p>
<h2 id="what-make-people-feel-that-fake-wasps-nest-would-work">What make people feel that Fake Wasps Nest would Work?</h2>
<p>Definitely! People think that since most species of wasps live in territorials, then, it is easier for them to soothe wasps into a decoy Fake Wasps Nests. In the ideal situations, its not the case. Most wasps have ways of making decisions and implementing them.</p>
<p>In case a swam of wasps want to migrate, they do a thorough investigations on any Fake Wasps Nest or place before relocating.</p>
<p>Wasps, rarely shift to other places  they may even take a year or more before moving to a new nest.</p>
<p>Sometimes, wasps nest may not necessarily be on the roof or somewhere hanging  many wasp species tend to build their nests on or within the grounds where you may not see them. Hanging Fake Wasps Nests wont work for these species of wasps.</p>
<p>In most scenarios, people think that presence of flying wasps within their compound calls for wasps infestation in the area. This may not be the case. These wasps may be on patrol searching for food source or new place to inhabit. Setting Fake Wasps Nests basing on such occurrence will be a waste of time and resource.</p>
<p>You must continuously monitor the wasps occurrences in case you notice some in your vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="can-wasps-re-use-their-own-made-nest">Can Wasps Re-Use Their Own Made Nest?</h2>
<p>No! In the real life, wasps wont opt to go for their old abandoned nest. Naturally, during winter, most of male wasps die due to advance weather conditions.</p>
<p>The queen is, then, forced to leave and search for a new place to hibernate until summer.�During the following year, the wasps would build other nests in their new location, abandoning their previous nests completely.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the queen may return to the old place but wont live in the old nest. Instead, the queen wasps would make a new nest near to the old one and begin to breed. This behavior tell you that the Fake Wasps Nests may not be an option for the wasps on return thus rendering them ineffective.</p>
<p>Research shows that there are very few cases where wasps re-use their own made nests. Though this may occur, it is not something you can rely on when setting up you Fake Wasps Nest.</p>
<p>It is advisable that you remove all abandoned wasps nest in your house - they may act as attractants of future wasps re-infestations in your home. These abandoned nests may also house some eggs or young wasps, which may be left to develop and mature during the winter period.</p>
<h2 id="which-wasps-control-methods-do-work">Which Wasps Control Methods Do Work?</h2>
<p>Though wasps control may not be achieve efficiently through use of Fake Wasps Nests, its necessary to try it in different places/points. However, if you realize that it doesnt yield much, you can opt for some of the alternative given below:</p>
<h3 id="1-use-alternative-wasps-traps">1. Use alternative wasps traps</h3>
<p>You can purchase or create your own homemade traps using used items like bottles. In this option, you will need to place a wasps attractants inside the bottle and place it near wasps infestation site.</p>
<p>Close the bottle once the wasps get in. Though tedious, this method works nicely.</p>
<p>You can also make swat trap, which you will swap and kill any flying wasps you spot in your place. This trap may not kill those wasps that do not come from their hideouts.</p>
<h3 id="2-using-wasp-spray">2. Using Wasp Spray</h3>
<p>You can spray the wasps nests directly using the insecticide to kill eggs and adult wasps. Ensure you frequently do this to keep off future infestations. It is necessary to select the best spray for wasps.</p>

Be keen to check whether there are some wasps left in the fallen nest while others flew away. Some wasps may hide within the house and build new nests instead of leaving the entire place.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years back, I bought a Backyard Discovery Wooden Swing Set for my kids. I spent like 2 days putting it together in our backyard. It was a task on its own.</p>
<p>Recently I noticed wasps around the playset and I think they are getting out of hand. I can call it a Wasps infestation of some sort. The wasps have made my childrens swing set their home.</p>
<p>Our kids are scared to death to play on the playset. So, how do we keep Wasps Away from the swingset?</p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-wasps-away-from-playsets">How to Keep Wasps Away from Playsets</h2>
<ol>

</ol>
<ul>

<li>** Maintaining Cleanliness **</li>
<li>** Pesticides**</li>
<li><strong>Calling an exterminator</strong>
*Note: wasps prefer to build their nests in *
<em>crevices</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>and in dark warm areas. On your kids&rsquo; playset, these areas may include inside the playhouse, climber*
**, **
<em>swings, slides, on the roof of the playhouse, among other areas. The wasps can literally attack any section of the playset and find a perfect resting point. This can be dangerous for you and your kids.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-how-do-you-keep"><strong>So, How Do You Keep <strong><strong>Wasps</strong></strong> off- Details</strong></h2>
<p>Well, I did some research online to find out what other people with wasp infestation are doing to end the menace. �I will discuss the methods I used plus those that other people have used and seen success.</p>
<h3 id="1-natural-insect-pest-control">1. Natural Insect Pest Control</h3>
<p>Use the following natural methods to repel wasp invasion.
<strong>a) Use Herbs</strong>
You may decide to plant herbal plants in your backyard, outdoor sitting area, or around the patio. Wasps dont like plants with aroma. Therefore, planting things like thyme, eucalyptus, citronella, among others can help in repelling wasps.
<strong>b) A mix of vinegar, salt &amp; sugar</strong>
A solution of vinegar, salt, and sugar will work wonders. This solution attracts wasps and they get stuck inside the solution for wasps-free playsets. �Youll need a cup of vinegar, 4 tablespoons of sugar, and 4 tablespoons of salt.
<strong>c) Detergent, Tap Water, &amp; Peppermint extract</strong>
Fill tap water in your regular spray bottle; add a cup of any liquid detergent, then add about 20 drops of peppermint extract. This solution is effective at eliminating wasps.</p>
<h3 id="2-fake-wasps-nest">2. Fake Wasps Nest</h3>
<p>After going through various reviews online about using Fake Wasps Nest, I decided to try the method. Well, I mounted two Fake Wasps Nests on the playset and another two in the backyard. I tried to plant them in such a way that my sons wont touch or play with them.</p>
<p>The beauty about these decoy wasp nests is that they fool the wasps into believing that the territory is already taken. Therefore, they move to some other place to build their nests.</p>
<p>These nests trick the wasps into believing that other wasps have already settled into that specific region. Since wasps are territorial in nature, they cant settle where other wasps are present. So they end up moving away.</p>
<p>I bought a ready-made wasp nest from Amazon. However, you can make one yourself. Its pretty simple. �Take brown paper and crumple it. Fill this brown bag with other papers to make it gain more volume. Hang it on your playset and wait for the results.</p>
<h3 id="3-use-wasp-and-hornet-spray">3. Use Wasp and Hornet Spray</h3>
<p>Wasp and Hornet Spray are effective at eliminating wasps. I at one time used the wasp spray on my wooden deck. The wasps had built nests and you could see them flying around. I sprayed the nests thoroughly and killed the wasp population on my deck.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-of-chemicals">4. Use of chemicals</h3>
<p>Some people online claim to have used Break fluid, WD40, and Gasoline to eliminate wasps infestation. Most reported positive results. Nevertheless, I cant verify the truthiness of these claims. I havent used the chemicals yet.</p>
<p>However, if youre going to use either of these chemicals on your kids playset ensure that they dont come into contact with them.</p>
<h3 id="5-pesticides">5. Pesticides</h3>
<p>The use of pesticides to control wasps is another effective method you may consider using for eliminating wasps. Most people love the efficiency and effectiveness of pesticides to kill wasps.</p>
<p>However, some pesticides are extremely dangerous to the environment. Pesticides can also be hazardous to children, pets, and the person applying them.</p>
<p>Therefore, before using pesticides consider using natural wasp control methods that dont have any negative effect on the environment.</p>
<h3 id="6-call-an-exterminator">6. Call an Exterminator</h3>
<p>I remember one of my colleagues had a serious wasp infestation in his backyard. He sought the services of an exterminator who charged him 32$. So, every time he sees wasps he just calls the exterminator.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you feel overwhelmed, you can contact your local pest exterminator to do the work for you. The good part is that most exterminators eradicate everything including bees, rats, wasps, etc.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-wasps-from-invading-your-space">How to Prevent Wasps from Invading Your Space</h2>
<p>So how do you prevent the wasps from building their nests on the playsets or any other place in your backyard? Prevention is better than cure, thus, do the following.</p>
<h3 id="maintain-cleanliness">Maintain Cleanliness</h3>
<p>Ensure that you do regular cleaning around your backyard to prevent wasp invasion. Pick up fallen leaves, twigs, and dead branches and dispose of them properly.</p>
<p>Empty your garbage cans regularly and ensure they remain clean by washing them after each garbage disposal. Put the lid on at all times to keep off insects and wasps.</p>
<h3 id="remove-food-sources">Remove Food Sources</h3>
<p>Food and water attract wasps. Therefore, train your children to thoroughly clean after they are through with playing. They should not leave foods, juices, or even fruits in the playset.</p>
<p>Ensure that the backyard has no leftover foods maybe from picnic scraps; pet food, etc. also, cover the garbage cans properly.</p>
<h3 id="seal-entry-points">Seal Entry Points</h3>
<p>If you start noticing wasps in your backyard, playset, or any other place in the compound, its possible that wasps have built a dwelling. I recommend that you take action immediately. Seal off all their entry points.</p>
<p>You can do this by carefully observing the wasps activity plus the paths they use. This way youll know their exit and entry point. Start sealing off their flight path, all cracks on the frames of windows or doors.</p>
<p>You can even put some of the natural solutions for wasp control weve discussed above to get rid of them completely.</p>
<h3 id="replace-the-playset-roof-with-a-lightweight-mesh-canvas">Replace the Playset Roof with A Lightweight Mesh Canvas</h3>
<p>Wasps flourish well in warm and dark places. The roofing of the playhouse in most playsets is usually thick vinyl roof canvas. You can replace the roofing of the playhouse with roofing that allows light inside the playhouse.</p>
<p>I replaced the solid vinyl roof canvas that the playset had come with with a heavy-duty vinyl mesh canvas. This new roofing allows natural light and air into the set.</p>
<h2 id="diy-wasp-traps-for-backyard-playsets">DIY Wasp Traps for Backyard Playsets</h2>
<p>You can also make your own wasps trap using readily available material. These materials wont cost anything. Read on for easy DIYs on homemade wasp trap</p>
<h3 id="paper-wasp-trap">Paper Wasp Trap</h3>
<p>The idea behind this DIY Paper Wasp Trap is to come up with fake wasp nests using paper bags. Its pretty simple, I will also include a video to make the process much easier for you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you need a brown paper bag, scrunch it, add some paper bags inside to add more volume, tie the top part with a string and hang wasp traps in places where wasps like to frequent.</p>
<p>Apparently, wasps are territorial in nature, so they dont invade places already occupied by another wasps population. With this fake wasps trap, these annoying creatures will move to another place to build their nests.</p>
<h3 id="soda-bottle-wasp-trap">Soda Bottle Wasp Trap</h3>
<p>Another effective DIY method that you can easily make at the convenience of your house is the Soda Bottle Wasp Trap. This wasp trap requires a 2 liters soda water bottle or any other clear bottle you can find.</p>
<p>Cut off the top of the bottle. Try to approximate a quarter from the top and cut the bottle to create a funnel-like shape.</p>
<p>Insert the funnel upside down. The mouth of the funnel should be inside the body of the bottle. Secure the sides properly and seal off any gaps.</p>
<p>Pour any sweetener inside the bottle; you could add honey, wine, or other sugary substance that you can find. Sugary foods attract wasps and theyll be drawn to the bottle by the sweet scent. Once they climb inside, theyll be trapped inside the bottle.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now know How to keep wasps away from playsets. Ensure that you try the natural methods first before reaching out to chemicals or pesticides. As much as we are trying to keep off wasps, we should conserve our environment and make it safe for not only ourselves but also our kids, pets, and other people.</p>

<li><strong>Seal Entry Points</strong>:- <strong>Check Regularly</strong>: Conduct routine inspections of your home to find and seal potential entry points for wasps. This includes gaps around windows and doors, cracks in walls, and spaces around utility lines.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Caulk and Sealants</strong>: Seal any cracks or holes using high-quality caulk or other appropriate sealants. Ensure window screens and door sweeps are in good repair.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Remove Food Sources</strong>:- <strong>Proper Storage</strong>: Store food in airtight containers. Wasps are particularly attracted to sweet foods, so ensure that these are securely stored.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cleanliness</strong>: Maintain a clean environment by wiping down surfaces and cleaning up spills immediately. Wasps are less likely to linger if there are no food residues.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Properly Store Garbage</strong>:- <strong>Sealed Bins</strong>: Use garbage cans with tight-fitting lids. Wasps are attracted to rotting food and sugary residues found in garbage.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Disposal</strong>: Dispose of trash regularly to avoid<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/baby-wasp/">attracting wasps</a>. Rinse out any recyclable containers that held food or drinks.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Regular Maintenance</strong>:- <strong>Inspections</strong>: Perform regular checks around your home and property for early signs of wasp activity. The earlier you spot potential nests, the easier it is to deal with them.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yard Care</strong>: Keep your yard clean and free of debris where wasps might build nests. Trim bushes and trees regularly.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Plant Wisely</strong>:- <strong>Avoid Attractants</strong>: Avoid planting sweet-smelling flowers and fruit trees near entrances to your home. If you do have these plants, try to keep them away from areas where you spend a lot of time.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repellent Plants</strong>: Consider planting wasp-repellent plants such as eucalyptus, mint, and citronella around your home. These plants can help deter wasps naturally.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Use Wasp Deterrents</strong>:- <strong>Commercial Products</strong>: Use wasp traps and deterrent sprays available in the market. These can be effective in reducing the number of wasps in your vicinity.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>DIY Solutions</strong>: Create homemade wasp traps using sugar water or vinegar traps. These can be placed around your yard to catch and kill wasps.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Visual Inspection</strong>:- <strong>Common Areas</strong>: Look for nests in typical locations such as under eaves, in attics, garages, sheds, or in hollow trees. Wasps prefer sheltered spots that protect them from the elements.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hidden Spots</strong>: Check less obvious places too, like under porch roofs, behind shutters, or in outdoor furniture.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Nest Appearance</strong>:- <strong>Material</strong>: Wasp nests are usually made from chewed wood fibers mixed with saliva, creating a paper-like substance. This gives the nests a distinctive papery texture.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shape and Size</strong>: Nests can vary greatly in shape and size. Some may look like small, open umbrellas, while others may be large and spherical.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Wasps Behavior</strong>:- <strong>Flight Patterns</strong>: Observe the flight patterns of wasps around your home. If you notice wasps frequently flying to and from a specific area, it&rsquo;s likely there is a nest nearby.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggressiveness</strong>: Be cautious if wasps seem particularly aggressive or territorial in certain areas, as this often indicates a nearby nest.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Types of Nests</strong>:- <strong>Paper Wasps</strong>: These nests are typically open and umbrella-shaped, with a single comb of cells visible. They are often found hanging from eaves or branches.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow Jackets</strong>: Yellow jacket nests are usually enclosed and can be found in the ground, wall voids, or attics. These nests can grow quite large.</li>
<li><strong>Hornets</strong>: Hornet nests are typically large, enclosed, and spherical. They are often found in trees, large shrubs, or on structures like sheds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dealing-with-nests">Dealing with Nests</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Early Removal</strong>:- <strong>Small Nests</strong>: If you<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/difference-between-a-bee-and-a-wasps-nest/">catch a nest early</a>, you can often remove it using a stick or a broom. Do this during the early morning or late evening when wasps are less active.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>: Always attempt nest removal during cooler parts of the day, as wasps are less aggressive and slower in lower temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Protective Gear</strong>:- <strong>Wear Protection</strong>: When dealing with larger nests, wear protective clothing to prevent stings. This includes long sleeves, gloves, and a hat with a net.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emergency Plan</strong>: Have an emergency plan in place in case of multiple stings, especially if you or someone in your household is allergic.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Insecticides</strong>:- <strong>Choosing the Right Product</strong>: Use wasp-specific insecticides and follow the manufacturers instructions carefully. There are foaming sprays that can reach nests in high or hard-to-reach places.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: Apply the insecticide during the evening when wasps are in the nest. Ensure you spray the entrance thoroughly to kill wasps as they enter and exit.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Professional Help</strong>:- <strong>When to Call Experts</strong>: For large nests or if you have an allergy to stings, it is best to contact a professional pest control service. Professionals have the experience and equipment to remove nests safely.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety Assurance</strong>: Hiring a professional ensures the job is done safely and effectively, reducing the risk of stings and further infestations.
By following these steps, you can minimize the risk of wasp infestations and handle nests safely and effectively. Regular vigilance and prompt action are key to keeping your home and surroundings wasp-free.</li>

<h2 id="details-how-to-identify-a-queen-wasp">Details: How to Identify a Queen Wasp</h2>
<p>A Queen Wasp is a mature (adult) female wasp that has been treated specially by worker wasps (female) and is assigned the role of laying eggs and raising a new generation of wasp.</p>
<p>The queen wasp, therefore, mates with drones (male wasps from other nests) for the entire of its life and it is mandated to raise new queens who would in turn raise new colonies elsewhere.</p>
<p>To identify the Queen wasp, you can look for the following features, sign or traits in a given wasp nest:
<strong>1. Shape and size</strong>
Normally, Queen Wasp is larger than any female wasp (worker) or drone (male) in any given wasp nest. The large size is due to special meals fed to the Queen Wasp, which also makes it acquire hormones that boosts its growth.</p>
<p>The shape of the queen wasp is round and elongated. Its chest protrudes slightly as compared to other wasps.�The triangular-shaped head of Queen Wasp and a distinctive waist having a sharp pointed stinger gives it a clear identification.
<em>NB: It is only female wasps (even the queen) that have stingers, which they use for self-defense.</em>
<strong>2. Color</strong>
The Queen Wasp may be yellow, brown, metallic blue or red. Some species of wasp has a queen which has black and white stripped abdomen  these colors are brighter than that of other wasps within the nest.
<strong>3. Winter Appearance</strong>
Most of the worker wasps and drones die before winter due to fall in temperature. The Queen Wasp migrates and hibernates in a new place waiting to lay eggs. This is clear that any wasp you will see during the winter season must be a Queen wasp. You can see them if you visit any wasp nest in your area.
<strong>4.�Movement</strong>
Normally, the Queen wasps do not move about in the colonies of wasps. It remains in a given cell where worker wasps feed it. You will see worker wasps moving back and forth at a given point where they could be feeding the Queen wasp. Moreover, the Queen could be surrounded by new young wasps for mother care.
<strong>5. Security</strong>
The Queen cell is given tight security by the female workers. You will notice, in any wasp nest, that there are wasps that surround a given area and seem not to leave  this could be one of the cells having the queen wasp.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-a-wasp-become-queen">How Does a Wasp Become Queen?</h2>
<p>The journey of the wasp to becoming the future queen begins when the mother queen mates with the drones just before winter. Then, the mother queen leaves the wasp nest to new place where it hibernates.</p>
<p>The laid eggs hatch to larvae in wasps nest cells from where they are fed by the queen using its chews.�These larva are expected to mature and become female wasps (workers).</p>
<p>However, the larvae that will become the new queen is specially fed by the mother queen. The research shows that, the new queen larvae contains more proteins that other larva and that it is usually larger.</p>
<p>On reaching maturity, the female wasps in the first generation are assigned job of building the new nests, feeding the next generation larvae and beefing security in the nest.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Female Wasp that is expected to be a new queen is not given much work and is overfed further.</p>
<p>It is believed that, through the help of the mother Queen wasp, the female wasps selects one of their own to be the new queen of that nest. There is no scientific facts accorded to this belief.</p>
<p>Once the new queen achieves full maturity, the mother leaves the nest and goes to die away or it remains in an individual cell until it dies while the newly crowned queen wasp takes over the leadership role.</p>
<p>The New workers works collaboratively and submissively to achieve every assignment given by the new queen even if they were of same age and generation.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-queen-european-wasp-look-like">How does the Queen European Wasp Look Like?</h2>
<p>This species of wasps is slightly small. The workers feeds the queen until it acquire a triangular shape after which its given the leadership mantle. The queen is approximately 2 cm long when fully grown.</p>
<p>The body of Queen European Wasp is bright yellow in color with black triangular stripes that runs to the tip of the abdomen. The wings incompletely cover the queens abdomen.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-kill-a-queen-wasp-in-a-wasp-nest">Should I kill a Queen Wasp in a Wasp Nest?</h2>
<p>If you intend to eliminate a wasp colony, killing the queen is a brilliant option. We know that the queen is mandated with a role of laying eggs and raising new generation for its entire life. Some people use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-wasp-fogger/">wasp foggers</a>
.</p>
<p>However, you will have to know the time at which you intend to kill the queen. As winter approach, the queen wasp leaves its nest after raising a number of generations to maturity.</p>
<p>Queen hibernates in the new place where it lays its eggs and broods. It is the work of queen to feed the first generation of larvae until they mature. In case you kill the queen at this stage, the larvae will dies of hunger thus preventing the wasp nest from spreading.</p>
<p>This brings to an end the entire infestation of wasp. Killing the Queen Wasp when the first generation has matured wont work since any of the worker can be selected and become the next queen wasp.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-where-are-you-likely-to-see-the-queen-wasp">When and where are you likely to see the Queen Wasp?</h2>
<p>Queen Wasps are much protected insects in the Wasp colonies. They rarely move around as compared to workers or drones. It is expected that the Queen Wasp will remain in its cell for its entire life while workers would offer it food and continued security.</p>
<p>However, it may not the case. This is because; change of weather, brooding requirement as well as surveillance may force the Queen Wasp to move out.</p>
<p>You will expect to see Queen Wasp at the end of Spring and beginning of winter. This is the time when the Queen Wasp is looking for a place to hibernate. This movement may not be frequent.</p>
<p>The best time to see the Queen Wasp is at the end of summer and beginning of spring. This is the time the Queen Wasp fly around looking for drone to mate with (Queen Wasp does not mate with drone within its nest  this prevents inbreeding and helps in transfer of gene- hybrid vigor).</p>
<p>You will find the Queen Wasp in gardens, meadows, parks or in woodland. It becomes more vibrant during spring due to the slight fall in temperature that favor mating.</p>
<p>Also, you may slightly see Queen Wasp during end of Autumn and early summer since this is the time it build nest and lay drone eggs, which mature during the summer period. The last egg laid at the end of the summer is usually fertilized purposely to raise a new queen.</p>

<h2 id="are-queen-wasps-be-aggressive">Are Queen Wasps be aggressive?</h2>
<p>Yes! The Queen Wasp and female wasps contain stinger. In case the Queen Wasp detects any danger, it becomes very aggressive. It will command its soldiers (workers) to attach the enemies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Queen Wasp will even come out of comfort zone and join its army in stinging you. The sting from wasp is very painful. Unlike bee sting, Queen Wasp can sting you severally at a single point without dying.</p>
<p>The Queen Wasp can also be aggressive in case you attacks its nest or disturb its growing Baby Wasp. Importantly, the Queen Wasp will sting even when in hibernation.</p>
<p>Hornets and Yellowjackets are the most aggressive species. They even sting your clothes and face protection severally without giving up.</p>
<h2 id="do-hornets-have-queen-wasp">Do Hornets Have Queen Wasp?</h2>
<p>Yes! Hornets, like any other species of wasp, lives communally in wasp nest. They have one Queen Wasp whose role is to lay eggs, train the female workers and breed new generations of wasps.</p>
<p>Hornet Queens build a new nest by chewing wood to form a pulp that forms a papery structure with multiple cells in each chamber.</p>
<h2 id="do-wasps-have-one-queen-in-each-nest">Do Wasps Have One Queen in Each Nest?</h2>
<p>Each Colony of Wasps has only one Queen Wasp at a time. It is not possible to have two Queen Wasps in a given wasp nest. In case two female wasps mature to be queens (which is a rare case) then, one must leave with given number of wasps in that nest and build another wasp nest in a different location.</p>
<p>The only possible allowable time when the colony of wasp may have two queen wasps is when the mother queen wasp is nurturing the new young queen. This does not last for long since the mother queen leaves the nest to die away or passes the responsibilities to new queen and rests in one of the cells in the nest until it dies.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-queen-wasps-build-wasp-nests">How Do Queen Wasps Build Wasp Nests?</h2>
<p>The task of building the first wasp nest is left to Queen Wasp. It can build the nest wasp on the leaves, branches, overhangs, roofs, underground or woods.</p>
<p>Usually, the Queen Wasp uses the wood as raw material. It chews the wood and turns it into wood pulp.</p>
<p>The wasp nest building process begins by Queen Wasp selecting the best place to build it (roof, log, wood, ground or drawer).Using its mouth, The Queen Wasp digs the wood.</p>
<p>Then, it chews the wooden material thus mixing it with its saliva to form a soft paper pulp. It then flies to the site it want to build the nest.</p>
<p>It then, forms hexagonal cells in various chamber. The Queen will enlarge the size of the wasp nest until it suites the number of eggs it intend to lay. At times, the Queen Wasp may build the wasp nest with help of the first generation workers so as to train them.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-queen-wasps-can-as-a-single-wasp-nest-produce">How Many Queen Wasps Can as a Single Wasp Nest Produce?</h2>
<p>The Queen Wasp will lay about 500 to 1500 fertilize eggs that hatch into larvae, pupate and mature to female wasps. Among these adult wasps, one is specially treated to become the queen wasp of the nest.</p>
<p>Then, the mother Queen migrates to establish another colony elsewhere. The new queen left in the old nest will bring up the new wasp generation, then leave to look for mate and create new colonies.</p>
<p>All the Fertilize eggs laid by the Queen Wasp has equal chance of becoming a queen once treated selectively by the Queen Wasp or the Workers.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-queen-wasp-leave-wasp-nest">Why Do Queen Wasp Leave Wasp Nest?</h2>
<p>Normally, Queen Wasp will leave the nest in search of place to hibernate or build a new nest.</p>
<p>Also, the Queen Wasp may leave the nest in search of drones to mate with (it does not mate with drones in the same nest).</p>
<p>The Queen Wasp can hibernate in places such as back of trees, in the ground, under the roof or in the woods.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-queen-wasps-eat">What Do Queen Wasps Eat?</h2>
<p>The Queen Wasp usually feeds on flower nectar, small insects (larvae), aphids, arachnids (mainly spider) or fallen fruits.</p>
<p>The Queen Wasp is mainly fed with proteins by the workers to help it lay fertile eggs and also build its body for future breeding.</p>
<h2 id="can-queen-wasp-live-without-food">Can Queen Wasp Live Without Food?</h2>
<p>During hibernation, Queen Wasp is sustained by the food it ate during the springtime. However, the Queen Wasp is able to store some of the food in its nest where it feed on it intermittently during the hibernation.</p>
<p>Normally, the Queen Wasp can stay without food for 20 to 100 days. It is usually in active dormancy.�Other wasps such as workers and drones can only survive between 11 to 23 days without food.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Queen Wasp is a female wasp that has been treated specially by the workers and assigned the role of breeding wasp generations for its entire lifetime.</p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to notice the Queen Wasp in a given wasp nest, you can identify it by size and color. Queen Wasp is normally larger than other wasps in the wasp nest.</p>
<p>The Queen Wasp rarely move and is surrounded by worker wasp to beef security. It can have red, metallic blue, yellow, black or mixture of these colors too.</p>
<p>However, the colors are brighter as compared to those for drones and workers. Queen Wasp will move out of its nest when searching for mate or place to hibernate and breed.</p>
