  <div class="post-content"><p>The Challenge of removing old paints on different surfaces is a frequent thing of every day-to-day life. Often, people have devised many options to clean paints while others are still stuck.
Perhaps you have used mineral spirits or have seen someone use it and wonders which other things can it be used for. Can mineral spirits kill germs, insects, or bleach paint?</p>
<p><em>Well, YES, the mineral spirit is a petroleum-based compound that works effectively in paint removal. This solvent can also be used in degreasing, removing paint pills, paint prep, thinning paint, and stain removal.</em>
<em>You can also use mineral spirits on surfaces such as automotive lacquer, sealed stones, finished furniture, wooden floor finish, a wood without a wax finish, bathtubs, tile, linoleum, laminated wood, sinks, wet paints as well as metal surface polishing.</em>
<em>Mineral spirits come with numerous advantages such as transparent look, less toxic, less smelly, budget-friendly, more effective, and versatile all-around thinner. See Also: Can Goo Gone Remove Paint?</em></p>
<h2 id="details-do-mineral-spirits-remove-paint">Details: Do Mineral Spirits Remove Paint?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#details-do-mineral-spirits-remove-paint">¶</a></h2>
<p>*The mineral spirit is not suitable for the removal of latex paint (or water-based paints) as it leaves stains behind or leads to incomplete paint removal. *
<em>Further, avoid applying mineral spirit on surfaces such as unfinished wood, naked stones, unpainted walls, leather material, suede, fire points (flammable), and coated glass.</em>
<em>Importantly, ensure that you wear a respirator mask and hand gloves to prevent adverse effects that result from mineral spirit when it comes into contact with your skin.</em></p>
<h3 id="a-active-components-in-mineral-spirits">a. Active Components in mineral Spirits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-active-components-in-mineral-spirits">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mineral spirit is a petroleum-based compound that works effectively in paint removal.
The product integrates a unique structural formulation that breaks and dissolves oil-based paints instantly upon application  its an organic compound (has a carbon base structure).
The solvent features stick-action properties that liquefy paint and thus, forming a thick viscous compound, which can be wiped out easily.
Moreover, the Mineral spirit is highly volatile and evaporates quickly without bleaching or reacting with the surface under paint removal if the right application procedure is followed.
The etching action is achieved in a couple of seconds, while the high degree of activeness allows deep penetration into the dense paint layer.
The transparent properties of mineral spirit make it easier to monitor the area under cover during the application, making it more useful and reliable in the current market.

<h3 id="b-area-of-use--where-to-apply">b. Area of Use  Where to Apply<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#b-area-of-use--where-to-apply">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mineral spirits work for oil-based paints (not for water-based paints) for excellent surface finish.
The solvent dissolves paints on surfaces such as wood without a wax finish, bathtubs, tile, linoleum, laminated wood, sinks, automotive lacquer, sealed stones, finished furniture, wooden floor finish, wet paints as well as metal surface polishing.
Moreover, you can also use mineral spirit in degreasing, removing paint pills, paint preparation, thinning paint, and stain removal without much hassle.
However, the right procedure and administration should be carried out during application (as explained later in this article) to prevent bleaching and staining of the surfaces.
NB: Since the mineral spirit is mainly used for paint thinning, its recommended that you carry out a drop test before you start the application to ascertain the effectiveness of this product over a given surface or given type of paint you intend to clean.</p>

<h3 id="c-concentration-requirements-and-precaution-to-be-observed">c. Concentration Requirements and Precaution to be observed<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#c-concentration-requirements-and-precaution-to-be-observed">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mineral spirit is manufactured in various degrees of concentration. However, this doesnt mean that its activeness is the same in all types of paint thickness. 50% concentration works for thin surfaces and in the removal of fine adhesive without many problems.
However, 70-95% concentration of mineral spirit is needed for the complete removal of a thick layer of the paint surface. Besides, a thick paint layer may require an extra-quantity of spray for significant penetration and paint thinning.
The degree and quantity of use are self-determined according to removal action rate since as you continue to spray over the painted surface, active agents erode the paints instantly, leaving an original clean coating.
During the process of mineral spirits application, it&rsquo;s recommended that you follow some of the precautions highlighted below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding applying mineral spirits near the fireplace  flammable</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose adequately during application  to avoid irritation and chocking</li>
<li>Use mineral spirit for paint removal upon recommended surfaces and paints only</li>
<li>Hand gloves must be won to protect skin from burns or scars in case of contact
If you touch mineral spirits accidentally, wash the affected area with plenty of cold water immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike other paint removers/thinner, the mineral spirit is manufactured specifically for thinning and cleaning oil-based paints only.
Otherwise, you will end up destroying/straining surfaces or material, and to some extent, the product may react with the fabric.
Though most mineral spirits come with user instructions, its important to avoid using them upon materials and surfaces such as unfinished wood, naked stones, unpainted walls, leather material, suede, fire points (flammable), and coated glass.
Indeed, the mineral spirit is not suitable for use in latex paint removal since it leaves stain marks behind or even lead to material corrosion/reaction.
NB: Remember, having the right mineral spirit concentration is vital in achieving an excellent surface finish.</p>

<h3 id="f-side-effects-of-mineral-spirits">f. Side Effects of Mineral Spirits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#f-side-effects-of-mineral-spirits">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mineral spirits require special handling as they have adverse effects on the user if proper precautions are not adhered to. Some of the side effects include:</p>
<ol>
<li>When swallowed or ingested, mineral spirits cause severe throat pain, vomiting, and burn the alimentary canal/digestive system.</li>
<li>When inhales, it may cause a feeling of dizziness, nausea, or breathing difficulties. It leads to a swollen throat or cause thick phlegm clogging.</li>
<li>If confined in a lowly ventilated room, it leads to drowsiness, dizziness, and even one can faint upon inhaling.
Mineral spirits cause skin irritation, burn, or rashes upon contact. Active agents cause permanent scars if not attended to immediately.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-is-the-best-substitute-for-mineral-spirits-in-paint-removal">What is the Best Substitute for Mineral Spirits in Paint Removal?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-the-best-substitute-for-mineral-spirits-in-paint-removal">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following are some of the best alternatives for mineral spirits in paint removal.</p>
<h3 id="1-denatured-alcohol">1. Denatured alcohol<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-denatured-alcohol">¶</a></h3>
<p>Just like mineral spirits, denatured alcohol removes dry or wet paint by dissolving it into a semi-liquid state, which is easily cleaned in a couple of minutes after etching.
This product works effectively for water-based paint and latex paint removal. You will effectively clean surfaces such as rooftops, walls, containers, car bodies, walls, furniture tops, and wet floors.
Denatured alcohol compound contains about 70% to 90% ethyl, which breaks stains and paint structure instantly.
However, you will have to prepare the right concentrate before application. Unfortunately, denature alcohol may not work for surfaces such as unsealed surfaces, unfinished surfaces, aluminum, leather, and wallpapers.</p>
<h3 id="2-acetone">2. Acetone<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-acetone">¶</a></h3>
<p>Acetone, also known as propane (in some regions), is an organic compound (carbon-based) that features a combination of propylene and benzene in its structure.
Its a highly flammable, colorless solvent that is used mainly used in the cosmetic industry for nail polishing, skin defatting, and as a paint thinner.
However, Acetone comes with a strong pungent and irritating odor  respiratory mask or protection is needed during application.
As a solvent, Acetone has a water-base advantage that makes it dissolve/mix with water uniformly.
It removes wet paint/thinner entirely upon application. Moreover, this product can be used in chemical peeling, printing artifacts for vapor polishing, and thinning polyester raisins.</p>
<h3 id="3-turpentine">3. Turpentine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-turpentine">¶</a></h3>
<p>Turpentine is a universal thinning solvent that is extracted from pine tree sap and agitated to an appropriate action degree that works for oil-base paints and latex paint removal.
You can use turpentine for either of the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Degreasing automobile parts</li>
<li>Cleaning tubs and paint thinning</li>
<li>Cleaning painting tools  e.g., paintbrush</li>
<li>Removing gum, stickers, and other adhesive
However, turpentine is highly flammable and comes with a strong pungent smell that makes it less popular as compared to mineral spirits. Therefore, great precautions should be taken into place during application.</li>
</ul>
