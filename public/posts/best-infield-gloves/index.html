It comes with excellent characteristics like a thumb sleeve, kip leather, wool padding, and inner lining made of Pittard&rsquo;s leather.

The glove has Solid Core technology that will enable it to comfort your hand and thus achieve excellent fit and comfort.
20% player break-in
Rawlings Premium Pro PPR1175 has only 20% player break-in, which is considered fair for most infielders in baseball.
