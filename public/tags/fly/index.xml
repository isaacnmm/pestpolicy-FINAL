<dt>Its no secret that most homeowners hate <a href="/posts/best-roach-bait/">cockroaches</a>. Surprisingly, an even larger percentage of the people report that they&rsquo;d fear meeting flying roaches. So, in this post, I&rsquo;ll be answering this question: Can Cockroaches Fly?</dt>
<dt><strong>Summary:�</strong></dt>
<dt>Generally, roaches are not good flyers. But, their flying capability varies with individual roach species and their gender. Most of the roach species have</dt>
<dt>wings, but not all of them can fly</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>Notably, most of the roaches will mainly use the wings in stabilizing themselves while crawling or making simple jumps  please dont confuse this with flying.</dt>
<dt><strong>Side note</strong></dt>
<dd>of the 4000 roach species, just about 40 of them are classified as pests. Choose one of the
top roach killers
that&rsquo;ll help you control most of the pests.

<li>Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach� (Only males can fly)
For Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach, its evident that just the male roaches have the capability to fly. Notably, it very easy to physically confuse the American cockroach with these Pennsylvania wood cockroaches.
The wings of the female Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach are underdeveloped and thus wont fly. However, the male Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach has poorly developed wings and will only fly for short distances.
Further, this roach species tend to be attracted to light sources, such as light bulbs, and tend to fly in that direction.
<strong>4. Smokybrown Cockroach (Males and females are flyers)�</strong>
<strong>Color</strong>
: Smoky brown
<a href="https://entomology.unl.edu/scilit/Urban%20Pest%20Profile-%20Smoky%20Brown%20Roach%20Amanda%20Newton.pdf">Cockroach</a>
has a shiny brown-blackish cover.
<strong>Wings and Length</strong>
: The adult roaches are about 1.25 inches. Smoky brown Cockroach has wings extending over its body and is known to be great flyers.
These roaches mainly jump from upper to lower spots; these pests show great stability when airborne.
They love chimneys and flat rooftops  which is how they can enter your home. Other facts on this roach are that it is nocturnal, and hence youll find it running up and down during the evening hours. Further, these cockroaches have a large body.
Further, youll most likely find these roaches in dark areas or on leaf litter in your homestead, wooded places, or areas that have high humidity. Thus they love tree holes and feed on decaying plants.
<strong>5. Madagascar Hissing Roach (Flightless)�</strong>
<strong>Color</strong>
:�Madagascar Hissing Roach is colored brown.
<strong>Wings and Length</strong>
: This is one of the largest roaches measuring about�2-3 inches.
Madagascar Hissing roaches (originating off Madagascar  the Gromphadorhina portentosa) have no wings and wont fly like other cockroaches discussed above.
But why hissing in its name? Well, this roach produces a hissing sound thats mainly helpful in scaring off any of its predictors.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="at-80-degrees-some-roaches-become-frequent-flyers"><strong>At 80 degrees, Some Roaches become frequent flyers.</strong></h2>
<p>Surprisingly, some roaches fly while trying to hide from the sweltering heat. So besides just crawling up the house drains, roaches might fly to get into your home.
The most common household roaches (the American cockroaches) do not generally fly and dont regularly use their wings.
Further, cold temperatures such as during winter and what you find
down drains and sewers
prevent them from using their flight muscles.
However, if the temperature rises to about 80 degrees and above (like with the summer weather), the American roaches will definitely become regular fliers. The hot weather also tends to increase the roaches metabolism and reproduction capacity, leading to an even higher roach population.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Different roach species have a varied�flying ability. However, roaches are not good flyers.</p>
<p>As noted above, American Cockroaches (both males and females) are good flyers.</p>
<p>However, other roach species may use their wings to glide or jump from higher to lower areas.</p>
