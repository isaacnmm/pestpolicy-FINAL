      <description>Live concerts</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert">Live concerts</a>
have diverse lighting conditions with fast-paced events &amp; excessive flickering or lighting. Thus, you&rsquo;ll require a camera that is very portable, and that offers high power in addition to ISO sensitivity.</p>
<p>Summary: To take exceptional pictures or shoot great videos in concerts, use either
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009B0MZ8U/?tag=p-policy-20">Canon EOS 6D DSLR</a>
or
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I1CPA0O/?tag=p-policy-20">Nikon D5300 24.2 DSLR</a>
as the best camera for concerts.
Otherwise, if you&rsquo;re low on the budget it&rsquo;s allowable to take your mobile phone (even with the basic built-in camera and some
concert earplugs
) to concerts and live shows.</p>
<h2 id="reviews-top-9-best-camera-for-concerts--live-shows-in-2025">Reviews: Top 9 Best Camera for Concerts &amp; Live Shows in 2025</h2>
<h3 id="1-canon-eos-5d-mark-iii-223-mp-full-frame---1-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007FGYZFI/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Canon EOS 5D Mark III 22.3 MP Full-Frame - #1 Pick</a></h3>
<p>It has an in-built GPS device that automatically geotags your photos. In addition, you can share the photo locations with your friends and family or even social media.</p>

.
Further, for video, this Canon EOS 6D will show 1080p HD quality videos. Hence, the full-frame (bigger sensor) &amp; continuous shooting features are the key reasons why the Canon EOS 6D.
It borrows heavily from the Canon EOS 60D. Full frame, in this case, means that the sensor is as big as a 35-millimeter film  in comparison to the APS-C sensors that are in most consumer DSLRs.</p>
<h3 id="2-canon-eos-6d-202-mp-digital-slr-camera---2-pick">2. Canon EOS 6D 20.2 MP Digital SLR <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009B0MZ8U/?tag=p-policy-20">Camera - #2 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Canon EOS 6D is a top full-frame (but affordable) digital SLR concert camera  topping on the Best Camera for Concerts. Its a traditional removable lens camera.</p>
<p>Therefore, the bigger sensor will collect more light and shoot better images. It has a DIGIC 5+ image processor and 20.2MP CMOS sensor (full-frame), which makes me classify it as a great kit for live shoes and on-the-go photo shooting and filming. Also, it has manual controls that will enhance a smoother video recording in addition to a fast speed in capturing images.
The wi-fi capability will enable you to control the camera from an Android or Ios phones. With the app launched you can control the aperture, ISO, and you can even adjust the exposure compensation. Further, on the screen, you have a screen confirmation box that you can move for focus and finally press the shutter button.
Interestingly, this camera will shoot at 4.5 frames/ sec and give you high-quality images  which will work great for continuous shooting on your live shows or concerts.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expeed#Expeed_4">Expeed 4</a>
processor, which means a higher resolution to give you excellent shots in live shows or concerts.</p>
<p>Hence, when you take images, you can easily blow them up or make them big or even crop. Its possible to print even on 11 by 16 while still achieving top clarity. With its optical viewfinder, you can create pictures that are centered or even off-centered.</p>
<p>When hand-shoot the concert events, this Nikon D5300 gives a high continuous framerate (5 frames per second). Also, it has a highly accurate autofocus system (specifically a 39 point autofocus system) that effectively tracks the subject  in addition to being smoother and quieter.
Its lens can shoot anything from the landscape, close up leaves, and anything in between. On video filming, the Nikon D5300 has pixels that allow top fluidity and smoothness if you just switch on the live view.
When you hit the record button, youll be recording 1920 by 1080 by default at 60p. Due to the very fast framerate, youll get extraordinary smoothness even on the big LCD screens. Further, the screen comes out and you can swivel it around.
You can customize the screen to make it something like classical looking or a graphics screen to have the relevant settings readily available for you. Also, if youll be using the camera when traveling, its possible to check back the photos and see where you took them.

<p>I am also very positive about this Sony Alpha a7IIK Mirrorless Digital Camera (having the 35mm full-frame sensor).</p>
<p>Its great for vacation or travel photographs  in addition to being great for filming concerts or live shoes. Definitely, I compared it against other full-frame cameras such as the EOS 5D Mark III.</p>
<p>With its E-mount lens system, you can undertake aperture control, smooth focusing, and zoom control. Considering its features, it has 24 megapixels, ISO range (from 100 to 25600). It films 1080p videos (60 frames per sec).
It has 25 contrast detection (clustered at the center), 117 face detection points - which will easily track various fast-moving subjects.
For continuous shooting, this camera will offer 5 frames/ sec. This Sony Alpha a7IIK will enable you to short stable images and videos. Due to its image stabilization, the camera now will minimize any blur.

It has an auto white-balance that will work great in concerts and live shows as such settings have crummy light. The sharp lenses and anti-alias filter will allow you to take very undistorted &amp; sharp images.
It has a great built-in flash that allows excellent flash exposure. Finally, this cameras body is full metal and thus more durable even compared to other top cameras. It has a tilting LCD, customizable buttons, and enough control points.</p>

<p>It also supports PlayMemories Camera Apps that you can use to personalize the available features. With the Image Stabilization (5-Axis SteadyShot), you can use most lenses with no blurs.</p>
<p>Definitely, a higher budget could get you a more advanced camera (with superior sensor) that you can use for live concerts and other purposes. To shoot your band or take professional videos or photos, you might need a feature-rich camera.</p>

<h3 id="1-point-and-shoot-cameras"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-and-shoot_camera">1. Point and shoot cameras</a></h3>
<p>Pocket size cameras (digital camera kind) such as Canon IXUS 185 or Sony Cyber-shot WX220 taking decent photos and video (some even 4K).
They are small and offer great portability. But, they wont match the quality offered by mirror-less camera or DSLRs. Check these
Point and Shoot Camera Under 100
.</p>
<h3 id="2-mirrorless-cameras"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera">2. Mirrorless cameras</a></h3>
<p>Mirrorless cameras (compact system cameras (CSCs)), unlike the DSLRs, come with no mirror (but have and interchangeable lenses).
But, you&rsquo;ll need a higher budget compared to DSLRs. They have faster processing and superior autofocus with the electronic optical viewfinders - with a compact &amp; sleek design.</p>
<h3 id="3-dslr-digital-single-lens-reflex-cameras"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera">3. DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) Cameras</a></h3>
<p>DSLR (such as Canon EOS Rebel T7i/800D or Nikon D5600) blend the digital imaging sensor and single-lens reflex devices (with reflex design scheme) &amp; optics. Check the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-camera-for-youtube/">Camera for YouTube</a>
.
But, DSLRs have a large build design  therefore wont serve if you need super portability and sleeker design. DSLR is praised for being inter-changeable - can switch in &amp; out of lenses.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If youre hunting for the best camera for concerts specifically, here are some key considerations youll need to make.
Do you need a 1080p or 4K resolution? For filming indoors, youll require a great

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Which is the best camera for music videos? Professional-level
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video">music videos</a>
never come easy. It depends on the quality of the cameras you use to shoot the videos like the
one-shot music video
.
A quality video is what builds your reputation as a great filmmaker - maybe a
Mac for music production
. These cameras will perform great for wildlife, sports, or landscape photography.</p>
<h2 id="1-canon-eos-full-frame-5d-mark-iv-digital-slr-camera--1-pick">1. Canon EOS Full-Frame 5D Mark IV Digital SLR <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CN2G19Z/?tag=p-policy-20">Camera -#1 Pick</a></h2>
<p>This 5D Mark IV is a mainstream pro-SLR, LCD screen (high resolution), 30MP sensor, and 7 frames_per_second shooting. It has great autofocus and can shoot your 4K music videos internally - for videographers and photographers.</p>
<p>On design and controls, the full-frame body 5D Mark IV weighs 1.8 pounds plus it&rsquo;s moderately sized (4.6 * 5.9 * 3.0 inches). It has no vertical shooting grip such as that in Nikon D5 but you can add a battery grip (BG-E20).
***Sneak Peek: ***</p>
<ul>
<li>*The sleek, modern and unique camera body design *</li>
<li><em>Offers 4K UHD 2160p of Video Capture Resolution</em></li>
<li><em>30.4 MP as the Optical Sensor Resolution</em></li>
<li><em>30.4 mp as the Max Resolution</em></li>
<li>*Reliable, durable, and offers top-performance *</li>
<li>*Provides continuous shooting at 7fps *</li>
<li><em>Has a 3:2 Aspect ratio with its versatile CMOS sensor (30.4 MP full-frame)</em>
The 5D Mark IV has an optical viewfinder that is both clear and bright (thanks to the glass pentaprism build) plus it&rsquo;ll cover the whole frame. The touchscreen is responsive and fast - you can tape to adjust your focus point when shooting video.
Many creative videographers say that its versatile and will help shoot highly refined images. It allows digital-to-analog conversion (on-chip) to enhance a sound recording. Also, check the photography drones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features I love are the Dual Pixel RAW with
phase-detection points
(fine-tuning shots
maximum sharpness
) and 30.4 MP. This 4K DSLR camera is significantly priced and 60 grams lighter compared to its predecessor.

<h2 id="considerations-in-choosing-the-best-camera-for-music-videos-">**Considerations in Choosing the Best Camera for Music Videos **</h2>
<p>**1. Camera Sensor and **
<strong>Autofocus</strong>
The performance of a camera will highly depend on the type and size of the sensor. Of course, higher pixels combined with the large-sized sensor results in better resolution. Thats because they can capture more details in an instance compared to those with low resolution.
The advantage of high resolution is that it allows you to crop your images without diminishing their quality. So, you should consider the camera sensor configuration depending on your desired level of resolution.
Autofocus, usually written as the AF system, is a technology that is gaining a lot of popularity in camera making technologies. AF system enables you to focus on the targeted scene with better accuracy.
**2. Viewfinder and **
<strong>Image Stabilization</strong>
Sometimes, its common to concentrate on the cameras pixels and forget the viewfinder. A viewfinder allows you to select and capture the intended details only. In this, you choose the subject using a frame.
An adequate viewfinder will capture only the selected features and block everything outside the frame. So, when choosing your camera to ensure it comes with a viewfinder sufficient to ensure you get the desired results.
This is a technology built into a mirrorless camera or lens to help reduce blurs that occur due to camera motion. It works by automatically adjusting the position of the camera lens to compensate for the tilt and pan induced by a shaky camera. Thus, you can shoot videos while holding the camera with your hands and still get high-quality images.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>To get many YouTube subscribers, you require a camera with a larger sensor, interchangeable lenses, fast Auto-focus speed, &amp; better depth of field/focus for
different music video shots
.
Its never easy to choose the best camera for shooting music videos. Cameras come in different qualities, ease-of-use, robustness, and budget. Most of the high-end cameras come at higher prices because of their premium build and superb performance.
However, therere middle-level cameras that will give you quality performance with a little pinch in your pocket. Whichever your choice, ensure what youre getting matches the quality of music videos you want to produce.</p>

<p>This is one of the most compact youtube camera in the market. So, if youre looking for something to help you capture beautiful scenes wherever you go, then you cant be wrong with this one.</p>
<p>However, compactness does not compromise its performance. Bundled with a 20.1MP sensor and DIGIC 7 image processor you expect to get a quality filming and imaging experience. The image processor has been upgraded from DIGIC 6 in the previous PowerShot G9X. That means it has better noise handling ability than its predecessor.

<h3 id="8-canon-eos-rebel-sl2-dslr-camera-with-ef-s-18-55mm-stm-lens"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071K62DPN?tag=p-policy-20">8. Canon EOS Rebel SL2 DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm STM Lens</a></h3>
<p>What stands out for me right now is the Canon SL2. The reason is that it is a very small DSLR. For example, compared to the Canon 7DD, youll notice that Canon SL2 model has cut some considerable weight and size.</p>
<p>Equally, it carries with it the flip screen (for selfies as noted above) and still has the same sensor as the Canon 80D. Therefore, the Canon SL2 will give you the same quality of YouTube videos like the premium cameras.
The Dual-Pixel autofocus has no match in the autofocus systems today. These best cameras for filming also have flip screens for selfies, microphone inputs (for better audio) and are super easy to use. Also, check the concert or lives show&rsquo;s cameras
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-camera-for-concerts/">here</a>
.
It has an even faster processor and a mic input. Further, the time-lapse modes are inbuilt into this fantastic camera. Despite that, I would recommend the RX100 or the G7 X for your vlogging tasks; the Canon SL2 is also enormous for vlogging. This is because it&rsquo;s lighter compared to other Canon DSLRs, and it has a flip screen.
Therefore, I consider this camera as feature-rich, light, and easy to use. As a YouTuber, you&rsquo;ll need something that works, is easy to use, and will always keep you on focus - which the Dual Pixel autofocus does best.
One more thing I envy with this Canon SL2 Camera, and some of the newer ones such as 7DD and T7i, is they&rsquo;ve incorporated the beginner mode. This is kind of great to me because, for any advanced vlogger, they&rsquo;ll just switch off the beginner mode. However, for someone just getting into creating videos, the beginner mode will help you kick-start without creating excessive challenges.
On the downside, the Canon cameras (best video camera for youtube) will process only the 1080p footage because they don&rsquo;t have an in-built 4K.</p>
<h3 id="9-panasonic-g7-4k-mirrorless---budget-4k-camera-for-youtube"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X409O6O?tag=p-policy-20">9. PANASONIC G7 4K Mirrorless - Budget 4K Camera for YouTube</a></h3>
<p>Panasonic G7 is great if you just need to create 4K YouTube videos  but on a small budget camera. Arguably, Panasonic G7 is very popular among vloggers due to its many great features. For example, it has a flip screen, which many vloggers love for the selfie mode.</p>
<p>Definitely, it has 4K video resolution and interchangeable lenses. With its included a mic input, you can easily get pro audio. However, one major shortcoming compared to our best camera for filming (the Canon SL2) is that the Panasonic G7 has bad autofocus in the video mode.
So remember that you&rsquo;ll have to be extra careful with this video autofocus limitation. For example, you might shoot a whole video, and in the end, you realize that you were out of focus while the background was actually in center. Further, it could also be face-tracking when all is not on focus.
However, this downside won&rsquo;t affect you if you&rsquo;ll be shooting for video production and not the single shooter type of YouTube content generator.
The runaround this video autofocus issue, however, is you can get all in focus, after which you&rsquo;ll change to manual mode, and thus the camera won&rsquo;t be searching for focus.
Next came the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Mirrorless-12-60mm-Megapixels-DMC-G85MK/dp/B01M050N05?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Panasonic G85</strong></a>
, which I would thus consider the best budget 4K camera. It has pro-features such as in-body image stabilization (but this is not new to Sony Cameras but a little bit expensive).</p>
<h3 id="10-canon-eos-rebel-t7i-body--built-in-wi-fi"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLHGJ88/?tag=p-policy-20">10. Canon EOS REBEL T7i Body -Built-in Wi-Fi*, NFC** and Bluetooth</a></h3>
<p>I started off my YouTube video recording with a T3i. However, I must state that the T3i fell short of my expectation as it lacked autofocus.</p>
<p>Enter REBEL T7i (knows as 800D in the Australia and UK)  the amazing average priced DSLR.
REBEL T7i is built with the 24MP sensor employing the Dual Pixel AF, which is a signature system by canon.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll quickly get better autofocus in your vlogging and live view production.
If you&rsquo;ll be moving around in your video production, then REBEL T7i is favorable compared to the Sony a7R I above since its lightweight.
Therefore, you may simply hook the REBEL T7i on your flexible tripod and continue shooting.
It allows shooting of highs of ISO 3200. Further, REBEL T7i has a hot shoe at its top, and hence it&rsquo;ll be simple to fix a shotgun microphone.
For raw shooting, it&rsquo;ll be easy to pull out many details from the underexposed areas.
Next came the Panasonic G85, which I would thus consider the best budget 4K camera.
It has pro-features such as in-body image stabilization (but this is not new to Sony Cameras but a little bit expensive).</p>
<h3 id="11-sony-a7r-ii-full-frame-interchangeable-mirrorless-lens-camera"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDWGFR2/?tag=p-policy-20">11. Sony a7R II Full-Frame Interchangeable (mirrorless) Lens Camera</a></h3>
<p>Sony a7R II is a high-end mirrorless camera that takes the top spot for the best YouTube cameras for 2018.</p>
<p>With the capacity to record in low light, conditions no other camera does, Sony a7R II has its own league and price too. Sony a7R II is pronounced &ldquo;Sony Alpha 7S Mark II&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The a7R II&rsquo;s sensor is acclaimed to be a futuristic low-light operations device. I consider it as the ultimate mirrorless camera designed for low-light coming with a full-frame and producing top quality videos for high ISOs. Further, the BSI CMOS sensor takes the gapless on-chip lens build, which aids light collection and, at the same time, enriching scene detail.
The sensor is more significant (and lightweight) and has improved the Bokeh effect to record seamlessly in extremely dark conditions. With its internal copper wiring, the a7R will give you high-speed, high-resolution stills. Further, the sensor will significantly reduce noise in your videos. Therefore, it&rsquo;ll be easy to record videos to a high of ISO 102,400.
Its body is a full magnesium alloy designed that is fully covered to prevent the entry of moisture and dust. Further, this best camera for filming comes has ten buttons that you can customize to your designed functions.
The Exmor CMOS sensor (12.2 MP full-frames) will double the sensor&rsquo;s light sensitivity and employ A/D conversion in cutting noise. It comes with a 25-point AF system, Sony&rsquo;s advanced BIONZ X image processor, a 3.0 LCD screen (tilting), and a full HD for

recording.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-camera-for-youtube">How to Choose the Best Camera for YouTube</h2>
<p>First, decide whether you need a camcorder, mirrorless cameras, point and shoot camera, or a Digital Single Lens (DSLR) camera.
Also, you should consider stabilization, ease of use, battery life, mic port, lens, resolution, flip screen feature, and cost.
Be it a webcam, camcorders, or digital video cameras, there would provide better proof than checking what camera that top YouTubers and vloggers recommend.
<strong>1. High Definition (HD) Quality</strong>
Creating HD videos that are informational and easily understandable will attract more viewers, subscribers, and money to your YouTube channel. HD videos have no blur and come with flexible box models, their primary and optimized audios, suitable screen and layout, and an appropriate video extension.
HD cameras will enable you to capture even the &ldquo;least information detail&rdquo; in each shooting scene. For instance, beauty, photography, and wildlife YouTube gurus would want to quickly capture the most details in their views to showcase their knowledge, skills, or training information.
Therefore, choose an HD camera that has autofocus, can capture different dimensions, and can quickly zoom to capture scenes in far distances with enough details to satisfy your YouTube viewers.
**2. Video Convertibility **
Lack of video output convertibility is one of the significant mistakes that vloggers on YouTube make. It&rsquo;s essential to ensure that the video camera you choose has
**a **
flexible output format. Don&rsquo;t wait to be surprised that the video you worked so hard to produce has a format that you can&rsquo;t upload to YouTube.
The flexible box model is the next critical aspect that must be considered. This denotes the ability of your created videos to adjust automatically to the various channels where the YouTube video will be viewed. Case in point is that your videos must be readily adjustable to the desktop computer and mobile gadgets with deferent screen sizes and screen resolutions such as Notebooks, Android, and iPad.
<strong>3. Smaller Disk Size for HD videos</strong>
Can your chosen video camera produce an HD video for YouTube that can be viewed even when your subscribers have limited disk size?
As you already know, YouTube&rsquo;s click pattern is a critical factor that will affect your statistics, leads, and earning. Therefore, ensure that the HD videos you produce will load fast with limited disk space.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re presented with a large number of products to choose from, you might get confused in selecting the best.
This guide has narrowed down on cameras that are typically meant for video shooting.
Getting one of these cameras will take your YouTubing or vlogging endeavors to professional levels.</p>

<h2 id="considerations-when-choosing-drones-for-still-photography">Considerations when choosing Drones for Still Photography</h2>
<p>**1. Camera Resolution **
The camera is the most critical factor for still photography. Look for drones with
<strong>large sensors (1-inch or bigger)</strong>
as they capture more light and detail.
<strong>Higher megapixels (12MP+)</strong>
ensure sharp, high-resolution images.</p>
<p>Opt for drones that support
<strong>RAW or DNG formats</strong>
. These files retain more data, giving you greater flexibility in post-processing. A mechanical shutter (like on the Phantom 4 Pro) helps avoid rolling shutter distortion in fast-moving scenes.

.
**2. Flight Control Range **
Longer flight times mean more opportunities to capture the perfect shot. Most high-end drones offer
<strong>25-30 minutes per battery</strong>
, while budget models may only provide 15-20 minutes.
But, Bluetooth, radio waves, and Wi-Fi connections have a limited range, and this will weaken as it moves to a further distance.
Always factor in
<strong>extra batteries</strong>
for extended shoots. Some professional drones, like the Autel Evo II Pro, push flight times to
<strong>40 minutes</strong>
, which is ideal for commercial work.</p>
<h3 id="3-balance-portability-and-performance"><strong>3. Balance Portability and Performance</strong></h3>
<p>If you travel frequently, a
<strong>compact, foldable drone</strong>
(like the Mavic 2 Pro) is a smart choice. These models fit in backpacks but still deliver pro-level image quality.</p>
<p>Larger drones (e.g., Inspire 2) offer
<strong>better stability and payload capacity</strong>
for interchangeable <a href="/posts/best-compact-cameras-under-300/">cameras</a>. However, theyre bulkier and require more storage space.</p>
<h3 id="4-obstacle-avoidance-is-essential"><strong>4. Obstacle Avoidance is Essential</strong></h3>
<p>For beginners,
<strong>obstacle sensors</strong>
prevent crashes while learning to fly. Advanced systems (like DJIs omnidirectional sensing) are crucial for
<strong>urban environments</strong>
with trees, buildings, or power lines.</p>
<p>Some drones, like the Yuneec Typhoon H Pro, use
<strong>Intel RealSense</strong>
for smarter object detection. If youre shooting in open areas, basic sensors may suffice.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Choosing the perfect drone for still photography depends on your specific needs, budget, and skill level. The market offers exceptional options at every price point, from the compact DJI Mini 4 Pro to the professional-grade DJI Inspire 3.</p>
<p>For most serious photographers, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro represents the <a href="/posts/best-point-and-shoot-camera-under-100/">best</a> balance of image quality, flight performance, and portability. Those needing the absolute best image quality should consider the Inspire 3, while travelers and hobbyists will appreciate the Mini 4 Pro&rsquo;s combination of capability and compact size.</p>

<p>This Pixpro FZ53 is a budget-friendly point-and-shoot camera that comes with a 5x zoom lens for any casual photo shooter. However, this camera has no wireless connectivity and could disappoint relatively on video and image quality.</p>
<p>The camera comes with plastic body build (230k-dot design) and is lightweight (about 3.7 ounces) with ISO sensitivity. Despite that most of us casual photographers may mainly tend to use the fully automatic mode, the camera also has manual controls.
Through the EV compensation, its possible to darken or brighten your scenes. On digital stabilization, Kodak Pixpro FZ53 has the all-important anti-shake. In addition, it has Panorama, Movie, and Portrait among other modes.
With the auto mode activated, its possible to toggle macro focusing after switching off the cameras flash. However, this camera only comes with a 2.7-inch LCD  which is relatively small, compared to other point and shoot cameras reviewed above.
Sadly, for continuous image shooting (particularly at 16 megapixels) youll have a 3.3 seconds wait time between the shots. Further, the cameras autofocus is slow. Read Also:

<p>It comes with a 35mm F/2.8 lens thats multi-functional, sharp and fast.</p>
<p>Also, it has an auto pop-up flash and an auto-focus system.
I found it simple to use the L35AF camera  including using flash, focusing, or aperture setting. It has the AF spot at the model of its viewfinder  that also has the analog lever &amp; diagram in showing the focus distance.
You can set its ASA/ISO through turning the ring around the cameras lens. Its interestingly powered by 2 economical AA batteries  not the specialized types of batteries.
