<h2 id="the-danger-of-fleas">The danger of fleas</h2>
<p>Fleas are parasites that live
entirely from sucking the blood of a host (hematophagy). They are wingless insects belonging to the Siphonaptera order. More than 2,000 species have evolved to favor specific hosts, such as dogs, cats, rats, birds, and humans.
The danger posed by fleas is evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of the pet care industry deals with fleas&rsquo; extermination and prevents them from taking residence. A female lays up to 1500 eggs in her lifetime, which is roughly 50 per day.
This means that you will end up with a huge flea population terrorizing you and your pets if you don&rsquo;t take action on time.
Some of the dangers posed by fleas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea bite dermatitis(allergy to flea saliva), - Tapeworm, - Flea bite anemia, - Plague (can spread to humans), - Cat scratch fever (can spread to humans).
How to
spot a flea problem
There are 3 ways to detect if you have a flea problem. Simply seeing your pet scratching does necessarily mean that you have a flea problem on your hands, and the reverse is also true.
Comb your pet with a flea
comb onto a white paper. If the paper catches some black flecks, wet the paper and see if they turn red. If they do, its an indication that it&rsquo;s
flea dirt
, and you have an itchy problem on your hands.
Put on a pair of wet white socks and walk around your pets play or resting area. Remove the socks and check for black specks, which react the same when exposed to water. If they are present, you have a flea problem on your hands.
Prepare a soapy water and vinegar solution in a bowl and place it next to alight. Leave it there overnight. If you observe drowned fleas in the morning, you have a flea problem.
