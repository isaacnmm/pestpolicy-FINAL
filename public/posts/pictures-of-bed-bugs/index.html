The size of bed bugs tends to change as it feeds and grows from
one life stage to the next
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their eggs measure about 1/32 inches long, while adults will measure 3/16 inches in length. Once the bugs suck blood - itll engorge to roughly 1/5 inches to 1/4 inches.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Color</strong></dt>
<dd>The color of Adult
bed bugs will vary depending
on when they are fed on a meal of blood from their host. Theyll be
<em>light brown</em>
and have an oval-shaped/ flat body when theyve not recently fed on blood.</dd>
<dt><strong>Shape</strong></dt>
<dd>Adult
bed bugs
are small, flattened, and oval-shaped insects that have considerably reduced wings. Theyre visible to the human eye. Other names of these bugs are mahogany flats, chinches, or red coats.
Adults are about one-sixth of the whole
bed bug population
.� The hemelytra (fore wings) are broad and short with a rectangular shape. Also, the bed bugs sides are covered by stiff and
short hair
.
<strong>Bed Bug Legs</strong></dd>
<dd>Bed bugs have two antennae plus six legs. The bugs body looks stripped due to their
short
body hair thats golden looking in color.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Media coverage on bed bugs recommends searching behind walls, examining bed and mattress, looking behind picture frames/ pictures, and in walls.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Real bed bug waste</strong></dt>
<dd>Bed bug poop will look like tiny clustered spots on the bed frames. The poop is mainly made of digested blood that turns black, rust-colored, and darker after drying.</dd>

<dt><strong>Definition</strong></dt>
<dd>Adult bed bugs will measure about a quarter-inch (4 - 5mm) in length and are reddish-brown.
They are flat to oval-shaped, depending on the amount of blood theyve sucked. However, adult bed bugs and make just one-sixth of these bugs population.

<p>Bed bugs will hide
in most furniture types - particularly in their undersides, seams, and corners.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rule of thumb is that bed bugs will fit in any crack that can also take a credit card.<em>Check the bugs below hanging on sofas!�</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Rarely will bed bugs hide in vinyl, suede, or leather sofa or couch materials.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if you sit on an infested chair or couch - its highly likely that youllcarry the bed bugs to your home.
Further, you can use
Tea tree oil

*So, youre wondering, would keeping your very clean prevent a bed bug infestation? *</li>
<li>Well, not really; bed bugs will attack whether the place is dirty or clean. However, with a clean house, youll find it easy to spot any bed bugs lucking around.</li>
<li>Exterminators recommend that youwash the bed sheets using hot water, avoid buying second-hand furniture, use a mattress cover, reduce room clutter, and inspect hotel rooms for bed bugs.

<p>Youll find most
dead bed bugs
to be shriveled and lying on their back. If you inspect your mattresses and box spring, you might notice
signs of bed bugs
.</p>
<p>Some may include dead bed bugs or specks of blood.�Have you found some dead bed bugs in your house? - Check the one below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs dont play or pretend to be dead - according to<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-017-2436-8"><strong>behavioral sociology</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, any of them that remains entirely still after some disturbance is most likely dying or dead.
Any bugs that are still alive will run away with subtle lighting (
<strong>afraid of light</strong>
) or disruption.

<p>Baby
bed bugs will hatch from eggs
(theyre pinhead-sized) and grow to be adults in only one month. But these insects will require a dry and warm environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bug eggs (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/bed-bugs-appearance-and-life-cycle">nymphs</a>) are visible using your naked eye - theyre colored translucent (when freshly hatching) to whitish-yellow/ brownish as they continue feeding.</li>
<li>After hatching from the eggs, baby Cimex lectularius quickly hunts for a good blood meal. Without a blood meal, the bugs wont develop to their next stage.
Despite that they can endure days even up to 1 month devoid of feeding, the bugs can feed even once daily while also casting their skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bed bug larvae measure about a millimeter when they are born, and they tend to be pale white, which makes them blend readily with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can see blood inside a nymph babies body after it has had its generous blood meal.
Youll notice that these bugs look anything like a small swollen balloon. To treat these bed bugs infestations,

<h2></h2>
<p>Well, for a small bed bug infestation, could be just one female whos mated and shes in a package or your home - and thats all theyll require.
The bed bug needs to feed on blood to nourish the eggs shed produce.</p>

<p>Females will lay about
250 eggs over their lifetime
, which is about 2-4 months.
The oval and white eggs are 1/16 inches in length - something like the rice grain - and youll mainly find them in crevices and cracks.</p>
<p>The eggs have round ends with an elongated and oval-shaped body.</p>
<ul>
<li>The eggs are attached to a glue-type substance thatll render them challenging to remove or move.</li>
<li>But the eggs have a wet spot look - you can use a flashlight plus a magnifying lens to search for them.
Theyll hatch into babies in about 6-10 days.
Further, its nymphs tend to mold about five times before attaining adulthood. Need a video instead? Check this right below.</li>

<h3 id="3-males-vs-female-bed-bugs">3. Males vs. Female Bed Bugs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-males-vs-female-bed-bugs">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main
difference between females vs. male bed bugs
is that they have a rounded abdomen while the males have a pointed abdomen.

<dt><em>Females</em></dt>
<dd>Female
bed bugs will only lay eggs
if they mate with their male counterparts - they need the males sperm. Females have a
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/2/2/151">hemocoel</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>an empty abdominal space to store their eggs.</li>
<li>After mating, the females will store sperm from the males and even draw from it to create mature eggs multiple times.
Besides sperms, female bed bugs require a
bed bug blood meal
before creating and laying their eggs.
<em>Males</em>
: Male dont produce eggs, and they lack ovaries. Males will break through the females shell, aim at the abdomen (its tiny dark spot) to deposit their sperms in the hemocoel.
The sperms
spread via the blood of the female bed bugs
until it reaches the ovaries - in what we term traumatic insemination.
**Bed Bug Patterns **</li>
<li>Female and male bed bugs have stripes patterns that move right to the left. They use this system to allow abdominal expansion when feeding on blood.</li>
<li>However, the females will show a small ridge at the back near its tail - the exact hemocoel location.</li>
<li>Therefore, youll notice that the stripes will look somehow curved as they cross this ridge on their back.
<strong>Bed Bug Skin Color</strong></li>
<li>Definitely, it&rsquo;s possible to
see through the bed bugs&rsquo;
skin despite brown hair. So, weve noted that females and males hold (based on their functions) internal organs differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, you can see the hemocoel and ovaries in the female bed bugs.
Further, you can see a dark area on the females abdomen (at its back) - which we noted is its hemocoel.</p>
<h3 id="4-bed-bugs-engorged-with-blood">4. Bed Bugs Engorged with Blood<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-bed-bugs-engorged-with-blood">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bed bugs will mainly feed on blood meals during the night - this is when sleeping humans release carbon dioxide that tends to attract these bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 5 to 10 minutes, the Cimex lectularius will be fully engorged with your blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bugs will also suck blood from different warm-blooded hosts despite being feasting on human blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>But for heavily-infested places, bed bugs will also feed take their blood meal in the daytime.</li>
<li>One hollow tube will inject anesthetics (saliva-looking liquid) into the human skin, making the area numb.
The other hollow tube will draw the hosts blood. The bugs will hide for about 5 to 10 days; theyll digest the blood, mate, and lay eggs during the time.
