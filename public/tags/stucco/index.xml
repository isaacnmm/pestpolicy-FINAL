<p>Before commencing paint application, its advisable to consider some of the following factors:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-prevailing-weather">1. The Prevailing Weather</h3>
<p>Prevailing weather determines the type of paint to select. For example, stucco found in wet areas should be painted with paint that integrates waterproof and mold-resistance properties in order to prevent chipping and scuffing from occurring.
On the other hand, stucco found in dry or sunny areas should be painted with paint that integrates UV-rays blockers, Blur removers, and heat resistive properties in order to attain quality finish results and reduce the chances of peeling or flaking.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-area-to-be-painted">2. The Area to be Painted</h3>
<p>The surface area under paint application should be accounted for in order to quantify the right amount of paint you need to buy. Larger surface areas require more paint gallons and vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="3-number-of-coats-to-be-used">3. Number of Coats to be Used</h3>
<p>You need to decide the number of paint coats you intend to apply  this decision is a function of the location of your stucco and the prevailing weather condition.
Stucco found in the wet areas should be coated with two or more layers, while those in dry areas can be coated with single layers without any problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-painting-method-to-use">4. The Painting Method to Use</h3>
<p>The type of method you choose for paint application highly influences the overall cost implication in that some methods like spray painting are slightly expensive as compared to the use of a paintbrush or a roller.

<h3 id="5-cost-implication">5. Cost Implication</h3>
