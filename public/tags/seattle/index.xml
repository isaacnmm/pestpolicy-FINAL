      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="/posts/10-winter-landscaping-ideas-to-spruce-up-your-outdoor-space/">winter</a> approaches in the Seattle region, homeowners and businesses face the challenge of dealing with various pests seeking shelter from the cold.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a guide to the common pests you might encounter during the winter months:</p>
<h2 id="rats-and-mice">Rats and Mice</h2>
<p>Behavior: Rodents like rats and mice are prolific breeders and can quickly infest buildings. They seek warmth and food, making homes and businesses prime targets during the colder months.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: Droppings around food packages, in drawers, or cupboards. Gnaw marks on wood, plastic, or wiring. Noises in walls or ceilings, particularly at night.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Seal cracks and holes in buildings. Keep food stored in airtight containers. Remove clutter where rodents can hide.</p>
<h2 id="spiders">Spiders</h2>
<p>Behavior: Many spider species move indoors during winter to seek warmth and prey. They often prefer undisturbed areas like basements, attics, and corners.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: Webs in corners or around windows. Sightings of spiders, particularly larger ones, indoors.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Seal cracks and gaps around windows and doors. Keep basements and attics clean and clutter-free. Regularly dust and vacuum to remove webs and egg sacs.</p>
<h2 id="cockroaches">Cockroaches</h2>
<p>Behavior: Cockroaches thrive in warm, humid environments and can survive the winter indoors. They are particularly problematic in kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: A foul odor that can be described as musty or oily. Droppings that resemble black pepper or coffee grounds. Sightings of cockroaches, especially at night.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Keep kitchens and bathrooms clean and dry. Seal cracks and crevices around pipes and baseboards. Store food in airtight containers and clean up spills promptly.</p>
<h2 id="ants">Ants</h2>
<p>Behavior: Certain ant species may invade homes in search of warmth and food during the winter months. They can be particularly persistent and difficult to eradicate.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: Trails of ants leading to food sources. Piles of ant debris, including dead insects and body parts. Sightings of ants, especially near food or water sources.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Keep food stored in tightly sealed containers. Clean up crumbs and spills promptly. Seal cracks and holes in walls, doors, and windows.</p>
<h2 id="silverfish">Silverfish</h2>
<p>Behavior: Silverfish prefer damp, dark environments and may move indoors during winter, especially in bathrooms, basements, and kitchens.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: Feeding marks on paper, cardboard, or clothing. Scales and feces left behind in infested areas. Sightings of silverfish, particularly at night.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Reduce humidity levels in the home. Store paper goods in sealed containers. Seal cracks and crevices where silverfish can enter.</p>
<h2 id="stink-bugs">Stink Bugs</h2>
<p>Behavior: Stink bugs are more common in agricultural areas but may enter homes seeking warmth during the winter months.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: Sightings of stink bugs on windows, walls, or curtains. A foul odor when the bugs are crushed or disturbed.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Seal cracks and gaps around windows and doors. Repair damaged screens on windows. Vacuum up any stink bugs found indoors.</p>
<h2 id="termites">Termites</h2>
<p>Behavior: Termites remain active in heated buildings during the winter months, continuing to cause damage to wood structures.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: Mud tubes on exterior walls or wooden beams. Hollow-sounding wood. Discarded wings near windows or doors.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Schedule regular termite inspections. Repair any leaks in plumbing or roofs promptly. Remove

from around the home.</p>
<h2 id="wildlife">Wildlife</h2>
<p>Behavior: Squirrels, raccoons, and opossums may try to enter homes in search of shelter and food during the colder months.</p>
<p>Signs of Infestation: Noises in walls, ceilings, or attic spaces. Droppings or nesting materials in hidden areas. Sightings of wildlife entering or exiting the home.</p>
<p>Prevention Tips: Seal entry points around the home, including chimneys and vents. Keep food waste and garbage securely stored. Trim tree branches away from the roof to prevent access.</p>
