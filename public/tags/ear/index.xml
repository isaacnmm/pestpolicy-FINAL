<em>Otodectes cynotis</em>
. They live inside the ear canal, where they feed on skin oils and wax. You can only see them with the help of an otoscope or microscope.
They are associated with intense itching and redness on the ears of the affected animal. This causes the animal to scratch at the back of the ear, often leading to bruises and possible secondary infection.
Ear mites are, however, not a threat to humans. But since they are highly contagious, they can easily be transmitted from one
dog to another or even humans
.
When you interact with your affected dogs, these tiny creatures may crawl and find their way into your body. You are also likely to catch ear mites when your infected dog shakes its head near you -
allow them to sleep on dog beds
.
Since ear mites feed on dead skin, it is possible to find them on your skin or underneath it. In rare cases, they can get into your ear canal to feed on the waxy secretions therein.
Outdoor dogs are more likely to get infected with ear mites and may affect other pets or humans. But you don&rsquo;t have to worry about ear mites. When they arrive on your body, they are not known to survive for long. They won&rsquo;t even cause severe infection. In rare cases, ear mites can cause a temporary rash on your arms or other extremities.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms-of-ear-mites-in-humans"><strong>Symptoms of Ear Mites in Humans</strong></h2>
<p>Dogs and cats
happen to be natural hosts
for ear mites. However, in rare cases, the mites can be transmitted to humans. Since they don&rsquo;t survive in humans for long, there may be no signs of infection. Usually, the symptoms of ear mites appear to be similar to those of other species of mites. These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skin irritation</li>
<li>Itchiness</li>
<li>Redness on the skin</li>
<li>Stained waxy inside the infected ear(s)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-dogs-get-ear-mites"><strong>How Do Dogs Get Ear Mites?</strong></h2>
<p>Ear mites are tiny creatures, but they move very quickly. When one of your dogs is infected, these mites can find their way into other pets in a short period. Adult ear mites can live up to months and multiply rapidly. Eggs hatch after only four days and reach maturity after three weeks.
When your outdoor dog interacts and gets into contact with affected dogs, it becomes easy for them to contract ear mites. Although they don&rsquo;t
fly or jump
, these mites crawl from the adjacent dogs to your dogs.
Alternatively, dogs may get the mites from a kennel that has been previously infected with ear mites. Fortunately, your
dog might brush
off ear mites with their paw or tongue. However, if the mites manage to get into the ear canal, your dog cannot remove them.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-know-my-dog-has-ear-mites"><strong>How Do I Know My Dog Has Ear Mites?</strong></h2>
<p>The earliest indicators that your dog has ear mites are frequent scratching and shaking of the ears. If you look closely inside the ears, the skin appears irritated and reddish. However, it would help if you ruled out irritations and redness caused by yeast or bacterial infections.
You can perform a simple test to confirm whether the symptoms are due to ear mites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a cotton ball, remove the black debris from your dog&rsquo;s ear canal. If the waste has already dried, you can loosen them with some mineral oil.</li>
<li>Scrutinize the sample for white dots, the size of a comma. A flashlight will help you observe the sample for ear mites. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you will see them moving around.</li>
<li>If you cannot ascertain whether your dog has been infected with ear mites, consult your local veterinarian. He/she will insert an otoscope into the ear canal to observe any mite activity. Alternatively, a sample can be removed from the ear and observed under a microscope.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-contagious-are-ear-mites"><strong>How Contagious Are Ear Mites?</strong></h2>
<p>Ear mites are small and contagious creatures almost the size of a comma. They mostly inhabit the ear canal of
dogs and cats
, where they thrive on the secretions and dead skin therein. They breed and multiply quickly and can spread to the head and other parts of the body.
They are just as contagious as fleas and may cause fungal and bacterial infections. Inflammation in the ear canal is also very likely to occur. In severe infestations, the eardrum can get ruptured, and this may lead to permanent hearing loss.
Puppies and kittens are more vulnerable to ear mites because of their low body immunity. They catch the mites from their mothers or other dogs they interact with. If your dog goes outdoors, it&rsquo;s very likely to catch ear mites and infect other pets in the compound.

<h2 id="how-to-treat-your-dog-for-ear-mites"><strong>How to Treat Your Dog for Ear Mites</strong></h2>
<p>Treat your dog as per the guidelines of your veterinarian. Wrong medications can harm your pet. A veterinarian uses special equipment to examine and recommend the correct medications.
If there&rsquo;s more than one pet in the compound, have them checked for ear mites. This will ensure that all the affected pets are treated to avoid re-infestation. Ear mite treatment will entail the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the help of a cotton ball, clean the affected dogs or pets&rsquo; inner ear to get rid of debris. They appear as dark and waxy substances often resembling ground coffee. If the substance tends to stick to the ear walls, you can loosen it with mineral oil.</li>
<li>Once the ears are clean, apply the prescribed parasiticide directly into the dog&rsquo;s ear tokill and removeear mites. Some antibiotics may be prescribed to help in the recovery process in case of a very severe infection.</li>
<li>Your veterinarian will also include a prescription for subsequent treatments. You&rsquo;ll be informed of the frequency of administering the medications.</li>
<li>Washing your dog regularly can help remove ear mites from their body even before they get into their ears. Veterinarians encourage washing pets with shampoo and water at least once a week to disinfect them.</li>
<li>Clean your pet&rsquo;s house regularly to keep mites at bay and reduce re-infestation.</li>
<li>Usually, your veterinarian will ask you to return for regular check-ups to monitor the remedy&rsquo;s effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-ear-mite-infections"><strong>How to Prevent Ear Mite Infections</strong></h2>
<p>So you want to keep your dog free from ear mites! But how does your pet get these creatures?
Well, dogs will catch ear mites when they get into direct contact with affected pets or surfaces. Whether at home or the dog park, any infected pet is likely to infect your dog with ear mites. They can be picked from the surfaces or hurled at them when the infected dog shakes its head.
Another place your dog is likely to pick ear mites is an infested kennel or bedding. However, you can keep your dog free from ear mites by following these strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first and most important approach is to limit your dog movement to public places that pose a risk of ear mites.</li>
<li>In case your dog gets into contact with affected pets or visits their kennel, wash the animal with shampoo and treat it with parasiticides.</li>
<li>Regularly check your pet&rsquo;s ears and clean any accumulated waxy. A veterinarian can help you check the interior of the ears. Cleaning also helps in depriving ear mites of their favorite food.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t want to keep your dog in restriction for fear of ear mites. So, you can apply some topical repellents behind their shoulders to keep ear mites at bay. These repellentswork effectively against otherparasites like ticks and fleas.
You&rsquo;re, however, required to use them regularly to keep these parasites away from your pets. For your pets&rsquo; safety, ensure you get a prescription from a qualified veterinarian before using these products.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Ear mites can be transmitted from dogs to humans through direct contact or when the animal shakes its head. Unlike in dogs, ear mites won&rsquo;t survive in human hosts for long.
So you don&rsquo;t expect them to have any symptomatic effects on
humans within the short stay
. Compared to other mite infections, ear mites are less severe. Their impact on dogs and other pets will depend on the severity of the disease.
However, with proper animal husbandry and expert treatment, you can quickly get rid of them and prevent future infestation.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For along time, scientific evidence considered that spiders are dominated by touch and sight. But the characteristics of these arachnids can be both terrifying and impressive.</p>
<p>**So, do spiders have ears? Spiders don&rsquo;t have ears or eardrums but jumping spiders can hear **
**sounds even from 5 meters away. **
<strong>A recent�study show that spiders�have tiny sensitive hairs to detect sound.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-ears">Details: Do Spiders Have Ears?</h2>
<p>According to the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/13/spiders-dont-have-ears-but-they-can-still-hear-you-coming">Paul Shamble research</a>
, their study showed that spiders have acute hearing senses. These insects, despite lacking ears and eardrums, will hear sounds from far distances.
Definitely, the research notes that the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s eardrums are small but its sensitive leg hairs will help the insect to detect sounds. Current research shows spiders will hear humans clap and talk in 5 meters.

<h2 id="spiders-legs-are-sensitive-to-sound-waves">Spider&rsquo;s Legs Are Sensitive To Sound Waves</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">Past knowledge</a>
suggested that the hairs on the spiders legs are sensitive to sound waves plus other airborne vibrations - but they said this was limited to sounds only near the spider&rsquo;s body length.
Definitely, most researchers had not realized that the spiders would also interpret the sound waves to a neural activity - this implies that the arachnids could actually hear the sound waves not just sensing even when the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-sleep/">spiders are resting</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="deeper-recording-than-just-visual-information">Deeper Recording than Just Visual Information</h2>
<p>The study conducted on
<em>hidippus audax (jumping spiders)</em>
where the researcher were doing neural brains recordings for the spiders analyzing their processes of processing visual data.
However, Menda conducted an analysis deeper into the spider&rsquo;s brain as
<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/log/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">outlined in this study</a></p>
<ul>
<li>this was unlike their norm in the previous research on the spider&rsquo;s visuals.
When Menda was moving from the spiders, the chair did some squeaking in the laboratory floor. The spider&rsquo;s neurons fired with the chair squeaking - they could hear a &lsquo;pop&rsquo; sound. Again the neural recordings fired again.
To clarify their discovery, the researchers did clap as they moved away from the spider to check when the neurons firing would stop. But the neurons firing continued up to 5 meters from the spider.
<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/log/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">Menda</a>
reported that the accidental discovery had just enabled the researchers to begin a new journey into testing the spider&rsquo;s hearing capability.

<h2 id="testing-spiders-hair-using-water-droplets">Testing Spiders Hair using Water Droplets</h2>
<p>Menda and team went on to determine the spider&rsquo;s hearing capability by placing some droplets of water on the insects legs - the main was to reduce the vibrations that would happen on the hairs.
But the spider&rsquo;s auditory neurons could no fire - which would mean the arachnid could not hear. Tests showed spiders were sensitive to sounds at low frequencies (80 Hz -130 Hz) like for wasps&rsquo; wing-beats.
However, even with their slight haring, spiders won&rsquo;t hear like human do - this is because their brain process such information in a different way.
The researchers are now examining if spider species like fishing spiders and wolf spider show similar reaction on sound waves - as shown in

<p>When fear comes - particularly when attached by spiders, you&rsquo;ll definitely scream but can the arachnids hear you? However, first, vibrations and visuals, are more pronounced.
Previously, researchers thought that spiders could only hear sounds and noises that are just around the insects body. Spiders will smell, taste but will sense vibrations (on hearing) via tiny holes nand hairs all over its body.
Some spiders species such as Phidippus audax and jumping spider do hear noises and sounds that are up to 5 meters away from the spider.</p>

<p>Dog Ear Mites (
<strong>also known as Otodectes cynotis mites</strong>
) is caused by very tiny parasites (you may not see them with your naked eye  you need a microscope) called ear mites which are classified under mange. These parasites feed on wax within the ear lobe and ear canal causing severe irritations and red inflammations/swellings that are very painful on touch.
<strong>On the other hand, Yeast infection</strong>
is caused by yeast growth within the ear canal. The Yeast infections can also result from the following sources: Trapped debris or water in the ear canal, Allergens such as dust, cigarette smoke, cleaning products, molds or feathers.</p>
<p>Moreover, Increased amount of oil produced in the skin, Medications such as corticosteroids, Fungus sources, Chemotherapy, Exposing dog to hot, humid weather, Using medical catheter or Weaken immune system will lead to yeast infections too. These clog the ear way-causing odor and a brownish greasy stinking discharge from the inner ear.</p>
<h3 id="2-signs-and-symptoms">2. Signs and Symptoms.</h3>
<p><strong>Dog Ear Mites</strong>
is characterized by the following signs and symptoms: Severe scratching of both inner and outer ear parts, Reddish Inflammations that may be bleeding, Clamps in the ear canal and Frequent itching at neck region.</p>
<p>Other symptoms of Dog Ear Mites include: Continuous ear irritations, Bleeding on the swellings, Spot falling of dogs hair at the ear region Dog abnormally shaking its head severally and a General body scratching like neck, head or back region.
<strong>Contrary, the Yeast Infections</strong>
is characterized by the following signs and symptoms: Clogged Ear Canal, Foul Odor coming from the ears, Greasy sticking discharge from the ears, Unbalance movement, Pawing of ears and Elephant Skin  thin skin.</p>
<p>Other Yeast infections symptoms include: Recurrent of otitis externa, Drooling and Hair loss on infected ears, Licking infected ears, Dark pigmented ear lobes Hyperpigmentation, Scabs and crusts on the ear, Change in skin color and texture, Crusty, flaky and scaly skin.
<strong>However,</strong>
Dog Ear Mites and Yeast Infections have the following similarities in signs and symptoms: General body weakness, Body hair loss in other parts, Loss of appetite, Dog generates hearing problems, Laxity or dog frequently rolling abnormally.</p>
<h3 id="3-diagnosis-process">3. Diagnosis process.</h3>
<p>To diagnose your dog Against Ear Mites, your will need to Use veterinary or Ear mites professional. This is the best way. The veterinarian may ask you some question concerning your dogs health in order to assess some of the possible cause or symptoms.</p>
<p>Also, the vet may carry out a clinical examination on your dog. He/she may take a swab or the ear canal to check what could be going on in there. Moreover, the veterinarian may try to identify presence of ear mites in your dogs ears using special equipment such as microscope or an otoscope.
<strong>On the other hand</strong>
, you may not need to necessarily need to involve veterinarian to carry out Yeast Infection Diagnosis (though its important). However, you can use the following techniques to attest yeast infections:
** Use of Acetate tape - **
Apply the acetate tape on the dogs ears/skin to collect any yeast sample that could be available.
**Through Impression smear - **
This requires you to press gently, a microscope slide, to collect yeast organisms samples on the dogs ear/skin;
<strong>Use of Cotton swab sample</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using a wet cotton swap, rub on the dogs ear to collect yeast sample or
<strong>By Skin scraping</strong></li>
<li>Using a scalpel/blade, scarp the ear skin gently to collect yeast samples.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also carry out
** Skin biopsy. **
Using a biopsy punch, obtain a small skin on the dogs ear and check on the yeast presence (in this technique, it is important to engage a veterinarian or specialist).</p>
<p>It is necessary to bring other pets for checkup so that treatment can begin immediately (in case they are found infected).
<em>NB: Ensure that you always put on the medical/protection gears while carrying out any diagnosis. Label all diagnosed dogs/pets appropriately.�</em></p>
<h3 id="4-treatment-methods">4. Treatment Methods</h3>
<p><strong>Dog Ear Mites can be treated</strong>
using various ear applications. These solutions are manufactured with ability to get rid of the eggs, larvae and adult ear mites.</p>
<p>You will need to pour or smear the product on the affected part and leave it to work on contact. Ensure that you select the right medicine and, where possible, consult the veterinary for advice.</p>
<p>Preferably, you can use: Tree Tea Oil (it is anti-inflammatory, anti-septic and can repel ear mites), Jojoba oil (It is anti-bacterial, antiseptic and natural safe solution) or try a homemade vinegar and water mixture for your Dog Ear Mite Treatment.
<strong>Contrary, Yeast Infections can be treated</strong>
using the following ways:
<strong>Oral Medications -</strong>
For advance yeast infections, you can use veterinary recommended oral antifungal medications such as terbinafine, fluconazole, Loft says or ketoconazole.</p>
<p>You can combine them with various antibacterial infections since most of ear infections are associated with bacteria too. You will need to administer several dose for complete treatment.
**Tropical Medication - **
Yeast Infested ears are greasy and removes stinking discharge. You will need to clean the dog with shampoo containing selenium benzoyl peroxide or sulfide first.</p>
<p>After that, bathe your dog using anti-fungal shampoo containing ketoconazole, miconazole or chlorhexidine 3-5 times daily for two to twelve weeks. This product will remove the yeast infections and maintain healthy ears for your dogs.
**Use of Coconut oil - **
This is a popular method since coconut oil contains both anti-bacteria and anti-fungal components which helps cure yeast infections.</p>
<p>The oil also ensure the ear skin is always soft and smooth for quick healing.
<em>NB: All treated dogs/pets should be kept separate from others/healthy ones. Medicines should be kept safe and away from children.</em></p>
<h2 id="similarities-between-dog-ear-mites-vs-yeast-infection">Similarities between Dog Ear Mites Vs Yeast Infection</h2>
<p>Similarities between Dog Ear Mites and Yeast Infections can be seen in the following areas:</p>
<h3 id="1-transmission">1. Transmission.</h3>
<p>Dog Ear Mites and Yeast Infections are highly contagious. They can be transmitted to other healthy dogs and animals such as cats, rabbits and even rats in similar ways.</p>
<p>The following are ways through which Dog Ear Mites and Yeast Infections can be Transmitted to other animals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogs Social interactions such as sleeping or playing together.</li>
<li>Sharing dogs clothes (ear mites/yeast infections can hold on dogs clothes and get transferred to the other healthy dog)</li>
<li>Through bathing them together (Sharing washing clothe  These may carry ear mites or yeast infections).
It is important to note that Dog Ear Mites and Yeast Infections are mainly transmitted on contact. You must minimize the interaction of ear mites/Yeast infected dog with others even if you will have keep it away completely.
<strong>NB: Dog Ear Mites cannot be transmitted to humans</strong></li>
</ul>
