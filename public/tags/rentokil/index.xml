<li>Getting mice around the business premises and house may be distressing. These pests may spread disease as they find suitable shelter and food, and this may trigger health risks around the food storage location and the kitchens.
If not controlled early enough, the mice will cause massive damage to your house and property as follows:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The mice will gnaw on your property and cause damage to the floorboards, doors, pipes, and insulation - they&rsquo;ll use the soft materials they get from such activities for their nesting.</li>
<li>Mice will also contaminate your foodstuffs because their body waste has pathogens that can transmit diseases such as Salmonellosis and Hantavirus.</li>
<li>Mice will also gnaw materials to allow them to squeeze through tiny gaps - their incisors are sharp - which allows them to chew electrical wires and wood - this may lead to the risk of fire.
So, you must inspect for common mice signs around the house as this will assist identify if there is a mice problem the soonest as possible.
