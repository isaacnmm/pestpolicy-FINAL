<p>Dish soap contains a chemical compound that breaks down paint bonds (upon application) to form a thick viscous liquid that is more comfortable to clean using a paintbrush.
Dilute dish soap slightly using water to apply over the paint-stained surface. Leave the solvent to cure for 10-15 minutes.
Then scrap of the paint using a putty knife gently to remove paint debris before mopping the surface with soapy water to clean paint remain and traces of dish soap.
When using dish soap, you must wear proper protective gear (eye protection, gloves, and dust coat) to prevent health hazards. Dish soap is best when using to clean wet paint and latex paint.</p>
<h3 id="2-using-vinegar">2. Using Vinegar<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-using-vinegar">¶</a></h3>
<p>Vinegar is suitable for both acrylic and latex paint removal process. The chemical components break down the paint molecular structure (wet or dried) to form a thick liquid that is more comfortable to clean.
Dilute vinegar to form a suitable solvent (tested via a drop test experiment) and apply over the paint-stained surface and leave it for 5 to 10 minutes to cure. Using a scraper, gently remove paint from the plastic surface and scrub of paint debris with a paintbrush.
Further, clean the surface with soap and water to remove remained paint and vinegar traces from the plastic surface. Eventually, rinse the surface with a clean piece of cloth to dryness.
NB: Over dilution of vinegar may reduce removal efficiency.</p>

<p>Prepare the ammonium solution (dilute) and apply it over the paint-stained plastic surface. Leave the surface to cure for 1o minutes. Scrap the cured paint using a blunt putty knife gently and wipe the surface using a paintbrush.
Wash the surface with plenty of clean warm water to remove ammonium traces and paint remains. Ammonium solution contains active ingredients that act instantly and breakdown paint molecular structure, which is more comfortable to clean.
NB: Ammonium solution emits fumes that may irritate your respiratory system when inhaled or get onto your skin.</p>
<h3 id="4-using-vegetable-oil">4. Using Vegetable Oil<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-using-vegetable-oil">¶</a></h3>
<p>Vegetable oil works for both oil-oil-based and water-based paint by breaking the paint molecules into a thick fluid, which is more comfortable to remove with a paintbrush or scrapper.
Apply vegetable oil over the paint stain and leave it for 5 minutes. Using a piece of clothes, rub gently to remove the cured paint. Repeat the process until the entire paint is completely removed.
Wash the surface with soapy clean water and a piece of cloth to remove paint debris and oil traces entirely. Finally, rinse the plastic surface to dryness with a clean piece of clothing.
Vegetable oil is best suited for wet paint stain removal. Though you can clean dried paint, the removal efficiency may not be that nice as compared to other methods.</p>
<h3 id="5-using-white-spirit">5. Using White Spirit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-using-white-spirit">¶</a></h3>
<p>Dilute white spirit sufficiently and apply over the paint-stained section. Leave the paint to cure for about 10 minutes or so. Scrap-off the paint gently using a blunt knife or paint scraper to remove cured paint.
For wet paint, you can clean directly without waiting for cure time (the white spirit acts instantly on wet paint stain). Further, wipe the surface with a piece of clothes or a paintbrush before cleaning with soapy water to remove traces of white spirit from the surface.
Rinse the surface with a clean piece of cloth to dryness. Notably, the white spirit is suitable for both water-based paint and oil-based-paint.</p>
<h2 id="precautions-and-safety-measures-when-removing-paint-from-plastic">Precautions and Safety Measures When Removing Paint from Plastic<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#precautions-and-safety-measures-when-removing-paint-from-plastic">¶</a></h2>
<p>When carrying out the paint removal process from a plastic surface, follow the following precaution and safety measures strictly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid smelling paint remover directly - some contain fumes that may irritate your nasal cavity when inhaled.</li>
<li>Always ascertain solvent action over a given surface by performing a drop test experiment before the actual application.</li>
<li>Wear protective gear always when removing paint from plastic - overall, gloves, goggles, boots, respirator, and facemask.</li>
<li>Before purchasing paint removers, check the type of paint applied on the plastic surface (whether oil-based or water-based paint). Water-based paint should be removed using water-based paint removers and vice versa.</li>
<li>All stain removers should be kept away from kids and pets to avoid any intoxication  if swallowed or inhaled.</li>
<li>In case you get into contact with paint stain remover, wash the area with plenty of water and soap.</li>
<li>Dont use flammable paint remover near fireplace or kitchen at all  may cause a fire outbreak.</li>
<li>During the paint preparation process, always follow instructions given by the manufacturer or otherwise state in this article.</li>
<li>Consider using a professional paint stain remover if you are not conversant with the process to follow.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having read the article on how to remove paint from plastic, I believe you have acquired quality information that will aid you in the excellent removal of fresh and dried paint from various plastic surfaces.
You can either choose to use isopropyl alcohol/rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover, Acetone, heat gun, commercial paint remover like WD-40, turpentine/thinner, or even scrap it off during the paint removal process.
Besides, you can consider alternative homemade methods such as vinegar, dish soap/detergent with warm water, vegetable oil or use ammonium solution, which works effectively when removing paint. However, proper procedure and safety measures should be adhered to and avoid excessive concentration when preparing the solvents.</p>
