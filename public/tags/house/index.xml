these vertebrate
s live. Could House Lizards live just like human beings or survive for a couple of weeks?
<em>So, whats the house lizards lifespan?�</em>
**The simple answer is, house lizard live for 4 to 6 years on average. However, this lifespan is subject to factors such as the care given, environment/climate and availability of basic needs for the house lizard. **
<strong>Some house lizards may even live slightly longer than 6 years if the above factors are maintained. On the other hand, skin shedding problems and wounding occurrences may lower the lifespan of the house lizards.�</strong>

<h2 id="whats-the-house-lizard-lifespan">What&rsquo;s the House Lizard Lifespan?</h2>
<p>The house lizard (also known as house gecko) has a life span of 4 to 6 years on average. This period is subjects to factors such as environment/climate, care given and availability of basic needs.
Most of the house lizards are faced with problems of wounding and skin shedding which lower their life span. For those house lizards that are well taken care of, they live slightly longer than 6 years.
The oldest House Lizard that ever lived recorded 27 years. House lizards are known to hatch in 60 days after which they grow to maturity in a couple of months (12 months) before breeding.

<h2 id="general-factors-that-affect-the-lifespan-of-house-lizard"><strong>General Factors that affect the Lifespan of House Lizard</strong></h2>
<p>The lifespan of the House lizard is affected by the following factors.
<strong>1. Environment/Climatic conditions.</strong>
House lizards are known to live in warm environment. Being cold blooded (ectothermic), these reptiles are adversely affected by change in temperature (sudden rise or fall). You must ensure that your pet house lizard has suitable/optimal warmth in its cage.
House lizards living in cold climates live lesser years as compare to those living in warm temperate climate. This is because cold environment makes house lizards less active (inactive) forcing them to hibernate till summer.
The environment full of predators such as cats, dogs, snakes, skinks etc. posts risks to life house lizards. Most of house lizards are fed on by their predators before they reach full maturity. Large water bodies easily drown the house lizards since they tend to
walk on water instead of swimming
.
Very hot climate/environment like desert will kill the house lizards faster due to their ectothermic nature. Their body enzymes (protein in nature) are denatured by high temperature leading to death.
<strong>2. Availability of basic needs.</strong>
House lizards requires basic needs such as proper habitat, food and water and right care. The habitat should entail nice cage with proper lighting and temperature. The cage should also have a hideout option for your house lizard and comfortable beddings (leaves or plant materials that does not cause discomfort).
The presence of food and water is vital for the survival of house lizard. Provide a variety of food such as crickets, ants, flies, leafhoppers, mealworms, grasshoppers, moths, soft shell beetles, pupae of butterflies and moths to your pet house lizard. Lizards that lack enough food and water die earlier (short life span  less than 18 months)
Provide the right amount of water for your house lizard in shallow bowls and make sure you replace it regularly. You can even provide a small pod in the cage for your house lizard to swim. Lack of right basic needs for your house lizard will reduce its life span.
<strong>3. Care given.</strong>
Proper care is vital for the house lizard if you need to boost its lifespan.� Ensure that you take your pet house lizards to veterinary regularly. Monitor the health of your house lizard every 48 hours. Clean the cage regularly and quarantine new pet house lizards for the first one to two months.
Provide stimulation such as mist spay that cause house lizards to relax and active within the cage. You can have rocks, hollows, plants and hideouts within the cage. You can even hide food for your house lizard to make it do something else.
House lizards that have been given continuous proper care have lived even more than 6 years.</p>
<h2 id="health-problems-that-affect-the-lifespan-of-house-lizard"><strong>Health Problems That Affect the Lifespan of House Lizard�</strong></h2>
<p>The following are problems that affects the lifespan of the House Lizards mostly:
<strong>1. Wounding Problem.</strong>
House lizards have soft skin that is easily wounded. Scratch from the walls or spikes on the house lizards skin cause mild to severe wounds.
Normally, House Lizards would prefer to roll on soft surfaces. You must ensure that the substrate in the cage does not cause injuries on landing or while moving about. You can also provide some soft beddings in your House lizards hideout.
House lizard are easily wounded when they fall due to their soft skin. Their skin also get ruptured by impact force. The scratch from the paws of the other lizards while playing cause back and skin wounds. These would leads to severe bleeding and their autotomy nature (self-amputation of tail in case of danger) may lead to death if not attended.
Lizards that are often wounded have lower lifespan (1 to 2 years) whereas those house lizards that are less wounded have longer lifespan (4 to 6 years).�NB: In case your pet lizards are wounded, seek quick medication from your vet.
<strong>2. Skin Shedding Problem.</strong>
House Lizards do shed their skin often (after every 4 to 6 weeks). They, then, eat their skin such that you may not notice easily. However, their skin color change can be noticed.
Contrary, some house lizards have problem while shedding their skin. You will notice a thick/excess skin at the neck, back/dorsal, tail, at the head and around the eye due to the unshed skin. This skin cause extreme pain, unhappiness and continued discomfort to your house lizard.
Seek your veterinary assistance to help remove excess unshed skin on your pet house lizard.
<strong>3. Loss of Tail.</strong>
House lizards have tendency of losing their tail in case of attack as a defense mechanism. This cause the gecko to lose a lot of energy during replacement. In addition, the regeneration of the tail takes longer and makes your house lizard less active as compared to other tailed house lizards.
In case your house lizard undergoes through a several loss of tail, it will die earlier (less than 2 years) than its expected time even if normal care is carried out.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-bones/">Do lizards have bones</a>
?
To prolong the lifespan of your pet house lizard, do not hold it by the tail. Instead, lift your house lizard by the chest. Moreover, do not cause tension to your house lizard while in its cage too.</p>
<h2 id="weird-life-behaviors-of-house-lizard">Weird Life Behaviors of House Lizard</h2>
<p>House lizard has several weird behaviors that you may need to know. These behaviors include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eating their own shed skin</strong>. Gecko eat their skin -<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">using their teeth</a>- as soon as it is shed. You may not notice that, however, you will find a change in its new skin color.</li>
<li>**Female is parthenogenesis.**This mean that the female house lizard does not need a male to reproduce always. It have ability to reproduce without mating with male. However, it has been found that such offspring lack a certain gene needed for diversity.</li>
<li>**Lack eyelids and lick their eyes.**Unlike human beings, house lizards do not have eyelids. Instead, their eyelids forms a colorless membrane that protect the eyes. To moisten the eyes when dry, the house lizard licks them often unlike in human where eyes are moisten automatically by the eyelids.</li>
<li>**Have autonomy capability.**This means that house lizards can cause self-amputation of their tail. This is done when the gecko detects danger during which it uses this method as a defense mechanism since the predator your tend feed on the tail and let go the lizard.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>House lizards have a lifespan of 4 to 6 years on average. However, this period is subject to factors such as care given, environment/climate and availability of basic needs for the house lizards.
Some House lizards may even live slightly longer than 6 years under proper care. Skin shedding problems and wounding occurrences may lower the lifespan of the house lizards. Consult your vet on your gecko care always.</p>

<p>The exterior of your home is the first thing people see, so choosing the right colors and design is essential to making a positive impression. Here are some popular exterior painting ideas:</p>
<h4 id="1-traditional-color-schemes">1. Traditional Color Schemes</h4>
<p>Classic color schemes remain timeless and elegant. Neutral tones such as whites, grays, beige, or soft taupes are perfect for creating a clean, sophisticated exterior. These colors work well with various architectural styles, including Colonial, Victorian, and Craftsman homes. You can add contrasting trim colors like deep green, navy blue, or charcoal gray to highlight architectural features like windows, doors, and moldings.</p>
<h4 id="2-bold-color-choices">2. Bold Color Choices</h4>
<p>If you want to make a bold statement, consider using brighter and more vibrant colors for your exterior. Colors like teal, mustard yellow, or deep red can create an eye-catching effect. Pair these bold shades with neutral accents such as white or black for balance. Bold colors work best with modern or contemporary homes and are ideal for creating a unique and personalized exterior.</p>
<h4 id="3-earthy-tones">3. Earthy Tones</h4>
<p>Earthy tones such as browns, terracotta, olive greens, and muted oranges are perfect for homes with natural surroundings, such as those with large gardens or near wooded areas. These colors blend harmoniously with the environment and create a warm, inviting exterior. Pair earthy tones with stone or wooden textures to enhance the natural look.</p>
<h4 id="4-monochromatic-palette">4. Monochromatic Palette</h4>
<p>A monochromatic color scheme uses different shades of the same color to create depth and visual interest. For example, you can use various shades of gray or blue, from light to dark, to paint the walls, trim, and accent features of your home. This design is simple yet elegant and works well with modern, minimalist, and contemporary homes.</p>
<h3 id="interior-painting-designs-and-colors">Interior Painting Designs and Colors</h3>
<p>When it comes to interior house painting, colors play a significant role in setting the tone and atmosphere of each room. The right design and color scheme can make a small space feel larger, create a cozy atmosphere, or enhance the functionality of a room. Here are some popular interior painting ideas:</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Spiders (Parasteatoda tepidariorum) popular as the American house spider or common house spider are classified under the
<a href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdf/IN/IN39400.pdf">Parasteatoda genus</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>House spiders mainly live in cosmopolitan areas and are described as synanthropic meaning they live near and in human dwellings.
House spiders are largely found indoors (in the house). Also, a spider and its webs will prove to be a nuisance in the house - which makes homeowners classify it as a challenging pest.</li>
<li>You mainly find house spiders in Canada and the United States but they are also in other areas worldwide.
In this article, I will outline the facts, physical appearance, and behaviors of the house spiders.
Let&rsquo;s dig in!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identification-of-the-house-spider">Identification of the House spider</h2>
<p>The house spiders will take shelter in man-made structures such as your home barns and sheds.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you noticed many cobwebs around the house, then house spiders must be this first suspect.
The spiders have a bulbous abdomen and produce uniquely-tangled webs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mc3eU6MdI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mc3eU6MdI</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-body-shape">1. Body Shape</h3>
<p>The female House spiders have an elevated (almost spherical) abdomen and they measure about 5 mm to 8 mm in length.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the male house spiders have abdomens that are elongated and their body length is about 3.7 mm to 4.8 mm.
The spider will appear grey or brown but will have some dark Chevron markings on its body.
The eggs of a house spider hatch in one week leaving it to go through different Instar development.</li>
<li>The female house spiders will go through 7 instars while the males will go through 6 instars.
The ballooning process will then take place - it involves dispersing the spiderlings from the silk threads to other habitats.
The adult house spiders can live 4 for a year or more.
These adults will be brown or yellow in color with their abdomens being Grey (dark and brown-banded legs) and having white marks.</li>
<li>Another differentiating characteristic of the house spiders is that the males and females can live together and thus mate many times.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-color">2. Color</h3>
<p>House spiders are generally around or yellowish Brown in color.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its abdomen is dirty white in color and has a number of dark stripes that meet at an angle.
First, on reproduction, a female house spider will lay roughly 250 eggs that will be wrapped in around (brownish) silken suck that is shaped like a flask.</li>
<li>In its lifetime, the house spider will produce 3700 + eggs that will be put into about 15+ silken sacs.
The house spiders are non-threatening and small in size. The bites are painful but then it will only bite for self-defense.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-legs">3. Legs</h3>
<p>Spiders have eight legs with an elongated bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the characteristic color of the house spiders is yellow-brown or brown.
However, its legs will have dark-colored rings but will still be largely brown.
The eight-legged arachnid has two body segments and lacks both an antenna and wings.
The house spider has 2 palps (pedipalps or appendages) in front of its legs.
If you have noticed some house spiders that have long legs, then outside these are the cellar spiders mainly found in the basements and cellars - damp and dark areas.</li>
<li>In fact, due to their thin and long legs, people refer to these cellar spiders as &ldquo;daddy longlegs&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Canada and the United States have about 20 species of these cellar spiders.
On comparing the common house spider with brown recluse - here&rsquo;s my take;</li>
<li>A sure way of identifying the brown recluse is with its eyes -they have six eyes as opposed to 8 most spiders.</li>
<li>The Brown recluses abdomen lacks markings that you will find in the common house spider and also they have smooth legs.
The brown recluse will also mainly occupy the warmer, darker, and quieter location where they will feed and reproduce.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-house-spider-habitats">3. House Spider Habitats</h3>
<p>House spiders generally love and hide in dark places where they can easily trap insects (such as flies and
bed bugs
) and camouflage from predators.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the outdoor spaces, the house spiders will largely hide under leaves and around windows, particularly around light sources that tend to attract insects.</li>
<li>In the indoor spaces, house spiders will mainly hide in crawl spaces, garages, basements, window frame angles, inside closets, under furniture, and in the upper corners.
Finally, in the warehouse, the house spiders will hide in corners around those that are always open.
The house spiders select the location of their webs through trial and error.</li>
<li>Therefore, the spider webs may build up very fast and also attract a lot of dust in a short time - you&rsquo;ll also see many<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-poop/">spider droppings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="controlling-the-house-spiders">Controlling The House Spiders</h2>
<p>House spiders are generally not dangerous but they make many humans fearful.</p>
<ul>
<li>So to maintain your peace at home and avoid possible venomous attacks you need</li>
<li>to control the spiders in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-spray-spider-insecticides">1. Spray Spider Insecticides</h3>
<p>Spray the house and the surrounding structures with insecticides that are formulated for spiders.
But since the spiders have long legs, it is important to ensure that the spray touches the spider&rsquo;s body directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, avoid squashing the spiders since this could lead to the fastest production of spider eggs and spiderlings will be distributed all over.
If the space under consideration has some cracks, then you should spray on them since spiders can hide inside there.</li>
<li>Since the crack space is small, then the spray chemicals will easily get into contact with the spider&rsquo;s body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-remove-possible-pest-food-sources">2. Remove Possible Pest Food Sources</h3>
<p>Spiders don&rsquo;t eat human food but other pests and insects will and so it is important to remove the foods.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the best and various insects are well fed, then the spiders will also be full and hence reproduce better.
So clean up the various scrubs and open food sources that may be lying around.
I advise that you keep all the food containers well sealed, wash the counters, and wipe all the food crumbs.
Doing such cleaner consistently we&rsquo;ll keep off the insects since they have less food - this will also reduce the spiders in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-adopt-great-pest-prevention-methods">3. Adopt Great Pest Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>The house spiders primarily feed on bugs and insects that get into the house and hence it is important to prevent their entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the entry points into your house will include screen tears, crevices, cracks, or drainages.
Some of the excellent pest prevention methods you can adopt for this include repairing the leaks or broken screens and sealing up the cracks.</li>
<li>This will limit the foods (insects and bugs) that are available for the spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-use-glue-traps">4. Use Glue Traps</h3>
<p>For areas of the house where you are sure to have spiders walking around, I advise that you set up some quality glue traps.</p>
<ul>
<li>The glue traps must be set up in places such as the basement or ceiling where there is darkness.
Spiders have great vision and they will see insects that are trapped and will attempt to catch them.</li>
<li>As the spider attempts to eat the trapped insect, it will also be trapped by the glue.
But remember to position the glue traps in quiet, and dark places like near the beds and around baseboards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-vacuum-the-house-thoroughly">5. Vacuum the house thoroughly</h3>
<p>To prevent the entry and fast reproduction of spiders, I advise that you vacuum the house thoroughly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to vacuum the hard-to-reach places such as the door frames, window frames, and baseboards.
The vacuum machine will help kill the live spiders while sucking up the egg sacs and the spider webs.</li>
<li>The vibrations, chemicals, and trauma caused by the vacuuming process will kill the spiders fast.
Male spiders have real height inside crawl spaces, basements, closets, under furniture, and in the ceiling corners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-dangerous-are-the-house-spiders">How Dangerous Are The House Spiders?</h2>
<p>House spiders aren&rsquo;t dangerous humans but will cause considerable nuisance and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">pain</a>
in case they bite - just like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/wolf-spiders/">the wolf spiders</a>
.
So these spiders won&rsquo;t cause considerable health damage to humans but they may make the house or various spaces feel unwelcoming.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spiders will trigger nervousness among the family members and sleeping off the webs will also be a demanding task.
You can do the spider control as a DIY Project but it is best you hire a professional with knowledge of the various spiders.</li>
<li>You can prevent the entry of spiders and various insects by sealing up cracks using some silicone-based caulk.
If house spiders have gained entry into the house, you should vacuum the spaces to remove the webs, egg sacs, and adult spiders.
Avoid using a broom only in the cleanup since most of the adult spiders will escape.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>House spiders may not pose a great health risk to humans (and like spiders such as the
black widow spiders
) but they are bites are painful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, their presence may cause nervousness among family members.
So it is important that you adopt effective prevention and control of the house spiders.</li>
<li>Prevention will involve filling up cracks that may allow spiders and insects to get into your spaces.</li>
<li>You can control the house spiders byusing spider bombs, spider sprays, and vacuuming.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Painting the interior of a <a href="/posts/house-lizard-lifespan/">house</a> is a rewarding project that transforms living spaces, adding vibrancy and freshness. However, many homeowners wonder: <em>how long does it take to paint a house <a href="/posts/best-paint-for-interior-doors/">interior</a>?</em> The answer depends on several factors, including the size of the house, the number of rooms, the level of preparation, and the techniques used.</p>
<h2 id="factors-affecting-the-time-to-paint-a-house-interior">Factors Affecting the Time to Paint a House Interior</h2>
<h3 id="1-size-of-the-house">1. Size of the House</h3>
<p>The size of the house significantly impacts the time required to paint. A smaller home or apartment may take a few days, while a larger house could take up to a week or more.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>1,0002,000 square feet:</em> Approximately 35 days</li>
<li><em>2,0003,000 square feet:</em> 57 days</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-number-of-rooms">2. Number of Rooms</h3>
<p>The number of rooms to be painted also determines the duration. Painting a single room usually takes 68 hours, including preparation, painting, and cleanup. Multiply this by the total number of rooms to estimate the overall time.</p>
<h3 id="3-surface-preparation">3. Surface Preparation</h3>
<p>Proper preparation ensures a flawless finish but can be time-consuming. Tasks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning walls to remove dirt and grease</li>
<li>Repairing cracks, holes, and imperfections</li>
<li>Taping edges and covering furniture
These activities could add several hours or even days to the project, depending on the condition of the walls.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is pretty obvious and common for pets to catch fleas and eventually show up at home with a full load of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our houses get infested too from pets, which bring them indoors, which means that human beings eventually get plagued.</li>
<li>To human beings, they cause diseases like bubonic plague and typhus fever, and to pets, they cause anemia and introduce tapeworms to them.
In this post, Ive discussed how to
tell if you have fleas

</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-tell-if-you-have-fleas-in-your-house">How to Tell If You Have Fleas in Your House</h2>
<h2 id="step-1---inspect-your-pets"><strong>Step 1 - Inspect Your Pets�</strong></h2>
<p>The following are signs that you should watch out for if fleas have infested your pets.
**1. Scratching **
The undeniable sign that fleas have infested your pet is prolonged and repeated scratching your pets are doing. The primary source of food for
fleas is blood, and it is only
obtained by biting.
Pets, in turn, retaliate by scratching themselves and repeated grooming (for cats) to
remove the fleas
off their bodies.
The discomfort caused by the fleas makes the animal have abnormal scratching of the body, licking and biting the affected parts.
<strong>2. Restlessness�</strong>
Due to the increased scratching and itching, the pets are always at bay due to the irritable little assailants. Behavioral changes are easily noticeable. For cats, they tend to be moody, low energy, and excessive grooming.
<strong>3. Welts and bumps�</strong>
Flea bites
are irritable.� These bites appear as small red bumps with a red halo at the center. They mostly appear around the waist, armpits, breasts, groin, elbows, or knees for humans. These small red bumps are called welts and bumps.
<strong>4. Hair loss�</strong>
When your pet is infested with fleas, it resorts to scratching and rubbing against the ground, carpet, and other surfaces to ease the itching.
Excessive scratching caused by the nagging
bites of fleas
leads to loss of hair. Animals may pull out some of their hair due to continuous biting and licking of fleabites.
In dogs, Alopecia is
hair loss caused by some strains of the flea
. It affects the dogs immune, lymphatic, and endocrine systems.
<strong>5. Anemia or pale gums�</strong>
The diet of fleas is mainly blood. Fleas can consume up to 15 times their body weight. This results in reduced numbers of red blood cells.
Pale gums mean reduced red blood cells. Reduced red blood cells indicate that your pet is not producing sufficient blood to compensate for blood loss to fleas.
<strong>6. Dodgy colored dandruff�</strong>
In human beings, fleas cause welts and bumps. In pets, you are likely to spot breaking skin with sores on their bodies that are black/red in color.
To check the dodgy colored dandruff,
run a flea comb
through the animals coat.�A flea comb has a close set of teeth specifically designed to trap fleas.
Run it on the animal several times. An infested coat will leave small black spots or brown spots on the teeth of the comb.

<h2 id="step-2---inspect-your-house"><strong>Step 2 - Inspect Your House</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Sock riders�</strong>
Spend at least 10 minutes walking around the house with the socks being as high as possible. Fleas will catch the socks looking for a meal. After the short walk, could you
remove them and inspect them for fleas
?�You can use
flea bombs
to exterminate the flea from your house.
Ensure that you are wearing white cotton socks. They will protect from the bites. White socks are suitable as it will be easy to
spot the dark specks from the fleas
.
In the case that you are wandering bare feet, you will experience some bites.
Flea bites
cause little swelling and only have one small puncture hole. They also cause intense scratching and hence red welts and bumps.
<strong>2. Powdered deposits and flea eggs�</strong>
The powdered deposits are also called
flea dirt
. Flea dirt will confirm your worst fears, that your pet is infested and, in turn, transmitted flea to the house.
Flea dirt is the name given to the small visible droppings of fleas. Most
flea dirt is found on your rugs and carpets
or the floor of your home.
To ascertain that it is flea dirt, you can rub a damp towel over them, and if reddish streaks are left behind, that is flea dirt. Check the electronic flea combs
here
.
Fleas lay eggs
in the rugs and carpets because of the relative safety. Run your fingers through the fibers of the carpet.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-eggs-look-like/">Flea eggs</a>
are small, white, and oval-shaped.
Remember to have gloves on your hands as a health precaution. Flea dirt is composed of flea fecal matter that is usually digested blood and other waste. It resembles finely ground black pepper.
The most
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-come-from/">common places to find flea</a>
dirt are around the tail, groin area, length of the lower side, and behind the hind legs.</p>
<h2 id="step-3--inspect-your-yard"><strong>Step 3  Inspect Your Yard�</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Backyard specks�</strong>
Just like the indoor procedure, spend at least 10 minutes walking around your backyard. Ensure that you are wearing white cotton socks with the socks being as high as possible. Fleas will catch the socks looking for a meal.
After the short walk, could you remove them and inspect them for fleas? They will be in the form of black pepper specks. Those dingy places are most likely the places where your pets contracted the pests from.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-the-fleas">How to Get Rid of the Fleas</h2>
<p>Now we have an idea of what we are dealing with and signs to watch out for. So we can talk about the removing process. Here are a few recommended ways of eliminating fleas from your pets.
<strong>1. Flea bath�</strong>
It involves bathing your pet in specialized shampoos that cover most of the pets bodies. This leaves the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">fleas with nowhere to hide hence killing</a>
them.
<strong>2. Water Trap�</strong>
This involves mixing warm water with non-toxic dishwashing soap and putting in a bowl. Place a point source of light directly to the bowl with water.
You can leave a candle in the middle or place a lamp near it. Please leave it in a dark flea-infested area overnight.
<strong>3. Brewers yeast�</strong>
This is a yeast that has an ingredient used in making bread, wine, and beer. Put it directly into your pets food. Enquire about the correct dosage from your vet.
<strong>4. Sticky Traps�</strong>
These non-toxic alternatives trap fleas using a sticky adhesive. The adhesive
stops the bugs
from moving, killing them through dehydration and hunger
<strong>5. Flea Comb�</strong>
They have teeth specifically designed to pick up fleas from your pets fur. Some well-designed combs pick up even larvae and eggs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scorpions are a pest that will come out regularly in the desert areas of the United States (especially the southwestern regions).
<strong>So, we just today found such a scorpion in our neighbor&rsquo;s <a href="/posts/house-lizard-lifespan/">house</a>. So I&rsquo;m wondering if there could be more around.�</strong>
<strong>My answer is that this will depend on the location and region that you found this scorpion  - which means where you live.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-i-found-one-scorpion-in-my-house-could-there-be-more">Details: I Found One Scorpion In My House? Could There Be More?</h2>
<p>My detailed response on whether there could be more than one scorpion in a house is that it depends on the location; the weather, the terrain, and the climate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other factors that will affect the number of scorpions that may have entered your house is if your neighborhood and yard are an excellent habitat for the pests.
So if the conditions and location are right, your area and your house could experience the manifestation of more than one scorpion.
For specific directions, scorpions will mainly love shady, dry, and hot areas.</li>
<li>This is because scorpions love hunting in darkness and they grow best with heat.
So if you are neighboring or country that has arid weather, and also a location that has many insects, and bugs, then you might experience many scorpions on your property.
Besides, if there are any massive ground-digging or unearthing activities going on in the surrounding, then the scorpions may flee from the old ground into your house for safety - just like the
Bearded Dragons
.</li>
<li>So even in your new house, all structures could be infested by scorpions escaping dangers from a construction or unearthing site.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV-x46Qy30I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV-x46Qy30I</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scorpion-species-and-their-biting">Scorpion Species and their Biting</h2>
<p>First, scorpions are considered to be social animals and won&rsquo;t pose a major threat to humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are scorpions really dangerous? Scorpions are not dangerous but they are non-venomous.
But the scorpion bites will be painful and leave some swelling that&rsquo;s comparable to what you get with a bee sting.
But elderly people and kids could experience relatively worse effects from the scorpion venom.
However, for any human that is bitten by a scorpion, medical experts advise you to talk to a doctor for a prescription and advice.
Scorpions do not love staying around humans and so they could have gotten there just by accident.
These animals will only bite humans during the panic in situations like when you crush them as they&rsquo;re hiding in clothes, gloves, or shoes.
So if you&rsquo;ve seen a scorpion in the house, it will be great to inspect the dark areas for the presence - at least to avoid a scorpion sting.

<h2 id="scorpions-are-social-animals">Scorpions Are Social Animals</h2>
<p>Depending on the species, most spiders are described as social animals.
But this will also vary with the local environment such as your yard or neighborhood and how inviting it is.
So, if you&rsquo;re home earlier has many scorpions, it will require extensive energy to eradicate them all within a short time.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because there could be many other scorpion eggs in the dark places waiting to hatch.
Preventing or repelling the scorpions from your house, especially in the scorpion-dense areas, will only push them to the yard or the neighbor&rsquo;s house.
So, it is good practice to alert all the neighbors to enable the scorpion prevention or control to be more widespread (broad) and effective.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scorpion-proofing-methods">Scorpion Proofing Methods</h2>
<p>In this section, I will outline the measures that can be used to scorpion-proof your house.</p>
<h3 id="a-remove-or-control-bugs">a. Remove or Control Bugs</h3>
<p>First I advise that you remove or control insects and pests that are within the house surroundings which may include flies, moths, crickets, and beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are the creatures that scorpions use as food and so removing them repels scorpions.
To repel the insects and pests, apply effective and environment-friendly insecticides to act as a barrier for the house.
Father, for the basement, doors, and windows, you should use an indoor pesticide that is non-hazardous to kill the pests and insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-maintain-the-yard-properly">b. Maintain the Yard Properly</h3>
<p>Scorpions get into your house by first hiding in the yard.
So you must keep a well-organized and tidy garden or yard since this will help keep scorpions off your house.
Scorpions get dehydrated regularly and will hide in the cool and shady areas of your yard to avoid exposure to sun and heat in the daytime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim the trees and bushes provide the overgrowth touching the house</li>
<li>Declutter the yard by removing excessive leaves and wood stacks.</li>
<li>Avoid over-watering the garden or yard by inspecting a water system.</li>
<li>Trim the garden or yard grass

</ul>
<h3 id="c-remove-debris-and-seal-the-house">c. Remove Debris and Seal the House</h3>
<p>For the house, you should remove the debris to keep it clean so that it doesn&rsquo;t hide insects and scorpions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove debris from the basements, bathroom, and kitchen.
Seal the entrance that the scorpions can use to gain access to the house. These openings may include ceiling fan openings, wall cracks, light switches, windows, and doors.</li>
<li>Inspect for more openings on the porch, patio, attic, and basement.
To sell the openings and trucks you can use expandable foam, sealers, fillers, silicone caulk, and concrete caulk.
When the windows and doors are not in use we should keep them sealed or shot.
As noted earlier, scorpions will regularly experience loss of moisture when either outdoors or indoors and so you should remove any moisture, standing water, or water puddles.</li>
<li>Keep the backyard area leakage free and dry since this will help repel the scorpions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-install-scorpion-traps">d. Install Scorpion Traps</h3>
<p>The next step will be installing some suitable rat or mice traps in the house to trap scorpions - oor use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-cages-for-bearded-dragons/">dragon cages</a>
.
Place them around water sources and the entryway and dark areas such as the closet and furnishings.</p>
<ul>
<li>But remember that the sticky pest traps could have toxic chemicals such as hazardous pesticides.
You can also deter the scorpions by using essential oils such as cinnamon, peppermint, tea tree, lavender, and cedar.
Spray the water-diluted essential oil in the basement, windows, doorways, and other similar entry points.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in summary seeing one scorpion in your house may not necessarily mean that there are more of such animals around.</p>
<ul>
<li>But this could vary depending on whether the area is scorpion-dense and if conditions are pushing the animals to shelter in the house.
Some of these conditions may include wildfires or construction site unearthing.
Scorpions will bite humans but their venom is non-hazardous - but could be hazardous to kids and elderly people. Any massive ground-digging or unearthing activities are going</li>
