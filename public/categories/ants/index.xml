      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ant infestations are a common problem in Bellingham, WA, especially during the warmer months. These
tiny pests can invade homes and businesses
, creating trails, contaminating food, and causing significant inconvenience.</p>
<p>Effective ant <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">control</a> requires a comprehensive approach that targets the root of the problem and ensures long-term prevention. Heres how we handle ant control in Bellingham.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-ant-behavior">Understanding Ant Behavior</h3>
<p><a href="/posts/ant-control-in-puyallup/">Ants</a> are social insects that live in colonies, often numbering in the thousands. They are highly organized, with worker ants foraging for food and bringing it back to the colony.</p>
<p>This means that seeing a few ants indoors often indicates a larger infestation nearby. Common ant species in Bellingham include pavement ants, carpenter ants, and odorous house ants, each requiring different treatment strategies.</p>
<h3 id="comprehensive-inspection">Comprehensive Inspection</h3>
<p>Our ant control process begins with a thorough inspection of your property. We identify the species of ants present, locate their nests, and find entry points where ants are getting inside.</p>
<p>By understanding the extent and source of the infestation, we can develop a targeted treatment plan. We also look for factors that might be attracting ants, such as food sources or moisture issues.</p>
<h3 id="targeted-treatments">Targeted Treatments</h3>
<p>Once we have a clear understanding of the infestation, we implement targeted treatments to eliminate the ants. This often involves the use of baits that worker ants carry back to the colony, effectively eliminating it from the inside out.</p>
<p>For more stubborn infestations, we may use sprays or dusts that are applied directly to nests and entry points. All our treatments are designed to be safe for your family, pets, and the environment.</p>
<h3 id="preventative-measures">Preventative Measures</h3>
<p>Eliminating ants is only part of the solution;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/why-ignoring-a-few-ants-can-lead-to-larger-infestations/">preventing future infestations</a>
is equally important. We provide recommendations for keeping your home or business ant-free, such as sealing cracks and crevices, storing food properly, and addressing moisture problems.</p>
<p>We can also apply preventative treatments around the perimeter of your property to create a barrier that keeps ants out.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-monitoring-and-support">Continuous Monitoring and Support</h3>
<p>Ant control is an ongoing process, and we offer continuous monitoring and support to ensure your property remains ant-free. Our team is always available to address any new issues that may arise and provide additional treatments if necessary.</p>

<h4 id="identifying-common-ant-species-in-federal-way">Identifying Common Ant Species in Federal Way</h4>
<ol>

<li><strong>Carpenter Ants</strong>: Larger than most other ant species, carpenter ants are black or dark brown. They are known for nesting in wood, potentially causing structural damage to homes.</li>
<li><strong>Pavement Ants</strong>: These ants are light brown to black and typically nest under pavement, sidewalks, and building foundations. They often enter homes through cracks and are attracted to greasy and sweet foods.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="prevention-tips-for-federal-way-homeowners">Prevention Tips for Federal Way Homeowners</h4>
<p>Preventing an ant infestation is the first step in effective ant <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-bellingham/">control</a>. Here are some practical tips for homeowners in Federal Way:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintain Cleanliness</strong>: Keep your kitchen clean by wiping down countertops, sweeping floors, and promptly cleaning up spills and crumbs. Store food in airtight containers and regularly take out the trash.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Entry Points</strong>: Inspect your homes exterior for cracks and gaps in walls, windows, doors, and the foundation. Seal any potential entry points to prevent <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-puyallup/">ants</a> from entering your home.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Moisture Sources</strong>: Fix leaky pipes, faucets, and roofs to reduce moisture that attracts ants. Ensure that your homes gutters and downspouts are functioning properly to direct water away from the foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Trim Vegetation</strong>: Keep trees and shrubs trimmed away from the house to prevent ants from using them as bridges to enter your home. Remove any debris and wood piles from around the foundation.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="diy-ant-control-solutions">DIY Ant Control Solutions</h4>
<p>If you notice signs of ant activity in your home, these DIY methods can help control the problem before it becomes an infestation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bait Stations</strong>: Use commercial ant bait stations to attract and kill ants. Place bait stations near ant trails and entry points. The ants will carry the bait back to their nest, effectively eliminating the colony.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Repellents</strong>: Use natural repellents such as vinegar, lemon juice, or essential oils like peppermint and tea tree oil. Spray these solutions along ant trails and entry points to deter ants.</li>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth around ant entry points and along ant trails. This powdery substance is non-toxic to humans and pets but lethal to ants, causing them to dehydrate and die.</li>
<li><strong>Borax and Sugar Solution</strong>: Mix borax with sugar and water to create a homemade ant bait. Place the solution in shallow containers near ant trails. The sugar attracts the ants, while the borax kills them.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ants are a common pest problem in Puyallup, WA, and can be a nuisance for homeowners. Understanding how to manage and prevent ant infestations is essential for maintaining a comfortable and pest-free home.</p>
<ul>
<li>This guide provides practical tips and effective strategies tailored specifically for<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/no-spill-ant-kill/">controlling ants</a>in Puyallup.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identifying-ants-in-puyallup">Identifying Ants in Puyallup</h2>
<p>The first step in controlling ants is to identify the type of ant you&rsquo;re dealing with. Common species in Puyallup include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Odorous House Ants</strong>: These ants emit a foul odor when crushed and are often found indoors searching for food.</li>
<li><strong>Carpenter Ants</strong>: Larger than other ants, they can cause structural damage by tunneling through wood, which is particularly problematic in Puyallup&rsquo;s wooded areas.</li>
<li><strong>Pavement Ants</strong>: Typically found in driveways and sidewalks, they can also enter homes in search of food.
Correctly identifying the species helps in choosing the

.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prevention-tips-for-puyallup-homeowners">Prevention Tips for Puyallup Homeowners</h2>
<p>Preventing ants from entering your home is the best way to avoid infestations. Here are some tips to keep ants at bay in Puyallup:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep Your Home Clean</strong>: Ants are attracted to food and water sources. Regularly clean your kitchen, dining areas, and other spaces where food is consumed. Wipe down surfaces, sweep floors, and promptly clean up spills.</li>
<li><strong>Store Food Properly</strong>: Keep food in sealed containers and store them in cabinets or the refrigerator. Avoid leaving pet food out overnight.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Entry Points</strong>: Inspect your home for potential entry points such as cracks, gaps, and holes. Use caulk or weatherstripping to seal these openings and prevent ants from entering.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Standing Water</strong>: Fix leaky faucets, pipes, and ensure that gutters and downspouts direct water away from your home.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Your Yard</strong>: Keep your yard tidy by trimming trees and shrubs away from your home. Remove piles of wood, leaves, and other debris where ants can nest, which is especially important in Puyallup&rsquo;s lush, green environment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="natural-ant-control-methods">Natural Ant Control Methods</h2>
<p>For those who prefer environmentally friendly solutions, several natural methods can help control ants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vinegar Solution</strong>: Mix equal parts of water and white vinegar and spray it around entry points and ant trails. The strong scent disrupts their scent trails and repels ants.</li>
<li><strong>Lemon Juice</strong>: Similar to vinegar, lemon juice can be sprayed in areas where ants are present. The acidity deters ants and removes their scent trails.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Oils</strong>: Peppermint, tea tree, and citrus oils are effective natural repellents. Mix a few drops with water and spray around entry points and ant trails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chemical-ant-control-methods">Chemical Ant Control Methods</h2>
<p>When natural methods aren&rsquo;t sufficient, chemical solutions can be effective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ant Baits</strong>: Place ant baits in areas where ants are active. The ants will carry the bait back to their colony, effectively eliminating the entire colony over time.</li>
<li><strong>Insecticidal Sprays</strong>: Use insecticidal sprays around entry points and ant trails. Be cautious when using these products indoors, especially if you have pets or children.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-carpenter-ants-in-puyallup">Dealing with Carpenter Ants in Puyallup</h2>
<p>Carpenter ants are a particular concern in Puyallup due to the abundance of trees and wooded areas. These ants can cause significant damage to wooden structures. Here are some additional tips for managing carpenter ants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove Decaying Wood</strong>: Regularly inspect and remove any decaying wood around your property. This includes old stumps, fallen branches, and firewood.</li>
<li><strong>Inspect Wooden Structures</strong>: Check your homes wooden structures, such as decks and porches, for signs of damage or ant activity.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Help</strong>: Given the potential for structural damage, consider hiring a professional pest control service if you suspect a carpenter ant infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-call-a-professional">When to Call a Professional</h2>
<p>If your ant problem persists despite your efforts, it may be time to call a professional pest control service. Professionals have access to more potent treatments and can provide long-term solutions. They can also identify and treat the source of the infestation, ensuring that ants do not return.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ant control in Puyallup requires a combination of prevention, natural remedies, and, if necessary, chemical treatments.</p>
<ul>
<li>By keeping your home clean, sealing entry points, and using effective control methods, you can keep ants at bay and maintain a comfortable, pest-free environment. If you need additional assistance, professional pest control services are always available to help.

<h4 id="signs-of-an-ant-infestation">Signs of an Ant Infestation</h4>
<p>Detecting an ant infestation early can prevent more severe problems down the line. Common signs include visible trails of ants, especially near food sources or water, small piles of dirt or debris indicating nesting sites, and the presence of winged ants, which are reproductive members of the colony.</p>
<p>Carpenter ants, in particular, can cause significant structural damage as they burrow into wood to build their nests. If you notice any of these signs, it&rsquo;s essential to act quickly to prevent the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-rid-your-home-of-big-headed-ants/">infestation from spreading</a>
.</p>

<p>This step is crucial as different ant species require different treatment approaches. For example, carpenter ants often require treatments that target both the nest and the surrounding areas to eliminate all colony members.</p>

<li>Once the inspection is complete, we develop a customized treatment plan that may include baiting, spraying, and other control methods.
Baiting is particularly effective as it allows ants to carry the toxic bait back to the colony, ensuring the elimination of the entire nest. Spraying and other residual treatments can provide immediate relief by killing foraging ants and creating a barrier to prevent future infestations.</li>

<li>It wipes out the entire colony, making it highly effective in eliminating severe infestations.
The bait contains borax, a killer ingredient that interferes with the insects&rsquo; digestive system, causing death.
Although highly toxic, borax is slow-acting. Ants that consume it can carry it and pass it around to others in the colony.
And because its bait, more ants will be further attracted to the liquid, ultimately reducing their population. The trap features a stay-fresh tab that keeps the
liquid bait fresh until opened
.
<strong>How to use Terro liquid trap</strong></li>
<li>Break the bait tab off and place it in areas with a severe infestation. This can be in a crack in the wall or at the door</li>
<li>If there are more affected areas, place more baits</li>
<li>Complete eradication can take up to two weeks, so replace the bait liquid once it&rsquo;s depleted</li>
<li>Repeat for reinfestation

<p>Terro Liquid ant baits are the ultimate solution for all your insecurities regarding the safety of having fire ant killers inside your house.
T
he main active ingredient used in this product is borax (5.4%) which is effective in killing the ants but is relatively safe for pets and humans.
This sweet liquid bait attracts indoor ants that then mistake it for food and carry it back to their colonies. Like most bait controls, Terro liquid baits require you to be patient and wait for a little before the results are obvious.
The liquid baits are contained in small semitransparent plastic sacks called bait stations. To be able to use the bait station, you have to simply activate it by breaking off the cap piece and keeping it near the fire ants.
The ants will crawl into these stations where some will drink the liquid and others will take it back to their colonies. Slowly but gradually, the fire ant colonies will get contaminated with the poison and the fire ants will die.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The high-quality design stops the liquid bait from leaking</li>
<li>The packaging prevents humans or pets from direct contact with the bait</li>

.
But in this article, I&rsquo;ve outlined some major characteristics that&rsquo;ll help you differentiate between carpenter <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-bellingham/">ants</a> vs fire ants - you&rsquo;ll thus easily identify the ants in the house or yard.
**In summary; on Carpenter Ants vs Fire Ants - we&rsquo;ll consider their behavior, nesting habits, and coloration. **</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, carpenter ants are black (to orange), brown, or black while Fire Ants are red-brown in color. Fire Ants.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>Next, Fire Ants are aggressive when disturbed and cause painful bites while carpenter bites are less aggressive but may bite if threatened.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finally, carpenter ants create nests in structures such as walls, boxes, doors, or trees while fire ants create their nest in ground molds.�</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="carpenter-ants-vs-fire-ants">Carpenter Ants vs Fire Ants</h2>
<p><strong>1. Identifying Carpenter Ants�</strong>
You can
<a href="https://extension.umn.edu/insects-infest-homes/carpenter-ants">recognize the carpenter ants</a>
, which are mainly in the Southern states such as Texas - and they behave like
termites
, with some key features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carpenter ants have waists that have a rounded thorax behind their head and a waist having a single petiole (node).</li>
<li>Worker carpenter bees measure about 3/8 - 1/2 inches in body length.</li>
<li>Worker carpenter bees are black or red
You&rsquo;ll mainly find the carpenter ants in the yard, trees, or the house. Notably, the carpenter ants will cause extensive damage to the house if ignored.</li>
<li>Thus, you - as a diligent homeowner, must take care to ensure that the carpenter ants won&rsquo;t nest in the trees and your home.
Carpenter ants build their residence of nests inside solid woods but they&rsquo;ll largely occupy cracks in soft materials and cardboard boxes, hollow walls, and hollow doors.</li>
<li>Carpenter ants will mainly love occupying places with moisture.</li>
<li>So, check for house or structure wood that has moisture or ones that are rotting.
However, winged ants may be black while other species could be black and yellow.
You&rsquo;ll notice the elbowed antennae and a pinched waist on the carpenter ants - which allows you to differentiate it from the termites.</li>
<li>But carpenter ants are ready for reproduction, just like the termites move in a swarm and are winged - which allows them to move rapidly in mating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-identifying-fire-ants">2.** Identifying **Fire Ants</h3>
<p>You can identify Fire ants quickly from the dull red color in their body - but this color may vary from reddish black or reddish-brown.</p>
<ul>
<li>On their anatomy, you&rsquo;ll also notice a stinger on the fire ants.
In sunny places, the fire ants will create some noticeable�soil mounds</li>
<li>The soil mounds could be as big as 61 centimeters wide and 18 centimeters tall - or they may be shaped like a dome.
Fire ants will have less activity in the bot sunny times; they also evade shades and darkness - and thus you&rsquo;ll mainly find them in open lawns and fields.
These ants are
<a href="http://fireant.tamu.edu/materials/fact-sheets/">considered aggressive</a>
and they&rsquo;ll mainly feed on dead animals and living insects. But when they get into their house, the fire ants will invade sweet foods and fats.</li>
<li><strong>In brief, we can easily know fire ants from the size and shape of the mounds, and the type of bites they cause. Also, fire ants are seen to be very aggressive compared to other ant species.�</strong>
The worker fire ants will bite humans using their chewing mouthparts while also injecting some poison using the stingers that&rsquo;ll cause a tingling or painful feeling.
You&rsquo;ll know when you have fire ants in your spaes from some key indicators; these are -</li>
<li>Presence of an ant mound that has worked, fluffy soil - this will be seen shortly following some heavy rain</li>
<li>Further, that ant mound lacks an opening at its top area like other ant mounds. Notably, fire ants use underground tunnels to get into their mound.</li>
<li>You may see white pupae, larvae, and eggs on the soil mound.
Collecting the fire ants for proper identification requires adequate keenness from that ant mounds.</li>
<li>Take your dishwashing gloves and pour some baby powder on them; wear those gloves now and this will hinder ants from crawling up.</li>
<li>Take a vial and put somerubbing alcoholonto the ant mound - the top part. Notably, the worker ants of the fire ants will climb and drop into the vial.</li>
<li>Finally, close the vial (with the fire ants inside) - but ensure to still use gloves to avoid ant bites - if bitten,<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-treat-ant-bites/">you can treat the ant bites</a>.
Notably, fire ants come in 5 different species; red-imported fire ants, little-fire ants, desert-fire ants, tropical-fire ants, and the Southern (native) fire ants.</li>
<li>When the nests of these fire ants are attacked, the pest will move out aggressively ready to bite and sting in defense.

</ul>
<h2 id="ant-removal-methodscarpenter-ants-vs-fire-ants">Ant Removal Methods?�Carpenter Ants vs Fire Ants</h2>
<p>Fire ants have been described to be very aggressive and thus care must be a priority when treating these pests.</p>

      <description>Sugar Ants are little brown and black insects with semi-transparent bodies that invade homes, ceilings, walls, and kitchen. But, do Sugar Ants Bite?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/what-do-sugar-ants-look-like/">Sugar</a> Ants are little brown and black insects with semi-transparent bodies that invade homes, ceilings, walls, and kitchen. But, do Sugar Ants Bite?</p>
<p><strong>The short answer is: YES, sugar ants will bite humans but; NO, they&rsquo;re not poisonous. Sugar ant bite order to defend itself. Thy&rsquo;ll first puff up their abdomens and flash their mandibles to express irritation.�</strong>
Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-sugar-ants-look-like/">How Sugar Ants Look</a></p>
<h2 id="do-sugar-ants-bite">Do Sugar Ants Bite?</h2>
<p>Sugar ants can be invasive and stubborn household critters.�Although they are omnivores, they love nothing more than to lap up the sweet white nectar that has earned them their nickname.</p>
<p>Sugar ants can also describe any household ant ranging from 2 to 15 mm in size that have a sweet tooth that draws them to your pantry.</p>
<p>If you have these unsightly buggers in your house and you have kids or pets, you may be worried and asking yourself whether they bite.</p>
<p>Thankfully, sugar ant bites are relatively minor and don&rsquo;t hurt nearly as much as the bites of their carpenter ant or fire ant relatives.</p>
<p>With the exception of the case of a rare allergy, sugar ant bites are also far less likely to produce any lasting reactions or unpleasant symptoms.</p>
<p>When it comes to insect bites, it is common for people to confuse bites with stings, and thankfully sugar ants, unlike their carpenter and fire ant compatriots, are not capable of producing stings.</p>
<p>Sugar ants bite and pinch with their mandibles while fire ants actually inject venom into the skin with their stingers.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-bitten-by-a-sugar-ant">What should I do if I&rsquo;ve been bitten by a sugar ant?</h2>
<p>In the event that you are bitten by a sugar ant, there is a small likelihood that you may experience some slight inflammation or heat in the area around the bite.�This is because at the time of the bite the sugar ant spews a small volume and weak concentration of formic acid.</p>
<p>If this happens, relieve the inflammatory effect of the bite and any itchiness the same way you would with any other common insect bite: disinfect with an antibacterial ointment and apply ice, hydrocotisone or antibiotic cream to the affected area until the swelling decreases.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that the discomfort persists and the small pimple-like bite swells into a blister, and/or you begin to experience breathing difficulty or lightheadedness, contact a medical health professional.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-sugar-ants">How to Get Rid Of Sugar Ants?</h2>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s how to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-sugar-ants/">get rid of sugar ants</a>
. But for a summary, you&rsquo;ll need to clean up, use natural ant control solutions - including diatomaceous earth (DE), peppermint oil, mint plants or eventually call your trusted exterminator.</p>
<h3 id="1-clean-up-food-debris-and-dirt">1. Clean Up Food Debris and Dirt</h3>
<p>To get rid of sugar ants, first make sure that your kitchen is consistently tidied up. Keep all perishable foodstuffs refrigerated; regularly dispose of garbage and keep all compost outside.</p>
<p>Do not leave your unwashed dishes in the sink overnight, especially if they contain remnants of food; and ensure that all containers and bags of food in your pantry are tightly sealed at all times.</p>
<p>Most sugar ants come from outside, but some, especially if you are living in an older house, take up residence in disused objects and neglected corners inside.</p>
<p>Make sure to regularly vacuum your floors, carpets, and furniture to disrupt and get rid of any potential colony hiding places. You should also check your home for any crevices and cracks that might allow the ants inside: seal them up as needed.</p>
<h3 id="2-get-rid-of-the-problem-with-ant-traps">2. Get Rid of the Problem with Ant Traps:</h3>
<p>If regularly cleaning your kitchen and house and being vigilantly on the lookout for colonies doesn&rsquo;t get rid of the problem, you may want to consider purchasing ant traps and laying them near affected areas.</p>
<p>Commercial ant traps come in a variety of sizes and brands and can be bought in hardware stores and grocery stores. The ants you see around your kitchen are worker ants: they are the ones in charge of the food supply and they bring provisions back to the colony and queen.</p>
<p>The traps lure the workers to partake of its &ldquo;food,&rdquo; which is then transported back to the colony, effectively poisoning and eradicating them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Although they are inexpensive and effective, keep in mind that most conventional ant traps make use of pesticides and chemicals and should be kept away from human food. Keep them on the floor, not the counter!</p>
<h3 id="3-bite-back-with-natural-solutions">3. Bite back with Natural Solutions:</h3>
<p>If you are unable to secure a non-toxic, organic ant trap and are wary of bringing chemicals into the home, try out some natural remedies.</p>
<p>One option is to eliminate the scent trail that attracts ants to your food. Try filling a spray bottle with a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water and spraying it upon affected areas as well as door-frames and windowsills that may be serving as inadvertent portals to your home.</p>
<p>Directly spraying the vinegar and water mixture directly onto the ants will also kill them; wipe away the mess with a tissue or paper towel.</p>
<p>Diatomaceous earth is also effective: try sprinkling it beneath your fridge, around the garbage can, and other affected areas.�The tiny blade-like particles of Diatomaceous earth shear through the exoskeletons of ants, and their bodies soon dry up.</p>
<p>A less deadly solution is to fill the aforementioned door-frames,windowsills, and pantries with mint sprigs, mint plants, or cotton balls soaked with peppermint oil: insects detest the smell of mint, and in addition to sugar ants, this may take care of insect issues altogether!</p>
<h3 id="4-call-the-dreaded-exterminator">4. Call the dreaded Exterminator</h3>
<p>If cleaning up, ant traps, and natural solutions fail, you may have to consider looking into the services of an exterminator.</p>
<p>Luckily, professionals are increasingly discrete, and are typically able to resolve to situation in mere hours so you can get back to worrying about the things that matter and not another bite from an unwelcome guest!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ant infestations are a common problem for homeowners in Eugene, OR, particularly during the warmer months.</p>
<ul>
<li>The region&rsquo;s temperate climate and lush environment provide an ideal habitat for various ant species, including odorous house ants, carpenter ants, and pavement ants.
While these tiny invaders can be a nuisance, there are effective strategies tailored to Eugenes unique conditions to manage and prevent infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="identifying-common-ant-species-in-eugene">Identifying Common Ant Species in Eugene</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Odorous House Ants</strong>: These small, dark ants are prevalent in Eugene and are known for the strong, rotten coconut smell they emit when crushed. They typically nest indoors near moisture sources, such as kitchens and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">bathrooms</a>, which are common in the damp climate of Eugene.</li>
<li><strong>Carpenter Ants</strong>: Larger than most ants, carpenter ants are a significant concern in Eugene due to the abundance of moisture-rich wood in the area. These ants can cause substantial structural damage as they tunnel through wood to create nests. They are usually black or dark brown and prefer moist, decaying wood found in Eugenes forests and older homes.</li>
<li><strong>Pavement Ants</strong>: These ants are commonly found nesting under sidewalks, driveways, and building foundations throughout Eugene. They are small, brown to black ants that often invade homes in search of food.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="prevention-tips-for-eugene-homeowners">Prevention Tips for Eugene Homeowners</h4>
<p>Preventing an ant infestation is the first step in effective ant <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-bellingham/">control</a>. Here are some practical tips for homeowners in Eugene:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Seal Entry Points</strong>: <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">Ants</a> can enter your home through the smallest of cracks. Inspect your homes exterior and seal any gaps or cracks in walls, windows, doors, and the foundation. Eugenes rainy weather can exacerbate these entry points, so regular checks are essential.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Food Sources</strong>: Ants are attracted to food and water. Keep your kitchen clean, store food in airtight containers, and promptly clean up spills and crumbs. Regularly take out the trash and keep garbage cans sealed. The abundance of outdoor food sources in Eugene, such as fruit trees, can also attract ants, so clean up fallen fruit promptly.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Moisture</strong>: Many ants are attracted to moisture, a common feature in Eugenes climate. Fix leaky pipes, faucets, and roofs. Ensure that your homes gutters and downspouts are functioning properly to direct water away from the foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Your Yard</strong>: Trim trees and shrubs away from the house, and keep mulch and wood piles away from the foundation. Ants often use these as bridges to get into your home. Eugenes lush vegetation requires regular maintenance to prevent providing ants with easy access to your home.</li>

<h2 id="flying-ants-vs-termites---in-depth-pest-control">Flying Ants vs. Termites - In-Depth Pest Control</h2>
<p>To effectively eradicate flying ants and termites, its essential to know which of the insects youre dealing with. In this guide, youll get to know the differences between the two insects.</p>
<h3 id="1-appearance">1. Appearance</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Flying ants and termites appear to look alike from an outward perspective. But a closer look will portray some notable differences in their physical appearance.</dt>
<dt>A microscope or a magnifying glass can be used to give a better view. Three of the most important</dt>
<dt><a href="https://u.osu.edu/biomuseum/2017/01/30/mites-as-parasitoids-of-invasive-ants/">distinguishing features include</a></dt>
<dt>:</dt>
<dt><strong>Body</strong></dt>
<dt><strong>Flying ants</strong></dt>
<dd>Flying ants have a broad body with a thin waist. Thus, you can differentiate between the abdomen and thorax. The color of the body ranges from reddish-brown, brown to black.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites have a straight body and a broad waist. That means you cant distinguish between the abdomen and thorax. Their body can either be dark brown or black.
<strong>Wings</strong>
<strong>Flying ants:</strong>
They have two pairs of
wings
one in front and the other at the back. Notably, the front wings are longer than the back wings.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites also have two pairs of wings. However, both pairs of wings are of equal length.
<strong>Antennae</strong>
<strong>Flying ants:</strong>
Flying ants have elbowed antennae.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites have straight antennae.

<h3 id="2-behavior">2. Behavior</h3>
<p><strong>Flying ants:</strong>
Flying ants live amongst other members of a colony and play the role of finding and creating new colonies. They are often known as swarmers because of their ability to fly, unlike other colony members.
They swarm during the summer to create new colonies. Once a new colony is set up, flying ants will pluck off their wings since they arent needed anymore. They usually leave their wings on windowsills. After mating, male ants will die, leaving the females to lay eggs and increase the colony.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites also live in colonies consisting of reproductive termites, workers, and soldiers. Mating occurs during spring. However, unlike ants, male termites do not die after mating. Both the males and females lose their wings and continue expanding the new colony.
The discarded wings can be seen scattered on surfaces, especially the floor.</p>
<h3 id="3-diet">3. Diet</h3>
<p><strong>Flying Ants:</strong>
Flying ants are omnivorous insects, and their diet mainly consists of food debris and nectar. They also feed on other small insects. The worker ants do the work of bringing food for the rest of the colony.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
A termites diet mainly consists of cellulose, obtained from wood and dead plants. Food is brought to the colony by the worker termites. Thus, these are some of the insects that do a lot of damage to your property.

<h3 id="4-life-cycle">4. Life Cycle</h3>
<p><strong>Flying ants:</strong>
Ants undergo a complete metamorphosis. The queen <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">ant</a> lays
eggs that undergo the larvae
, pupae, and adult stage. The queen lives for many years, while the workers and soldiers die after a few months.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites undergo the egg, larvae or nymph, and adult lifecycle. The queen and reproductive females can live up to 25 years. However, the soldiers and workers live for 10 to 14 months.</p>
<h3 id="5-habitat">5. Habitat</h3>
<p><strong>Flying ant killer:</strong>
Flying ants are outdoor insects usually thriving in warm and wet conditions. Youre likely to see them flying around your garden and near sources of light, such as near the door and window. They only come indoors in search of food, such as food debris.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites usually venture in indoor spaces, especially in hidden cavities in the house foundations and wooden materials, among other places. So if you see damages on your wooden materials, this could be the
work of termites
.</p>
<h3 id="5-threatdamage">5. Threat/Damage</h3>
<p><strong>Flying ants:</strong>
Since their diet mainly entails food debris and nectar, flying ants will not damage your plants, flowers, or wooden surfaces. Their only problem is that they mess your home with their wings and dead bodies. Plus, some species can sting when provoked.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites pose the biggest threat to your property, especially wooden materials. They dig holes into wooden materials as they extract cellulose for their food.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-flying-ants"><strong>How to Get Rid of Flying Ants</strong></h2>
<p>Although flying ants do not destroy your property, theyre often very annoying and scary to have around your home. They not only come into the house but also make your home very untidy.
Luckily, you can effectively eradicate flying ants using both commercial and do-it-yourself
home remedies, even for fleas
.� Below is a brief outline of some practical methods for eliminating and preventing flying ants.</p>
<h3 id="1-house-tidiness">1. House Tidiness</h3>
<p>Cleaning your house and getting
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">rid of food debris deprives flying ants</a>
of something to eat. Ensure that all leftovers are thrown away and all food is kept in closed containers.</p>
<h3 id="2-use-insecticides">2. Use Insecticides</h3>
<p>Commercial insecticides such as aerosols and poison
baits can be used to kill
flying ants. In aerosols, get a product that kills ants instantly and continues to kill ants that come into contact with the treated surfaces.
Use slow-acting poison baits so that ants can take back the poison to the rest of the colony. This gives you the possibility of eradicating an entire ant colony.</p>
<h3 id="3diatomaceous-earthde">3.Diatomaceous Earth(DE)</h3>
<p>DE can provide an effective remedy for flying ants if used around common sources of food. DE kills works by breaking through the insects exoskeleton and dehydrating it to death.
Sprinkle a thin layer of DE around common entry points and feeding locations. As the insects contact DE, the sharp microscopic granules will pierce through their
hard outer shell
and cause dehydration.</p>
<h3 id="4-homemade-solutions">4. Homemade Solutions</h3>
<p>If you dont want to use chemicals in your home, you can embark on one or more homemade solutions. Make a solution using peppermint
essential oil for bed bugs,
dish soap, and water.
Use a
spray bottle to apply the solution to the flying ants
. This solution works by suffocation and dehydration.�This method works effectively when you spray directly on the insects.</p>
<h3 id="5-bug-zappers">5. Bug zappers</h3>
<p>Bug zappers can be placed inside the house and around the compound. Ants will be attracted to the light and obviously be killed by the electric shock.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-termites"><strong>How to Get Rid of Termites</strong></h2>
<p>Termites are worse than flying ants. When
termites raid your home
, they can create the worst damage you can imagine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their appetite for cellulose results in unimaginable damage to wooden materials, including furniture, roofing frames, attics, ceiling boards, and so on.
Measures for eradicating
termites should entail both prevention and treatment
procedures to avoid damages to your property. Below are some important treatment and
prevention interventions for termites
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-home-maintenance">1. Home Maintenance</h3>
<p>Before using any chemical or homemade products to kill termites, ensure your home is completely unattractive to them. This can be done by clearing any clutter that may allow them to build foraging or mud tubes.
Wood, timber, or paper piles near the houses foundation provide good avenues for termites to build colonies and access your house. Logs, wood, and timber should be kept in designated areas away from house foundations. Plus, stumps in the garden should be uprooted.</p>
<h3 id="2-chemical-treatments">2. Chemical Treatments</h3>
<p>Chemical treatments such as termite sprays will give you the best solution for your termite menace. These include some of the most
effective termite killers
.
They contain powerful active ingredients that kill termites instantly and continue to kill termites that come back to the treated area.</p>
<h3 id="3-termite-baits">3. Termite Baits</h3>
<p>Termite baits
are chunks of food materials that lure termites into eating poison. They are meant to kill slowly to allow the worker termites to take the poisoned bait back to the colony.
Poisoned baits, therefore, provide an
effective way of eradicating a whole termite
colony.</p>
<h3 id="4-nematodes">4. Nematodes</h3>
<p>Deploying beneficial nematodes around a termite colony will effectively get rid of these insects.
Nematodes work by releasing toxic bacteria inside the insects digestive system, thus killing them. Termites are hard to spot whenever they invade our homes.
A single treatment wont be
useful since termites
create new colonies in a short time. Therefore, it is essential to have a scheduled termite inspection routine to detect and dismantle any termite development - through
fumigation
.</p>
<h3 id="5diatomaceous-earth">5.Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>DE contains microscopic particles that can break through a termites body. The desiccating effect from DE kills the insect through dehydration - this is one of the
natural termite control methods
.
Spread a thin layer of a food-grade DE on areas most frequented by termites, such as house foundation, woodpiles, and other wooden materials.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Both flying ants and termites are quite unwelcome in our houses. Flying ants will mess your home without causing any significant damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, termites are dreadful because of their ability to destroy wooden materials.</li>
<li>If youre unsure which type of pest youre dealing with, its important to make proper identification to avoid using the wrong pest eradication method.
With this guide, it will be relatively easy to differentiate a flying ant from a termite.</li>

<h3 id="1-boric-acid-and-peanut-butter-straws">1. Boric Acid and Peanut Butter Straws</h3>
<dl>
<dt>These are excellent homemade ant killers to eradicate ants without exposing your kids and pets to toxic substances.</dt>
<dt>Since the peanut butter and the moderately toxic</dt>
<dt>boric acid</dt>
<dt>are contained in the plastic straws, there are fewer chances of being ingested by kids and pets.</dt>
<dt>The bait does not leave a sticky mess on your floor or any surface it is left.</dt>

<dt>:</dt>
<dt>Boric acid</dt>
<dt>and Peanut butter</dt>
<dt><em>Equipment</em></dt>
<dd>Plastic straws, Mixing bowl, Spoon or whisk, and a knife
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix 1 teaspoon of boric acid with one teaspoon of peanut butter in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Fill plastic straws with the paste.</li>
<li>Cut the straws into 2-inch pieces and place them in places most frequented by ants.</li>
<li>Ants will be attracted by the peanut butter and get killed by the boric acid. Ants are social creatures that love doing everything together.</li>
<li>So, they will take the pieces back to the colony, hence distributing the poison to more ants.

<h3 id="2-food-grade-diatomaceous-earth-ant-killer"><strong>2. Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth Ant killer</strong></h3>
<p>Diatomaceous earth powder provides a non-toxic and inexpensive way to kill ants at home. DE powder is available from a local shop or online.
It contains sharp microscopic pieces that pierce into the insects exoskeleton.
Once inside the body, the pieces will dehydrate the insect to death. The powder is, however, not dangerous to humans and other animals.
<em>Requirements</em>
:
Diatomaceous earth
powder.
<strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Begin by accessing your house to locate the infested places, trails, and common entry points.</li>
<li>To use DE powder, spread a generous amount on groups of ants and create a barrier around them. Also, apply a thin layer along the trails.</li>
<li>Apply the powder on the floor, baseboards, windows, and any crack that you usually see ants coming out from. In very narrow spaces, you can dust the powder using a soft cloth or duster. Just dip the cloth in the powder and flick it over the cracks.</li>
<li>Check the area after one or two days for dead ants. If theres no more ant activity, you can clean the area andwash it with soap. This will clear the pheromones to prevent more ants from coming in.</li>
<li>If the ants migrate to other locations or create alternative tracks, reapply the DE powder on these surfaces.</li>
<li>For outdoor use, apply the DEpowder along the building&rsquo;sfoundation to kill ants at their entry points. Apply a generous amount at the most notorious entry points to kill as many ants as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3-sugary-baking-soda-ant-killer"><strong>3. Sugary Baking Soda Ant Killer</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt>If youre looking for a natural and non-toxic ant killer, then you can prepare one at home using baking soda.</dt>
<dt>Its a safe recipe to use inside the house. However, it can harm your pets if consumed in large amounts.</dt>
<dt>Ants may shy away from the baking soda. But the sugar in this recipe will attract them to the bait.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dd>Baking soda and Confectioners Sugar
<em>Equipment</em></dd>
<dd>Measuring spoon, Jar lids, and Mixing bowl
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix equal portions of baking soda and confectioners sugar in a mixing bowl. Confectioners&rsquo; sugar is used because ants cannot differentiate it from baking soda. If you use regular sugar, ants will eat sugar and leavebaking soda.</li>
<li>Put the mixture in several jar lids and place them in strategic places in the house. Place the bait at the cracks they use to access your house and common meeting points.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the bait in narrow cracks such as along the baseboard.</li>
<li>Wipe out the mess in your house after the ants have died.</li>
<li>For outdoor use, sprinkle the bait along the foundation of the house and entry points.</li>
<li>Also, treat the ant mounds and common nesting locations such as trees, woodpiles, and stone piles.</li>
<li>If you are worried about your pets ingesting the bait, it is a bottle and places it in strategic locations. Ants will climb into the bottle and consume the bait. Your pets cannot reach the bait.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-boric-acid-and-sugar-liquid-ant-trap">4. Boric Acid and Sugar Liquid Ant Trap</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Boric acid and sugar liquid is a tried and tested homemade recipe for use against sugar ants such as Pharoah ants, Argentine ants, and house ants.</dt>
<dt>Borax is a very effective insect killer</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>The goal here is to mix it with a substance that will attract sugar ants to the bait-I use sugar.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dd>Boric acid, Sugar, and Warm water
<em>Equipment</em></dd>
<dd>Mixing bowl
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix 30g of boric acid with about 250g of sugar in a mixing bowl. Your bowl should be large enough to hold water.</li>
<li>Add water while stirring to prevent the formation of lumps.</li>
<li>Stir until all the boric acid and sugar is dissolved into a thin paste</li>
<li>To lay your bait, find a suitable location, preferably an area where ants love to congregate.</li>
<li>Pour the paste into jar lids and distribute them around the area. Pour some baits on the surface near the jar lids to lure the ants into the bait stations.</li>
<li>Leave the bait undisturbed for a couple of days. Ants will eat the bait and take more to their nest. Keep on refilling the jar lids with the bait until you get satisfactory results.</li>
<li>Store the remaining bait in a labeled, airtight container away from the reach of kids and pets. Keep it in a cool dark place.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-vinegar-and-water-ant-spray"><strong>5. Vinegar and Water Ant Spray</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt>Vinegar works in two ways against ants - a great homemade ant killer. When sprayed directly on the ants, it can kill them instantly.</dt>
<dt>You can also</dt>
<dt>spray on the bed bug trails</dt>
<dt>, entry points, and emerging points to deter them. Ants hate vinegar because it blocks their communication aids (pheromones).</dt>
<dt>This prevents ants inside the house from following the trail of others and deters new entries. Vinegar also discourages ants from your house by interfering with their ability to smell food.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dt>:</dt>
<dt>Apple vinegar</dt>
<dt>and Water</dt>
<dt><em>Equipment</em></dt>
<dd>Spray bottle
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix equal portions of cider vinegar and water in a spray bottle.</li>
<li>Shake the contents thoroughly until they mix properly</li>
<li>To use the solution, spray on ant trails. Usually, ants will follow the scents of others in the trail. Spraying along the trail will deter ants from following the path they have been using.</li>
<li>Spray the solution in areas where ants usually emerge out in large numbers, such as baseboards, cabinets, and windows. This will prevent the ants outside the house from picking up the scent.</li>
<li>For a large number of ants, you can saturate them withvinegar to killthem. Allow some time and come back to wipe the carcasses.</li>
<li>Apply the vinegar solution at least two times a week. For more effectiveness, you can increase the vinegar concentration.

<dt>Most of the household ants love to</dt>
<dt>eat sweet food</dt>
<dt>. They cant resist the corn syrup in this recipe. Its easy to make ant bait using simple over the counter ingredients.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dd>Boric acid and Corn syrup
<em>Equipment</em></dd>
<dd>Mixing bowl and Spoon or whisk

<ol>
<li>Mix about one teaspoon of boric acid with three teaspoons of corn syrup in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Stir thoroughly to make a fine paste.</li>
<li>Place small bits of the paste on a waxed paper or card.</li>
<li>Place your bait in areas where ants like to congregate. The sweet substance is quite irresistible to these critters.</li>
<li>They will feast on it and take some back to their colony. Give the ants ample time to share the poison with the rest of the colony.</li>
<li>For more effectiveness, add fresh drops after every two days.</li>
<li>Store the remaining bait in an airtight container and at room temperature. Keep the substance out of reach of children and pets.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="7-cinnamon-solution"><strong>7. Cinnamon Solution</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt>As an essential oil, cinnamon can be used to repel and kill ants. Ants cannot withstand the smell of cinnamon. So, you can keep them away by treating your surfaces with the recipe.</dt>
<dt>It will repel those already in the house and prevent new ones from entering the house.�Cinnamon oil is</dt>
<dt>safe to use around kids and pets</dt>

<li>To kill ants, spray-on directly on them. For more effectiveness, use higher concentrations of the cinnamon solution.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="8-dish-soap-and-water-ant-spray"><strong>8. Dish Soap and Water Ant Spray</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt>A dish soap solution is another effective do-it-yourself</dt>
<dt>remedy for eradicating ants in your home</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>Its one of the safest methods to use indoors without worrying about your kids and pets. Ants use their joints for breathing. So, you can easily suffocate them to death with the dish soap solution.</dt>

<h3 id="11-borax-and-jelly-ant-killer"><strong>11. Borax and Jelly ant killer</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt>If ants have invaded your house or compound, you can make an effective ant bait using your choice&rsquo;s borax and jelly.</dt>

<p>For an ant, it can take anywhere from 24-48 hours to die after eating borax or boric acid bait.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax can kill ants, but the ants do their work for you. Forager or worker ants will carry the borax bait back to their nests and share it with other ants.
Though it may take anywhere from 24-48 hours, the ants will feed and share the borax amongst themselves; this will gradually kill off an entire colony of ants, eventually killing their queen.</li>

There are a few signs that can help you determine whether or not ants have invaded your home.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Look for ant mounds: Ants will make small, dome-shaped hills out of the dirt in order to live. As time goes on these mounds become more frequent and larger; they may also be close together as the colony grows over time.</li>
<li>Look for ant trails: If you see long lines of tiny insects wandering aimlessly around your house then that&rsquo;s a big sign an infestation is underway - and something needs to be done! These trails will sometimes lead up walls or seem like they&rsquo;re going nowhere at all these ants might be looking for food or nesting areas; other times theres actually nothing going on, and the ants are just exploring.</li>
<li>If you think your home is infested with ants: You&rsquo;ll need to look for any sources of food or water that might be attracting them - like crumbs from a forgotten piece of toast, sugar stuck in small crevices around counters, or sipping some spilled milk. The best way to tackle an ant invasion is by eliminating these temptations first before applying other methods (like sprinkling borax).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget about traps! Setting up bait stations near entrances can help stop new invaders from coming inside which will ultimately make things much easier down the road. Ants also don&rsquo;t seem to recognize many scents as dangerous so using peppermint oil may not work; you can also use cinnamon oil, which has been proven to be very effective.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re done inspecting and bait-setting up, it&rsquo;s time to start the borax treatment plan by sprinkling some on every surface that ants are known to crawl: Your kitchen countertops and floors, windowsills, window ledges (make sure not do this if your home is in a high rise because they&rsquo;ll just walk right off), under furniture legs where pets like to sleep or eat; anywhere there might be crumbs for them to feast on.

<h2 id="how-to-do-ant-baiting">How to Do Ant Baiting</h2>
<p>On ant baiting, here are a few tips for getting ants to take your bait back to the colony, which will help ensure that you dont have any ants come back.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid ant sprays - Sprays are an effective insecticide for killing any type of pest, but should not be used around ant baits. Spraying near your ants&rsquo; bait usually deters or repels them from eating it.</li>
<li>Positions baits on trails - To work successfully, ant bait must be situated near trails. Ants often forage in groups or &ldquo;trails.&rdquo; If you can locate where the ants are trailing, this is an ideal location to place and best bait.</li>
<li>Remove Harborage places - Ants will nest in dark places where they are well hidden, like in the yard or leaf piles. So, frequently clean up and make sure your house is not cluttered.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t disturb - Don&rsquo;t kill ants that come around the borax bait. These are scouts who help find food for their colonies - they will carry the bait on their back to their nest.</li>
<li>Remove food sources - Keep your home as clean as possible in order to help prevent ants from coming into contact with any food sources. Also, store all of your food inside containers that have tight-fitting lids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-borax-kill-the-queen-ant">Will borax kill the queen ant?</h2>
<p>Borax or boric acid combined with a sugary substance to make a liquid bait will kill adult�ants including the queen.</p>
<ul>
<li>But to kill ant larvae, create a borax bait with white sugar and borax (at a ratio of 1:1) and mix these ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed.</li>
<li>The larvae are more sensitive than adult ants so this mixture is lethal for them and also kills some insects such as termites.</li>
<li>Place baits on ant trails. This includes any surfaces where ants are found, such as railings, sidewalks, and walls.
For best results use this method during the late evening when all types of ants are present and feeding but before midnight because that is when most immature stages die off naturally.</li>
<li>Also, leave out baits containing sugar after sunset since these become ineffective at night unless you add another attractant (such as sugary aphid honeydew) which will only work for ants that are attracted to sweet substances.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="does-20-mule-team-borax-kill-ants">Does 20 Mule Team Borax kill ants?</h2>
<p>Mixing 20 Mule Team Borax with sugar in a ratio as close to your count (for example if you have 50 ants then make it half sugar and half Borax) so each ant eats its share and dies.</p>
<p>20 Mule Team Borax is very good at controlling a wide variety of insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Or perhaps it might be easier just to use borax, which you can find in stores.

<h2 id="how-does-terro-ant-baits-kill-ants">How Does TERRO Ant Baits Kill Ants?</h2>
<p>TERRO liquid ant baits are pesticide-free bait that will attract and kill ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alkaline borax is an ingredient found in many different products, but its safe to assume that having water close to boiling temperature will quickly solve any household ants coming into contact with your cereal, oatmeal or spices.
The poison causes the ant&rsquo;s stomach to burst, killing almost instantly. Ants soon starve from lack of energy and die as their digestive tract shuts down due to this persistent source of alkaloid poison (borate).</li>
</ul>
<p>The borax in the bait will eventually kill the worker ants. However, it works slowly enough to allow for a few trips by a foraging ant before the effect is lethal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the course of a few days, you will likely start to see lower numbers of ants in your home or around the bait.
When using an ant bait station, it is important not to disturb the bait until the ants are fully fed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes! It Works Slow Enough That Allows For Trips By A Foraging Ant Before Effect Is Lethal.</p>

<ul>
<li>Presence of children playing, or pets</li>
<li>Uncovered and used or dirty utensils in the infested area such as in the kitchen</li>

<h3 id="v-the-frequency-of-control-service">v. The Frequency of Control Service</h3>
<p>You will pay less per visit to ant-infested if you contact the same exterminator for every control service for future inspection.
For instance, when you engage the exterminator on three-month regular service visits, youll realize that it will cost you less than 1/2 of the corresponding charge for a one-time treatment. Instead of paying $500 dollars for a visit, you will actually end up paying 250 dollars.
Assuming you opt for a yearly plan, you will be shocked your monthly charges will be as low as $50- $70. The benefit of such long-term contracts is that they cover a variety of pests and not just one kind. Common pests that may be covered in these agreements include:</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="-iiactual-ant-treatment">**�� II.**Actual Ant Treatment</h3>

Some companies will even recommend sanitation measures for you to ensure long-term control of the insects.
The basis, and certainly your guiding principle, is for you to understand that a licensed professional can better handle the ant problem.

avoid their bites
.</p>
<p>Even though you may normally come across ants in your house devouring food crumbs or colonizing your back yard, but when ants invade your car they can be a hazardous distraction.</p>
<p>If you are tired of all the failed attempts to get rid of ants in your car, read our detailed guide to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why ants get in your car</li>
<li>How to identify different kinds of ants</li>
<li>What techniques to apply to get rid of ants in the car
Ants are not too picky when it comes to choosing a place to nest. Theyll feel at home anywhere as long as it is moist, warm and has a food supply nearby  even if its your car! And when this happens, you should be prepared to be bugged and have damaged wires, switches or cables in your dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-ants-invade-your-car">Why Ants Invade Your Car</h2>
<p>To be able to effectively get rid of ants in the car, it is important to understand why they infested there in the first place. Cars are an uncommon place for ants to nest, but when they do it is due to either one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your car was parked near an <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-naturally-outside/">ant</a> colony for a long time. Ant colonies are normally near a kitchen or trash cans, so if your garage is nearby, this is probably why they got into your car.</li>
<li>You have water leaking in or near your car. Many ants like to nest near water sources just like they do near food sources.</li>
<li>Your car has the odor of stale or sweet-smelling food. If ants detect this smell they will quickly invade the car.
Whatever the reason, it all comes down to food. But if you have found ants in your car, will they stay there forever? Ants usually have two main motives when taking over any place.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accidental-infestation">Accidental Infestation</h3>
<p>It is possible that some ants accidentally stumbled across your car in search of food. Even if you threw away the food cans or cleaned all the leftovers in your car, the smell of food probably stayed for some time and attracted some ants meanwhile. If you have found ants in the car during this phase, theres no need to worry. Their stay is only temporary and will leave when they find no food.</p>

<h3 id="permanent-infestation">Permanent Infestation</h3>
<p>It is hard to get rid of ants in the car when they decide to inhabit your car permanently. This happens when ants have evidence of food sources being present in the car. They may either start transferring the food to their colonies or just simply colonize your car instead. Anything ranging from food wrappers to sticky soda residue can attract ants in the car. Some experts have suggested that even the insulation of wires is enough to attract ants because it emits a slight scent of vanilla when its warm. The trick is to instantly take measures to get rid of ants in the car as soon as you see ants crowding.</p>
<h2 id="identify-the-type-of-ants-in-your-car">Identify the Type of Ants in Your Car</h2>
<p>You may feel that it is useless to put time and effort in the identification of ants. But did you know that out of thousands of ant species, only a few species are likely to nest in cars? Even the slightest knowledge of ant species can spare you plenty of time when deciding which technique to use to get rid of ants in the car.</p>
<h3 id="carpenter-ants">Carpenter Ants</h3>
<p>Appearing in shades of red and black, a carpenter ant is a quarter to half an inch in size. These can mostly be found near trees and tend to eat insects and anything with a sweet taste. Carpenter ants are usually active at night and if you disturb them they emit a strong smell to warn other ants. So you will have to devise a plan that could trap all carpenter ants at once.</p>
<h3 id="pharaoh-ants">Pharaoh Ants</h3>
<p>These light-colored ants can appear to be anywhere between yellow to light brown. Pharaoh ants are smaller in size  almost 1/16 inches long! They feed on insects, sweets, fats, and proteins, but prefer to nest near a water source. Their size allows for fast reproduction and enables them can quickly change locations if they get too crowded or disturbed.</p>
<h3 id="thief-ants">Thief Ants</h3>
<p>Extremely small in size, thief ants love greasy foods and proteins. These light brown ants live near other ant nests so that they can easily steal food.</p>
<h3 id="pavement-ants">Pavement Ants</h3>
<p>These dark-colored ants are aggressive to other ants. They can be found nesting near lawns or under stones or wood. Pavement ants feed on both greasy and sweet food.</p>
<h2 id="5-simple-ways-of-dealing-with-ants-in-the-car">5 simple Ways of Dealing with Ants in the Car</h2>
<p>Now that you know why and what kind of ants infested your car, choose one or a combination of the following ways to get rid of ants in the car for good.</p>
<h3 id="1-change-parking-locations">1. Change Parking Locations</h3>
<p>This is the first thing to do when you spot ants in your car. If your parking spot is near trees or bushes, it is likely to make it convenient for ants such as carpenter ants to check out for food.</p>
<p>We suggest that you keep changing your cars parking location now and then to discourage ants from nesting. And dont forget to keep your windows closed at all times to restrict access.</p>
<h3 id="2-thoroughly-clean-the-car">2. Thoroughly Clean the Car</h3>
<p>The easiest way to get rid of ants in the car is by thoroughly cleaning it. A spotless and properly vacuumed car will not only be free of any attractive food source for the ants but will also force them to move away. To ensure that your car is clean you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove any food wrappers, packaging or leftover food items in your car.</li>
<li>Vacuum the crevices of your car seats</li>
<li>Wash out any surface and car floor mats</li>
<li>Dust off all the interior edges and surface of the car</li>
<li>Clean all the food stains on seats, dashboard or center console using a chemical cleaner</li>
<li>Slide the seats backward to access the floor underneath

</ul>
<h3 id="3-wash-the-car-exterior">3. Wash the Car Exterior</h3>
<p>If parking at a different spot doesnt help, chances are that the ants had already set up a trail to follow. All kinds of ants leave behind traces of pheromones that help them to direct other ants toward the food source. So your car will still be accessible to these ants if it is not too much out of the smelling range of ant colonies.</p>
<p>Washing the exterior body of your car will eliminate these pheromones and clean out any tracks that the ants could use to trace back in the car. This technique will help you to get rid of ants in the car if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Properly wash the tires. To deter ants from climbing the tires, use a certified chemical to clean the wheels of your car.</li>
<li>Polish the undercarriage. Hire a professional to polish the undercarriage of your car using a pest repellent to keep the ants away in the future as well.</li>
<li>Clean under the hood. Ants usually find interesting places to get into the car. Cleaning the area around the engine of the car will kill any ants that are hiding there.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-try-natural--diy-remedies">4. Try Natural &amp; DIY Remedies</h3>
<p>Non-toxic remedies can be an efficient way of getting rid of ants in the car. These are ideal to opt for if you have children who frequently travel in your car or play around it. Some of the best options to choose from are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cayenne Pepper. Spread this pepper around the tires of your car and even inside it. Its deterrent properties will keep the ants away.</li>
<li>**Lemon extract.**Squeeze lemons in a bottle of water and then spray the mixture in areas where there are colonies of ants. Because ants hate the smell of lemon, they will soon vacate the car.</li>
<li>Chalk. Draw lines around your car and its tires with chalk. It is made up of calcium carbonate which acts as an ant repellent.</li>
<li>Table salt. Boil water and add some salt in it. Then spray this mixture over infested areas.</li>
<li>Peppermint. Spray or apply diluted peppermint oil in infested areas. It will drive the ants away and leave a pleasant smell behind.</li>
<li>Clove Essential Oil. This fragrant oil acts as a great insecticide and is safe use.</li>
<li>Diatomaceous earth. Dust the earth along the entry points to get rid of ants in the car.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-set-up-ant-traps">5. Set Up Ant Traps</h3>
<p>If cleaning is not keeping the ants away and you dont have time to carry out the home remedies, you should probably resort to ant traps.</p>
<p>If the infestation is really bad and you want to get rid of ants in the car immediately, you will need toxic traps or pesticides to eliminate the problem. The pesticides are easy to use and can be placed near the entry points of ants or on their trail.</p>
<p>Ant traps will trap any ants in your car by using baits to attract them and since these baits are poisonous, the ants will be killed in the process. Some benefits of using ant traps instead of pesticides are:</p>
<ul>
<li>They dont contaminate the inside of your car.</li>
<li>They are odorless so you will not experience any unpleasant smells.</li>
<li>They come in different forms including granules, liquid, and gels.</li>
<li>If one ant eats the bait, it carries the poison back to its colony where it destroys the ant population

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You must have noticed some
<a href="http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Formicidae/">ants</a>
, maybe little or black, in your bathroom. Did the ants in the bathroom appear at the same time last year? Are the ants also in the upstairs bathroom?</p>
<p>Well, this is a worrying issue, mainly when you have yourself, kids, and pets around the house and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-%5Bant%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-car/)-killer/">kitchen</a>
. Therefore, how do you get rid of <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-naturally-outside/">ants</a> in the bathroom?
<strong>First:�</strong>
Ants appearing in the bathroom is not an uncommon occurrence. They are attracted by
human hair
, stagnant water, or drains. Also, ants are attracted by lotions, perfumes, and toothpaste due to their sweet taste and smell.</p>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Ants Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="characteristic-features-of-ants-">**Characteristic features of ants **</h2>
<p><strong>-</strong>
Ants can bite and sting, but most are harmless, with no venom. Ants measure about a length of 0.6 to 0.9 cm and have six legs and 3-4 abdominal segments.
<strong>-</strong>
A characteristic feature of ants is the metapleural gland that produces phenylacetic acid to fight bacteria and fungi.</p>
<ul>
<li>The metapleural gland is created from 2 cell clusters that point to 2 chambers at the back of the insects middle section. However, the metapleural gland is not present in all ants, particularly among the arboreal species.
<strong>-</strong>
The ants head connects to the thorax through the as thin neck. Further, the thorax connects to the abdomen through a thin &ldquo;waist.&rdquo;
<strong>-</strong>
However, the main distinguishing feature of ants is their waist pinched down at the back in the link with its abdomen.</li>

<h3 id="1-understand-the-ant-colony-">**1. Understand the ant colony� **</h3>
<p>Knowing the specific insect that is in your bathroom will be important, particularly when determining which
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flying-ants-vs-termites/">pest control</a>
product of the method to use.</p>
<p>Notably, ants have over 12,000 species globally. For example, there are black and red ants. Ants are considered
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality">eusocial insects</a>
that are in the Formicidae family.</p>
<p>Other insects in the Formicidae family and order Hymenoptera are ichneumons, sawflies, and wasps.
Where is the queen?
Ants live in a colony with the drones, soldiers, queen, and worker ants. The queen bee is a critical part of the ant colony as it lays all the eggs that hatch into ants. The queen does not leave its nest and is thus difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>However, to wipe out the ant colony from your bathroom, you should devise ways to kill the queen and stop the ants&rsquo; reproduction process.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you only
spray the visible ants
, the ant colony will continue growing.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-attracting-the-trailing-ant"><strong>2. What is attracting the trailing ant?</strong></h3>
<p>Youll need to trail the ants and determine what is attracting them to your bathroom. Therefore, youll need to watch the ants determine their origin and destination in your house.</p>
<p>Notably, an ant that finds food leaves a trail on its way back to its nest, and thus, other ants will follow the same trail to come for food at the same location.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll mainly see sugar ants in the yard, under rocks, on trees, and if you are not careful, in your home. They are mainly attracted to sugary foods and scraps and they will do anything to gain entry into your home to find them.</p>
<p>These� insect&rsquo;s body size allows them to gain entry into your home through the tiniest spaces.�Sugar ants can be extremely annoying to most homeowners.�Let&rsquo;s get into the details of how to get rid of sugar ants once and for all:</p>
<h2 id="a-natural-methods">A. Natural Methods</h2>
<h3 id="1-keep-your-house-clean-especially-the-kitchen">1. Keep your house clean, especially the kitchen</h3>
<p>The typical sugar ant diet consists of anything they can find lying around in your home. Even a tiny crumb from a snack you hastily devoured might be enough to attract hundreds of ants to your home. Always keep your home clean and surfaces free from food scraps that might attract ants. Make sure you clean dirty dishes in the sink and dispose of your trash regularly. Wipe down the counters thoroughly, dust your shelves, vacuum your floors, and have professionals clean the carpet regularly.</p>
<h3 id="2-soapy-water">2. Soapy Water</h3>
<p>Dishwashing soap and other detergents can double up as pest killers in various circumstances. Just mix some soap with water and pour it into a spray bottle. Soap has a certain scent that acts as a deterrent against sugar ants and when sprayed directly on the ants, it can kill them.</p>
<h3 id="3-store-your-food-properly">3. Store your food properly</h3>
<p>Leaving your food open and exposed is almost like sending the sugar ants an invitation into your home. Keep your perishable food items such as fruits and vegetables safely locked away in the fridge where the ants can&rsquo;t access them. Your non-perishable food items such as cereals should be stored in airtight containers then kept in cabinets where the ants can&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-vinegar">4. Use Vinegar</h3>
<p>Vinegar can be an effective ant deterrent when used creatively. It contains acetic acid which is a powerful ant deterrent and also removes the scent of ant trails preventing other ants from using the same route to access your home. You just need to combine equal parts vinegar and water into a spray bottle and blitz the areas you&rsquo;ve either spotted ant activity before or where you want to ensure sugar ants never get to, such as kitchen surfaces.</p>
<p>The only drawback with vinegar is that it only keeps ants at bay when its scent is still strong, which doesn&rsquo;t last that long. You will need a full spray bottle if you choose to use this method for a while.</p>
<h3 id="5-coffee-grounds">5. Coffee Grounds</h3>
<p>If you are a coffee lover, you will love this one! Instead of getting rid of your coffee grounds, you can use them to repel sugar ants. Ants hate the burning acidity and smell of coffee grounds. You can sprinkle them around your home or in areas where you want to repel ants, such as near pet bowls.</p>
<h3 id="6-cloves-bay-leaves-or-garlic">6. Cloves, Bay Leaves or Garlic</h3>
<p>The compounds responsible for the strong smell in bay leaves and cloves are also highly effective for repelling sugar ants. Garlic also has a strong odor that throws ants off their scent trails and confuses them. Lay out bay leaves and whole cloves along baseboards and other areas where you want to repel ants.</p>
<h3 id="7-homemade-ant-repellent">7. Homemade ant repellent</h3>
<p>You can easily make your own insect repellent at home by combining water with peppermint or lavender essential oils and spraying it on ant infested areas.</p>
<h3 id="8-homemade-ant-trap">8. Homemade ant trap</h3>
<p>You can easily make an ant trap by smearing a sweet and sticky substance like honey or corn syrup on a plate and placing it in areas where you know sugar ants have invaded. The sugar attracts ants to the plate but since it&rsquo;s sticky, the ants will be stuck giving you a chance to annihilate them.</p>
<h2 id="b-chemical-methods">B. Chemical Methods</h2>
<h2 id="1-ant-killer-sprays-and-insecticides">1. Ant killer sprays and insecticides</h2>
<p>There are commercial ant killer sprays or insecticides that you can use to kill ants in your home. However, remember that such products contain toxic chemicals that can be harmful to you, your kids or pets. Be careful when using them.</p>
<h3 id="2-ant-bait">2. Ant Bait</h3>
<p>This is where you use a poisonous bait disguised as ant food to destroy an entire colony. The idea is to trick the ants into carrying the bait back to their colony as food. Once the ants eat the bait, they&rsquo;ll slowly begin to die. Most ant baits contain borax or boric acid which is a slow-acting ant poison.</p>
<p>If you have tried all these methods and failed( which is highly unlikely), your next best option is to hire a professional exterminator to come in and deal with the ant problem for you once and for all.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>There are 3 easy and safe ways to get rid of the ants from carpets; you can use some <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">ant</a> carpet powder, ant bait, baking powder, or borax. All these 3 methods are very effective and reliable though there are other ways too that you can employ.</strong>
Before eliminating the ants from carpets, you need to understand what draws them to your carpet. Remember that ants dont eat carpets and therefore finding them in your carpets is something to worry about.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-ants-from-carpet-the-safest-ways-of-doing-it">How to Remove Ants from Carpet? The Safest Ways of Doing It</h2>
<p>Most ants that you are seeing on your carpet are there because they were attracted by something.
Food droppings are the first thing that attracts them to your house and the carpet. You can control them by:</p>
<h3 id="1-using-ant-carpet-powder"><strong>1. Using Ant Carpet Powder</strong></h3>
<p>Anti-ant carpet powder is a pest control product that is used to control ants. If ants have all over the carpet, you can use this powder to control them.
This
powder is very effective
especially when the ants infestation is much. With this powder, all you need is to sprinkle it on the carpet and the ants will start dying immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those that are lucky will run but cannot survive for long before they die.</li>
<li>When that is done, you can clean your carpet with a vacuum cleaner or by other means.
Be cautious because it can be harmful to you, your children, or your pets. Always wear gloves before using them and keep the children and pets when sprinkling. Remember to do vacuum clean the carpet,</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-using-baits-">**2. Using Baits **</h3>
<p>This is so far the best way to rid the carpets from your carpet. But this only works if the level of an ant infestation is low.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the powder, you set the baits as food to the ants. They are placed around the carpet so that the ants can pick is as food and take them to the nest.</li>
<li>Upon eating all the ants in the nest will die. The bait kills the ants from the source but if the ants are many, it, may not be the best method of control.
The good part with using baits is that your carpet remains clean from the dirt of dead ants. It is also safer to use even when you have kids and pets in the house.
As a precaution, baits are more effective if kept around the carpet. Apart from the carpets, you can also set these baits on other parts of the house like the kitchen and bedroom among others.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-using-baking-soda-">**3. Using Baking Soda **</h3>
<p>Baking soda can be a very good agent of killing ants in your home. It is both a natural way and also safe to use with our homes.</p>
<ul>
<li>But when you opt to use this method, you have to mix the baking soda with some sugar so that you can attract the ants to eat it.</li>
<li>You can then sprinkle it around the carpet. When the ants eat it, their stomachs bloat and they end up dying.
Sugar is not the only agent you can use with baking soda because you can also use diatomaceous earth (DE) or boric powder.</li>
<li>When you mix it with diatomaceous earth, it also works very well also in controlling bedbugs and roaches.</li>
<li>However, when mixed with boric powder, this mixture is harmful and children and pets should be kept off.
Ensure you do a thorough clean before you can let the children and pets in.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-you-use-ant-spray-on-carpet"><strong>Can You Use Ant Spray On Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>No. Though sprays are a good way of controlling ants, they are not recommended for use indoors especially on carpets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their liquid form is likely to have a long residual effect which may later affect your kids and pets. This is also applicable to all other liquid control methods for the ants.</li>
<li>If you have to use them, maybe on the entry points or and cracks in the walls or even outdoors.
For carpet use, powdered ant control products work the best. Remember to vacuum cleaners to remove off the dirt both from leftovers, the dead ants, and the chemical residues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-have-ants-invaded-your-carpet"><strong>Why Have Ants Invaded Your Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>Ants are on your carpet is because of food. Ants dont eat carpet and a closer look at your carpet, you will either find bread crumbs and other sugary leftovers on your carpet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondly, ants also love moist areas. They find an environment under the carpet favorable to make their nests and establish their colonies.</li>
<li>To reduce this, you can use the elimination methods listed above before you can thoroughly clean your carpet.
If you have children in your house, they keep on dropping leftovers, which is a good way of attracting the ants. Regularly clean the carpet after every meal.

</ul>
<h2 id="can-ants-live-under-the-carpet"><strong>Can Ants Live Under The Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>Under the carpets is not really the favorite place for the ants to make their nests.</p>
<ul>
<li>But if the carpet has a lot of leftovers and crumbs, they will make the nests near the food source.</li>
<li>Therefore, if you have seen ants on the carpet, it is also good to check under the carpet too.
Secondly, under the carpet, there is some moist environment which ants prefer. This could also attract them into making their nest there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="natural-home-remedies-for-ants-on-carpets">Natural Home Remedies for Ants on Carpets</h2>
<p>Getting rid of ants at home should be practiced in the safest way possible to avoid harm on the others within the same roof.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have to get rid of the ants from the carpet, using powder forms is much safer than liquid forms.</li>
<li>For instance, using boric powder or baking soda is much safer than using sprays to control ants.
However, the best options still remain keeping your carpet clean at all times to avoid ant infestation. Vacuum cleaning after every meal will avoid too many leftovers in the carpet that can attract ants.

<ul>
<li>Technically, keeping the carpet well cleaned is the best way to keep your carpet free from ants.
As a DIYer applying the methods would work but in extreme cases, you can engage a pest control expert for the assistance of eliminating the ants and other pests.</li>

      <description>The Bigheaded Ants (sceientifically;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bigheaded Ants (sceientifically;
<em>Pheidole megacephala</em>
) is classified as one of the top 100
<a href="https://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/ants/bigheadant.shtml">&ldquo;World&rsquo;s dangerous&rdquo;�invaders</a>
including in businesses and homes.
The Bigheaded Ants will get into your house to forage for water and food through the seams and cracks around the doors and windows or on the house foundation.
But are the Bigheaded Ants really a risk or nuisance to humans? Well, yes&hellip;here&rsquo;s why; First, the ants will leave extensive debris and dirt in the house to feed their colonies. Also, the ants will scavenge and forage persistently both outside and inside the house.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-rid-your-home-of-big-headed-ants">Details: How to Rid Your Home of Big Headed Ants</h2>
<h3 id="identify-the-big-headed-ants">Identify the Big Headed Ants</h3>
<p>This reddish-brown to light-brown ants have 2 workers; the Minor workers (measuring 1/16th Inch and with a smaller head) and the major worker ant (measuring 1/8th Inch and with a large head).</p>
<ul>
<li>Misidentification of the ants may make you choose to use an inappropriateant-control method.
However, the large-sized head will mainly help identify most of the Bigheaded Ants - especially being that its head is very big compared to the rest of its body.</li>
<li>Further, these Bigheaded Ants are mainly found in Hawaii,<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/tiny-red-ants-in-florida/">Florida</a>, and Australia; they&rsquo;re black to reddish-brown and their antennae are segmented.
The Pheidole megacephala is classified to be in the Formicidae family.
You&rsquo;ll find it commonly in Australia (coastal brown ant), and the big-headed ant (USA). The ant species is described as being very invasive and they pose a great risk to the Australian native ants.</li>
<li>These ants live in small colonies and will build their nests in well-shaded and open places - and rarely will they build such dwelling under stone or logs.
In addition, you&rsquo;ll find the nest of these Bigheaded Ants in the soil below landscaping beds and shrubs. The soil nest has many tiny particles that&rsquo;ll form into some crater mounds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inspection-for-big-headed-ants">Inspection for Big Headed Ants</h3>
<p>Following the confirmation that the ants are truly Bigheaded Ants, you&rsquo;ll require to undertake a thorough ant inspection on your property - see the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-much-does-an-ant-exterminator-cost/">cost of an Ant Exterminator Cost</a>
.
In this time, you&rsquo;ll thus require to pinpoint exactly the places that those Bigheaded ants could be hiding or also the objects and location that could have been infested; which means you&rsquo;ll realize the places to concentrate the ant treatment.
<strong>Inspect Areas?�</strong>
For the Bigheaded ants, you&rsquo;ll require to inspect the outdoor spaces since these species don&rsquo;t colonize the indoor areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, I would recommend that you inspect thoroughly under the general clutter, leaf litter, yard debris, bricks, stones, logs, near trees, and the yard.</li>
<li>Additionally, inspect other areas like the driveways, areas near the house slab, and around the pavement.
Check for crevices &amp; cracks in these structures that could point to areas that some Bigheaded ants could use as an entry to your spaces.
Away from the outdoor spaces, you&rsquo;ll also need to inspect some indoor spaces such as bathrooms, basements, attics, and kitchens.</li>
<li>While at it inspect under various appliances, door frames, around window frames, on and near countertops.
<strong>Signs of Bigheaded ants</strong>
The signs to look out for while inspecting for the Bigheaded ants include ant colonies and the foraging (food hunting) trails and then follow these to where the pests are hiding.</li>
<li>Notably, the Bigheaded ants are mainly underground and thus you may require equipment or tools that&rsquo;ll help you dig out the soil or debris such as around the driveway or pavement.
Finally, after you&rsquo;ve seen where the ants are hiding, this will now be a great time to maximize using the chemical ant-treatment options available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="treatment-and-control-options-for-big-headed-ants">Treatment and Control Options for Big Headed Ants</h2>
<p>The treatment and control of the Bigheaded Ant will require you to use various chemical, DIY, or even natural methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, it&rsquo;s important to observe safety while treating the ants. For example, wear appropriate PPEs and follow the various product cautions and instructions of applying the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fire-ant-killer-for-lawns/">ant-treatment products</a>.
As noted above, the Bigheaded Ants will mainly colonize the outdoor areas but it&rsquo;ll be important to treat the indoor &amp; outdoor spaces too.
To effectively treat your spaces for ants, I would recommend that you include Supreme IT and Bifen LP Granules for the outdoors.</li>
<li>Also, include Ant-Trax Ant and Fipro Foaming Aerosol to treat the indoor spaces for ants.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRi1zdgm5C8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRi1zdgm5C8</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-treating-ants-in-outdoor-spaces-includesupreme-it">1. Treating Ants in Outdoor Spaces; Include<strong>Supreme IT</strong></h3>
<p>I recommend including the Supreme IT chemical in your ant-treatment regimen - this chemical allows easy drenching of the ant colony as well as creates a barrier in the yard and for your house and other structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supreme IT for treating ants is known to hold a long residue effect - which is outlined to be about 90 days. Further, the product will kill insects and repel others including the Bigheaded ants.
To create a viable ant-treatment remedy using Supreme IT - you&rsquo;ll require to mix a gallon of 1 ounce of the chemical with about 1 gallon of water and this will help you control the Bigheaded Ant in an area measuring about 1,000 square feet.</li>
<li>But you&rsquo;ll need to calculate and determine how much of the Supreme IT you&rsquo;ll require to mix depending on the footage of the garden to be treated for ants.</li>
<li>For example, if the yard area to be treated for ants is less than 1,000 square feet, then you&rsquo;ll need to mix less than 1 ounce of the Supreme IT.
Remember to apply the Supreme IT mixture on foundations, around yard perimeter, and also to spray on crevices &amp; cracks, plumbing or electrical penetrations, around pet houses, garage doors, rain gutters, soffits, eaves, near gates, door frames, and window frames.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-usebifen-lp-granules">2. Use<strong>Bifen LP Granules�</strong></h3>
<p>The next chemical is an insecticide and it&rsquo;ll treat the various yard insects such as ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>The chemical also has a long residue effect - which is around 3 months and you may distribute it all over your garden.
On the amount to apply, you&rsquo;ll require Bifen LP in the amount of 2.3 pounds to treat ants in an area of about 1,000 square feet of your yard.</li>
<li>For the tools, you&rsquo;ll need to use some hand spreader or the push spreader to apply the Bifen LP.
You may spread the Bifen LP around the trees and flowerbed - the tools will assist in spreading the chemical all over the yard, backyard, or garden.
However, if the yard area is smaller, you&rsquo;ll require to determine the amount of the Bifen LP that&rsquo;s appropriate for that space to effectively exterminate the ants.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-use-ant-gel-bait-ant-trax-and-fipro-aerosol"><strong>3. Use Ant� Gel Bait (Ant-Trax) and Fipro Aerosol�</strong></h3>
<p>The Ant-Trax and Fipro Aerosol ant treatments will be effective for controlling ants that are foraging actively - especially in indoor spaces.
One key advantage of these ant treatments is that they&rsquo;re slow-acting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus the ants will carry them on their body back to their nest where they&rsquo;ll exterminate their colony.
The Fipro Aerosol will be easy to use since it comes in a foaming nature and thus its ingredients will reach very deep places that other pesticides would not.
You&rsquo;ll just need to inject that Fipro Aerosol (using a syringe) into the crevices and cracks where there is the notable activity of the Bigheaded Ant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-use-ant-baits-like-ant-trax-">**3. Use ****Ant Baits like Ant-Trax **</h3>
<p>The Ant-Trax will attract and bait the Bigheaded Ants - it&rsquo;ll be easy to use since you&rsquo;ll simply need a syringe to apply.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ant-control product has a formula that allows the pest to carry the chemicals back to the colony nest - which will finally make the ant population die due to poisoning.
So, you&rsquo;ll simply require to apply some pea-sized Ant-Trax in places where the ants trail and areas like behind appliances, on countertops, door frames, and around window frames.
However, avoid cleaning off the ants that die from the Ant-Trax or Fipro since the pests will require to come into contact with the chemicals and carry them into their colony nests.</li>
<li>Therefore, I recommend you allow about 1 - 2 weeks after applying Ant-Trax or Fipro before doing a thorough cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Notable places that&rsquo;ll require treatment with Fipro Aerosol include the crevice, crack, baseboards, under sinks, near door frames, &amp; window frames.</p>

, or
<a href="https://www.webmd.com/allergies/guide/allergic-reaction-causes">allergic reactions</a>
, and you may require some soothing treatment. In this article, I&rsquo;ll describe how to treat ant bites; what should I do?
<strong>To treat ant bites, hydrocortisone cream &amp; antihistamine will ease the itching. Wash the bite area using water &amp; soap, then smear some antiseptic and an antiseptic like calamine or hydrocortisone.�</strong>
<strong>If there is swelling around the ant bite area, cold-compress that place with an ice pack. Other DIY remedies include apple cider vinegar, olive oil, baking soda &amp; lemon juice, salt, toothpaste, cucumber, and honey.�</strong>
Let&rsquo;s check the details!</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-bites-or-stings-from-ants"><strong>Signs of Bites or Stings from Ants�</strong></h2>
<p>The signs you&rsquo;ll get following the <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">ant</a> bites include pain and itching especially if you&rsquo;re attacked by many ants in a swarm.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, you&rsquo;ll notice that bites from other ant species are less intense compared to the ones caused by fire ants.
General ant bites are less uncomfortable, less itchy or painful, and less red.
The ant bites could also trigger allergic reactions, some redness, and possible swelling. However, observe if the allergic reactions might be extreme since this could be dangerous.
Check for extreme allergic reactions from ant bites; some signs could include dizziness, confusion, tongue &amp; tongue swelling, intense itching &amp; burning, and challenges breathing.

<h2 id="details-how-to-treat-ant-bites-what-should-i-do">Details: How to Treat Ant Bites; What Should I Do?</h2>
<p>An ant bite will leave an itchy (small and painful) lump that will get better within 1 hour. But you could get a tiny or large blister around the ant bite area within 24 hours.</p>
<h3 id="1-soap--water---get-relief-from-ant-bites">1. Soap + Water - Get Relief from Ant Bites</h3>
<p>Experts advise that you treat the ant bites using soap &amp; water - simply wash the bite area with the soap + water and then cover it using some bandage.
You should also apply some ice on the ant bite area to reduce the pain. Other treatments include topical treatments such as antihistamines and steroid creams (over-the-counter).</p>
<ul>
<li>Other professionals approve of using some DIY ant-bites treatment made from<a href="http://fireant.tamu.edu/files/2011/12/FAPFS023_2002rev_Medical.pdf">bleach and water</a>.</li>
<li>Another solution would be using astringents, aloe vera, and diluted ammonium - these will offer relative relief.
Further, the bite or sting marks caused by the ants will be finished within a week.</li>
<li>However, scratches on the bite area could trigger further infection - and thus the bite or sting bite marks may remain longer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2avoid-contact">2.�Avoid Contact</h3>
<p>Besides treating the ant bites, avoidance is considered an effective technique too.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, when you notice an ant nest, it would be great if you avoid the urge to disturb the insect&rsquo;s homes.
Further, when playing or working in the outdoor spaces, it&rsquo;ll be great if you wear socks and shoes.
Besides, if ants attach you or your kids, you&rsquo;ll need to move off the nest and also brush them off from your clothes or body - but ensure you&rsquo;re having some gloves on to avoid further bites.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll find it challenging to control thecolonies of fire ants- you may use some ant poison baits such as piretherine if you apply them regularly.
I would advise you to use the ant baits in the fall season as it&rsquo;ll be most effective since the insects have reduced activity.</li>
<li>Further, to finish the fire ants in their anthill, pour some boiling water onto it as this will kill the ants. But take care since the surviving ants could launch biting attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-honey"><strong>3. Honey</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe you already know that sugar and honey droplets left behind could attract some ants to the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>But do you realize that honey may also be used to relieve the pain &amp; discomfort that comes from ants - while also reducing itching, swelling, and redness?
Luckily, if you need immediate ants&rsquo; bite relief, honey will be an excellent remedy.
So, simply apply some hone drops on the ants&rsquo; bite area.

<p>Baking soda &amp; lemon juice are critical DIY elements that can help stop the pain &amp; discomfort that arise from ant bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if you have some lemons in the yard, you might find them helpful in tackling that ant bite challenge. Simply cut that fruit, squeeze some quice and drop it into a bowl.
I recommend you apply the lemon juice directly onto the ant bite area - this has in the past given me quick relief.
As with the lemon juice, baking soda too will also help ease your pain and discomfort.</li>
<li>I know that you may already have some baking soda in the house or<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">bathroom</a>- it&rsquo;ll work as a great alternative.
Simply mix some 3 teaspoons of the baking soda with some water and mix to create some thick paste.</li>
<li>Next, apply that basking soda mixture onto the area affected by the ant bite.
So, the baking soda &amp; lemon juice will work well in reducing that discomfort or pain that is caused by the ant bite.
<strong>5. Apple Cider Vinegar�</strong>
Likewise, Apple Cider Vinegar is a common ingredient in most kitchens - it&rsquo;s loved for various purposes.</li>
<li>However, the substance has acidic features - apple cider vinegar will ease the itching and pain on the ant bite area.
But make sure to mix that apple cider vinegar with enough water prior to applying it to the bite area.
So, if you&rsquo;ve stepped onto some ant bed, the apple cider vinegar will be excellent - you may soak some cotton into the solution and apply it to the bite area.</li>
<li>This apple cider vinegar will finish that itchy and painful bite from ants including the fire ants.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most homeowners in Florida have experienced the tiny Red Ants challenge - this is among other 49+ ant species such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/carpenter-ants-vs-fire-ants">red fire ant, carpenter ant</a>
, and ghost ants.
<strong>Some of the tiny ants that wreak havoc in the Florida area include the yellow ant, black ant, sugar ant, and pharaoh ant. Despite that these tiny ants may look harmless, I&rsquo;ve noted that they&rsquo;ll bite humans and pets to leave so much pain - you&rsquo;ll be left treating the ant bites.�</strong>
In this post, I&rsquo;ve discussed the Tiny Red Ants In Florida in detail and what you should know or worry about. Let&rsquo;s dig right into it.</p>
<h2 id="details-tiny-red-ants-in-florida">Details: Tiny Red Ants In Florida</h2>
<h3 id="1-yellow-ants">1. Yellow Ants</h3>
<p>Unlike the carpenter ant and black ant that have been in Florida for a long time, the yellow ant is a new ant species in that location that arrived in 2017 -
<a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article184758688.html">as outlined by scientists</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>The yellow ants are tiny and came from Madagascar - they&rsquo;re thought to have arrived during Hurricane Irma, especially from South and Caribbean America.
These ants measure about 1/16th inches with their food being honeydew and flower nectar - all of which are dropped by the insects that suck sap.</li>
<li>However the yellow and ants won&rsquo;t sting or bite - but they&rsquo;ll spread and grow their colony very fast and hence when you see them in your Florida home, they may already have taken over the house.
The yellow ants could also impact agriculture by contributing to the damaging of the ornamental plants and other crops just like it&rsquo;s done by the scale insects, mealy bugs, and aphids.</li>
<li>However, the yellow ants only operate to protect the crop-damaging bugs - they don&rsquo;t feed on those plants. You&rsquo;ll find the ants in the woods around the house since they love high moisture such as rotten wooden logs, and wet soil.
For the removal of these yellow ants from your Florida home or elsewhere, I
recommend using some vacuum cleaner
.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSx2bNASW60">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSx2bNASW60</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-carpenter-ants">2. Carpenter Ants</h3>
<p>The Carpenter Ants scientifically referred to as then Camponotus floridanus are comparable in size and shape to the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fire-ant-killer-for-lawns/">Fire Ants</a>
and Big-Headed Ants since they love protein diet as opposed to carbohydrates.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-attracts-carpenter-ants-in-a-home/">Carpenter Ants are attracted</a>and will nest inside rotten wood attacking termites while also feeding on the termite eggs.
The large-sized carpenter ants will mainly be active in the early morning or late nights - they&rsquo;ll easily hide under the house or in the attics - and thus it might be challenging to locate these ant nests.</li>
<li>These bugs will thus contribute to the destruction of structures such as house foundations and attic materials while also causing painful and powerful bites in humans.
You can control these Carpetemnt ants by; removing all the standing water or moisture as this will help you protect your attics, basements, and crawl spaces; this action will also help remove other bugs like termites, mosquitoes, and
ants.</li>
<li>Further, you should trim plants and tree branches that are around your house. Also, remove all the cables and wires that the carpenter ants may use to trail from the yard to your buildings or house - such as the attics.
Any spaces, holes, or openings that are on the house must be sealed using silicone caulk since the carpenter ants and other bugs may nest here.
Equally, keep building materials and firewood a place away from the house since the pests could create their nests around these objects.
In addition, apply approved ant treatment chemicals on the nest of these pests to help exterminate any workers, queen, and brood; this will help in cutting the reproduction and ant cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-big-headed-ants">3. Big Headed Ants</h3>
<p>The big-headed ants (Pheidole megacephala) are also another
ant species that is invasive and you&rsquo;ll find them in Florida too. They won&rsquo;t bite humans or cause major home damage unless you disturb them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reddish-brown big-headed ants have been common in Australia and Africa but have now moved into South Florida.
The big-headed ants have different sizes even in one colony (simply referred to as polymorphic). Further, these ants don&rsquo;t sting or bite.</li>
<li>The ants may also exist in large interconnected colonies that will nest over many structures and hencecontrolling these would be challenging even with using chemicals or insecticides.
You can spot the big-headed ants in the yard or landscape as they&rsquo;re forging in the attics and walls - you may notice the foraging tube and trails (conical shaped) on trees.</li>
<li>You may also see the big-headed ants that may be found on flowerbeds, under concrete slabs, and on lawns. You&rsquo;ll also notice that the dirt piles and nests will be found between pavers and sidewalks.
The crawling ants and also the workers of the Big Headed Ant will equally be found on the crevices and cracks ad they feed on food remains of juices, fruit, pet food, peanut butter, molasses, liver, grease, and also meat which may be in the storage cabinets or the kitchens.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-rid-your-home-of-big-headed-ants/">Controlling the Big Headed Ants</a>
; You can prevent the growth or infestation of the Big-Headed Ants in your Florida home is to ensure that all the pet food and human food wi remain well sealed.</li>
<li>Keeping the food containers air-tight will avoid attracting the ants with the scent while also avoiding spillage
You should also screen or caulk any window, or baseboard cracks and holes that the ants might be using to forage in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-fire-ants">4. Fire Ants</h3>
<p>Some fire ant species that you&rsquo;ll find in Florida are red imported fire ant (RIFA) and the �Solenopsis Invicta Buren - all of which will be in the Port Saint Lucie and Stuart regions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fire ants (Red Imported species) came into Florida mainly from south and central America around the time when World War II concluded.
The Fire ants will sting and bite especially when they&rsquo;ve gathered in a crowd - they&rsquo;ll largely bite the feet. You&rsquo;ll notice
that the ants are black or brown-colored with a dark abdomen.</li>
<li>The habits of the fires ants will be in electrical equipment, indoors, under buildings and pavement, around stumps and trees, and in rotting logs.
The food the fire ants will love includes Lipids (oils, lard, grease), Proteins (meat and insects), Carbohydrates (syrups, sugars, and fruits).</li>
<li>The treatment options for fire ants include spot and barrier treatments, and mound treatments or baiting applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The tiny red ants in Florida are pharaoh ants (comparable to Thief ants),�Yellow Ants,
Fire Ants,
Big Headed Ants,
Carpenter Ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pharaoh ants are about the length of 1/16-inch, red to light yellow in color, and have some black marking on their abdomen - and 3 body segments and also an antennal club.</li>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-ant-traps/">attracts carpenter ants</a>
in a home?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carpenter ants are attracted to our homes by debris piles, food, shade, stagnant water, and also like to live in moist places. Carpenter ants are very destructive, especially in the pantry. But unlike termites, these ants dont eat but chew the moist wood and throw off the remains behind.�</strong>
These carpenter ants are both indoor and outdoor insects. When they come into the house, something has attracted them. What are things that we do that make them come out from the yard and other areas into our houses?

</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-attracts-carpenter-ants-in-a-home">Details: What Attracts Carpenter Ants in A Home?</h2>
<h3 id="1-food-">**1. Food **</h3>
<p>If you have food that the carpenter ants like, they will find their way into your house to eat. They are mostly attracted by sugary things and also
proteins in the pantry
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Things like honeydew and other sweet liquids will make them come running into your house.</li>
<li>Sometimes, if you have a garden and there are lots of aphids, you need to watch out because the honeydew they produce could also be a source of attraction.
Lastly, if you leave out the garbage and leftovers in the open, this could also be another attraction point.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-moisture"><strong>2. Moisture</strong></h3>
<p>Carpenter ants like damp and humid conditions in your house. Leaking pipes and sinks and other factors that cause humid conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you dont repair them, they are going to create the rightful environment that will make this ant come running.
You are most likely to find them in drains, kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry among other areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-debris-">**3. Debris **</h3>
<p>If you have firewood areas, you need to check them for the carpenter ants. They are attracted to such places more so if the firewood is wet and moist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you take that firewood into the house, always do a thorough check for these ants.</li>
<li>Damp and the rotting wood are also another favorite spot for the ants as they chew the wood.
There are also other factors that accelerate and create a rightful environment for the ants.

</ul>
<h3 id="4-poor-drainages-and-stagnant-water-">**4. Poor Drainages and Stagnant Water **</h3>
<p>Sometimes we allow water to stagnate and also flow in unwanted places which can be the beginning of carpenter ants in our houses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Things like obstructed gutters could easily redirect water onto the walls or cause splashing leading to moist walls and the environment.</li>
<li>In turn, this will start attracting the carpenter ants into your home.
It is good to check on all your drainage systems and possible leaks that could lead to a highly humid room and attack by the carpenter ants.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-allowing-too-much-shade-in-your-house"><strong>5. Allowing Too Much Shade in Your House</strong></h3>
<p>Some houses are surrounded by too many trees that create a permanent shade around the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>These can lead to an ever cool and humid house that is very favorable for carpenter ants.
Timely and proper pruning of these trees can be a good way of avoiding such scenarios and allowing sufficient lighting and also temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-too-many-plants-in-your-yard-">**6. Too Many Plants in Your Yard **</h3>
<p>Though carpenter ants dont eat plants, many plants can easily attract them and later push them to your house.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of these plants attract aphids which leave behind honeydew.</li>
<li>This honeydew is a favorite food for these ants and it will attract them from any corner into your house.
Therefore try to keep your yard as clean as possible if you want to keep these ants.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-piling-wood-near-home-">**7. Piling Wood near Home **</h3>
<p>This is a very common behavior with most people not knowing the danger it brings.</p>
<ul>
<li>The heaps of firewood around your house can be a host to a number of pests, insects, and animals among them carpenter ants.</li>
<li>Once these piles of wood become moist, the ants will invade and try to chew through as they look for the best breeding places.
They can even spread over into your house as they look for food and other breeding areas. This also comes with its damage cost on the furniture and other furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-ignoring-subtle-signs-">**8. Ignoring Subtle Signs **</h3>
<p>There are some simple signs that are very important but mostly ignored because they look insignificant.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, you may see one or two ants roaming around your house as they look for food. You are also likely to see dead ants on the floor or on your premises.</li>
<li>This is a red sign that should not ignore as you do your inspection on the infestation.
If you see fine sawdust from the ceiling or furniture, thats a red alert that needs immediate intervention before any more damage. Though these ants eat the wood they will chew it and throw it out through tiny holes.

<h2 id="carpenter-ant-and-the-changing-seasons">Carpenter Ant and the Changing Seasons</h2>
<p>Carpenter ants are also affected by seasons. They will mostly attack during warm and humid seasons but hide and hibernate during the cold season.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the hibernation period, their bodies slow down their metabolism to reserve the energy and heat for the season.</li>
<li>This does not happen all the time because when the winters are warmer, they forfeit the hibernation process.
However, you dont have to wait for the carpenter ants to reach this level where they hibernate within your home.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below I&rsquo;ve tackled this question - &ldquo;what do <a href="/posts/do-sugar-ants-bite/">sugar</a> ants look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sugar ants (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_sugar_ant">banded sugar ants</a>
or
<em>Camponotus consobrinus</em>
) are one of the most popular types of ant species.</p>
<p>Sugar ants will mainly be seen in most homes hauling grains of sugar and food particles.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-sugar-ants-bite/">Bites</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-sugar-ants/">Get Rid of</a></p>
<p><strong>Summary:��</strong>
<em>The banded sugar ant is a type of ant that is only found in Australia. It&rsquo;s polymorphic and relatively large in size with a black body and a distinctive orange-brown band wrapping around its gaster. Banded sugar ants differ slightly in appearance based on the roles they play in the colony.�</em></p>
<h2 id="what-do-sugar-ants-look-like">What Do Sugar Ants Look Like?</h2>
<p><em>The soldiers, also known as major workers, and the minor workers usually measure approximately 5 to 15 mm in length while their queens can be up to twice the size of the worker ants.�</em>

<h2 id="details-what-do-sugar-ants-look-like"><strong>Details: What Do Sugar Ants Look Like?�</strong></h2>
<p>These are the other types of sugar ants found in other parts of the world but share similar characteristics with the banded sugar ants (apart from the band).</p>
<p>Also referred to as odorous house ants, sugar ants are tiny ants that measure around 10mm in length and are commonly found in forests, woodlands, trees, shrubs, under rocks, in the soil, or even right in your home.</p>
<p>Male sugar ants are black while the female sugar ants have a lighter reddish-brown color than can easily be mistaken for a tiny drop of honey or syrup.</p>
<p>All sugar ants are tiny and skinny with a large head, thorax, and abdomen. Their heads have two antennae on top which the ants use to find trails and communicate.</p>
<p>They also have powerful mandibles which they use to break food and sugar particles into small ones that they can actually carry. Depending on their roles, some sugar ants may appear different as a result of adaptation.</p>
<p>For instance, the worker sugar ants will have bigger heads and mandibles since their job is to gather food.�When sugar ants invade your home, you will likely spot them lined up in a queue coming from their entry point to their source of food in your home.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-know-you-have-a-sugar-ant-infestation"><strong>How to Know You Have a Sugar Ant Infestation</strong></h2>
<p>Sugar ants are tiny creatures whose size allows them to enter your home through any tiny crevices they can find. They can use cracks in doorways, windowsills, or other openings in your home.</p>
<p>When you have a sugar ant infestation, you may notice as soon as it starts happening when the affected area is clearly visible such as the kitchen.</p>
<p>But, when they invade a hidden area such as tall cabinets or basements, it can take a while to realize that you&rsquo;re under attack.�The following are some ways to tell when you have a sugar ant infestation:</p>
<h3 id="1-actually-seeing-them">1. Actually seeing them</h3>
<p>Sugar ants are very courageous creatures and when in search of food, they will walk right in front of you or even on you to get to it.</p>
<p>The thing that makes sugar ants easy to see is that they never travel alone. When searching for food, sugar ants travel in hundreds or thousands so if you see one, there&rsquo;s probably many others nearby.</p>
<h3 id="2-trails">2. Trails</h3>
<p>Sugar ants usually leave a pheromone trail to the food source so that the other ants can know how to get to it. This trail appears to be a pale while line and you should wash it off with soapy water as soon as you see it.</p>
<h3 id="3-hollow-sounds-in-wood">3. Hollow sounds in wood</h3>
<p>If your home is made of wood, you could be in serious trouble if sugar ants attack your home especially if it goes on for a long time undetected.</p>
<p>Sugar ants may burrow into wooden components of your home when trying to gain entry which, over time, may damage your home&rsquo;s wooden parts. Sugar ants are not nearly as destructive to wood as carpenter ants but they can also do quite a bit of damage.</p>
<h3 id="4-seeing-them-around-your-home">4. Seeing them around your home</h3>
<p>If you see sugar ants in your lawn, backyard, fence or other places near your home, it won&rsquo;t take long until they find a way into your home or maybe they already have.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up"><strong>Wrapping Up�</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you know what sugar ants look like and how to know if they have invaded your home, it&rsquo;s up to you to get rid of them and take the necessary measures to keep them out of your home for good.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/ant-control-in-bellingham/">Ants</a>, those tiny yet industrious creatures, seem to have a peculiar penchant for some rather unexpected substances. One such substance that has raised eyebrows and piqued curiosity is human sperm.
***The Sweet Attraction: Sperm and Sugar -�*<em>At first glance, the idea of ants being drawn to sperm may seem perplexing. However, the key to understanding this behavior lies in the composition of sperm itself.�</em>
<em>Sperm, like every cell in our body, contains sugar molecules. What&rsquo;s intriguing is that men&rsquo;s semen gets an additional dose of sugars secreted into the mix during its formation in the testicles. This sugar-rich concoction serves as a sweet treat for ants, offering them an abundant source of energy.</em></p>
<h2 id="sperm-and-its-sugar-content"><strong>Sperm and Its Sugar Content�</strong></h2>
<p>Ants are opportunistic foragers, and any resource that resembles a potential food source is fair game for these diligent insects.
While it may not align with our human sensibilities, ants rely on gathering and storing resources whenever they can, as they cannot predict when their next meal will be available. Consequently, the sugar-rich semen becomes a valuable source of
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29273326/">nutrition for them</a>
.
Sperm, like every cell present in our body, contains sugar molecules. These sugar molecules are vital for the energy production and sustenance of the cell. However, what makes sperm particularly appealing to ants is the additional sugar content it acquires during its formation in the testicles.
Men&rsquo;s semen, the fluid that carries sperm, undergoes a process in which extra sugars are secreted into the mixture. These sugars serve a specific purpose in human reproduction, but they also create a sweet, sugary liquid that ants find irresistible.</p>
<h2 id="ants-and-their-need-for-energy"><strong>Ants and Their Need for Energy</strong></h2>
<p>Ants, being diligent foragers and members of highly organized colonies, are in a constant search for food sources to sustain their energy levels. In the <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">ant</a> world, the availability of food is unpredictable, and they cannot rely on a regular food supply like humans do.</p>
<ul>
<li>This scarcity mindset drives ants to seize any opportunity to gather resources, even unconventional ones like human secretions.
When ants encounter chemical cues that resemble familiar food sources, such as the sugary compounds found in sperm, their instincts prompt them to investigate further.

</ul>
<h2 id="the-nutritional-value-of-sperm-for-ants"><strong>The Nutritional Value of Sperm for Ants</strong></h2>
<p>While it may seem unusual to humans, ants view sperm as a valuable source of nutrition. The sugary liquid within sperm provides ants with a significant energy boost.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that ants are not attracted to sperm for reproductive purposes; rather, they are drawn to the rich sugar content as a source of sustenance.
This ability to gain energy from sperm allows ants to stay active and efficient in their daily activities, from foraging to caring for their colony. To ants, sperm is not only a potential food source but also a means of survival in their challenging and resource-limited environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ants"><strong>Ants&rsquo; Appetite for Sperm: A Natural Instinct</strong></h2>
<p>From a human perspective, the notion of ants being attracted to sperm might seem perplexing or even off-putting. However, when we delve into the world of these industrious insects, their fascination with unusual food sources like sperm begins to make sense.</p>
<h2 id="ants-and-the-scarcity-of-resources"><strong>Ants and the Scarcity of Resources</strong></h2>
<p>In the world of ants, resources are precious and unpredictable. Unlike humans, ants don&rsquo;t have the luxury of knowing when their next meal will be available.</p>
<ul>
<li>This scarcity of resources drives ants to adopt a &ldquo;never waste anything&rdquo; mentality. In the insect kingdom, anything that can provide sustenance is considered a gift from nature, and ants are quick to seize such opportunities.
Ants operate on the principle that food may not be readily available again in the near future. This inherent uncertainty leads them to take advantage of any resource that crosses their path.
Whether it&rsquo;s a sugar-rich nectar, a fallen fruit, or, in some cases, human secretions like sperm, ants approach these potential food sources with the same level of enthusiasm.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-energy-needs-of-ant-colonies"><strong>The Energy Needs of Ant Colonies</strong></h2>
<p>Ants live in highly organized colonies that function as complex societies with various roles and responsibilities.
Each member of the colony plays a specific role, whether it&rsquo;s foraging for food, caring for the young, or defending the nest.</p>
<ul>
<li>These roles require energy, and the size of an ant colony directly correlates with the amount of energy it needs to function effectively.</li>
<li>Foraging ants are responsible for collecting food to sustain the colony. To support a large and active colony, ants must constantly search for resources.
This relentless quest for sustenance drives them to explore diverse food sources, including those that may seem unusual to humans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="varieties-of-ant-species-and-their-attraction-to-sperm"><strong>Varieties of Ant Species and Their Attraction to Sperm</strong></h2>
<p>Ant species vary in their dietary preferences and ecological niches. Different ant species have adapted to thrive in various environments and have developed specific dietary habits. Here are some common ant species that might be attracted to sperm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carpenter Ants</strong>: These large ants are known for their wood-nesting habits and can be attracted to sweet substances, such as sperm rich in sugar.</li>
<li><strong>Odorous House Ants</strong>: These ants emit a distinct odor when crushed. They are opportunistic feeders and may be drawn to various human secretions.</li>
<li><strong>Pavement Ants</strong>: These ants often build nests under pavement and are attracted to sugary substances, including human secretions.</li>
<li><strong>Black Ants</strong>: While the term &ldquo;black ants&rdquo; encompasses various species, many are attracted to sweet or sugary substances, making them potential visitors to areas with human secretions.</li>
<li><strong>Red Ants (Fire Ants)</strong>: Fire ants are known for their painful stings and are typically drawn to protein-rich substances. Although they might not be as attracted to sweet secretions, improper cleaning of messes can invite them into your household.
It&rsquo;s worth noting that while ants may be attracted to sperm and other secretions, their interest is primarily driven by their innate need for sustenance rather than any reproductive purpose.

      <description>Ants may seem like a minor nuisance when spotted individually, but ignoring even a few can quickly escalate into a larger infestation. Heres why:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ants may seem like a minor nuisance when spotted individually, but ignoring even a few can quickly escalate into a larger infestation. Heres why:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Communication and Pheromones:**Ants communicate primarily through pheromones. When a few ants find a food source, they leave a trail of pheromones leading to it. Other ants in the colony detect these pheromones and follow the trail to the food source. Ignoring these initial ants allows more to follow the trail, creating a larger group that can rapidly expand their foraging range and increase in numbers.</li>
<li>**Colonization and Nesting:**Ignoring a few ants can lead them to establish nests indoors. Ants are adept at finding hidden, sheltered spots in your home to build their colonies. They can nest in walls, insulation, under floors, and in other secluded places, making it difficult to detect and eradicate them once theyve settled in. Once a colony is established, it can grow rapidly as ants continue to reproduce and expand their nest.</li>
<li>**Rapid Reproduction:**Ants reproduce quickly. Ignoring just a few ants for a short period can give them enough time to reproduce significantly. <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">Ant</a> colonies typically have a single queen that can lay hundreds of eggs per day under optimal conditions. This rapid reproduction can quickly lead to a population explosion, making the infestation much more challenging to control and eliminate.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prevention-tips-to-avoid-ant-infestations">Prevention Tips to Avoid Ant Infestations:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintain Cleanliness:</strong>- **Clean up spills and crumbs promptly:**Ants are attracted to food sources. Keeping your kitchen and dining areas clean reduces their attractiveness to ants.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
