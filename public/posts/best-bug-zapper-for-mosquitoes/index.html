Substances like Octenol in your attractants are more efficient- you need to check on them too. You can have the shielding of the bug zapper for an efficient environment.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that the critical idea to place is to attract and kill the mosquitoes. Well,
<strong>if it&rsquo;s outdoors,</strong>
it is better to place them on open ground with top rain protection.
You can hang it on a pole or wall provided you offer a better upper shielding. Ensure it is safe from external damages.
<strong>In case of indoors,</strong>
ensure you need to place in on a stable place away from children and pets. You can hang it on the wall or roof if the Mosquito zapper has a hook option. This should not affect humans within the room.</p>
