<p>Gardening can be an excellent part-time or full-time activity  either for leisure or for revenue generation.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, to make beds, rows, or generally dig the rocky or rough soil, youll need a good tiller.
Of course, using a spade or shovel will be difficult but with a tiller, youll save time, money, and effort. But how do you select your ultimate tiller?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-rotation-mechanism">1. Rotation Mechanism<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-rotation-mechanism">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rear tine tillers will either have a counter-rotation or forward rotation mechanism when it comes to tiller rotation style.</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-rotation tine  The tiller tines here will rotate in a direction to that taken by the wheels, which is mainly backward direction.</li>
<li>These counter-rotating tines are effective in mixing up the soil such as clay on compact grounds. Therefore, I would recommend this tiller for new ground including yards, gardens, and beds.</li>
<li>Forward rotation tines  The tines will be rotating in a similar direction to that taken by the tillers wheels. Such a rotation direction also assists in losing up soil and breaking up roots and weeds  which will be ready for sowing.</li>
<li>Dual rotating tillers - Hint: A tiller with both counter-rotating plus forward tines is an excellent choice if youre planning to use the machine for different soils types of terrains. This one combines both the counter-rotation and forward rotation tines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2tiller-power">2.�Tiller power<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2tiller-power">¶</a></h3>
<p>Definitely, tillers  including these rear-tine tillers, will display power over horsepower on their engine rating. This is unlike in other garden tools that are engine-powered. Heres what engine size to pick:</p>
<ul>
<li>For clay soil and compact new ground  For this kind of ground that was not recently upturned, you should pick an engine with a 200cc+ engine power capacity size (this would include 350cc or 500cc).</li>
<li>This will readily break up the compact soil, roots, and heavy obstacles to leave you with smooth soil ready for sowing. NB: cc, in this case, denotes cubic centimeters.</li>
<li>For land thats tilled regularly, particularly annually, you may pick an engine with 100 to 180cc engine power capacity size.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3tine-depth">3.�Tine depth<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3tine-depth">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of us gardeners already know this but generally tilling at a depth of about 4-6 inches is adequate for most crop types.
This is particularly so for ground thats not new. However, for new ground or garden, youll require the tilling depth to be a few inches longer than 6 inches.
While choosing your tiller, I would recommend one thatll give you 6 inches tilling depth if its for new ground or a garden that has heavy soil  this will give your seedlings and plants adequate aeration and growth space of their roots.</p>
<h3 id="4tilling-width">4.�Tilling width<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4tilling-width">¶</a></h3>
<p>These tillers will have a tilling width that ranges from 10 inches (25 centimeters) to about 20 inches (50 centimeters).
Definitely, its not possible to change a large-width tined tiller for use in smaller spaces  and thus its important to check your tilling width requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wider tilling width- Therefore, for the small-width rear-tine tillers, the gardener will require to make much more turns while tilling their land since the width is small. This will be great if youre working on rectangular beds or uniform spaces.</li>
<li>Narrow tilling width� This will be the tillers whose tilling with is around 10 inches. Itll be great for irregularly shaped, curved, or decorative gardens. Your tilling width will vary on the number of tiller tines  definitely many will come with a width of 24 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5tiller-torque">5.�Tiller Torque<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5tiller-torque">¶</a></h3>
<p>The rear tine tiller will require significantly high torque to rotate the tines  which is generally a derivative of the power of the machine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, choose a tiler that has higher torque as itll easily shred down all the hard soil, roots, and mulch thats in your garden. Typically, the best rear tine tillers will have their torque ranging from 8 to 10 lb. per ft.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-tiller-tires-and-tread-size">6. Tiller tires and tread size<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-tiller-tires-and-tread-size">¶</a></h3>
<p>I recommend that you get suitable tires  consider thickness, durability and ensure theyre created for all terrains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tread type and size  The treads on your cultivator and thus I recommend you get agricultural-type, all-terrain, and equally thick tread.</li>
<li>This will significantly enhance the maneuverability of the tractor in different terrains including clay soil, uneven, rocky, muddy, or grassy ground. However, for soil that is tilled regularly, you can choose to take the lighter-duty tires thatll be cheaper.</li>
<li>Tire size  for effective plowing, choose tiller tires that&rsquo;re about 12 inches for uneven land (and large tillers) or take 8 inches for smooth land and small tillers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-tiller-weight">7. Tiller Weight<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#7-tiller-weight">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your tillers weight will significantly affect how well you can handle that machine and do the work on your garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, dont just check the machines weight when it&rsquo;s running, youll need to determine how easy it is to move when its engine is switched off.</li>
<li>The balance between engine power and overall weight. For example, some of the tillers could weigh 250+ pounds. So, examine if this kind of weight will be easy to wheel around even with the tillers engine switched off.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>Luckily, a rear tine tiller will be great for straighter lines and give us more control on tilling depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrast this to the front tillers (the regular garden tiller) that have tilling blades at the front of the driving engine.
Safety must be your next concern after youve acquired the best rear tine tiller. Heres how you can use your tiller for effective plowing.</li>
</ul>
