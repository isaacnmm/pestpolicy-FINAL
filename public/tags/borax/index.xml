      <description>A comprehensive, real-talk guide comparing Diatomaceous Earth (DE) and Borax for fleas. As a pet owner, here&amp;#39;s my experience on which powder is safer and more effective for your home.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You saw it, didn&rsquo;t you? That tiny black speck that jumped. Maybe it was on your ankle, or maybe you saw it on your pet’s white fur. That single moment sends a wave of dread through any homeowner, and it leads to the same frantic, late-night internet search: &ldquo;how to get rid of fleas FAST.&rdquo; That search will inevitably lead you to two popular DIY solutions: white powders that promise to end the infestation in your carpets. One of them is likely the familiar box of <span style="color:red;">[20 Mule Team <a href="/posts/borax-flea-killer/">Borax</a>](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000R4L32E/?tag=p-policy-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000R4L32E/?tag=p-policy-20</a>)</span> from the laundry aisle, a product you&rsquo;ve seen for years.</p>
<p>The other contender is a powder you may have heard of but don&rsquo;t know as well, called <span style="color:red;">[Food-Grade Diatomaceous <a href="/posts/diatomaceous-earth/">Earth</a>](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harris-Diatomaceous-Earth-Powder-Duster/dp/B072J8Z28F?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=f7253eb7f0f22c7858d1c74cbccc18e7&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">https://www.amazon.com/Harris-Diatomaceous-Earth-Powder-Duster/dp/B072J8Z28F?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=f7253eb7f0f22c7858d1c74cbccc18e7&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl</a>)</span>. Both are inexpensive, and countless forums and articles claim they’re the secret to winning the war against fleas. On the surface, they seem interchangeable. But they are not. As someone who has navigated the stress of a flea infestation with pets in the house, I can tell you that the difference between these two powders is profound. It’s not just about what works—it’s about what’s safe for the family you’re trying to protect.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-real-enemy-why-fleas-are-so-hard-to-kill">Understanding the Real Enemy: Why Fleas Are So Hard to Kill</h3>
<p>Before we even talk about powders, you have to understand that the adult fleas you see are only about 5% of the total problem. The other 95% of the infestation is hiding in your carpets, furniture, and pet bedding as eggs, larvae, and pupae. This is why a single treatment rarely works; you have to break the entire life cycle. Any effective solution must address not only the biting adults but also the next generation waiting to emerge.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-diatomaceous-earth-the-natural-assassin">What is Diatomaceous Earth? The Natural Assassin</h3>
<p>The easiest way to picture Diatomaceous Earth (DE) is as microscopic, jagged fossils. It’s a natural powder made from the fossilized remains of tiny aquatic organisms called diatoms. While it feels soft like flour to us, on a microscopic level, it’s incredibly sharp and abrasive. This is its secret weapon. DE is a <em>mechanical</em> killer, not a chemical one. It doesn’t poison fleas. Instead, when a flea walks through the powder, the sharp particles physically scrape away the waxy, protective outer layer of its exoskeleton. This process fatally dehydrates the flea, killing it from the outside in. Because this is a physical attack, fleas can&rsquo;t develop a resistance to it like they can with chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>The most important thing you need to know is that you <strong>must</strong> use <strong>food-grade DE</strong>. This grade is mined from freshwater sources and is purified to be safe for mammals. It&rsquo;s so safe, in fact, that it’s often used as a health supplement and in animal feed to control internal parasites. This is the powder you want in your home. (Do not confuse it with &ldquo;pool-grade&rdquo; DE, which is chemically treated and dangerous to inhale).</p>
<h3 id="what-is-borax-the-common-household-chemical">What is Borax? The Common Household Chemical</h3>
<p>You probably have Borax in your laundry room right now. It’s a naturally occurring mineral salt, and there’s no question that it is an effective insecticide. Borax works as both a desiccant (like DE) and, more potently, as a stomach poison. As fleas move through a treated carpet, the small crystals get stuck to their bodies. When they groom themselves, they ingest the Borax, which shreds their insides and kills them. It’s brutally effective.</p>
<p>However—and for me, this is the deal-breaker—<strong>Borax is toxic if ingested by pets or children.</strong> If your dog or cat licks the powder from their paws or grooms it out of their fur after walking on a treated carpet, they can suffer from skin irritation, digestive distress, vomiting, and in severe cases, even more serious health consequences.</p>
<h3 id="the-verdict-for-pet-owners-its-not-even-a-debate">The Verdict: For Pet Owners, It’s Not Even a Debate</h3>
<p>When I weigh the options, the choice becomes crystal clear. Why would I introduce a known toxin into my home to solve one problem, only to create a potential health emergency for my pet? It&rsquo;s a risk I&rsquo;m not willing to take.</p>
<p>For any household with pets or small children, <strong>food-grade Diatomaceous Earth is the only responsible choice.</strong> It&rsquo;s just as effective at killing fleas over time, but it comes without the scary risks. The peace of mind you get from knowing your pets are safe while you treat your home is worth everything.</p>
<h3 id="my-complete-step-by-step-battle-plan-for-using-de">My Complete Step-by-Step Battle Plan for Using DE</h3>
<p>Just sprinkling some powder around won&rsquo;t cut it. You need a strategy. Here is the exact method I use to successfully eradicate fleas.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: The All-Important Prep Work</strong>
Before you even open the bag of DE, you have to prepare the environment. Start by treating your pet with a veterinarian-approved flea treatment. Then, wash all of your pet&rsquo;s bedding, blankets, and any washable fabrics in hot water. Finally, you need to vacuum. Vacuum everything—carpets, rugs, sofas, chairs, and especially the corners and edges of rooms. This not only sucks up some of the existing fleas and eggs but the vibration also encourages the dormant pupae to hatch, exposing the new adult fleas to the treatment you&rsquo;re about to lay down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: The Application</strong>
Now it&rsquo;s time to apply the DE. I highly recommend wearing a simple dust mask for this part, as the fine powder can be irritating if you breathe it in. You want to apply a <strong>light, even dusting</strong>, not a thick pile. A heavy application can actually deter fleas from walking through it. Use a powder duster for a fine mist, or simply use your hand to gently shake it over your carpets and furniture. Make sure to get it along baseboards, under cushions, and into all the dark, hidden places where fleas love to hide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: The Waiting Game</strong>
This is the hardest part: patience. DE does not kill instantly. You need to leave the powder down for at least <strong>48 to 72 hours</strong>. This gives the fleas ample time to move through the powder and begin the dehydration process. During this time, it’s best to limit activity in the treated rooms if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: The Final Clean-Up</strong>
After a few days, it&rsquo;s time to vacuum again. Use a vacuum with a good filter and go over all the treated areas thoroughly. This will remove the DE along with the dead fleas. Immediately after you finish, take the vacuum canister or bag outside to empty it into a sealed garbage bag. You don&rsquo;t want any survivors crawling back out of your vacuum.</p>
<p>Because new fleas can continue to hatch for a couple of weeks, you should <strong>repeat this entire process once a week for at least two to three weeks.</strong> This persistence is the key to breaking the life cycle completely.</p>
<p>For a reliable and safe product, I always point people towards something like the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harris-Diatomaceous-Earth-Powder-Duster/dp/B072J8Z28F?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=f7253eb7f0f22c7858d1c74cbccc18e7&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Harris Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth with Duster</a></strong>. It&rsquo;s an effective tool in your arsenal that lets you fight back against fleas without compromising the safety of your home.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-borax-kill-fleas"><strong>How does Borax Kill Fleas?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong>
As a powder, Borax has no smell and can control fleas by dehydrating them. The borax powder breaks the fleas exoskeletons and enters their body, which leads to dehydration and death.
<strong>Method 2:</strong>
As the flea larvae hatch, Borax dehydrates the fleas outer tissues and kills them. Therefore, Borax stops the flea from hatching.
<strong>Method 3:</strong>
Also, Borax contaminates the food preserves for the flea larvae. The larvae feed on the contaminated food (mainly droppings by adult fleas) and get ripped to death.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-borax-for-fleas-in-yard--lawn"><strong>How to use Borax for fleas in Yard &amp; Lawn</strong></h2>
<p>What youll require to control fleas in your lawn:
<strong>Borax powder, salt, sprinklers or water hose, and diatomaceous earth. But you can also use the�</strong>
Best Flea Spray for Yard
.
<strong>Precautions:�</strong>
Wear
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYMRZEI/?tag=p-policy-20">gloves</a>
and cover your face using a dust protector. The borax powder can cause significant throat and skin irritation if you do not take safety precautions.
First: Clear your Lawn or Yard -
Remove any obstacles such as containers and movable furniture. This will make it easier to apply the Borax on your lawn.
<strong>Step 1: Choose a Dry Day and week</strong>
Borax will be useful in treating fleas when there are low moisture levels in your garden. Therefore, treat your yard when there is no rain or any rain forecast in that week. Also, turn off your water sprinkler system.
<strong>Step 2: �Mix Borax, diatomaceous earth, and salt.</strong>
To achieve the highest effectiveness, mix one part of two parts of Borax and diatomaceous earth with one part of salt.
<strong>Step 3: �Sprinkle borax on your lawn</strong>
Ready? Go! Sprinkle the borax mixture on your lawn using a hand trowel. You will need to reach all the corners of your yard and cover it maximally on the surface.
Also, ensure to maintain the dry atmosphere in your yard 2-3 days after the borax application. The time allowance will allow the Borax to dehydrate the fleas, thus killing them.
**Step 4: Spread the Borax **
Use a tool such as a rake to spread the Borax on the yard to ensure that the powder gets to all the plants and grass. To avoid poisoning and contamination, ensure that no human being or animal steps in the yard for about 2-3 days. Note that if your pets ingest the borax mixture, they might get poisoned.
<strong>Step 5: Water the Yard</strong>
After 2-3 days, water the yard to wash away the borax moisture. Check whether there are signs of
live fleas
, and if you find any, repeat the treating process. Always ensure to repeat the process once after 15 days to make sure the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-eggs-look-like/">fleas and their eggs</a>
are all killed.
In addition to treating your yard, you will need to treat your house using the
best fogger for fleas
to control the fleas from residence from inside and outside. You can find Borax in an online store or the physical grocery store, particularly in the detergent section.</p>

<h2 id="is-borax-safe-for-cats-and-dogs-pets"><strong>Is borax safe for cats and dogs (Pets)?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>First:�</strong>
Did you know there is a difference between Borax and boric acid powders? Most pet owners use the above terms interchangeably, which could lead to dangerous outcomes if one is not keen on the one they use on their dog or cat.
It is essential to know which one, between Borax and boric acid, is the recommended natural flea treatment option. You should also be aware of the safety precautions you should take while using Borax to treat fleas on your cat.</p>
<h2 id="borax-vs-boric-acid-powders-which-is-safer">Borax vs. boric acid powders: which is safer?</h2>
<p>Both Borax and boric acid powders are derived from boron. Notably, Borax has mainly been used for glazing and welding and also for pharmaceutical purposes.
As a drug product, Borax is known to act as a fungicide and antiseptic and is utilized to heal eye infections. Boron exists in nature is made up of boron, sodium, and oxygen. However, boric acid is made from Borax mixed with an acid. Both Borax and boric acid can be used to treat pest infections.
**However: **
You should note that Borax is a safer and natural alternative when compared to boric acid. Borax is
safe and not harmful to the human skin or pets
. On the contrary, Borax raptures the fleas skin, absorbs its body moisture and kills it.
Also, Borax has a crystalline structure that allows it to slice the fleas internal organs and thus kills both larvae and adult fleas.
**Note: **
Since Borax is naturally derived from boron, it is considered less toxic to your dog, cat and safer in treating a flea infestation. However, ensure to follow all the product label instructions to avoid accidents.
<strong>Other uses of Borax Powder</strong>
<strong>1: Borax for ants, moths, and cockroaches</strong>
Apart from just treating fleas, Borax can treat other insects like moths and ants. You will need to sprinkle Borax in the cabinets and storage areas. Also, Borax will be useful in
treating bed bugs
, very troublesome insects.
<strong>2: Borax to kill fungus</strong>
Do you have a fungus problem in your house? It is time you tried Borax! Fungus and molds require wet atmospheres to grow. Borax will dry the various surfaces and thus prevent them from increasing.
**3: Borax weed killer **
Borax will effectively kill weeds around your home and on the lawn. You will require only to sprinkle some borax on the weeds. Further, Borax will not harm your plants and grass. However, treat the weeds in sections if you have a big lawn.

<h2 id="best-borax-substitute-diatomaceous-earth-powered"><strong>Best Borax Substitute: Diatomaceous Earth Powered</strong></h2>
<p>The borax alternative for killing flea naturally is Diatomaceous Earth.
Diatomaceous Earth
(DE) has razor-sharp edges, which cut the fleas outs shells and absorb their body fluid.
Diatomaceous earth remains the sea and wetland algae, particularly a type of hard-shelled phytoplankton or plankton. Similar to Borax, DE is mined from underground, and it is a natural
pest control
method. Later, the DE powder is crushed into an excellent powder.
Equally, DE is considered a safe
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-cats-get-fleas-in-the-winter/">flea prevention</a>
alternative to Borax. If you purchase DE that is labeled food-grade, you can use it to deworm humans and animals.
It will take DE about 24-72 hours to kill the fleas in your home. The DE powder will also destroy any other fleas that will emerge from their cocoons within that time.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Borax is a popular and effective solution for controlling ants, especially outdoors. It disrupts the ants digestive system, ultimately eliminating them and their colonies. Heres a guide on how to use borax effectively to deal with ants in your yard or garden.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-borax-for-ants-outside">How to Use Borax for Ants Outside</h2>
<h3 id="1-understand-how-borax-works">1. Understand How Borax Works</h3>
<p>Borax, a naturally occurring mineral, is toxic to ants but safe for humans and pets when used correctly. Ants are attracted to borax-based bait, which they carry back to their colony, effectively poisoning the queen and other members over time.</p>
<h3 id="2-prepare-borax-bait">2. Prepare Borax Bait</h3>
<p>To create an effective <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-bellingham/">ant</a> bait, mix <a href="/posts/borax-flea-killer/">borax</a> with a sweet attractant such as sugar, honey, or syrup. Heres a simple recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 1 tablespoon of borax with 3 tablespoons of sugar or honey.</li>
<li>Add enough water to create a thick paste.</li>
<li>Place the mixture on small pieces of cardboard or in shallow containers near ant trails.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-place-the-bait-strategically">3. Place the Bait Strategically</h3>
<p>Locate ant trails or areas with heavy ant activity outside. Place the borax bait along these paths, near anthills, or around the perimeter of your garden. Ensure the bait is out of reach of pets and small children.</p>
<h3 id="4-monitor-and-replenish">4. Monitor and Replenish</h3>
<p>Check the bait regularly to ensure it hasnt dried out or been consumed entirely. Replenish as needed until you notice a significant reduction in ant activity. This process may take a few days to a week for full colony elimination.</p>
<h3 id="5-use-borax-in-a-spray-solution">5. Use Borax in a Spray Solution</h3>
<p>If youre dealing with a widespread infestation, a borax spray can help target larger areas. Mix 1 tablespoon of borax with 1 cup of warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and apply it directly to anthills, nests, or trails.</p>
<h3 id="safety-precautions">Safety Precautions</h3>
<p>While borax is generally safe, follow these precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep borax and bait away from food preparation areas and water sources.</li>
<li>Avoid applying borax directly to edible plants or crops.</li>
<li>Wear gloves when handling borax to prevent skin irritation.</li>
<li>Store borax in a secure place, away from children and pets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages-of-using-borax-for-ant-control">Advantages of Using Borax for Ant Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Effective Colony Elimination:**Borax targets the entire colony, including the queen, ensuring long-term control.</li>
<li>**Eco-Friendly:**Borax is a natural product, making it a safer alternative to chemical pesticides.</li>
<li>**Cost-Effective:**A small amount of borax goes a long way in controlling ant infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-to-seek-professional-help">When to Seek Professional Help</h3>
<p>For severe infestations or if borax doesnt seem to work, consider contacting a pest control professional. They can assess the situation and provide targeted solutions for your specific needs.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using borax for ants outside is a simple, effective, and affordable solution for managing outdoor ant problems. By preparing the bait correctly and placing it strategically, you can eliminate ant colonies and protect your garden or yard. Always follow safety guidelines when handling borax, and enjoy an ant-free outdoor space.</p>

<p>For an ant, it can take anywhere from 24-48 hours to die after eating borax or boric acid bait.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax can kill ants, but the ants do their work for you. Forager or worker ants will carry the borax bait back to their nests and share it with other ants.
Though it may take anywhere from 24-48 hours, the ants will feed and share the borax amongst themselves; this will gradually kill off an entire colony of ants, eventually killing their queen.</li>

There are a few signs that can help you determine whether or not ants have invaded your home.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Look for ant mounds: Ants will make small, dome-shaped hills out of the dirt in order to live. As time goes on these mounds become more frequent and larger; they may also be close together as the colony grows over time.</li>
<li>Look for ant trails: If you see long lines of tiny insects wandering aimlessly around your house then that&rsquo;s a big sign an infestation is underway - and something needs to be done! These trails will sometimes lead up walls or seem like they&rsquo;re going nowhere at all these ants might be looking for food or nesting areas; other times theres actually nothing going on, and the ants are just exploring.</li>
<li>If you think your home is infested with ants: You&rsquo;ll need to look for any sources of food or water that might be attracting them - like crumbs from a forgotten piece of toast, sugar stuck in small crevices around counters, or sipping some spilled milk. The best way to tackle an ant invasion is by eliminating these temptations first before applying other methods (like sprinkling borax).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget about traps! Setting up bait stations near entrances can help stop new invaders from coming inside which will ultimately make things much easier down the road. Ants also don&rsquo;t seem to recognize many scents as dangerous so using peppermint oil may not work; you can also use cinnamon oil, which has been proven to be very effective.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re done inspecting and bait-setting up, it&rsquo;s time to start the borax treatment plan by sprinkling some on every surface that ants are known to crawl: Your kitchen countertops and floors, windowsills, window ledges (make sure not do this if your home is in a high rise because they&rsquo;ll just walk right off), under furniture legs where pets like to sleep or eat; anywhere there might be crumbs for them to feast on.

<h2 id="how-to-do-ant-baiting">How to Do Ant Baiting</h2>
<p>On ant baiting, here are a few tips for getting ants to take your bait back to the colony, which will help ensure that you dont have any ants come back.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid ant sprays - Sprays are an effective insecticide for killing any type of pest, but should not be used around ant baits. Spraying near your ants&rsquo; bait usually deters or repels them from eating it.</li>
<li>Positions baits on trails - To work successfully, ant bait must be situated near trails. Ants often forage in groups or &ldquo;trails.&rdquo; If you can locate where the ants are trailing, this is an ideal location to place and best bait.</li>
<li>Remove Harborage places - Ants will nest in dark places where they are well hidden, like in the yard or leaf piles. So, frequently clean up and make sure your house is not cluttered.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t disturb - Don&rsquo;t kill ants that come around the borax bait. These are scouts who help find food for their colonies - they will carry the bait on their back to their nest.</li>
<li>Remove food sources - Keep your home as clean as possible in order to help prevent ants from coming into contact with any food sources. Also, store all of your food inside containers that have tight-fitting lids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-borax-kill-the-queen-ant">Will borax kill the queen ant?</h2>
<p>Borax or boric acid combined with a sugary substance to make a liquid bait will kill adult�ants including the queen.</p>
<ul>
<li>But to kill ant larvae, create a borax bait with white sugar and borax (at a ratio of 1:1) and mix these ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed.</li>
<li>The larvae are more sensitive than adult ants so this mixture is lethal for them and also kills some insects such as termites.</li>
<li>Place baits on ant trails. This includes any surfaces where ants are found, such as railings, sidewalks, and walls.
For best results use this method during the late evening when all types of ants are present and feeding but before midnight because that is when most immature stages die off naturally.</li>
<li>Also, leave out baits containing sugar after sunset since these become ineffective at night unless you add another attractant (such as sugary aphid honeydew) which will only work for ants that are attracted to sweet substances.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="does-20-mule-team-borax-kill-ants">Does 20 Mule Team Borax kill ants?</h2>
<p>Mixing 20 Mule Team Borax with sugar in a ratio as close to your count (for example if you have 50 ants then make it half sugar and half Borax) so each ant eats its share and dies.</p>
<p>20 Mule Team Borax is very good at controlling a wide variety of insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Or perhaps it might be easier just to use borax, which you can find in stores.

<h2 id="how-does-terro-ant-baits-kill-ants">How Does TERRO Ant Baits Kill Ants?</h2>
<p>TERRO liquid ant baits are pesticide-free bait that will attract and kill ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alkaline borax is an ingredient found in many different products, but its safe to assume that having water close to boiling temperature will quickly solve any household ants coming into contact with your cereal, oatmeal or spices.
The poison causes the ant&rsquo;s stomach to burst, killing almost instantly. Ants soon starve from lack of energy and die as their digestive tract shuts down due to this persistent source of alkaloid poison (borate).</li>
</ul>
<p>The borax in the bait will eventually kill the worker ants. However, it works slowly enough to allow for a few trips by a foraging ant before the effect is lethal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the course of a few days, you will likely start to see lower numbers of ants in your home or around the bait.
When using an ant bait station, it is important not to disturb the bait until the ants are fully fed.</li>

<p>Yes! It Works Slow Enough That Allows For Trips By A Foraging Ant Before Effect Is Lethal.</p>

      <description>Hey Pet Lovers &amp;amp; Pet Parents,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Pet Lovers &amp; Pet Parents,</p>
<p>Maybe you know that borax (sodium borate) is as a cleaner and antiseptic. Also, it&rsquo;s used in toothpastes, water softener, pesticide, and mouthwashes.</p>
<p>Well, recently, we discussed how borax can be used
as a flea killer
around the house. But how safe is it around
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-borax-safe-for-dogs/">dogs</a>
and cats.
**Is borax safe for cats? **
**Yes and No. **
**Cats, and kittens are more sensitive to the toxicity of borax than humans are - and if your cat ingests a large amount (5 grams and above), it damages their internal organs and skin which can cause poisoning, breathlessness, allergies, and death. **</p>
<ul>
<li>**Moreover, inhaling sodium borate powder can inflame or irritate the respiratory system&rsquo;s mucous membrane. **</li>
<li><strong>Normally, dogs and cats do not lick sodium borate. But if they have it on their paws, they may lick it.</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best <a href="/posts/is-borax-safe-for-dogs/">Fleas</a> Treatment for Cats&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
<li><a href="/posts/borax-flea-killer/">Borax</a> and boric acid are considered safer pesticides in comparison to other chemicals in killing fleas, ants, roaches, and fleas.</li>
<li>The 20 Mule-Team Borax is one of the borax-based cleaning products. However, borax is safe for cats if ingested in small and EPA-approved amounts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-borax-safe-for-cats-borax-for-fleas">Is Borax Safe for Cats? Borax for Fleas</h2>
<p>If ingested in small amounts in ingested as recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency, Borax is safe and won&rsquo;t harm your small pets including cats and dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite not being very toxic, if borax is ingested in large amounts by your hamsters, dogs, or cats, it may be toxic compared to its effects on humans.</li>
<li>Similarly, inhaling sodium borate may inflame or irritate the respiratory system.*But borax will be safe for your cat and kittens. *
Its rare that your cats and dogs will lick the Borax (sodium borate) directly. But if the borax is stuck on the claws of these felines and canines, they may ingest it as they clean their claws.</li>
</ul>
<p>Borax is not harmful to cats - at least when used properly by manufacturers&rsquo; instructions. Boraxo or 20 Mule-Team Boragon can be purchased from most grocery stores without any issue whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="is-borax-great-for-killing-ants-and-fleas">Is Borax Great for Killing Ants and Fleas?</h2>
<p>Yes, borax is safe for cats. Its a popular way of getting rid of fleas, as it dehydrates them while also killing them.</p>
<p>As a result, fleas have no defense against borax. Borax penetrates their skin to get to the larvae and kill them outright. But eggs that are still forming couldn&rsquo;t be penetrated by the borax solution.</p>
<p>Borax is fatal to ants, it&rsquo;ll damage the bug&rsquo;s digestive system and
exterminates the ants within 24-48 hours</p>
<ul>
<li>removing the ant queen and the other colony.</li>
<li>The first step in eliminating an ant infestation is figuring out where they&rsquo;re entering your home.</li>
<li>When ants find food they need to share it with other ants in their colony by leaving behind some pheromone trail.
Actually Borax has some advantages over traditional pesticides such as DEET-based products because it doesn&rsquo;t kill the good bugs like pollinators that are needed to make our food plants grow.
It&rsquo;s also not toxic to humans when ingested in amounts less than what you would get from simply using it once on your carpet; however if swallowed, vomiting may occur due to stomach irritation by gastric fluids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symptoms-of-borax-poisoning-in-cats"><strong>Symptoms of Borax Poisoning in Cats</strong></h2>
<p>The symptoms of toxicity in cats after taking excessive amounts of borax include:</p>
<ul>
<li>If swallowed, vomiting may occur due to stomach irritation by gastric fluids.</li>
<li>Excessive salivation or drooling</li>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Dropping food from the mouth and eating non-food items such as dirt and stones</li>
<li>Loss of appetite (anorexia)</li>
<li>Nervousness or excitability during initial exposure stages followed by depression following chronic intoxication stage.
Signs are most severe between 24 hours after ingestion until 36 hours after ingestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>When ingested in small amounts that would be a normal amount for someone with sensitive skin; however, if swallowed it can cause nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-treat-borax-poisoning-in-cats">How to Treat Borax Poisoning in Cats</h3>
<p>In the event your cat comes into contact with borax, a veterinary doctor should administer treatment to avoid toxicity. If your cat ingested borax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the animal from the area of exposure to prevent further ingestion of the chemical (if not already done).</li>
<li>I would recommend dialysis on the cat as this will easily remove the borax from the animal&rsquo;s body. You may also use IV fluids on the cat to help reduce the effect of borax.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use activated charcoal and don&rsquo;t force the cat to vomit
For further precaution, was the cat thorough using
some mild detergent
or that suitable
cat shampoo
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-borax-on-cat-fleas">Using borax on cat fleas</h2>
<p>Borax is not recommended as a flea control product. It can be used to eliminate carpets, but it does not kill the eggs or larvae of fleas and ticks in your home.</p>
<p>Borax also doesn&rsquo;t work well on hard surfaces and has no residual effect which means that you will still need to use other products if you want complete protection from these pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, if you do decide to apply borax powder directly onto the fur of your pet, we recommend that you only use one teaspoon at a time as this will dramatically reduce any risks associated with its application.
Remember to wash them after they have been outside because fleas and ticks are attracted to their blood which means they could potentially come back inside with them from areas where there&rsquo;s an infestation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Borax is safe for cats plus another small pest if used as intended. Always go for brands and quantities that are
<a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-011001_1-Sep-93.pdf">EPA-registered</a>
for your intended use to reduce chances of toxicity.</p>
<p>If you are trying to control fleas in your cat, fill borax into crevices, cracks, and carpet and leave it there for around 24 hours before vacuuming it. Don&rsquo;t put the borax powder directly on your cat&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>For fleas, borax will damage their exoskeletons but for other insects like termites, ants, and
cockroaches
, it&rsquo;ll cause stomach poisoning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle Borax across the floor, and in carpets. This is great for fleas, as it kills their larvae, but may not exterminate the adult fleas since they&rsquo;ll only feed on pet blood.
Therefore, Borax must be used only as part of a comprehensive flea or ant-treatment program since it may not eliminate these insects alone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The safety of borax for cats is a contentious issue, with some claiming it to be hazardous while others maintain that it can be safe when used correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax for Fleas: Borax is not very effective in killing cat flea and may be toxic if used in large amounts - 5 grams and over.</li>
<li>So, before settling on using borax, employ other flea and ant control methods like IGRs and pyrethrin sprays.</li>
<li>This is less of a concern for dogs, which do not groom themselves as regularly and so are likely to ingest fewer particles.
In short: Borax can be safe if used in appropriate amounts - but should always be used only with other methods of flea control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always store it well in places out of reach of both your children and pets since they may accidentally ingest it. Also, get rid of any spillages.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first question is, is <a href="/posts/is-borax-safe-for-cats/">borax</a> <a href="/posts/pet-safe-roach-killer/">safe</a> for dogs? The answer to this question is that it depends on the amount and how often they are exposed.
Borax is a chemical compound (Na2B4O7(OH)410H2O) that has multiple uses in industry, but many people use it as a laundry booster or as an insecticide because of its low toxicity to mammals and birds.
<strong>But, just how toxic is borax to dogs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dogs are susceptible to borax toxicity at over 0.02 oz per lb of body weight. It will <strong><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470699010"><strong>cause clinical signs</strong></a></strong> like loss of appetite, retching, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anemic skin/ gums, shock, and <strong><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/274229"><strong>death</strong></a></strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The dog exposed to borax or boric acid frequently vomits, produces stools with blue-green substance or blood, and becomes lethargic or droopy-eyed.�</strong>

<h2 id="is-borax-safe-for-dogs"><strong>Is Borax Safe For Dogs?</strong></h2>
<p>Borax is a chemical compound that can be found at many grocery stores. But the real question is how much borax can a small dog eat before being dangerous?
Well, for every pound (half a kilogram) of body weight, dogs are only able to tolerate about 0.25 grams (0.06 ounces) of borax before it is too much for them and can cause serious health problems such as vomiting or diarrhea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax is an irritant, so if your dog consumes any borax, they will likely experience some type of irritation in their mouth or stomach.
<strong>Oral ingestion of b</strong>
<strong>orax</strong>
, either as a pesticide or as a cleaner, has been linked to many disorders in dogs including seizures,
<a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/kidney-problems-in-dogs">kidney failure</a>
, or death when ingested.</li>
<li>When you mix Borax ingredients with others that are also unsafe for your dog, the health consequences can be even worse.
Borax ingestion may also damage the dog&rsquo;s reproductive organs, brain, and endocrine system. Other symptoms of borax poisoning include excessive drooling, vomiting, and diarrhea.</li>
<li>Dogs that have ingested borax may also experience an elevated heart rate or blood pressure, panting, seizures, difficulty breathing, tremors, and unsteady gait.

<li>toxic for dogs?*
The answer is simple; YES. As Borax and boric acid are so similar, both chemicals could be harmful to your dog. The question remains, then: Which one is worse?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well, it all depends on the kind of exposure that occurs. If you make a mistake with just one like getting it on your dog&rsquo;s paws and they lick it, boric acid is the worse choice.

<h2 id="causes-of-dog-borax-poisoning">Causes of Dog Borax Poisoning</h2>
<p>Boron, a naturally occurring element found in a number of products used around the home can have adverse effects on your canine companion.
The causes of borax poisoning include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insecticides</li>
<li>Paints</li>
<li>Fungicides</li>
<li>Rodent poisons and repellents</li>
<li>Medicated powders</li>

<li>Detergents.</li>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">Laundry products</a>(detergent powders)</li>
<li>Shaving cream</li>
<li>Diaper creams
Cosmetics such as soaps or lotions with borax in them can also be a cause of poisoning to your dog if they lick the product of their skin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-20-mule-team-borax-harmful-to-dogs">Is 20 Mule Team Borax harmful to dogs?</h2>
<p>Yes,
20 Mule Team Borax
is toxic to dogs. But there&rsquo;s no need for you to panic because it won&rsquo;t kill your pet instantly unless they consume a large amount in one sitting.
The boron present in the product can cause vomiting and diarrhea with larger doses that may lead to death if not treated promptly by a veterinarian.
What are some of the symptoms I should keep an eye out for?</p>
<ul>
<li>The signs of dog poisoning include nausea, excessive drooling, lethargy or weakness (being uncoordinated), seizures, difficulty breathing or panting, increased heart rate, and/or fever up until 106 degrees Fahrenheit.
If any such symptom persists seek veterinary attention immediately!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-dog-ingested-or-ate-borax-what-should-i-do">My Dog Ingested or Ate Borax, What Should I do?</h2>
<p>In the event that your dog has eaten borax, you should contact your veterinarian straight away. Once youve done this, take note of the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure at what time did he last eat? If it was more than one hour ago then a trip to the nearest veterinarian is not necessary. But, if less than an hour has passed; or he just ate; it is extremely important to get him there as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Contacting your vet will involve gathering information about how big (how many kilograms) is your dog and also finding out whether they have anything which may assist with animal poisoning cases beforehand- such as anti-emetics or charcoal treatments. Assuming no arrangements are made beforehand
Contacting the dog Poison Helpline is a good idea to get answers if your dog has been poisoned. Animal poison control centers exist to provide help in times of need.
One of the many helpful services offered by the poison helpline is to provide insights on potential causes for dog poisoning.
Once you provide your vet with the case number, they can speak directly to the poison helpline toxicologists who will advise on the best course of action.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-at-the-vets-office">What will happen at the Vet&rsquo;s Office?</h2>
<p>When you take your pet to the vet for dog borax poisoning, there are typically a few treatment options that vets recommend.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your veterinarian will decide if the dog needs immediate veterinary attention, and may induce vomiting if appropriate. Ingested borax will be vomited up.</li>
<li>A dog with borax poisoning will be monitored for signs of neurological damage.</li>
<li>If the vomiting continues, or if the dog is lethargic and experiencing muscle tremors, seizures, depression, or difficulty breathing, a veterinarian may decide to admit him/her into an animal hospital intensive care unit (ICU).</li>
<li>Once admitted to ICU he/she will receive intravenous fluids (IV fluids) as well as medications that help reduce stomach acidity and prevent kidney failure from dehydration.</li>
<li>The vet may take blood, urine, or tissue samples to test for damage to organs caused by ingestion of borax.
The vet will keep your pet under observation in order to see whether there are any changes such as skin irritation around their mouth caused by too much saliva being produced.</li>
<li>Intravenous fluids can also cause this so they&rsquo;ll monitor it carefully until all symptoms have cleared up.
The vet may recommend a gastric lavage if your dog shows symptoms of high toxicity such as neurological symptoms.</li>
<li>Gastric lavage is a process of cleaning out your dog&rsquo;s stomach (under anesthesia) and the first part of their intestines by giving them an emetic to induce vomiting.</li>
<li>Otherwise, they&rsquo;ll recommend feeding charcoal (which absorbs some types of poison) in order to absorb any remaining borax that may have been ingested.
The vet will also monitor hydration levels closely through urine output as well as blood pressure if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recovery-from-borax-poisoning-for-dogs">Recovery from Borax Poisoning for Dogs</h2>
<p>Kidney damage from boric acid poisoning is a top concern for vets. The vet may opt to do hemodialysis and dialysis to help remove any boric acid from the kidneys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once they have recovered, make sure to keep them away from any borax.</li>
<li>Leaving it in the house will only tempt your dog and could lead to another poisoning event or death.
The vet may also prescribe
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/borictech.html">medication for boric acid</a>
depending on how much borax was consumed by the dog.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion on the question &ldquo;is borax safe for dogs&rdquo; is a yes with many considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax is safe for dogs when used in moderation, but can lead to kidney damage if consumed in excess or over time.</li>
<li>It is very important that you always keep borax away from your dog and make sure they have plenty of water during recovery!
If swallowed: Watch out for severe vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy (too tired), seizures (convulsions).</li>
<li>If these symptoms occur seek emergency veterinary care immediately because this could be life-threatening as well. See your vet</li>
<li>I would love to hear any feedback so I may improve on future content.
