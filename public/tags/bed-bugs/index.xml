<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borax">Borax</a>
. This natural mineral has been a trusted pest control solution for over a century and offers a safe alternative to chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re dealing with ants, the cockroaches, fleas, or bed bugs, 20 Mule Team Borax can help manage these unwelcome invaders effectively.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-20-mule-team-borax">What is 20 Mule Team Borax?</h2>
<p>20 Mule Team Borax is a crystalline mineral made from boron, sodium, oxygen, and water. For more than 100 years, it has been used in cleaning and laundry products. This mineral is not only economical but also environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Its primary mode of action as a pest control agent is through dehydration. When pests come into contact with or ingest Borax, it damages their exoskeletons and disrupts their digestive systems, leading to dehydration and death.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-20-mule-team-borax-work">How Does 20 Mule Team Borax Work?</h2>
<p>The effectiveness of 20 Mule Team Borax in pest control stems from its desiccating properties. Pests like ants and cockroaches rely on their exoskeletons to prevent moisture loss.</p>
<p>Borax particles adhere to these exoskeletons and absorb moisture from the insects body, causing rapid dehydration. Additionally, when ingested, Borax interferes with the digestive systems of pests, further ensuring their demise.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-pests-controlled-by-20-mule-team-borax">Types of Pests Controlled by 20 Mule Team Borax</h3>
<p>20 Mule Team Borax is effective against a variety of common household pests, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ants</strong>: These pests often form colonies in wall voids or under floorboards, seeking out food and water.</li>
<li><strong>Cockroaches</strong>: Roaches hide in cracks and crevices, potentially spreading allergens and infections.</li>
<li><strong>Fleas</strong>: Fleas bite both humans and pets, causing irritation and itching.</li>
<li><strong>Termites</strong>: These insects can severely damage the structural integrity of your home.</li>
<li><strong>Silverfish</strong>: Known to damage books, wallpaper, and clothing, silverfish thrive in dark, damp areas.</li>
<li><strong>Carpet Beetles, Moths, Flies,Spiders</strong>**, Bed Bugs, Ticks**: Borax is also effective against these pests, making it a versatile option for pest management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applying-20-mule-team-borax-for-maximum-effectiveness">Applying 20 Mule Team Borax for Maximum Effectiveness</h2>
<p>To get the most out of 20 Mule Team Borax, strategic application is essential. Heres how to use it effectively:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify Pest Hotspots</strong>: Determine where pests are most active. Common areas include cracks around windows, doors, utility pipes, and in pet bedding.</li>
<li><strong>Clean and Prepare</strong>: Before applying Borax, thoroughly clean the areas to remove food residues and other attractants. This ensures that Borax is not diluted or masked by other substances.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Borax</strong>: Lightly dust Borax powder in areas where pests are active. For example, apply it along gaps around windows and doors, around utility pipes, and in the corners of rooms where pests may hide.</li>
<li><strong>Treat Pet Bedding</strong>: Fleas often infest pet bedding. Wash and fully dry the bedding before applying Borax. Ensure pets are kept away from treated areas until the Borax is cleaned up to avoid irritation.</li>
<li><strong>Target Nesting Sites</strong>: Different pests have specific nesting preferences. For example, silverfish favor moist, dark areas like basements, while cockroaches prefer warm, humid spaces. Apply Borax directly to these areas to address infestations effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Use as Bait</strong>: Mix Borax with attractive food items such as honey, syrup, or peanut butter to lure pests like ants and cockroaches. When pests consume the Borax-laced bait, they will carry it back to their nests, helping to eliminate the entire colony.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="safety-precautions">Safety Precautions</h3>
<p>While 20 Mule Team Borax is non-toxic to humans and pets when used properly, it is important to handle it with care:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid Direct Contact</strong>: Prevent Borax from coming into direct contact with your skin, eyes, or mouth. Use gloves when applying it and wash your hands thoroughly afterward.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Away from Pets and Children</strong>: Store Borax in a secure place out of reach of children and pets. If you apply Borax in areas frequented by pets, restrict their access until it is cleaned up.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="borax-vs-boric-acid">Borax vs. Boric Acid</h3>
<p>Its worth noting that Borax and Boric Acid, though related, are different substances. Borax is a natural mineral that contains about 11% boron, whereas Boric Acid is a synthesized compound with higher insecticidal potency.</p>
<p>Both can be used for pest control, but
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/boric-acid/">Boric Acid</a>
is typically more effective for certain applications, such as in traps or powders due to its finer grain and higher toxicity to insects.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tips-for-pest-control">Practical Tips for Pest Control</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regular Inspection</strong>: Regularly check potential pest entry points and nesting areas to address issues before they escalate.</li>
<li><strong>Combine Methods</strong>: For severe infestations, combine Borax with other pest control methods or consult a professional.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Maintain cleanliness in your home to avoid attracting pests. Proper food storage and regular cleaning are key preventive measures.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are
<em>bed bug eggs</em>
hard or soft? Are they hard or soft? This is a question you might be asking in an attempt to figure out whether the substances youre seeing are bed bug eggs.
Well, bed bugs eggs are soft to the touch and tend to crush when you try to pick or dislodge them from the surface.
They adhere to the surface, which makes it difficult to dislodge without squashing. Therefore, bed
bug eggs
are soft and can readily be destroyed by crushing with a stick or bare hands.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft-bed-bug-shells"><strong>Details: Are Bed Bug Eggs Hard or Soft? Bed Bug Shells</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bug eggs appear as grains of rice attached to surfaces. However, an attempt to touch them with your finger can tell you that they are soft, unlike rice grains.
They tend to adhere to the surface due to the
glue-like substance that bed bugs
use to secure them in place. Any attempt to scrape or pick the eggs from the body makes them crush.
The outer shell of the egg shields the fluid from which
bed bugs grow
. However, its not hard enough to resist a little force from your fingers. - try bed bug
home remedies/)
.
Instead of dislodging from the surface, the eggs tend to spread or smear on the cover whenever you try to lift them.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bug-eggs-have-hard-shells"><strong>Do Bed Bug Eggs Have Hard Shells?</strong></h3>
<p>Although
bed bug eggs
are very tiny, they have a hard outer shell covering the internal fluid. Thats why most of the insecticides and home remedies such as
diatomaceous earth cannot kill bed bug
eggs.
Steaming and heat treatment are some of the most effective ways of destroying the hard outer shell found in bed bug eggs - including those of
<em>baby bed bugs.�</em>
Even so,
bed bug eggs squash
easily when subjected to mechanical forces such as when scrapped off or picked from the surface.
A little force breaks the outer shelf and
exposes the fluid from which bed bugs
grow. The fluid smears on the surface and your finger whenever you try to pick them.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug-egg"><strong>What Happens When You Squish a Bed Bug Egg?</strong></h2>
<p>Its almost painful to see bed bug eggs because they are very tiny and seemingly transparent.
But, when squished on fabrics, the
bed bugs appear as small stains
almost faint yellow.
Freshly squished eggs tend to adhere to the surface and smear on your fingers. However, if left to dry on wood or fabrics, the stain may become flaky and break into pieces.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-crush-bed-bug-eggs"><strong>Should You Crush Bed Bug Eggs?</strong></h2>
<p>Well,
bed bugs are as easy to squish
as crushing a cooked rice grain or bean. Although this reduces the number of eggs that hatch into nymphs, its an inefficient
combating bed bug
infestations.
The fact that
bed bugs lay many eggs
makes it impractical to eliminate them by squashing their eggs. Besides, they put their eggs in narrow spaces to avoid predators or disturbance by humans.
To crush eggs in these places, you need a slender stick or a credit card. This can be time-consuming and also ineffective.
Generally speaking, squashing bed bug eggs cannot provide an effective solution to a bed bug menace.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs"><strong>How to Kill Bed Bug Eggs</strong></h2>
<p>While most chemical products and home remedies may prove
effective against bed bugs
, they may not work on bed bug eggs.
So, what
should you do about bed bug
eggs? Below are two treatments you can use to get rid of bed bug eggs effectively.</p>
<h3 id="1-steaming"><strong>1. Steaming</strong></h3>
<p>The hard outer shell in a bed bugs egg makes it difficult for pesticides to penetrate.
It is possible to kill bed bugs with a dry steamer at all their life stages, including eggs - use
bed bug steamers
to kill flea larvae and eggs.
Most steamers come with nozzle attachments, which allow you to direct the steam into
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">crevices where bed bugs</a>
lay their eggs.
They also come with upholstery nozzle attachments, which can be used to steam upholstery.</p>
<h3 id="2-freezing"><strong>2. Freezing</strong></h3>
<p>Another effective
method for destroying
bed bug eggs is to expose them to shallow temperatures - adult bed bugs can be trapped.
Bed bugs and their
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">eggs cannot survive</a>
at temperatures below 3 degrees Fahrenheit. You can also use
<a href="https://www.bedbugsinsider.com/can-you-kill-bed-bugs-with-ammonia/">ammonia to kill bed bugs</a>
, among other cheap remedies.
Leaving infested items outside during the winter season will
kill bed bugs
and their eggs. If possible, you can put the infested items in a freezer to
kill the bed bugs
and eggs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>However, squashing bed bug eggs does not effectively eradicate bed bugs -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">mattress encasement</a>
can also help.
The use of chemicals
may also prove futile
because they may not penetrate the hard outer shell found in bed bug eggs. The most
effective methods for destroying bed bug
eggs include steaming or freezing.</p>

<h3 id="1-appearance-and-size"><strong>1. Appearance and Size�</strong></h3>
<p>In size, Nymphs are in between the
bed bug eggs
(1 mm / 0.09 inches) to the size of an adult bed bug (4.5 mm / 0.18 inches).
However, immature
bed bugs
are tiny in size (definitely) but will grow bigger as they suck more blood and molt.
It&rsquo;s important to note that it&rsquo;s possible to
see nymphs with the naked eye
.�An adult bed bug will�be something like an apple seed in size (about 4.5mm), and it is red or brown.
[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_6620&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Bed Bugs Lifecycle. Credit: phdmc.org[/caption]
The baby bed bugs-nymphs add about 0.5 mm of their size at each molting stage (of the five juvenile &ldquo;nymph&rdquo; stages). However, do not confuse a cluster of bed bug eggs (with each measuring about 1 mm) with the nymphs.
At the 5th nymph stage, the baby bed bug is almost equal to their adult counterparts. But for more clarity, check out the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLhL09m5oDM">video</a>
(Courtesy of Sandy Honess) and see how you can differentiate the nymphs from the adult bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="2-shape-andcolor">**2. Shape and�**<strong>Color�</strong></h3>
<p>Nymphs have an oval just like their counterparts. So, the main difference between the nymphs and the adult bed bugs is just the color. After hatching, nymphs will be yellow-white (almost colorless) but will turn reddish or brown as they feed on blood.
Before they suck blood, bed bugs are relatively thin and hence will easily slip through cracks and crevices into mattress covers and furniture spaces where they hid, waiting to lay eggs or attack their next host.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jGm8widTEY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jGm8widTEY</a></p>
<h2 id="do-baby-bed-bugs-jump-or-crawl"><strong>Do baby bed bugs Jump or Crawl?�</strong></h2>
<p>First things first, the baby bed bug, just like the
adult bed bugs, can&rsquo;t fly or jump
. However, these bugs have a breakneck speed when running on a flat surface, ceilings, walls, and floors.
To be specific, bed bugs will clock about
<a href="https://www.terminix.com/bed-bug-control/behavior/do-bed-bugs-jump/">4 feet every second</a>
. I am wondering if even adult
bed bugs can fly
? Do Check�this
Guide for more details
.
Nevertheless, compared to insects like fleas that can hop and jump around, bed bugs can only crawl or run very fast on floors and other surfaces. Nothing would qualify as an adventure in the movement of bed bugs.
Further, they&rsquo;ll only crawl low in the ground because of the bug&rsquo;s wide body and short legs. However, despite moving very fast, they would not quickly significantly exceed their regular crawling speed.
<strong>Will bed bugs climb up rough surfaces?</strong>
Bed bugs, including the
baby bed bugs-nymphs
, have small hooks on their legs. Therefore, in these structures, the bugs hold onto pores, cracks, or crevices of different rough surfaces and quickly climb up metals, plastics, walls, clothes, or timber. On the flip side, bed bugs cannot climb up on smoother covers such as glass and porcelain.
<strong>Can bed bugs push off serious obstacles?</strong>
Equally, the
bed bugs wont do great in moving in thick carpets
, hair, or some busy terrain because of their wide-body and short legs.
Further, the short legs are also too frail to push heavy objects aside, incredibly when moving in thick hair, carpets, or grass. Therefore, they would opt to climb up the items and drop on the other side or circumnavigate them in such cases.</p>
<h2 id="do-baby-bed-bugs-bite"><strong>Do Baby Bed Bugs Bite?</strong></h2>
<p>Immediately after hatching, the nymphs from the eggs (nymphs) need to suck a pint of human (of your pets) to allow it to grow, live, and molt into other lifecycle stages.
Check the nymphs (Nymphs) - Color, Pictures, Movement.�Side note:
Bed bug eggs
take two weeks to hatch, after which the nymph moves through the five molt stages during which they must feed on blood.
<strong>Therefore, the short answer is</strong>
that just like the adult bed bugs, the baby bed bugs-nymphs
bite human
beings for blood. Interestingly, the nymphs will bite humans (and such blood) more often due to their growth requirements. However, the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-bed-bug-bites-last/">bed bug bites will disappear with 1-2 weeks</a>
.
<strong>But how do the bites from nymphs look like?</strong>
Well, bites from the nymphs will look just like those from the adult bed bugs. As a reminder, such bites leave reddish bumps on your skin and are itchy too. Equally, nymphs will mainly bite your shoulders and arms  this can be
compared to fleas that mostly bite the feet and ankles
.</p>
<h2 id="where-can-baby-bed-bugs-be-found"><strong>Where can baby bed bugs be found?</strong></h2>
<p>Despite that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">bites from bed bugs</a>
could be a significant sign of their presence on your premises, you must know how and where the bugs tend to hide so that you can easily control them.
First things first, the signs to look out for include blood spots or fecal matter (colored like rust) on your bedding or mattress.
Sadly,
human beings can carry
bead bugs and their nymphs in their clothes from one house to another. For example, the bugs may hitchhike your bags, purses, clothes, and luggage. However, they do not love hairy
pets such as cats and dogs
.
But of course, you know that the nymphs can also trigger skin irritation and transmit diseases. Therefore, the best solution when you believe you have a bed bug infestation is to hire the services of a bed bug exterminator or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">spray on the adult or babies of bed bugs directly</a>
.</p>

It is difficult to tell the similarities and differences between bed bug bites vs. mosquito bites - unless you have actually seen the parasite itself.
Both bites will appear as small raised lumps, itchy, and won&rsquo;t bust. Bedbugs bits, however, will take longer to heal compared to

<h3 id="1-appearance"><strong>1. Appearance</strong></h3>
<p>Both appear as red, raised lumps. Both can range in color from light pink to a brownish look. Both
bites are also slightly raised from your skin
. Besides, both are smooth when you touch them and appear swollen.
When left untreated, the bitten area might attract germs and infections that can harm our health. Below is how you can treat them.
There are certain things which you can do while a mosquito or a bed bug bites you. They are not too dangerous but to avoid having severe symptoms, try to cure it before its out of hand.�Related:

<h3 id="2-itchiness"><strong>2. Itchiness</strong></h3>
<p>Both bites are itchy because their saliva contains chemicals.�Your skin will itch upon a bite from either of them because they contain two different chemicals: Anticoagulant and Anesthetics.
Anticoagulant stops blood from clotting. This allows them (bedbug and mosquitoes) to suck up blood for several minutes before the wound closes up.
Anesthetic chemical leaves a numb feeling which prevents the bite from itching at. First, this ensures you don&rsquo;t notice them feasting you, well, at least for seconds.

<h3 id="3-swelling"><strong>3. Swelling</strong></h3>
<p>Both bites will appear swollen, can&rsquo;t be squeezed and popped. The bitten area will swell as a response mechanism from your body to enable more blood to reach it.
More blood ensures sufficient white blood cells that can help fight the threat of infections. More blood concentration in the bit area will see it swell, but it can&rsquo;t be squeezed nor popped. Related:

<h3 id="1-size"><strong>1. Size</strong></h3>
<p><em>Bedbug bite:�</em>
About 4-5mm long and 1.5mm wide
<em>Mosquito Bite:�</em>
Size depends on the length of time the mosquito&rsquo;s labium remained stuck in your skin.
The size of a bedbug bite is relatively bigger than a mosquito bite, whose size depends on the length of time its labium remained stuck in your skin. The longer the time, the larger the bite.</p>
<h3 id="2-reaction"><strong>2. Reaction</strong></h3>
<p><em>Mosquito Bite:�</em>
Bite turns red immediately, a rash appears.
<em>Bedbug Bite:�</em>
Reaction depends on an individual, which might occur between the first 20 minutes to days after.
Our bodies will detect a mosquito bite instantly, and a rash will appear right after the bite. In some extreme cases, your body can form blisters in reaction to the mosquito bite.
For bedbugs, however, the reaction will depend on your body. It could be after 20 minutes or even days. Some of us won&rsquo;t react to it at all. Related:

<em>Bedbug Bite:�</em>
Takes longer to clear up, 1-3 weeks.
Mosquito bites will disappear faster, usually after a maximum of 4 days, depending on how your body reacted. Over that length of time, the bite will gradually lose its swelling and smoother its normal color.
For bedbug bites, however, it will take up to 3 weeks at most to clear up. Those of us with a strong reaction to it will see the bite take a longer period to clear up.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-they-feast"><strong>4. How they feast</strong></h3>
<p><em>Bedbug Bite:</em>
appears on parts of the body close to the mattress.
<em>Mosquito Bite:�</em>

Mosquito bites spread several viruses like malaria, zika virus, and yellow fever, among others. For bedbugs, they don&rsquo;t carry any disease; however, the wound can lead to the entry of germs in our bodies when left untreated.</p>
<h3 id="6-who-they-bite"><strong>6. Who They Bite.</strong></h3>
<p>Mosquitoes
bite not only humans
but also many other animals like birds. Mosquitoes are categorized into different species, and each has their preferences on what to feast on. Some prefer humans over other animals.
Contrary to that, bedbugs have a specific diet: human blood. Although bedbugs do feed from other animals in some cases, they stick to
humans for most of their lives
.
Their preference for human blood has been attributed to the host&rsquo;s convenience, given they cannot
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-fly/">fly nor jump</a>
. Also, the human
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-your-skin/">skin has an easier surface to bite</a>

Bedbugs are most common in populated settlements like cities and suburbs. The higher the population, the more the bedbugs. The proximity of households enables the easier
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-jump/">movement of bedbugs</a>
from one house to another.

Mosquitoes, on the other hand, require
standing water
like ponds and pools to breed. Therefore, you are more likely to experience mosquito problems if you live near a lake, ocean, or neighborhood with an un-maintained swimming pool.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bedbugs are hard to control but their bites could also trigger allergic reactions, cause itching, and are painful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bugs-that-look-like-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">look like many other insects</a>but they will mainly hide inside mattresses, baseboards, upholstered furniture, headboard, walls, and furniture.
Is it a <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bully-review/">bed</a> bug that is biting you? Well, in this article, I will teach you how you can differentiate between bed bug bites and other bites.
Lets dive in.
Most humans will get terrified when bed bugs crawl into their bed or house.
Bed bugs are nocturnal insects that will bite on animals and humans (while they sleep) to suck blood.</li>
<li>If your skin has some small red dots, you may be confused whether they are from bed bugs or any other biting or stinging insects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-bed-bugs-bite">Where Do Bed Bugs Bite?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs tend to bite on most of the skin diseases caused including the feet, hands, arms, legs, neck, and face.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pests will bite the areas of your skin that are not covered while you are sleeping.</li>
<li>However, bedbugs invite you all over your body if you sleep wearing few or no clothes.
A bed bug will bite humans and inject their
anticoagulant
that will make your skin numb so that you won&rsquo;t feel it while they&rsquo;re sucking blood.
The bed bug sucks a fill of the human blood (before going into hiding for a number of days) and will only return when its blood supply (their food) goes down.</li>
<li>Bed bug bites have a similar shape and size to those from mosquitoes and fleas - which makes it difficult to identify them correctly.
But in summary, here are some of the unique features that will help you identify the bedbugs bites.</li>
<li>The localized bite area will have a rash</li>
<li>Burning sensation</li>
<li>Itching around the bite area - localized</li>
<li>Red welts that are small and appear in clusters or in ZigZag lines.
Also, humans may experience anxiety and insomnia because the bed bugs will disturb their sleep patterns.</li>
<li>Luckily, besides causing possible allergic reactions, bed bugs (includingbaby bed bugs)are not documented to carry any disease-causing pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-bed-bug-bites-versus-flea-bites">1. Bed Bug Bites Versus Flea Bites</h2>
<p>a. Bite Locati
<strong>on</strong>
It&rsquo;s important to know where specific pests will bite a human being.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if you know that the b of a specific pest tends to be concentrated in a certain area, itll be easy to identify the pest.
Fleas will mainly target humans on the lower extremities
<a href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/mg343">such as the legs</a>
when bed bugs will bite your upper torso.
But why?
Well, bed bugs will mainly hide or nest in the bedding such as mattresses and sheets.</li>
<li>They will mainly move towards the head of your bed and thus they will bite your arms and upper torso - but you can use a<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">mattress Encasement</a>.
On the other hand, fleas will mainly bite humans on the lower body such as the legs.</li>
<li>This is because fleas do not fly but leap over small heights - about 13 inches.
Also, fleas do not target people but will buy them when their preferred host (cats and dogs) is not available. See how to
Keep Fleas off Me While I Sleep
.
b. Colour and size
The Colour and size of the bite are important factors in trying to identify the animal causing them.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that the differences between bed bug bites and flea bites (when considering color and size) is minimal, I have some clues for you.
Bites caused by animals are relatively large and they will appear like reddish welts but they will be less bright compared to flea bites.</li>
<li>Bed bug bites will be laid down in clusters in a zigzag or line.
However, flea bites will be smaller than bed bug bites and will also have a red appearance that is brighter.</li>
<li>Flea bites can be found in patterns of the human skin but may also be grouped closely.
c. Time of biting
Bugs have different feeding habits, and will also feed at varied times of the day -information that can help you identify the insect biting you.
First, we&rsquo;ve noted that bed bugs mainly feed at night because they are nocturnal insects.</li>
<li>Also, these bills will mainly be hiding during the day and thus they want to bite humans.
However, fleas will move and feed at any time of the day or night that they choose.</li>
<li>So if you notice bites occurring and insects crawling on your skin during the day, you know that you are battling with fleas.
But flea bites and bed bug bites have similarities; they take some time to be felt since they inject an anticoagulant.
Also, both bites may lead to severe reactions such as itching and allergy (insect-related).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9UzvclvEQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9UzvclvEQ</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-bed-bug-bites-versus-mosquito-bites">2. Bed Bug Bites Versus Mosquito Bites</h2>
<p>Mosquito bites will be painful since mosquitoes do not have the numbering ability like that in the saliva of bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, mosquito bites will leave you with some unique (one or two) large marks on the skin.
However, bed bug bites will appear in clusters as opposed to singly or in pairs.</li>
<li>So, if you notice several bites in one location but you didn&rsquo;t feel them being inflicted, these will be bed bug bites.
a. Bite Location
Bed bugs will mainly bite humans on the part of their body that is near the mattress - which is the back, sides, arms, and upper body.</li>
<li>For example, if you are sleeping on your back and the bed bugs are hiding on the top right side of the mattress, then the b will appear on your right shoulder and side.</li>
<li>Also, if the bed bugs are hiding on the bed headboard, the bites will appear mainly on your head and shoulders.
So if you notice that you have some regular bites on your body that appear on the right side, then inspect the side of your mattress.
However, mosquito bites will be inflicted on any part of your body that is exposed.</li>
<li>Parts of the body that are regularly exposed include the arms and legs and this is where you&rsquo;ll find most of the mosquito bites.
This implies that mosquitoes will not get under your sheets to bite you like it is the case with bed bugs.
b. Colour and size
Bed bug bites and mosquito bites have a similar appearance with their colors ranging from brown to light pink.</li>
<li>Both bites will be raised a bit from the human skin but have an average size of a pea.
On sensation, bed bug bites will feel the same (in pain and itching) as mosquito bites.</li>
<li>Both will be swollen and feel smooth and so it&rsquo;ll be challenging to differentiate them just by their looks
Unlike the condition of pimples, both mosquito and bed bug bites cannot be popped or squeezed.
c. Time of biting
Compared to mosquito bites, bed bug bites and their pain tend to last longer - this could be up to two to three weeks (if you have a stronger bite reaction).</li>
<li>So mosquito bites will clear faster - which will be between three to four days.</li>
<li>But mosquito bites will have cleared within 1 week.
Also, bed bugs don&rsquo;t bite continually but in different locations since they need to get a blood meal every 3 days.</li>
<li>Mosquitoes can also bite humans continually but they&rsquo;ll be easy to control and clear.
Bed bug bites appear in clusters but this is not the case with mosquito bites.</li>
<li>Mosquito bites will appear on random human skin locations (that are exposed) since these insects will seek and attack their hosts singly.
However, bed bug bites will form a line (some form of pattern) since a number of bed bugs in the colony will follow the same route while attacking their hosts.</li>
<li>Also, bed bugs will attack humans in a group and they will bite on the first exposed location they find.
Earlier I noted that bed bugs will not carry disease-causing organisms but mosquitoes will.</li>
<li>Mosquito bites will, besides causing itching, transmit disease-causing organisms that lead to the Zika virus, yellow fever, malaria, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-bed-bug-bites-versus-tick-bite">3. Bed Bug Bites Versus Tick Bite</h2>
<p>Tick bites will be larger than bed bug bites but they&rsquo;ll have the same shape and color.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ticks will also remain on the animal for long (while still biting) and will also transmit diseases such asLyme disease.
But bed bugs will bite humans or other hosts, suck blood and then go back to hiding.
a. Bite Location
Bed bug bites will look harder and swollen compared to tick bites.</li>
<li>Also, bed bugs will move in numbers while biting humans on multiple occasions for their bodies.
So the bed bug bites will be patterned when the tick bites will be in only one location.</li>
<li>Further, ticks can bite under clothes or different layers while bed bugs will prefer biting skin that is exposed.
b. Colour and size
Tick bites may transmit diseases that are commonly known as tick-borne diseases.
Here is a quick guideline on how to identify tick bites.</li>
<li>Tick bites will not be filled with fluid but other bites such as from and we&rsquo;ll have some fluid (pus) inside.
On location, Tick bites will mainly be on the back of your legs, groin, scalp, and neck.
Besides, ticks will bite humans and pets on one location before burrowing in but other pests such as bed bugs and fleas will bite on multiple locations.
c. Time of biting
Just like bed bugs, this will also inject the anesthetic into your skin which will make its bites painless.</li>
<li>Injecting the chemical will help the tick to undertake its biting and blood-sucking undetected - at least for some time.
However, things will not borrow their body fully into the skin. The tick can continue feeding on the host&rsquo;s blood for about 10 days.
If the bite has a bulls-eye rash, then this could be a sign that there is an infection of Lyme disease due to a tick bite.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-bed-bug-bites-versus-chigger-bite">4. Bed Bug Bites Versus Chigger Bite</h2>
<p>Chiggers love living in wooded, grassy, damp, and moist areas - and so you want to generally find them in your bedroom.
You can differentiate between bed bug bites and chigger bites with the location of that bite on the human body.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chigger bites will give you welts and they will mainly be found around your waist.</li>
<li>But bed bug bites can be found just around all above your abdomen
You can cure the chigger bites using some quality chigger repellent.
a.Reaction time
Bed bug bites will generally not be felt when the pest is in action but will only be noticed if there is evidence on the sleeping area.</li>
<li>These pests will inject a numbing chemical into the human body.</li>
<li>The chemical will also prevent any blood from the bite location
Chigger bites and their symptoms can remain for a few days to several weeks depending on how long the pest lodges on you.
b.Colour and Size
Both chigger bites and bed bug bites will look inflamed, red, and raised spots on the skin.</li>
<li>But as outlined earlier, bed bugs bites will appear in random clusters or in a line, especially where there is exposed skin.
But chigger bites mainly happen one human is wearing clothes that are tight-fitting.</li>
<li>Also, the chigger bites will actually be grouped together in such areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-bed-bug-bite-versus-hives">5. Bed Bug Bite Versus Hives</h2>
<p>A hives outbreak can happen from a number of triggers such as a bug bite, environmental factors, or a reaction to food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hives will appear like red welts (angry) and they will spread on your skin, especially on locations that came into contact with the irritant.</li>
<li>Hives can create splotchy patterns and are linked to wheals or red bumps that are painful.
But bed bug bites would be formed into a line and we&rsquo;ll be a few. You can also use an antihistamine to treat hives.
a.Size and color
Bites from bed bugs will have a similar size but two separate ones can become joined and appear like a big bite.</li>
<li>In brief, bed bug bites will be about the size of an eraser on your pencil.
But I will have different sizes and may be small or large like a pimple.</li>
<li>On color, bed bug bites generally look red but the skin around the bite may be lighter.</li>
<li>However, hives can have a dark red to pale color (with a red skin surrounding) or even have a color similar to your skin.
b.Shape
Both bed bug bites and hives will be raised from your skin and they will flatten during the healing process.</li>
<li>The shape of the bed bug bites will be like that of mosquito bites - with even edges.</li>
<li>But hives will have uneven edges and their shape will vary.
c.Location
We&rsquo;ve repeated this a number of times, but my wife will likely appear on skin that is exposed.</li>
<li>As you sleeping on your bed or couch, bed bugs will bite your neck, legs, and arms
However, you may find hives on almost any part of your body.
Another characteristic feature that we differentiate bed bug bites from hives is the number of people suffering in the house.</li>
<li>Notably, if more than one person is suffering from similar skin irritation, then that will be most likely a bedbug bite.
However, if it is just one person suffering from skin irritation, then I would classify these as hives since they aren&rsquo;t contagious.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-bed-bug-bite-versus-chicken-pox">6. Bed Bug Bite versus Chicken Pox</h2>
<p>Vaccination is the most common remedy against chickenpox.</p>
<ul>
<li>But some people find it challenging to differentiate between chickenpox and bed bug bites.
The key differentiating factors between the two will be the type and quantity of markings.</li>
<li>Chickenpox marks are fluid-filled and irritated (blisters) while bed bug bites will be red bumps that have no fluid or pus.
Chickenpox is known to spread all over the human body because they caused by a virus.</li>
<li>Bad bed bug bites won&rsquo;t appear in large numbers since is pests bite at a lower rate.
So it is clear that chicken off will look different from bed bug bites.</li>
<li>Scratching the location that is affected by the bed bugs bite can result in a small bump and redness</li>
<li>But chickenpox will cause visible and clear marks that will persist on the skin for up to one year.
The symptoms of chickenpox will include itchiness and redness on the skin location that is affected.</li>
<li>Symptoms of bed bugs on humans will include an itchy red rash, headache, loss of appetite, hardness, and fever.
Chickenpox will leave your skin or not of your kids with marks but bed bug bites won&rsquo;t leave Marks just some minor redness.
Chickenpox will sure leave marks all over the human body but bed bug bites will appear as clusters or groups.
The remedies for chickenpox will include baking soda baths, oatmeal baths, and calamine lotion.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the remedies for bed bug bites will include ice to minimize redness and itching, calamine lotion, and anti-itch cream.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bugs would use a number of sectors such as carbon dioxide, and body heat to detect a suitable host such as human beings.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best will take a complete blood meal on their host in under 15 minutes and then get back to their hidden areas.
Bedbugs are cold-blooded insects that get into a dormant state and can survive in that condition for months without taking a meal.</li>
<li>For example, bed bugs will survive for about 12 months when the temperatures are under 55 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skills, the manufacture of Bed Bug Bully, markets the product as an effective, non-toxic, all-natural bed bug killer spray.
So, how accurate is this?
Can Bed Bug Bully safely exterminate mild to moderate bed bug infestations? Will it kill even the
baby bed bugs/)
?
In this post, I seek to verify these claims by undertaking a thorough review of
Bed Bug
Bully.�So, let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Bed Bug Bully&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="summary-bed-bug-bully-review-full-analysis">Summary: Bed Bug Bully Review (Full Analysis)</h2>
<p><strong>My Overall Review:�Only Suitable for Treating Small to Medium Bed Bug Infestations.�</strong>
<strong>1.</strong>
Bed Bugs Bully is
a contact killing killer
that offers great residual protection for prevention and killing.
Luckily, being odorless and chemical-free, you can even
spray this insecticide
in the bedroom even before your sleep.
<strong>2.</strong>
The spray will kill the whole bed bug life cycle - eggs, their babies, and adults bed bugs (
check the pictures of bed bugs here
).
Bed Bugs Bully is equally safe, besides
being highly effective
, to both humans (including kids) and pets in your house.
<strong>3.</strong>
Spraying bed bugs
bully won&rsquo;t stain your furniture, linens, or other surfaces in the area of coverage. Equally, it has no harsh odor or chemicals - but leaves a mild scent behind.
<strong>4.</strong>
However, some
<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/how_effective_are_natural_bed_bug_pesticides-146722">available case studies</a>
claim that Bed Bugs Bully is ineffective in treating bed bugs. Further, some homeowners claim that pesticide doesn&rsquo;t
kill bed bug eggs
.
The issue is that the pesticide won&rsquo;t
kill bed bugs and their eggs
tucked deep in the fibers or the blankets, pillows, and mattresses.</p>
<h2 id="features-or-specifications">Features or Specifications</h2>
<p>Below are the�natural oils you&rsquo;ll
find in Bed Bugs
Bully - they&rsquo;re highly toxic to bed bugs but very safe for humans (including kids) and pets.</p>
<ol>
<li>Castor Oil - 0.5%,
*Clove oil - 0.40%, *
&amp;
*Citronella oil 0.40% *
*2. Mint oil - 0.24% *
&amp;
<em>Rosemary oil - 0.4%�</em></li>
<li>Citric Acid - 1% &amp; Sodium L. Sulfate - 2.5%</li>
<li>32 oz total Weight</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="bed-bug-bully---key-features">Bed Bug Bully - Key Features</h2>
<h3 id="1-longresidualprotection">1. Long<strong>Residual</strong>Protection</h3>
<p>Bed Bugs Bully is created
to have a long residue effect - it&rsquo;ll last even about 30 days.
Therefore, the pesticide will continue exterminating the
bugs for a long time after the first-bed
bug treatment.
However, it&rsquo;s good to repeat the
bed bug treatment
using this pesticide about 3-4 times after several weeks.</p>
<h3 id="2-contact-killing-pesticide">2. Contact-killing Pesticide</h3>
<p>The pesticide will kill the bugs only on contact and thus great for controlling
bed bugs you can see in your home
.
However, this could be a disadvantage because the bed bugs might be hidden inside crevices, cracks, or
inside carpet fibers
.</p>
<h3 id="3-non-poisonous-non-toxic">3. Non-Poisonous /Non-toxic</h3>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, the
bed bug bully mainly is made
from natural oils, including castor oil, clove oil, citronella oil, and mint oil.
The product has no toxic chemicals and will be safe to use around your family members, other humans, and pets.
This can be contrasted to using other pesticides like the
best bed bug fogger
that would require you, your family, and all pets to leave the house for about 12 hours after setting them off.
Also,
bed bug bully won&rsquo;t leave
a toxic or lingering odor - and thus, it&rsquo;ll be comfortable to even sleep in a room that you&rsquo;ve just treated for bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="3-its-a-liquid-form-spray">3. Its a Liquid Form Spray</h3>
<p>The pesticide exists in liquid form and hence will be easy to
apply to
bedbug-infested areas such as mattresses, crevices, cracks, or bed frames.
Further, the liquid form makes it easy to combine this bed bug bully will different cleaning products such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a></p>
<ul>
<li>for effective control of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-suitable-foroutdoor-andindoor-treatment">4. Suitable forOutdoor andIndoor Treatment</h3>
<p>Bed Bug Bully will work
great for both your outdoor and indoor spaces.�You&rsquo;ll be able to control the bugs both inside the house and before they infest your dwelling spaces.
I dare say that the bed bug insecticide will work for most weather conditions - including winter and summer, killing bed bug adults and their babies.</p>
<h2 id="an-alternative-to-bed-bug-bully-to-kill-bed-bugs">An alternative to Bed Bug Bully to Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Traditional pesticides are just as effective or the naturally developed
bed bug killers
. An excellent pointer is Steri Fab, which many people trust in exterminating
bed bugs from their business premises
and homes.
Sadly, most
bed bug sprays
are ineffective in controlling bed bugs, or theyll have a lower efficiency level.
For this, I suggested that you use a combination of different bed bug control techniques, including Eco Defense, mattress encasement, diatomaceous earth, and dry
bed bug steamers
.</p>
<h3 id="1-mattress-encasements">1. Mattress Encasements</h3>
<p>Bed bugs will always be looking
for dark and warm places to hide  and mattresses are such good locations. However, you can use
bed bugs mattress encasement
as theyll safeguard the mattress against any such attacks.
Further, any
bed bugs thatll lock inside
the mattress encasement will lack the chance to take their regular blood meals and will thus starve to death. This is mainly because
bed bugs cant bite through clothing or fabrics
.
However, you can also use box spring encasement if youre using box springs. Also, ensure that the encasement isnt damaged or scratched since this will provide entry or
exit points for bed bugs
and their babies.</p>
<h3 id="2-diatomaceous-earth">2. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth�will be a great alternative to bed bugs bully because its cheap, non-toxic, and its all-natural  itll prevent the bugs from moving around your house and thus
spreading carelessly
.
However, DE must not be used alone as itll have lower kilning effectiveness.�DE is a natural white power thats manufactured from sea rocks.
Luckily, itll tear the
bed bugs skin
, dehydrate it by taking out its body fluids and thus kill it. So, put some DE over the floors and furniture in your
house where the bed bugs
will be walking.</p>
<h3 id="3-dry-bed-bug-steamers">3. Dry Bed Bug Steamers</h3>
<p>Steamers are an excellent way to treat
bed bugs in your walls, cabinets
, mattresses, furniture, chairs, and sofas.
For example, most steamers will generate steam at over 200 degrees thatll
exterminate both bed bugs
eggs and adults.
Luckily, steam will easily reach the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs while hiding</a>
in the crevices, cracks, and baseboards. However, only shift the steamer at 1 inch every second while treating these blood-sucking bugs in your house.
The machine has nozzles thatll release small amounts of dry steam. However, the device must be used cautiously as it can burn kids and pets with high-temperature steam.
Remember to use a respirator to protect yourself from ant gages or chemicals that might be released.</p>
<h3 id="4-vacuuming">4. Vacuuming</h3>
<p>A vacuum will enable you to keenly clean all the tough spots and corners that may
easily hide bed bugs
and their babies.
However, be sure to securely seal the vacuum bag before disposing of it after youve finished vacuuming. Next, ensure thoroughly washing the vacuum cleaner to remove all the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>
, the babies, and adults.
These, if not removed well, could trigger a
bed bug re-infestation
. Further, store the vacuum machine in a sealed bag  this will prevent re-infestation.</p>
<h3 id="5-wash-fabrics-with-hot-water">5. Wash Fabrics with Hot water</h3>
<p>Next, you can wash your clothes with very
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">water and then dry them to kill the bed bugs</a>
and their existing eggs.
Use a
dryer to kill bed bugs
with the least  but ensure to check the maximum temperature recommendation for each cloth fabric.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-bed-bugs">Identifying Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Accurate identification is the first step in dealing with bed bugs. Here are some key characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appearance</strong>: Bed bugs are small, oval, and brownish insects. Adult bed bugs are about the size of an apple seed, while nymphs are smaller and lighter in color.</li>
<li><strong>Bites</strong>: Bed bug bites often appear in clusters or lines on exposed skin. They can cause redness, itching, and swelling.</li>
<li><strong>Signs of Infestation</strong>: Look for tiny reddish-brown fecal spots on bedding, mattress seams, and furniture. You might also find shed skins or live bugs in these areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prevention-tips-for-puyallup-homeowners">Prevention Tips for Puyallup Homeowners</h2>
<p>Preventing a bed bug infestation is much easier than eliminating one. Here are some tips to keep bed bugs at bay in Puyallup:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspect Secondhand Items</strong>: Puyallup residents often enjoy shopping at local thrift stores and garage sales. Carefully inspect used furniture, mattresses, and clothing before bringing them into your home. Bed bugs can easily hitch a ride on these items.</li>
<li><strong>Be Cautious When Traveling</strong>: When staying in hotels or other accommodations in Puyallup or beyond, check the bed and surrounding areas for signs of bed bugs. Keep your luggage off the floor and bed, and inspect it before returning home.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Clutter</strong>: Clutter provides hiding places for bed bugs. Keep your home tidy and reduce unnecessary items, especially in bedrooms. Puyallup&rsquo;s mild climate can sometimes encourage indoor clutter as people store seasonal items.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Cracks and Crevices</strong>: Inspect your home for potential hiding places such as cracks in walls, baseboards, and furniture. Seal these openings to prevent bed bugs from establishing themselves.</li>
</ol>

, several natural methods can help control <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heat Treatment</strong>: Bed bugs cannot survive at high temperatures. Wash and dry bedding, clothing, and other infested items on high heat. Steam cleaning can also be effective for furniture and carpets.</li>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: This natural powder can be applied to cracks, crevices, and other bed bug hiding spots. It works by dehydrating and killing the bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Oils</strong>: Some essential oils, such as tea tree oil and lavender oil, are believed to repel bed bugs. However, their effectiveness can vary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chemical-bed-bug-control-methods">Chemical Bed Bug Control Methods</h2>
<p>When natural methods aren&rsquo;t sufficient, chemical solutions can be effective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insecticides</strong>: Use bed bug-specific insecticides to treat infested areas. Follow all safety instructions and consider hiring a professional for application.</li>
<li><strong>Encasements</strong>: Encase mattresses and box springs in bed bug-proof covers to trap any existing bugs and prevent new infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-bed-bugs-in-puyallup">Dealing with Bed Bugs in Puyallup</h2>
<p>Bed bugs can be particularly challenging due to their ability to hide and reproduce quickly. Here are some additional tips for dealing with bed bugs in Puyallup:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Inspections</strong>: Conduct regular inspections of your home, especially in bedrooms and living areas, to catch any infestations early. Puyallup&rsquo;s community events and social gatherings can increase the risk of bringing bed bugs home, so staying vigilant is important.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Treatment</strong>: If an infestation is severe, professional pest control services can provide more potent treatments, such as heat treatments or fumigation, which may not be available to homeowners.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</strong>: IPM combines multiple control methods for a comprehensive approach. This includes physical, chemical, and biological controls, along with regular monitoring and prevention strategies.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upon mating with a male bed bug, the female bed bug lays oval, white eggs about 1/16-inch long. You&rsquo;ll find the eggs hidden in crevices &amp; cracks.
In its lifetime, an
<a href="https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/manuals/25/">adult bed bug</a>
lay roughly 200-250 eggs.
The eggs will also hatch in 6-10 days, and the
baby bed bug/)
immediately starts hunting for a blood meal. Notably, the egg is the most challenging stage in the life cycle of bed bugs to control.
So, in this guide, we delve into the details of what the eggs look like and how to treat
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155541551730274X">these bed bugs</a>
on your clothing, yard, and house. Also, here&rsquo;s a guide on
how to kill those bed bug eggs
.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="bed-bug-eggs--pictures--appearance-and-life-cycle">Bed Bug Eggs * Pictures * (Appearance and Life Cycle)</h2>
<p>What do
bed bug eggs look and smell like
? They are off-white or semi-transparent in color and measure about 2.5 mm or 0.1 inches in length (relatively tiny!). You might confuse them for a pinhead, uncooked white rice (grain), or a grain of salt.
The eggs have a sticky surface that makes them stick together in a cluster. Further, the oval-shaped eggs have round ends that are elongated. When they&rsquo;re over five days old, they&rsquo;ll have an evident dark mark that makes them look like an eye.
The rice-like eggs have a &ldquo;wet spot&rdquo; on its surface - the sticky/ glue-like (but relatively invisible) substance allowing the eggs to stick together. You can find them using a flashlight or magnifying glass.
Adult
bed bugs will lay about 200-250 eggs
, and, when exposed to the right conditions, they&rsquo;ll put in 6-10 days. Further, the
bed bug nymphs will go hunting for a blood meal
.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-see-bed-bug-eggs">Can you see bed bug eggs?</h2>
<p>Despite that
bed bug being 2.5 mm in size
, you can see them with your naked human eyes. You&rsquo;ll notice that the adults anywhere near red, brown, or tan. Check here for
what bed bugs look like
.
However, the eggs and nymphs are tiny, and they&rsquo;ll be more challenging to see with your naked eyes -� not unless they appear in clusters - one of them is anywhere like a pinhead-sized.
Eggs are generally off-white of pearly whites, and they mainly exist in clusters of many eggs that&rsquo;ll ultimately measure about 1 millimeter in length.</p>
<h2 id="common-areas-where-bed-bug-eggs-are-found">Common Areas Where Bed Bug Eggs Are Found?</h2>
<p>So,
where do bed bugs
lay eggs? Well, adult
bed bugs won&rsquo;t move far from their hiding
place to feed and lay eggs. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll
mainly find bed bug
eggs in protected areas - near the food source.
For example, the bugs will sneak into cracks and crevices - even as thin as your business card - to lay their eggs. Check mattress joints and seams for the eggs. Don&rsquo;t forget the behind headboards or in the box spring when touching or fixed to the wall.
Further search for the eggs near or around your
bed because the bed bugs and bite
mainly suck blood while their host is sleeping. Thus, here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll mostly find the eggs - as the bugs primarily feed at night.
Check for black &ldquo;specks&rdquo; or red marking - bed bug feces since they have semi-digested blood. These could also have a sweetish or pungent odor that
comes from the bed bug&rsquo;s
scent glands.</p>
<h2 id="where-can-you-pick-up-bed-bugs-eggs">Where Can You Pick Up Bed Bugs Eggs?</h2>
<p>These
bed bugs will live in clusters</p>
<ul>
<li>that&rsquo;s the only way you can see them since they&rsquo;re too tiny for the naked eye when separated. So, here&rsquo;re the
signs of bed bug
eggs - particularly in the areas you rest or sleep.
<em>Bedroom:�</em>
In the bedroom, check especially around or on -</li>
<li>Mattresses buttons and folds, tufts, bed frames, mattresses, and box-springs.</li>
<li>Examine furniture, including chairs and desks - avoid second-hand furniture like the plague.</li>
<li>Checkbehind pictures, clocks, and wallpapers for bed bugeggs.</li>
<li>Examine under your carpet and wooden floors - especially in any cracks that you may find.
<em>While traveling</em>
: You can
carry off pick-up bed bug
eggs while you&rsquo;re traveling from one town or country to the other. Therefore,</li>
<li>Keenly inspect your new room when you&rsquo;re allocated as you start your vacation or even a short stay.</li>
<li>Check that you don&rsquo;t set your luggage on the hotel room floor and don&rsquo;t carry it into the house directly when you come from your travel.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget thatbed bugs can also hidein other rooms such as laundry rooms, living rooms, and bathrooms.
<em>Check smears and spots</em>
: Check for brownish or dark reddish smears or places that are fecal
deposits of the bed bug&rsquo;s
digested blood.
You may find these smears and spots around the bed, on mattresses, pillowcases, and bedsheets.
This shows that the beds were feeding around the bedding and sheets. In addition to fecal spots, also check for cast skins.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-bed-bug-eggs-hard">Are bed bug eggs hard?</h2>
<p>*So, are bed bug eggs hard? *
These nymphs are simple to squash because�they&rsquo;re
soft - they&rsquo;re sticky and smooth.
These
eggs are hard to pick up because they&rsquo;ll easily
squash or smear on your hands - despite having an outer shell. In the eggs, you&rsquo;ll find a fluid that eventfully
develops into your bed bugs
.
It is possible to
squash the bed bug
egg clusters using the nails or between the fingers.
However, don&rsquo;t crush
<a href="https://www.bedbugsinsider.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">the bed bugs</a>
, so hire an exterminator.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-bed-bugs-lay-their-eggs">Where Do Bed Bugs Lay Their Eggs?</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll
mainly find bed bug
eggs in
protected sites, including beds, different furniture, and mattresses. Most of these places will be near their host, and one with darkness, and given safety.
Also,
bed bugs will lay their eggs in floorboards
, baseboards, and wall cracks. Check
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/how-find-bed-bugs">how to check bed bugs on wood and fabrics, metal, bed-frames, or plastic</a>
. I&rsquo;ve analyzed
probable areas you&rsquo;ll find bed bug
eggs.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bug-eggs-in-beds">1. Bed Bug eggs in Beds</h3>
<p>Bed Bug eggs
will mainly be laid around
mattresses and buttons - you&rsquo;ll find them on rough surfaces. The bed is an excellent location because it&rsquo;ll be near the bug&rsquo;s host - i.e., humans beings.
Because bed bugs won&rsquo;t get very far from your house, it&rsquo;s possible to get the eggs in the bed - this is
where you&rsquo;ll see the bed bug
nymphs and adults. So, inspect the open spaces and the non-flat spaces on the bed. Check the
<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/emergingdiseases/mattress_fact_sheet_275417_7.pdf">bed bug in the mattress.</a>
Inspect the box springs, mattress edges or
folds, and seams for bed bug
eggs. Besides, check under the mattress and box springs, walls, floor,
mattress encasements
, and bed frame since they may contact the infested beds.</p>
<h3 id="2-flooring-and-carpet">2. Flooring and Carpet</h3>
<p>Sadly, you might not easily see the
bed bug eggs when they&rsquo;re hiding
in the flooring or carpet. These tiny eggs are translucent, measuring about a sesame seed in size.
If you
examine your carpet
, ensure you check under the chairs and dressers, legs of your bed frame, and the flooring. Don&rsquo;t just mop or sweep your carpet or floor, as this won&rsquo;t
kill bed bug
eggs.
On the contrary, you are using an excellent-suction
vacuum that&rsquo;ll remove the bed bugs
from your carpets, walls, and floors. Besides,
dry/ heat treat the rugs
or
vacuum the bed bugs
plus include a carpet shampoo.
The steam will
instantly kill the bed bug
eggs sitting deep into the flooring cracks and carpet fibers. Further, this will
quickly kill the bugs
in the mattress seams and furniture fabrics.
Further, examine around the baseboards and walls, in addition to joints and cracks in the hardwood floors. Remember to explore the wall-to-wall carpet - particularly along tack strips and edges.</p>
<h3 id="3-window-curtains-and-windows">3. Window Curtains and Windows</h3>
<h2 id="do-bed-bug-eggs-survive-after-spraying">Do Bed Bug Eggs Survive after Spraying</h2>
<p>A
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-abstract/109/6/2495/2422101">study by K. R. Hinson et al.</a>
shows that survival of bed bug eggs (
<em>Cimex lectularius</em>
L) or first-instar nymphs sprayed directly highly depends on
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">bed bug spray used</a>
, life stage, and strain.
Notably, the study examined the insecticides&rsquo; efficacy
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-traps/">against first-instar nymphs and bed bug</a>
eggs. The motivation for the
research was because bed bug
eggs tend to be highly resistant.
The outcomes were that Temprid SC (imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin) produced the best
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">results as first-instar nymphs and bed bug</a>
eggs n- it prevented the hatching of the eggs - giving only a 13% hatch rate.</p>
<h2 id="metabolic-activity-and-water-loss-in-bed-bug-eggs"><strong>Metabolic Activity and Water Loss in Bed Bug Eggs</strong></h2>
<p>Water loss among
different strains of bed bug
eggs was not significant. But chorion water loss was significantly other between the field-collected bed bug eggs to your Harlan laboratory strain -

However,
the bed bug
eggs&rsquo; metabolic rate among Harlan strain rose with temperatures ranging from 15 - 35?C. But this would decrease when the weather hits 39?C -

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs are reddish-brown and nocturnal insects that suck blood from warm-blooded animals including humans - youll find them in hotel rooms or in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bodies of the bed bugs are flattened (dorsoventrally) and hence they will easily hide in upholstered furniture, beds,carpets-live-in-carpet/), and floor cracks.
So if you starting a journey to control bed bugs in your business premises or house, it is very important to know the life cycle of these pests.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the lifecycle of bed bugs shows that it moves through 3 key stages: egg, the nymph, &amp; bed bug adult - this whole life cycle of bed bugs will take between 1 to 4 months to complete.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bed bug eggs will hatch in around 1 week (6 days to 9 days) while its nymph stage moves through five instars (or phases) to finally become an adult.
Signs of a bed bug infestation in your hotel or the house include seeing some reddish-brown and wingless insects that may be hiding in the bed or mattress - a quick remedy would be
using mattress encasements
.</li>
<li>Also, the presence of an outer shell of insects in the area may point to the presence of bed bugs.</li>
<li>However, depending on the stage that the bed bugs are in their life cycle they will have different sizes and colors.
Therefore it&rsquo;s important to know how to identify the bed bugs and differentiate them in their different stages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bed-bug-life-cycle---stages-in-the-life-of-bed-bugs">Bed Bug Life Cycle - Stages in the Life of Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>The general but critical information about bed bugs include;</p>
<ul>
<li>The eggs are laid covered with some glue and they&rsquo;ll hatch within 10 days.</li>
<li>The bed bug nymph stage goes through five phases (stages) or what we call instars.</li>
<li>Each of the bedbug instar we require to take a blood meal for them to molt to the next instar stage.</li>
<li>Adult bed bugs can live for about 10 months but their whole life cycle will complete in between 1 to 4 months.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6myZM7FO8w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6myZM7FO8w</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-bed-bug-eggs">1. Bed Bug Eggs</h3>
<p>The life cycle of a bed bug starts at the egg stage - the eggs are milky white and grain-like in shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs (females) we lay eggs clustered in 10 to 20 pieces and a total of 200 - 500 eggs on in their lifetime different surfaces including bed frames.
Bed bug eggs
will be laid in clusters or in singles and they will finally be stuffed in crevices and cracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bed bug eggs measure about the size of two salt grains - which is about a length of 1 mm or less.</p>
<ul>
<li>The eggs grow fast because in just two weeks they&rsquo;ll have hatched and their nymphs will be leaving already.
Since the bed bugs are tiny in size you might be unable to see them using your naked eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>But they will be late around where the bedbugs sleep, they look like grains of salt, and are white or creamy in color.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s laid, Bed bug eggs are around 1 mm but they will all have grown about 1.5 mm when moving to the nymph stage.</p>
<p>Bed bugs so what we call granular metamorphosis - this implies that pests will grow bigger progressively at every instant stage but they will require to take a blood meal for molting to happen.</p>
<p>The bed bug nymph will graduate product rule after death fifth stage of molting in their instar movement in the life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>When food and other conditions for growth are available bed bugs will move through their life cycle in 1 - 4 months.</li>
<li>But the adult bed bugs May leave even for 1.5 years.</li>
<li>Also provided the female bed bugs are healthy will continue laying eggs - which weve noted that in their lifetime theyll lay about 500 eggs.

Are Bed Bug Eggs Hard or Soft?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-bed-bug-nymphs--baby-bed-bugs">2. Bed Bug Nymphs / Baby Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>Bed bug nymphs or
Baby Bed Bugs
go through molting stages before achieving maturity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite that the nymphs may look mature, they are small-sized and have not yet achieved sexual maturity.
Old nymphs will be red-brown in color while the younger ones will be yellow-white.</li>
<li>The nymphs will require room temperature and a blood meal for them to successfully malt to the next stage.
When a suitable host is available to supply a blood meal to the bed bug nymphs, these organisms will molt to the next stage if there is room temperature in around 3 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bed bug eggs and their nails are yellow-white or light-colored and thus it will be challenging to spot them while on the carpets and bedsheets.</p>
<ul>
<li>The organisms turn red after feeding on that blood meal but they will also tend to darken as they achieve maturity
When you spot some of these nymphs be sure that is a larger bed bug population in your space.</li>
<li>Arsenal because the nymphs are small-sized there will be even more challenging to detect compared to the adult.</li>
<li>The size of the nymphs will be about the size of a sesame seed - which is around 1 to 5 mm in length.
Is it possible for the bed bug nymphs to lay eggs?</li>
<li>Well, technically, nymphs can&rsquo;t lay eggs but in around 5 weeks from egg hatching, these organisms will have achieved enough fertility (as an adult).
Will Diatomaceous Earth kill bed bugs?</li>
<li>Well yes, the formulation that isdiatomaceous Earthwill kill adult bed bugs and also exterminate their names nymphs.
Diatomaceous Earth as noted earlier kills bed bugs by dehydrating them after peeling off its skin.</li>
<li>So since the bed bug nymphs are immature, their skin will be immature and thus softer - that will mean that the Diatomaceous Earth will have an easier job exterminating them
The nymphs will walk over the diatomaceous Earth and they will get injured, begin bleeding and finally die.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will especially happen in the third and fourth stages of the nymphs growth because these organisms will be more active and will easily reach the location of the diatomaceous earth.</p>
<p>However diatomaceous Earth won&rsquo;t wipe out the whole nymph population. Therefore, experts recommend
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-heaters/">using heat treatments</a>
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">bed bug sprays</a>
or hiring exterminators for infestations that are large.</p>
<h3 id="3-adult-bed-bugs">3. Adult Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>The average length of an adult bedbug ranges from 1/4 inch to 3/16 inches - they have a wide and flat body but will get larger once theyve fed on blood from their host.</p>
<ul>
<li>After getting a blood meal (engorged) the bed bug&rsquo;s body will be cylindrical and longer.
But bed bugs are generally brownish, oval-shaped, and small insects (comparable to an apple seed) that live on hosts such as humans and other animals.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will move fast over ceilings, walls, and floors -<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-fly/">but they cant fly</a>.
Also before reaching maturity they mature bed bugs (instars or nymphs) will have shed skin 5 times when molting to the next stage and after feeding on blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the conditions are right, the bedbugs will reach the adult stage in about a month and thus will produce 3 + generations each year.</p>
<p>But where will bed bugs hide?</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs will make entry into your house unnoticed through items such as couches, second-hand beds, clothing, and luggage.
If there is a space in the house that measures the width of your credit card, then the bed bugs will take advantage of their flat bodies and hide there.</li>
</ul>
<p>But generally, you&rsquo;ll find bed bugs hiding in headboards, bed frames, box springs, and mattresses from where they can access humans easily at night while they are sleeping.</p>
<p>But as a bedbug colony grows these insects will move to other apartments or nearby rooms, protected locations, crevices, or just scatter around your bedroom.</p>
<p>You may also find bed bugs in clean hotel rooms or homes - this is contrary to the common rumor that bed bugs signify dirtiness but this is untrue since these insects survive only through blood meals.</p>
<p>At what time will bed bugs bite humans? Well, bed bugs will largely bite humans as they sleep - especially at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs will pierce your skin and suck blood via their elongated mouthparts for between 3 to 10 minutes before crawling away.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqcc3ILhHP0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqcc3ILhHP0</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The life cycle of a bed bug we&rsquo;ll take it 2 three life stages which are; egg stage, nymph stage (through five instars), and finally the adult stage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through these three stages, bed bugs will have different shapes, sizes, colors, and feeding habits.
Therefore as you seek to control bed bugs in your home or business premises you require to know how they look in their different life stages.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs are a common pest problem in Tacoma, posing a challenge for homeowners and businesses alike. These small, elusive insects can cause significant discomfort and health concerns, making effective treatment essential.</p>
<p>This article provides an in-depth look at bed bug treatment options in Tacoma, ranging from professional pest control services to do-it-yourself (DIY) methods, along with preventive measures to keep these pests at bay.</p>
<h4 id="understanding-bed-bugs">Understanding Bed Bugs</h4>
<p>Bed bugs are small, reddish-brown insects that feed on the blood of humans and animals. They are nocturnal and often hide in cracks and crevices during the day, making them difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Signs of an infestation include itchy bite marks on the skin, small blood stains on sheets, and dark fecal spots on bedding and furniture.</p>
<h4 id="professional-pest-control-services">Professional Pest Control Services</h4>
<p>Engaging a professional pest control service is often the most effective way to deal with a bed bug infestation. Heres how the process typically works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspection</strong>: Professionals conduct a thorough inspection to identify the extent of the infestation. They check common hiding spots such as mattresses, bed frames, furniture, and baseboards.</li>
<li><strong>Heat Treatments</strong>: This method involves raising the temperature of the infested area to around 120F (49C), which is lethal to bed bugs at all life stages. Heat treatments are highly effective and can often eliminate bed bugs in a single session.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Treatments</strong>: Pest control experts use EPA-approved insecticides designed specifically for bed bugs. These chemicals are applied to affected areas, targeting bed bugs in their hiding spots. Multiple treatments may be required to ensure complete eradication.</li>
<li><strong>Steam Treatments</strong>:<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/">High-temperature steam</a>is used to kill bed bugs on contact. This method is particularly useful for treating mattresses, furniture, and other areas where chemicals cannot be applied.</li>
<li><strong>Encasements</strong>: Special bedbug-proof covers are used for mattresses and box springs. These encasements trap any remaining bed bugs, preventing them from feeding and eventually killing them.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="diy-bed-bug-treatment-methods">DIY Bed Bug Treatment Methods</h4>
<p>While professional services are often the most effective, there are several DIY methods that can help manage and reduce bed bug populations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vacuuming</strong>: Regular vacuuming of infested areas, including mattresses, carpets, and furniture, can help reduce the number of bed bugs. Be sure to dispose of the vacuum bag in a sealed plastic bag immediately after use.</li>
<li><strong>Washing and Drying</strong>: Washing infested clothing and bedding in hot water (at least 120F or 49C) and drying them on high heat can kill bed bugs. This method is effective for linens and clothing but may not address all areas of an infestation.</li>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: This natural, non-toxic powder can be spread in infested areas. It works by<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">dehydrating and killing</a><a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs that come into contact with it. However, it may take several days to weeks to see results.</li>
<li><strong>Bed Bug Sprays</strong>: Over-the-counter bed bug sprays can be used to treat visible bed bugs. However, these sprays may not be effective against hidden bed bugs or eggs, and their efficacy varies.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="preventive-measures">Preventive Measures</h4>
<p>Preventing a bed bug infestation is always preferable to dealing with an existing one. Here are some steps to help keep bed bugs out of your home:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decluttering</strong>: Reducing clutter eliminates potential hiding spots for bed bugs. Keep belongings organized and off the floor.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Inspections</strong>: Regularly check for signs of bed bugs, especially after travel. Inspect luggage, clothing, and bedding for any signs of bed bugs before bringing them into your home.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Cracks and Crevices</strong>: Seal gaps in walls, baseboards, and furniture to eliminate potential hiding spots. Use caulk to seal any cracks where bed bugs might hide.</li>
<li><strong>Careful Travel Practices</strong>: When traveling, inspect hotel rooms for signs of bed bugs and keep luggage elevated and away from beds. Upon returning home, wash and dry travel clothes on high heat.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="why-choose-professional-services">Why Choose Professional Services?</h4>
<p>While DIY methods can be helpful, professional pest control services offer several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expert Knowledge</strong>: Professionals have extensive knowledge of bed bug behavior and treatment methods, ensuring thorough and effective treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Solutions</strong>: Professional treatments often combine multiple methods (heat, chemicals, steam) for maximum effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Prevention</strong>: Professionals can provide ongoing monitoring and prevention advice to ensure bed bugs do not return.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are a persistent and troublesome pest, but with the right treatment methods and preventive measures, you can effectively eliminate them from your home or business in Tacoma.</p>
<p>Whether you choose professional pest control services or DIY methods, its important to act quickly at the first sign of an infestation to prevent it from spreading. By staying vigilant and proactive, you can keep your living spaces bed bug-free.</p>

On amount, bed bugs consume a meal about six times their body weight while sleeping, which happens within a quarter of an hour.
However, adults may live for even five months without taking a blood meal. After taking their blood meal, the female bed bugs will escape into the cracks and walls to lay eggs.
Further, their nymphs or baby bed bugs can also survive for a long time without eating. With the appropriate humidity and temperature, the bed bugs will live in this condition even for weeks.
Bed bugs will mainly take their meals every 3-7 days,
considering their conditions
and age. Therefore, most of the bed bugs will be digesting their meals - and hence treatment leads to dormancy.

Bedbugs are described as a public health pest by the USDA, CDC, and EPA. They will irritate humans, cause itching and suck blood they spread and transmit diseases.
So, I advise that you adopt appropriate control and prevention of the bed bugs since these pests can trigger more public health problems.
The increase in bed bugs is due to poor bug control techniques, resistance to pesticides, having limited information on pest prevention, and increased travel.
Controlling bed bugs requires combining chemical and non-chemical strategies.

<h2 id="roaches-versus-bed-bugs-differences">Roaches versus Bed Bugs; Differences</h2>
<p>Roaches and bed bugs have some similarities, particularly when they are younger.
However, the pests have differences that may assist you in identifying either of them.</p>
<h3 id="1-bites">1. Bites</h3>
<p>Cockroaches and bed bugs can bite humans. But
bed bugs
will prove highly aggressive in their biting compared to the roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bug bites will leave red and itchy skin marks
Bed bugs will bite humans and suck blood for their survival. The pest will bite you and attack itself on your skin feeding on blood until they get filled.
On the other hand, cockroaches will bite humans but rarely (they dont suck blood) but they will eat feces, food leftovers, and trash.</li>
<li>When cockroaches get enough food around their spaces, they wont bite people. However, when there are limited food sources for cockroaches, the bugs will bite human beings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-running-or-fighting">2. Running or Fighting?</h3>
<p>Cockroaches and bed bugs generally avoid going near humans during the day (during activity) and thus they will run from people.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the day, bed bugs and cockroaches will avoid human contact and hide<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/">under carpets</a>, and cracks.
An attempt to attack either cockroaches or bed bugs will cause these pests to run and hide.
Unlike cockroaches, bed bugs have no adaptation to enable them to fight humans. For example, they lack jaws while their stings are adapted only for sucking blood.</li>
<li>Therefore, bed bugs cant use their stings to attack or fight off human beings - and so theyre runners.
On the other hand, cockroaches can attack humans using their jaws. However, due to the small size of the bug and its jaws, roaches wont cause major injury to humans.
However, a direct confrontation between coaches and humans will have the pest running into some hiding places such as cracks - and so theyre also generally runners and not fighters.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-do-roaches-or-bed-bug-fly">3. Do roaches or Bed Bug Fly?</h3>
<p>On flying, both bed bugs and roaches have wings. These wings, however, are used differently in these pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, bed bugs are crawlers and thus they wont fly. Bed bugs will hide in mattresses (<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">but you can use mattress covers</a>) and so these pests will not require to fly to get to their host - the humans being sleeping on the bed.
Further, bed bugs will largely hide in indoor spaces (the home) and thus they dont need to fly long distances or move outdoors.
However, cockroaches are able to glide through the air and may even fly.</li>
<li>This might come as a surprise to most homeowners.</li>
<li>The cockroaches have a hard body that tends to hide their wings.
During flying the cockroach will open its hard outer shell and spread its wings.
However, most of the time the cockroaches will be crawling as opposed to flying even when moving into hiding spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-nocturnal-or-day-runners---roaches-vs-cockroaches">4. Nocturnal or Day Runners - Roaches vs Cockroaches</h3>
<p>Cockroaches and bedbugs are described as nocturnal and so you will mainly see them in the daytime.
Bed bugs for example tend to feed while humans are in bed (sucking their blood) and this is mainly at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the daytime, bed bugs will be digesting the blood meal taken the previous night, hiding in various locations, and laying eggs.
Bed bugs will run into hiding if humans attempt to irritate or harm them over the daytime.
Cockroaches on the other hand are also known to be nocturnal.</li>
<li>They will be rummaging around for food sources during the night as you are sleeping.
It is highly likely that you will see more cockroaches around the house during the day as opposed to the number of bed bugs you can see.</li>
<li>Cockroaches are very fast and nimble and so they will avoid getting harmed by running away.
However, cockroaches will remain in their hiding places during the day unless there is an urgent need to move around the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-do-roaches-or-bed-bugs-spread-diseases">5. Do Roaches or Bed Bugs Spread Diseases?</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that bed bugs will survive by sucking human blood, no scientific proof shows that they do really spread diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-bed-bug-bites-last/">bed bug&rsquo;s saliva</a>may trigger itching in humans and this may result in intense scratching around the bite area.</li>
<li>Such scratches on the human skin could result in infections.
Notably, most bed bugs will suck blood on an individual or the few people sleeping on the same bed.</li>
<li>So, it is less likely that the bed bugs will transmit any infections to other people that are not sleeping in the same bed.
However, due to how cockroaches feed and live, it is more likely that they carry infections and diseases.</li>
<li>For example, cockroaches will feed and leave around the sewer and trash bins where there are food sources, and areas that are dark and damp.
So, because of visiting and living in such areas, cockroaches can spread diseases such as cholera fever, typhoid dysentery, and diarrhea.
Besides, cockroaches can trigger allergies and asthma as they move around the dirty boots and pick different germs and allergens.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5OJ0hdsfc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5OJ0hdsfc</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary on cockroaches vs bed bugs, I would recommend getting a professional exterminator to help in the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, I know that baby roaches and bed bugs may have a similar appearance.
Other pests that look like baby roaches or bed bugs include fleas, spider beetles, carpet beetles, beetles, booklice, and bat bugs.
The signs of bed bug infestations will include reddish or rusty blood stains on mattresses and sheets.
Cheers!</li>

<li>
<p>Luckily,Bedlam Plus has no restrictions like other bed bug sprays, and thus you can apply it at any location you&rsquo;d apply to other liquids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But exclude pets and kids from the places where you&rsquo;ve applied the Bedlam Plus until the aerosol has fully dried.

The active ingredients are n-octyl dicarboximide (bicycloheptene) in addition to sumithrin, which is a great chemical to allow you to kill the bed bugs readily.
Luckily, the new formula in this Bedlam Plus has imidacloprid, enhancing a faster knockdown
effect even for different bed bug
strains.
While spraying your sofas, you&rsquo;ll need to give special attention to corner cracks, folds, and seams since that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll mainly find
bed bugs, larvae, and their eggs
while still reducing their hatching rate. But, cover up your aquariums to protect your reptiles and fish.

eggs of the bed bugs

<h2 id="how-to-use-bed-bug-powders">How to Use Bed Bug powders</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWiu07UDH50">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWiu07UDH50</a>
There is a wide range of powders that you can use to protect your
home from being bed
bug-infested�effectively.
To use the powders in the right way, you need to start by clearing the clutter and other mess in your bedroom and other parts of the house.
Apply your favorite powder in the holes, crevices, under the carpet, and in stuffed toys. These are the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-bed-bugs/">areas that the bed bugs use to hide</a>
and reproduce.
The powders should be applied in small amounts. However, you must ensure that you target the right areas since without that, the bed bugs will keep reproducing, and your house will not be safe.
Regardless of the powder that you use, you are supposed to clean your house of the residue that might have been left behind after the powder&rsquo;s application.
Note that some powders work faster compared to the rest. After applying the powder, you should give it at least 48 hours to
kill all the adult bed bugs
.
A good powder will also target the eggs (including
baby bed bugs
) and destroy them all.</p>
<h2 id="is-bed-bug-power-safe-for-humans">Is Bed Bug Power Safe For Humans?</h2>
<p>Diatomaceous earth
is the primary ingredient used by the powders mentioned above. It is mainly natural and does not have any effect on human health.</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">fact that it kills bed bugs</a>and prevents them from moving freely in your home makes it an ideal option.</li>
<li>It is essential to note that diatomaceous alone is not perfect forkilling and controlling bed bugsfrom infesting your home.
Though it kills and ensures that they dont move in your house, diatomaceous works best alongside heat treatment.
It is essential to heat-treat your items all the time and before using diatomaceous to complement the process.</li>
<li>Though the powders might not significantly affect humans, it is essential to treat and air your house after using them.</li>
<li>This makes sense since some companies use additives that might be poisonous.
Therefore, when your kids and pets get into contact with them, they might have allergic reactions that might be hard to deal with. Use as per the manufacturer&rsquo;s direction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bug powders come in different qualities, prices, and efficacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on your budget and level of infestation, you can pick the right powder to use.
From this list, you can easily choose to go shopping when you already know what to look for.</li>

Maybe you need a highly portable spray for the small
bed bug infestation

<li>Bedlam Plus is a great contact spray (and equally a residual formula) that&rsquo;ll kill even the bed bugs that are pyrethroid-resistant and thebaby bed bugs.</li>
<li>Bedlam Plus is formulated to be a residual spray combining three key ingredients (1) 3-phenoxybenzyl, (2) Imidacloprid, and (3) 2-dimethyl-3 - this is pyrethroid plus synergized neonicotinoid.
But you can also spray on your clothing.
The aerosol has a quick knockdown effect and great residual control that&rsquo;ll
kill bed bugs
even two weeks after spraying. It has a sweet but very mild smell that won&rsquo;t be too irritating.
Bedlam Plus will show ovicidal features in addition to functioning like an adulticide. The formula will quickly
kill adult bed bugs and their eggs
only on contact.
Scientific findings show that 40 percent of the bed bugs treated using Bedlam Plus treated will die.
Luckily,
Bedlam Plus is a more natural and safe pesticide composed of pyrethroids and pyrethrum. Spray on a bed frame, clothes, carpets, box spring, mattresses (and
mattress encasements
), headboard, carpet, and furniture.
The straw applicator will hit the deepest of spaces, cracks, and crevices.
The Bedlam Plus formula allows you to control several pesticides or insects, including lice, fleas, carpet beetles, clothes moths, dust mites, and ticks.
It&rsquo;s also non-staining on your water-safe fabrics. But, first, test a smaller area of the fabric to avoid creating a stained mess. However, check the

Cimexa
CXID032 is an odorless and luckily non-staining bed bug dust (particularly silica-based) that you&rsquo;ll love in your
pest control
processes. Puff the dust on carpets and mattresses.
An interesting fact to note is that silica dust has a higher efficacy in killing bed bugs compared even to diatomaceous earth. Silica will soak the
bed bug&rsquo;s
wax and thus enhance speedier desiccation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cimexadust is finely ground dust that sticks on a bed bug&rsquo;s body (via electrostatic attraction) and breaks its exoskeleton (cuticle) to dehydrate the bug to its death. Keep off kids and pets.
The�silica dust, which you&rsquo;ll puff onto the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-bed-bugs/">bug&rsquo;s hiding areas, will dry on the bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton</a>
and thus dehydrate it to cause its death. It comes with a�puffer and applicator.
You may use a�paintbrush to spread the dust thinly onto crevices and�baseboards that the bed bugs will be hiding or moving around. Luckily, silica isn&rsquo;t toxic to human beings but wear a mask.
The Good:</li>
<li>Viable for about ten years if left undisturbed.</li>
<li>Silica-based hence kills by dehydrating the bed bugs.</li>
<li>Natural bug killer</li>
<li>Faster bed bug extermination than even Diatomaceous Earth
The Bad:</li>
<li>Use a mask</li>

FenvaStar EcoCap
from Rockwell Labs is designed from a synthetic pyrethroid (3.5% Esfenvalerate) and vegetable-based oils to kill a range of household pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pyrethroid has a long residue effect to kill bed bugs and other insects such as silverfish, turf pests, cockroaches, spiders,fire ants, and fleas.
FenvaStar EcoCap employs &ldquo;microencapsulation&rdquo; and will easily give the deadly dose to poison the bed bugs. But it lacks the quick knock-down effect that&rsquo;s present in other sprays.
To reach the wall cracks and floor crevices, you&rsquo;ll require a pump sprayer. FenvaStar EcoCap is also reusable and cheap, making it an excellent option for most homeowners who need to treat the bugs but on a budget.
FenvaStar EcoCap will be great for indoor bed bug extermination, partially for food cabinets, underneath appliances, and under carpets.
You can apply in outdoor spaces, including on ornamental plants, turf, structural, and livestock houses. However, dont spray more than once in 2 weeks as it could lead to poisoning.
You&rsquo;ll require�1 to 2 ounces of the�FenvaStar EcoCap per gallon of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">water to spray against the bed bugs</a>
. For every square foot to be treated for bed bugs, you&rsquo;ll require to apply a spray burst of about� 2 seconds.

<li>Budget-friendly</li>
<li>Has a long residue effect
The Bad:</li>
<li>No quick knock-down effect</li>

<li>The active ingredient in�Proof 100% Effective is<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/neemgen.html">Cold-Pressed Neem Oil (5.5%)</a>- fromneem tree seeds,which will repel the bed bugs but wont be great in disrupting the bugs lifecycle.

<h2 id="bugs-that-look-like-bed-bugs"><strong>Bugs That Look Like Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-bat-bugs">1. Bat bugs</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Dark brown or beige
<strong>Description:</strong>
Among other bugs, bat bugs have the greatest resemblance to bed bugs. Perhaps only an expert can differentiate between the two using a microscope.</p>
<p>You cant tell the difference by looking at their color or shape. One of the most notable difference is their hair on the thorax. Bat bugs have longer hair than bed bugs.</p>
<p>While bed bugs feed on human blood, bat bugs feed on bat blood. However, in the absence of bats, bat bugs will feed on blood from other hosts including humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**3-5mm or  in</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do bat bugs have wings?**The wings on bat bugs are non-functional.</li>
<li>**Do bat bugs bite?**Their bite is just as irritating as a bed bug bite.
<strong>Where are bat bugs found?</strong>
The name bat bug does not mean that they nest on the backs of bats. It rather depicts their adaptation to live in areas nested by bats as they feed on their blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from caves, bats can live in many other places. So its possible to find bat bugs just anywhere including our houses.</p>
<h3 id="2-spider-beetles">2. Spider Beetles</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Their color ranges from yellow to brown to near black.
<strong>Description:</strong>
Spider beetles have a common resemblance to spiders owing to their small oval body and long legs.</p>
<p>But they are also easily mistaken for bed bugs because most of them are reddish brown in color.</p>
<p>They are however smaller than bed bugs and have wings that are covered with hairs. Unlike bed bugs, spider beetles have two body segments (head connects to the body without a neck).</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**1/32 in-3/16 in or 1-5mm</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do Spider Beetles have wings?**They have wings but only a few species can fly</li>
<li>**Do Spider Beetles bite?**They dont bite
<strong>Where are Spider Beetles found?</strong>
They inhabit wooden structures
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)-live-in-carpet/">and carpets</a>
where they can easily access stored food.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-cockroach-nymphs">3. Cockroach Nymphs</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Reddish-brown
<strong>Description:</strong>
Cockroach nymphs bear a lot of similarity to adult <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs, especially in their size and color. When lodged in their favourite narrow cracks, youll easily confuse them for bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**2 in long</li>
<li>**Shape:**Cylindrical</li>
<li>**Do Cockroach Nymphs have wings?**Cockroach nymphs have no wings</li>
<li>**Do Cockroach Nymphs bite?**They dont bite
<strong>Where are Cockroach Nymphs found?</strong>
Unlike bed bugs, roach nymphs like hiding in the kitchen and other places where there is food and debris.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-carpet-beetles">4. Carpet beetles</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Dark brown or black with white marks and red or orange scales.
<strong>Description:</strong>
They dont bear any resemblance to bed bugs but may give you some panic when they crawl on your carpet or clothes. They like feeding on fibrous material like cotton wool, silk, fur, feather etc.</p>
<p>They can be distinguished from bed bugs by their hard skeleton and antennae.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**Adults are 1/16-1/8-inch or 2.0-3.8mm.</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do Carpet beetles have wings?**Adult carpet beetles have wings which they use to fly during the day.</li>

They usually inhabit fabrics, especially carpets. Sometimes they can be confused with clothes moths</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-swallow-bugs">5. Swallow Bugs</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Reddish-brown
<strong>Description:</strong>
They belong to the family Cimicidae, just like bed bugs. Physically, they resemble the bed bugs in their shape, size and color.</p>
<p>Notable differences between the two include the long antennae segment and the long hair on the body of swallow bugs. These can only be seen under a microscope.</p>
<p>Another distinction is perhaps their feeding habits. While bed bugs feed on human blood, swallow bugs feed on the blood of birds, specifically swallows.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**3/16 in</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do Swallow Bugs have wings?**They dont have wings.</li>
<li>**Do Swallow Bugs bite?**They bite humans when swallows abandon their nests during the breeding seasons.
<strong>Where are Swallow Bugs found?</strong>
Typically, swallows bugs live in nests inhabited by swallow so as to feed on their blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, swallows abandon their nests when they become heavily infested with swallow bugs.</p>
<p>Swallow bugs can survive in the nests for up to one year without blood, especially when swallows are breeding.</p>
<h3 id="6-fleas">6. Fleas</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Reddish-brown.
<strong>Description:</strong>
Fleas are smaller than bed bugs with a bilaterally flattened body (body is taller than is flat).</p>

<p>While bed bugs crawl around, fleas jump from one place to another.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**1/16 in-1/8 in or 1.5-3.3 mm</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oval</li>
<li>**Do fleas have wings?**No. But they can jump from one place to another.</li>

<strong>Where are fleas found?</strong>
Typically, fleas inhabit the bodies of warm-blooded animals especially those that are hairy or furry. Cats and dogs are their favourite host.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-book-lice">7. Book Lice</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Their color ranges from pale brown to cream yellow and sometimes appear to be translucent.
<strong>Description:</strong>
Book lice bear a lot of similarity with bed bug nymphs. While both are light colored, bed bug nymphs will turn to reddish-brown when they feed.</p>
<p>The body of book lice appears to be more elongated than that of bed bug nymphs.</p>
<p>Book lice are not actually related to the lice that feeds on us. They however look alike in terms of shape and size.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**1/32 in -1/4 in or 1-6mm</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oblong</li>

They usually inhabit dumb places where they feed on the growing mold and fungi. They are also commonly found on potted plants, wallpapers and furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-headlice">8. Headlice</h3>
<p><strong>Colour:</strong>
Color ranges from white to grey. Color changes to slightly brown after feeding.
<strong>Description:</strong>
Headlice are wingless insects and smaller than bed bugs. While both bed bugs and headlice feed on human blood, it possible to differentiate the two by their feeding habits.</p>
<p>Headlice stay on their host most the times and feeds regularly. However, bed bugs stay away from the host and only come to feed from time to time.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size:**1/16 in-1/8 in or 2.53 mm long</li>
<li>**Shape:**Oblong</li>
<li>**Do headlice have wings?**They have no wings but have legs for crawling from one hair to another or from one host to another.</li>
<li>**Do headlice bite?**A head louse will bite and suck blood at all stages of life cycle except eggs.
<strong>Where are head-lice found?</strong>
Head-lice live on human scalp where they survive entirely on blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike bed bugs, head-lice stay on the host until they are removed by trimming the hair, scratching, washing the hair or by transferring to another host.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bugs resemble a host of other common bugs in the house. So, it can be extremely hard to eradicate bed bugs if you dont correctly differentiate them from other common bugs.</p>
<p>This guide gives you relevant tips for identifying bed bugs so that you dont go dealing with the wrong bug. Its pointless to embark on eradication methods only to realize that youre not dealing with bed bugs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Wear long-sleeved clothes, and youll be safe from bed bug bites (Cimex lectularius Linnaeus).&rdquo; Maybe, maybe not. But bed bug bites are painful and will cause anemia. So, you&rsquo;re wondering, can bed bugs bite through clothing?
<em>The short answer is, NO, bed bugs lack teeth to gnaw through clothing or fabric. The bugs only have a sharp�and long proboscis allowing them to access your blood vessels.�</em>
<em>The bed bug&rsquo;s feeding response is triggered when they land on bare skin. So, any bites that you notice under your clothes may have been caused by other bugs like scabies mites or mosquitoes.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-clothing-pajamas-socks-fabric">Can Bed Bugs Bite through Clothing? Pajamas, Socks, Fabric?</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, bed bugs won&rsquo;t bite through pajamas, just like in other clothes and fabrics. Bed bugs lack teeth to help them gnaw pajamas, plastic, or different material.
Notably, bed bugs have a sharp and long proboscis that they&rsquo;ll use to suck blood from your blood vessels on the human skin. In fact, the
bed bug&rsquo;s proboscis/)
is almost double its body size.
However, the bed bug&rsquo;s feeding mechanism is only triggered when the skin lands on the human skin. Thus, the bugs can&rsquo;t poke the proboscis through fabrics, pajamas, and clothes to reach your bare skin.
Researchers report that bed bugs only suck blood using a skin-type membrane, and hence clothes or fabrics and pajamas won&rsquo;t trigger these feeding actions. Therefore, if you have pajamas on, bed bugs won&rsquo;t bit through them.
So, any bed bugs bites you find after a night&rsquo;s sleep, despite having worn your pajamas, must have been because the fabrics had rolled up to leave your skin bare for the bed bugs to feed.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-leggings-or-socks">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Leggings or Socks?</h2>
<p>Luckily, most leggings and socks are too tight for bed bugs to bite underneath them - and the bugs won&rsquo;t definitely bite through them.
Most leggings have nylon and elastic materials that&rsquo;ll tightly hug your legs and hence prevent
bed bug bites
.�Therefore, any bed bugs bite you&rsquo;ll notice on your legs will only occur at any bare skin that the bugs will find.
So, when you&rsquo;re wearing leggings for protection, also ensure you control bed bugs in other ways like sprays or steaming

.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-tights">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Tights?</h2>
<p>Many people, especially women, love putting on tights when going to sleep. I note that socks are an excellent solution to
averting any bed bug infestation
.
This is because tights will form a tight bond with your body - therefore, the bugs won&rsquo;t crawl under the fabric. Therefore, bed bugs won&rsquo;t bite the whole part of your lower body when you&rsquo;re wearing tights.
However, do not consider wearing tight as the sole and reliable way of preventing bed bugs from biting your skin. Sadly, the bed bugs will turn to any tiny bit of your bare skin that&rsquo;s available and launch bloodsucking attacks on you.
Therefore, you&rsquo;d better control the bed bugs using
sprays
,
traps,
or
<strong>tea tree oil</strong>
instead of just wearing tights as the only protection. - these are also odorless, non-staining, and most are
safe for humans and pets
.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-blankets">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Blankets?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs won&rsquo;t also bite
through blankets and comforters as you&rsquo;re sleeping or merely covering yourself. However, just like with other clothes and fabrics, bed bugs will readily bite your skin when they claw under the blankets.
Bed bugs have a tiny
and flattened body that allows them to hide in blankets, clothing, crevices, comforters easily. The warm and dark conditions in these materials will easily attract bed bugs.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-vinyl">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Vinyl?</h2>
<p>Thus, after
undertaking bed bug
treatment, you&rsquo;ll need to place the blankets in new plastic bags. Also, ensure that the bags have no holes. However, don&rsquo;t use
spray insecticides
with the blankets to leave a foul odor and stains.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-bite-through-sheets">Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Sheets?</h2>
<p>The bugs won&rsquo;t care whether you have comforters or bedsheets; they&rsquo;ll crawl under to get to your bare skin. So, don&rsquo;t think that bed bugs did bite through the blankets and sheet - they claw to bite any exposed skin on your body.
You can easily control the bed bugs in the blankets and comforters using high heat and a dryer. Luckily, the high temperatures will
kill bed bug adults, nymphs, and eggs
.</p>
<h2 id="bed-bugs-crawl-underneath-your-clothing-to-bite">Bed Bugs Crawl underneath Your Clothing to Bite</h2>
<p>Most people recommend we put on lengthy clothes to cover even the legs and arms  to reduce the amount of exposed skin. Well, the neck and face are a favorite feeding spot for bed bugs and
their babies
.
Bed bugs wont bite through your clothes but will
crawl under your fabric or clothes
and bite the skin. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and shorts wont deter bed bugs from biting you or your family members.
Also, bites from bed bugs may not appear or hurt immediately after the bug suck blood from you. Thus, the bite you might see under your clothes may have been
caused by another bed bug hours earlier
but now when your skin was bare.</p>
<h2 id="how-bed-bugs-hitchhike-your-clothes">How Bed Bugs Hitchhike your Clothes</h2>
<p>First,
bed bugs cant jump or fly
. Thus, its unlikely that the block suckers will jump from one human being to your fabric or clothing. But its possible to find the
bugs hanging around the clothes
on the bed, laundry, or room floor.
The
bugs will mainly hide
on piles of clothes, cracks, and crevices, including bed sheet crevices and headboards. So, dont leave clothes on the bed, old or send-hand furniture, or floor of a room thats bed bug-infested.
So, besides hiding in second-hand furniture or mattresses, bed bugs will also hide in your bed and bedding. Notably, steam, dryer, and
hot water will help kill the bed bugs
.
Dealing with
<a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/bed-bug/videos.php">bed bugs is a menace</a>
in our houses. They like to hide under clothes and mattresses but can bed bugs bite through clothes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The truth is bedbugs cannot bite through clothes. They have to find their way through the skin before they can bite. A lot of people think that they can bite through clothes but they dont. They only penetrate through the open spaces of the pajamas, blankets, socks, sheets, and other fabrics.</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Repellent&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]

<h2 id="details-can-bed-bugs-bite-through-clothes">Details: Can Bed Bugs Bite Through Clothes?</h2>
<p>If you have a bed bug infestation in your house, dont be surprised if you wake up and find yourself with bugs bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not because the bugs will bite through the clothes but because they have an easy way to get under the garments and bite.
Though these clothes help, some still cant protect you from the bites while others can.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-will-bed-bugs-bite-via-your-pajamas"><strong>1. Will Bed Bugs Bite via Your Pajamas?</strong></h3>
<p>Even if bed bugs cannot bite through fabrics, it is important to note that they can still make their way underneath the pajamas into the skin.
Bedbugs have mouths that are not structured to bite or cut through clothes but instead bite through soft skin. They also have a proboscis that easily penetrates into the skin and sucks blood which they depend on for survival.
The only way bed bugs will bite you even with your pajamas is when you sleep and leave parts of your skin exposed. They enter through the open spaces in the hand and legs and get to the skin before biting.</p>
<h3 id="2-will-bed-bugs-bite-via-skin-tights"><strong>2. Will bed bugs bite via Skin tights?</strong></h3>
<p>Just like others fabrics, bed bugs cant bite through skin tights. However, skin tights are very helpful because they keep the body well-covered making it hard for the bugs to get to the skin and bite.
Though the bugs may also try another way of getting to your skin by climbing to where the clothes are loose and easy to allow them to penetrate underneath.
Therefore, instead of pajamas, skin tights offer much better protection.</p>
<h3 id="3-can-bed-bugs-bite-via-socks"><strong>3. Can Bed bugs bite via Socks?</strong></h3>
<p>If you get bites underneath the socks, its probably not bed bugs because they cant bite through socks. Whether the socks are cotton or elastic types, bed bugs will not be able to bite through them.</p>
<ul>
<li>May bed bugs will probably move around the socks borderline where they get into contact with the skin and bite.
However, there are socks that are loose or woven with large spaces, they can easily let the bed bugs underneath and into the skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-can-bed-bugs-bite-via-blankets"><strong>4. Can Bed Bugs Bite via Blankets?</strong></h3>
<p>Blankets dont offer much protection from bed bug bites. If you are relying on it to protect yourself, you will be disappointed.
Unlike skin tights and other clothing, blankets wont protect you from bites. Bed bugs are able to penetrate underneath the blankets and bite your exposed skin.
What if you tightly wrap the blanket around you? Well, chances are at night as you sleep you will untangle yourself and give room to the bugs to crouch in and start biting.
But if you are infested with bed bugs, dont go for the blankets instead use pest control products to eliminate them and have a bug-free house.</p>
<h3 id="6-can-bed-bugs-bite-via-sheets"><strong>6. Can Bed Bugs Bite via Sheets?</strong></h3>
<p>Just the same way, bed bugs cant bite through other clothing, they also wont bite through sheets. Like blankets, they will make their way underneath it before they can attack you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs are clever and will most likely hide beneath the blankets and sheets waiting for the right opportunity. In this case, they will also like to hide underneath the blankets.
Therefore, though bed bugs cant bite through clothing, some clothing still makes it easy for the bugs to get through and bite.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-stop-bed-bugs-f-biting-through-the-clothing">How to Stop Bed Bugs f Biting Through the Clothing</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are very nagging parasites. They attack when we least expect and can survive for a long period without a blood meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>They will hide under the mattress and other areas and wait for the opportunity to get to the skin and bite.
Even though they can hardly bite through clothing, some home remedies will be good to keep off the bed bugs off.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-using-mattress-covers-">**1. Using Mattress Covers **</h3>
<p>For those bed bugs that hide under the mattress, it is so easy to keep them off by using mattress covers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it is hard for the bugs to penetrate and bite through clothing, this will keep them off from finding their way to come and bite you.
This method is not 100 percent effective because it does not eliminate the bugs and those that are not enclosed under the cover will still come and attack you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-using-bug-traps"><strong>2. Using bug traps</strong></h3>
<p>There are tarps that are
designed to trap bed bugs
. They are available at the retailer&rsquo;s store and other outlets.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the traps, you can place them around the bed as you sleep to enjoy a peaceful night. These traps have either a slippery or a sticky surface that traps the bugs. These traps use heat and carbon dioxide to attract the bugs.
If you can have access to these traps, you can improvise a homemade trap by using water to create a slippery surface for the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-contacting-an-expert"><strong>3. Contacting an Expert</strong></h3>
<p>If the infestation is too much, contacting a pest control expert is a good option. This is because of their experience in bed bugs management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those using traps and covers works only to prevent the bites but will not stop the bugs infestation.
Most pest control experts know how to handle and also eliminate both adult bugs and eggs and have a bedbug-free house.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p>Can bed bugs bite through clothes? The answer is no. Their mouths are not adapted to that but are made of proboscis, which bites and sucks blood from the host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs find their way underneath the clothes into the skin, where can bite and have their blood meal. Some clothes like skin tights can prevent the bed bugs from reaching the skin while others like blankets and sheets can hardly do that.
To minimize the risk of bed bug bites through clothes, you can employ home-based solutions as listed or invite a
pest control expert
to help you.</li>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-bed-bugs-bites">How to Prevent Bed Bugs Bites</h2>
<h3 id="1-bed-bug-mattress-encasement">1. Bed Bug Mattress Encasement</h3>
<p>Luckily,
bed bug mattress encasement
will readily cover your box spring or mattress and thus destroy one of the bug&rsquo;s breeding grounds. The bugs won&rsquo;t reach the mattress and can&rsquo;t hide from insecticides, steam, or heat treatment.
But who comes you&rsquo;re using encasement but still get bed bugs bites. Well, definitely, mattresses only hold a small percent of the blood-suckers. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to combine this method with other techniques to subdue it to the colony.

In addition to laundering the clothes, you&rsquo;ll need to disinfect them and their storage bags or suitcases to guarantee that the bed bugs won&rsquo;t find a haven in them. The bed bugs will find it challenging to hide in the

areas.</p>
<h3 id="1-sort-your-laundry">1. Sort Your Laundry</h3>
<p>First, sort the clothes to check which ones have
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-see-bed-bugs/">signs of bed bug infestation</a>
. You&rsquo;ll thus place the different piles in different plastic bags. Keenly follow the highest possible washing and drying temperatures.
Further, keep the wet-clean from the dry-clean clothes. However, some dry-clean fabrics can also be put in the dryer.
But ensure that you seal your plastic bags before you start moving the laundry - so the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-bed-bugs-spread/">bugs won&rsquo;t spread</a>
to the Laundromat or other house locations.</p>

<h3 id="3fold-and-disinfect-the-clothes">3.�Fold and Disinfect the Clothes</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll now need to fold your cleaned and dried clothes - only place the clothes inside a new plastic bag if you&rsquo;re doing your laundry in a laundry facility.
Further, don&rsquo;t use a folding table as you can get bed bugs in these locations. Ensure the clothes remain in the plastic bags until you arrive at your house.
Further, if your house is bed bug treated, you can now take out the plastic bags&rsquo; clothes.</p>
<h3 id="3-bed-bugs-love-dark-and-warm-corners">3. Bed Bugs Love Dark and Warm Corners</h3>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">Bed bugs prefer to hide</a>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can bed bugs climb metal or plastic? One of the worst bug infestations you can ever wish on your enemies is a bedbug invasion. These devious little creatures pack an irritable, itchy bite that will cut your night short.
If youve ever dealt with bedbugs before, you might be wondering how well they manage to navigate their way to all corners of our furniture. We previously noted that
bed bugs do not fly-fly/)
.
But, can
bed bugs
climb metal? Also, check our
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">list of ultimate drain cleaners</a>
as bed bugs can again come into your house through dirty drains.</p>
<h2 id="socan-bed-bugs-climb-metal-or-plastic">So,�Can bed bugs climb metal or plastic?</h2>
<p>Bedbugs are very agile creatures that
<a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/fs1251/">can climb any surface</a>
, so long as it has the right texture. Any surface that allows them some level of traction will be scaled with ease.
However, bedbugs will find it hard to climb polished surfaces of materials like metals, glass, or plastic, although this wont be a problem if the climbing surface has got a layer of dust.
Not to mention that bedbugs are very determined creatures that will go above and beyond the call of duty to find alternative routes to their ideal hiding spot. But do you know long
bed bug bites
last? If not, check this
guide
.
The notion you might have of bedbugs&rsquo; inability to climb metal is based on the fact that bedbugs generally prefer to harbor on wooden frames instead of metallic ones.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8lWbXMA9JM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8lWbXMA9JM</a></p>
<h2 id="how-to-handle-a-bedbug-infestation">How to Handle a Bedbug Infestation</h2>
<p>You will be shocked just how relentless bedbugs are to turn you into their dinner. The fact that they cant climb metal or plastic comfortably should not guarantee you a good night&rsquo;s sleep.
You must take additional measures to keep off their nasty and painful bites
by killing the bed bugs
or preventing multiplication.
If you are worried about a possible bedbug invasion in your home, you can begin by setting traps in suspect areas to confirm or dispel your fears.
You can do this by placing each leg of your bed and other furniture into a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">container filled with water</a>
. You may also add some
rubbing alcohol
into the water to kill the bugs.
The
water will temporarily keep the bugs
from getting to you when you sleep. Bedbugs will float on water for a short while but die within minutes of being submerged.
If you genuinely have an infestation, chances are youll come across a few dead bodies of culprits trying to swim after a day or so. You can also pour some
ammonia
around the metal or plastic pipes or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">spray the bugs</a>
to discourage the bed bugs from scaling them.
This should be enough incentive for you to call a professional pest control service if you want the scourge to be successfully decimated swiftly and permanently.

<h2 id="familiar-hiding-places-for-bedbugs">Familiar Hiding Places for Bedbugs</h2>
<p>Bedbugs are masters when it comes to the art of hiding. Naturally, these parasites will
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">hide in the corners of our beds</a>
and between the sheets and wait patiently for you to go and sleep. Alternatively, you can kill the bed bugs using steam from
bed bug steamers
.
Remember that they do not
live off the hosts&rsquo;
bodies, so they have to find spots with proximity to their food source, your bed.
But beds arent the only place you are likely to find bedbugs hiding; usually, they will look for any spaces that give them quick access to you when you sleep.
They can do this because they are excellent climbers and scale virtually any surface to find the ideal hang-out spot.
You will find bedbugs hiding in areas such as Lamps, Electrical outlets, Bed frames, Boxsprings, Curtains, Wardrobes and cabinets, Wall cracks and crevices, and Rugs and carpets.</p>

<p>It is very unlikely that you&rsquo;ll find bed bugs in human hair. Bed bugs lack claws - unlike ticks and claws that have claws to help them navigate via your hair.

<p>Bed bugs will feed on human blood by first piercing your skin using their tiny beak. The bite won&rsquo;t look serious but it will be skin-irritating.
The beak will inject some anesthetic liquid that&rsquo;ll leave your skin in a numb condition - this allows easy and non-irritating sucking of blood from the human body.
The bed bugs will suck blood from your body for roughly 2 to 5 minutes before crawling back to their hiding places. The bites will become itchy welts or small bumps on the scalp.
Equally notable is that some bloodstain may be left on the sheets or your pillow. For massive infestations, you may notice some offensive or musty odor.
On orientation, the bites from these bed bugs will be found on some straight rows. Your scalp will become raw and sore - but this won&rsquo;t make the hair fall off.</p>

. But, can <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs live in carpet?
**The simple answer is, YES, bed bugs can live in the carpet and other dark locations. This is particularly common in the gap between the carpet and baseboard and **
<strong>edges of the carpet behind your furniture.�</strong>
<strong>The carpet is a great spot for females to lay eggs.�</strong>
So, lets get started!</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet"><strong>Can Bed Bugs Live in Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bugs prefer hiding in locations where it is easy for them to bite on a host (here&rsquo;s how to
remove the bed bug bite scars
) and slip back into hiding without being noticed. So, apart from your bed, bed bugs will also hide in your carpet.</p>
<p>This is especially possible where your furniture presses against the wall leaving dark corners beneath. They also hide below the carpet and the spaces between the carpet and baseboard or the wall.</p>
<p>If you have an infestation, youre likely to see bed bugs at the edges of your carpet behind the sofa set, cupboard or bed. In case you dont see live bed bugs, their eggs or carcasses in these places are a clear evidence of their presence.</p>
<p>When bed bugs inhabit your carpet, they can create a very big challenge for pest eradication. Sometimes they get entangled in the fibres of the carpet and become extremely hard to locate.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bugs-are-very-swift"><strong>1. Bed Bugs Are Very Swift</strong></h3>
<p>Despite their inability to fly, bed bugs can move very fast from one room to another by crawling on the walls, floors and ceilings.</p>
<p>If you have some bed bugs in your bedroom or in an old sofa that you brought home, they will easily find their way into your carpets.</p>
<h3 id="2-carpets-have-dense-fibers">2. Carpets Have Dense fibers</h3>
<p>Some carpets have a dense network of fibres. This creates an ample hiding place for bed bugs and for female bed bugs to lay their eggs.</p>
<p>Thus, if a few bed bugs get into your carpet, they might soon develop into an infestation.</p>
<h3 id="3-bed-bugs-are-always-hunting-for-a-host"><strong>3. Bed Bugs Are Always Hunting For a Host</strong></h3>
<p>Bed bugs will not wait until you go to bed for them to have a blood meal - causing
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-make-you-sick/">anemia, itching and allergy from the bed bug bite</a>
. That means, they will follow you wherever you go.</p>
<p>As they traverse across the floor to look for a host, there are chances that many bed bugs will find their way in your carpet.</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-lay-eggs-in-carpet"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Lay Eggs in Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bugs will lay their eggs in the same places they inhabit. Since these pesky creatures hide and live in your carpet, you will also find their eggs here. However, you may not be able to see the eggs with your naked eyes since they are very small and translucent.</p>
<p>Again, bed bugs wont travel very far from their source of food. So, apart from your bed, bed bugs will find safe havens in your carpet where theyll hide and lay eggs. The eggs are usually coated with a sticky substance that makes them stick on any surface.</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-crawl-or-fly-across-a-carpet"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Crawl or Fly Across a Carpet?</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike insects, bed bugs wont fly or jump around the carpet. They can only crawl through the carpet to get to you. Although they might get slowed by thick carpets, they usually have a way of getting through.</p>
<p>When you sleep on the couch or stay too late in the living room, bed bugs will travel from their hideouts and across the carpet in order to feast on your blood.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-inspect-your-carpet-for-bed-bugs"><strong>How to Inspect Your Carpet for Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>Once bed bugs get into your house, they wont go looking for specific places to hide. They can live anywhere in the house as long they have access to their favourite meal.</p>
<p>So, if therere signs of bed bugs in your house, the best thing to do is to inspect all possible hideouts. Below is a guide for inspecting your carpet for bed bugs.
<strong>1. Inspect Space between Carpet and Baseboard or Wall</strong>
The mostly likely place where bed bugs will hide is the space between the carpet and the baseboard or wall. You can use a flashlight to look through the small gap. Even better, you can run your credit card through the space to ambush the bed bugs.</p>
<p>If therere bed bugs inside, youll see them coming out in haste scampering for safety. In addition, dead bed bugs and debris might also come out from these spaces.
<strong>2. Check Underneath the Carpet</strong>
To check whats underneath the carpet, lift one of the corners away for the floor and the baseboard. While holding the corner in place, look keenly for any bed bug movement, carcasses, feces, eggs or other debris.</p>
<p>If that corner of the house is dark, use a flashlight. Bed bugs may drift away into hiding, with the slightest flip of the carpet. However, if you see their carcasses or feces, you should be sure that bed bugs are living here.
<strong>3. Inspect the Debris in Vacuum Cleaner</strong>
You need a bagless vacuum cleaner for this exercise. Starting off with an empty canister, vacuum all your carpeted room thoroughly. Dump the debris outside and vacuum the house again especially along the edges of the carpet.</p>
<p>Now, the contents of the canister are little debris which can be easily differentiated. If therere indeed some bed bugs in your carpet, you will see them scampering for safety.
<strong>4. Inspect Carpet, Behind Sofa, Cabinets or Bed</strong>
The part of carpet that is tacked behind sofa sets, cabinets or beds is very dark, meaning it is a safe haven where bed bugs can hide and breed. To inspect this place, youll need some extra muscle to move things around.</p>
<p>If youve bed bugs in your carpet, then this part of the house could be harbouring a host of them. Some will be on the carpet and others on the furniture just close to the carpet.
<strong>Conclusion�</strong>
Bed bugs can get in your carpet and give you a hard time to eradicate. However, with the above remedies, you can easily get these pesky insects out of your carpet.</p>
<p>These include diatomaceous earth, borax powder, heat treatment, steam treatment and vacuuming.�I recommend using a combination of these remedies to eradicate bed bugs and prevent future infestation.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-bed-bugs-hide">Where Do Bed Bugs Hide?</h2>

      <description>No one wants to be confronted with a bed bug infestation and one of the burning questions - can bed bugs live outside?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one wants to be confronted with a bed bug infestation and one of the burning questions - can bed bugs live outside?
Will these tiny bed bugs survive outside/ in the lawn or yard - you may find
dead bed bugs/)
after you&rsquo;ve used <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bug steamers.
This is because if they can, many people become concerned that they could reenter a home after bed bugs have been eradicated and begin a new cycle.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-live-outside-where--how-long">Can Bed Bugs Live Outside? Where &amp; How Long?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs like to hide out in small dark spaces, and there are many opportunities for them to do so in the indoor environment, with tiny crevices and cracks in furnishings being ideal locations for these creatures.
Their name might suggest that they prefer to inhabit a bed, but this is misleading since they will happily set up home in any item within a house.</p>
<p>When looking for a place to stay, one of the main priorities is food, and bed bugs will live wherever food can be most easily accessed. In answer to the question of can bed bugs live outside, they can, but they prefer not to.
Bed bugs have become used to living in the indoor environment, and as we mentioned, they live where there is food. These minute pests feed off a host, in this case, a human, and so they will find homes where their host can be easily accessed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1QXtI2IhB4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1QXtI2IhB4</a>
Humans spend a lot of time within the home; it makes sense for the bed bugs to do the same. That being said, bed bugs can often be found in outdoor areas which are frequented often by their human hosts; this can include things such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>cars</li>
<li>outdoor furniture such as deck chairs and wooden tables</li>
<li>tents</li>
<li>sheds and other outdoor structures.</li>
<li>Wood piles
Bed bugs prefer to live in a warmer environment, and this is, of course, more simple when indoors. Being outside would not harm them, but they are not as keen on the outdoors&rsquo; cooler temperatures.</li>
<li>Some factors determine how long bed bugs can survive outside, and some of these are as follows.</li>
<li>Temperature extremes will have some effect on bed bugs, but they really do have to be extreme. These are pretty resilient little animals and are likely to survive hot and cold temperatures but will likely die off if the temperature drops well below freezing.</li>
<li>Of course, as with any insect, the bed bug has predators, and depending on the prevalence of these in your garden will depend on how long the bed bugs can last. Some of the most typical�bed bug predators include lizards, spiders, and ants.</li>
<li>If the bed bugs do not have access to food, they will eventually die out. That being said, these tough little pests can survive for months without food, but the females will be unable to produce<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-eggs/">eggs</a>if they are not fed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-get-back-inside-once-removed-from-the-house">Can Bed Bugs Get Back Inside once Removed from the House?</h2>
<p>Now that we have established that bed bugs can indeed live in an outdoor environment, we need to determine whether they can return after you have kicked them out of the home.
Bed bugs cannot fly or jump, like their distant cousins, the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/">fleas in the carpet</a>
, but they can still return into a house by way of attachment once they have been sent packing.
They do this by simply being on something that is returned inside; for example, if they live in a garden table, you then cover with a table cloth for a BBQ.
Once the BBQ is over, you return the table cloth into the home, and any bed bugs that have latched onto it will hitch a ride inside.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yChSIxn_9A8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yChSIxn_9A8</a>
It is essential that if you know there is a bed infestation outdoors or recently evicted some from within the home, you are extremely careful when bringing things back in from outside.
It is also worth noting that while they are tiny insects, they can travel around 20 meters in any one day and so can quickly march right back into the home should they wish to.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-get-rid-of-bed-bugs">How Can I Get Rid Of Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>If you are unfortunate enough to have some unwanted visitors in the form of bedbugs, there are some things that you can do to rid your home of these lodgers.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am using a professional heat treatment.</li>
<li>I am applying insecticide products to affected areas.</li>
<li>Vacuuming affected items thoroughly.</li>
<li>Use an oil-based varnish on wooden furniture.</li>
<li>Avoid having clutter inside or outside the home.</li>
<li>When bringing items inside the home, whether from your garden or anywhere else, thoroughly check them for the presence of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bugs can be a real nuisance, and once you have successfully eradicated them from your home, you are surely going to want to make sure that they do not return.
With this in mind, it is essential to understand that merely removing affected items outside is not enough to kill these pests because they can still thrive in an outdoor environment.
You can take measures to avoid their return, however, and most importantly, you should stay vigilant.</p>

<h2 id="details-can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water-scientist-results"><strong>Details: Can Bed Bugs Survive in Water? Scientist Results�</strong></h2>
<p>Whether bedbugs can survive in water depends on several factors. First, a recently fed bedbug tends to be heavy and takes the shape of a balloon. These two qualities make the bedbugs to sink when exposed to a pool of water.
When submerged in water, the
bed bug
cannot survive for long due to a lack of air.�On the other hand, an unfed bedbug appears flat, oval-shaped, and light in weight.
These factors result in adequate surface tension, making the
bed bug (check bed bug bully)
float on the water surface. While floating, the bedbugs have access to atmospheric air, which makes them survive.
However, you can drown the floating bedbugs by agitating the water with a washing machine or hand. Since bedbugs cannot survive for long in the water, they will easily die because of their inability to breathe - you&rsquo;ll see

.
Whether floating or submerged, bedbugs cannot survive more than 20 minutes in hot water at temperatures above 118F. Therefore, water above these temperatures is ideal for getting
rid of bedbugs from clothes
, curtains, and bedding items.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bug-eggs-survive-in-water"><strong>Can Bed Bug Eggs Survive in Water?</strong></h2>
<p>When you immerse bed bug-infested garments in cold water for 24 hours, all the adults and their nymphs will die while their eggs will remain intact.
This is according to a
<a href="http://insectsinthecity.blogspot.com/2010/03/guidelines-for-killing-bed-bugs-in.html">study</a>
conducted to investigate the effectiveness of washing your clothes to contain bed bug infestation.
However, it is possible to kill

. Freezing the
water to -17F will kill
the eggs in two hours.
Bed bug eggs
cannot also survive in hot water. Normally, adult
bed bugs
and nymphs die at between 104F and 122F. Eggs are more heat-resistant, and you will be required to heat water to 125F or more for them to die. Read Also:

? Without meaning to state the obvious, bed bugs are, above everything else, insects. So it goes without saying that they are fairly visible. Well, not necessarily.
<em>Summary: Most bed bugs resemble an apple seed in various aspects, from shape, size, and even color.�</em>
<em>This is why you shouldnt experience any difficulties spotting these blood-sucking little monsters with your naked eye.related Bed Bug Steamers.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bug Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-you-see-bed-bugs-signs-of-bed-bugs">Can You See Bed Bugs? Signs of Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>In terms of size, bed bugs grow to approximately 5 to 7 mm in length. Thats just about 3/16 to  of an inch. However, as you probably already guessed, their size varies depending on their age. Check these
bed bug pictures
.
Thats a no-brainer, really. More interestingly, the shape of bedbugs significantly changes depending on how full they are. Early in the morning, when they are just fresh from their feeding frenzy, bed bugs assume a balloon-like body.
In such times, their body is ordinarily reddish-brown and relatively elongated. This contrasts with the long, oval shape and brown
color of a bed bug
that has not eaten for some time.
In addition to these basic features, it is also important to remember that all bed bugs possess the characteristics of true bugs.
These include the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>3 pairs of legs.</li>
<li>Cone-like eyes.</li>
<li>A three-segmented beak.</li>
<li>A golden appearance characterizes short hair.</li>
<li>Part antennas.</li>
<li>Non-flying wings.
However, chances are you will never get close enough to view these features up-close.
For most people, a bed bug
is meant to be squeezed as soon as it is spotted.
That notwithstanding, catching bed bugs is an art in its own right. This is because they are asleep during the day and active during the night.
And even during their active hours, bed bugs will not readily come out to feed. Instead, they will wait until the coast is clear. Due to their high sensitivity to movement, bedbugs will usually prefer a still host.
If you are lucky enough to get up in the middle of the night, you will be able to spot them easily. This is the time when their bodies are swollen, and can barely run or hide.
In rare cases, you may spot bed bugs during the day. This especially happens when they are starving and happen to have detected the presence of blood nearby.
But make no mistake, bed bugs that regularly feed at night will rarely come out during the day, except when they really have to.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-tell-bed-bugs-from-other-bugs-and-insects">How to Tell Bed Bugs from Other Bugs and Insects</h2>
<p>Apart from the basic features discussed above, there are other ways to
tell a bed bug
from other insects. If you are lucky enough to come very close to them, you will never miss their signature scent that is usually described as dusty and sweet.
When looking at them from afar, bedbugs that have not eaten recently may often be confused for young cockroaches. However, that strong, musty smell will easily clear all doubts.
Another major distinguishing feature between bedbugs and other bugs is that they are relatively slow. And when exposed, they will often run towards dark areas to hide.

Unlike adult bed bugs, nymphs usually sport a translucent or white-yellowish color. Their size varies depending on their current
stage in the life cycle
. In the first stage, most bed bug nymphs are usually 1.5 mm in length.
They will then increase in length by 0.5 mm for each subsequent stage until they reach the fourth stage. At the fifth stage, bedbug nymphs measure up to 4.5 mm.
Bed bug eggs
may be the most difficult to see with naked eyes. These eggs are normally pearl-white and have an oval shape with a length of about 1/16 inches. As they continue to grow, you will notice an eyespot emerging from their heads.
But perhaps your main concern is not whether you can spot
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>
, but how to get rid of these eggs as soon as you have the slightest idea of their presence.
Remember that females will lay up to 250 eggs in the course of their lifetime, and once laid, eggs take just about a week to hatch. Now, if you do not take the right measures to control bedbugs, you could be looking at a colossal infestation.

<h2 id="how-do-i-know-i-have-bedbugs-in-my-house">How Do I Know I Have Bedbugs In My House?</h2>
<p>The following are some of the telltale signs that your house could be harboring bedbugs.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-bed-bug-bites-last/">Bed bug bites</a>. They are usually multiple bites spread over your face or other areas of your skin that remain exposed while you are asleep. The bites could also come with some burning or itching sensations.</li>
<li>Spots of dried blood on your mattress or pillow. These spots are normally dark-reddish-brown and are caused when you accidentally crash the bedbugs as you turn during sleep.</li>
<li>You may also want to look for evidence of exo-skeleton. They are usually pale-brown in color.
Remember.
The best way to
deal with bed bugs (kill)
is to ensure they do not get into your house in the first place. When they begin to breed, their number swells like a malignant tumor.
To make that happen, you need to invest in a powerful
bed bug
repellent. You may also consider getting a mattress cover that deters them from finding safe shelters within your mattress.
If living in a house with holes and crevices on the wall, be sure to have them sealed. Above all, check your luggage clearly to ensure you do not bring bedbugs to your house, especially when you are on a long vacation.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most folks can achieve a bedbug-free home for less than $200-$300 over 2-3 months with some diligence. If done correctly, you shouldnt see bed bugs after 2-3 weeks when using CrossFire along with Cimexa.</p>
<p>Many people swear by steaming or heat-treating
bed bugs/)
.
I tried this method twice and found that it failed for me because I did not have the time or patience to do it daily for two months. This review focuses on the chemical route with CrossFire, which has proven to be more effective with consistent application.</p>

<h2 id="crossfire-for-bed-bugs-residual-spray">CrossFire for Bed Bugs (Residual Spray)</h2>
<p>Bed bugs lay eggs daily in various hidden areas around your home. Even with thorough treatment, there will likely be areas you miss that will have hatching bugs. CrossFire is designed to keep working for long periods, ensuring that bed bugs are continually targeted even after the initial application.</p>
<h3 id="1-remove-clutter-">**1. Remove Clutter **</h3>
<p>The first step is to declutter your home. Get rid of clothes, shoes, books, and other items you can live without. Wash and dry everything on
high heat
, then seal them in plastic bags. This step is crucial to prevent bed bugs from finding new hiding spots and to eliminate any that may be hiding in your belongings.</p>
<p>Another significant issue is identifying the source of the infestation. If you dont figure out where they are coming from, you may find yourself needing to treat your home indefinitely.</p>
<h3 id="2-mix-and-apply-crossfire-">**2. Mix and Apply CrossFire **</h3>
<p>To start, mix  the bottle of CrossFire with  gallon of water in a chemical sprayer. Spray every nook, cranny, baseboard, corner, and crevice in your home. You will need to repeat this process every 10-14 days for 8-12 weeks. It&rsquo;s essential to only mix what you need because once mixed, CrossFire needs to be used within 24 hours.</p>
<p>One quart of CrossFire goes a long way; I was able to treat my 1200 sq ft, three-bedroom apartment with just one quart. Alongside CrossFire, use Cimexa dust, a fine powder that should be lightly applied to outlet covers, light-switch covers, and other voids in your home. Be cautious not to apply too much; a light dusting is sufficient as bed bugs will avoid overly thick layers.</p>
<h3 id="3-launder-your-clothes-thoroughly-">**3. Launder Your Clothes Thoroughly **</h3>
<p>During the first 2-3 weeks, while you may still
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/">see live bed bugs</a>
, launder your bedclothes every three days and dry them on high heat. Keep your CrossFire spray handy in case you spot any bed bugs crawling around.</p>
<p>Vacuum your home daily, paying special attention to baseboards if you have carpeting. Immediately empty the vacuum, tie up the debris, and remove it from your home to ensure you kill even the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/baby-bed-bugs/">baby bed bugs</a>
.</p>
<p>Clear out shelves in closets and books on bookcasesno boxes either, as bed bugs love hiding in cardboard. Everything you keep needs to be sealed or tied up in plastic or garbage bags. This leaves bed bugs nowhere to hide.</p>
<h3 id="4-treat-your-car-for-bed-bugs-">**4. Treat Your Car for Bed Bugs **</h3>
<p>Dont forget to treat your car. Bed bugs can hitchhike to your vehicle and eventually infest it. Treat your car with CrossFire every time you treat your home.</p>
<p>The cheapest place Ive found to buy CrossFire is from an online source where its priced at $30 with free shipping if you spend over $45. I suggest buying two bottles upfront, as it will take at least that much to treat every 14 days for 2-3 months, plus youll benefit from free shipping.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>CrossFire offers an effective solution to the persistent problem of bed bugs when used correctly and consistently. By following these stepsdecluttering, correctly mixing and applying CrossFire, laundering your clothes regularly, and not forgetting to treat your caryou can achieve a bedbug-free home.</p>
<p>Although the initial process may seem daunting, the results are well worth the effort. With the right approach and a bit of diligence, you can rid your home of these pests for good.</p>

bed bugs like to hide
include box springs, electrical outlets, bed frames, chairs, picture frames, baseboards, and wallpapers.
These are the areas that you need to check to
see if you have bed bugs
in your house.�Also, these pests are nocturnal, which means they go hiding during the day and come out to feed on your blood at night.

<h2 id="what-are-other-signs-of-bed-bugs">What are other signs of bed bugs?</h2>
<p>The truth is
bed bugs are tiny, and they move very fast
, which means spotting them will be hard. Therefore, you need to start looking for other signs that your house is bed bug-infested.
Start by looking for the signs of feces. You will find these around the bed frames and mattresses and in other areas that bed bugs like to use for hiding.
If you see things that look like small, dark, spots, then you shall have found them.�The other
signs that you might have bed bugs
in the house are tiny red spots on your bedsheets.
This can happen when you
killed a bed bug
unknowingly while asleep. Since they will be small spots, you need to get out your spotlight so you can see them.
The other thing is that before they reach the adult stage,
bed bugs molt several times
. Therefore, you need to look for exoskeleton in areas that they use for hiding.
You are likely to find them in your bed sheets and mattress seams. Their exoskeletons are pale yellow in color and to see them clearly, you will need a magnifying glass.
The last sign that you are about to deal with bed bugs is there eggs and eggshells beneath your mattress and bed frame. You might also see them in the crevices of your mattress.
They are very small, so get out your flashlight. Though bed bugs do not create nests, live ones and their eggs are usually found in colonies. Make sure to look in the tight hiding spots if you want to find them.</p>
<h2 id="home-remedies-for-bed-bugs">Home Remedies for Bed Bugs</h2>

home to rid bed bugs
permanently, and they are outlined below.</p>

<li>Start by removing your beddings and washing them thoroughly. Put them in a clean environment and let them dry for more than thirty minutes. Use a

<p>There is a possibility that your pet might have some bed bugs on their fur. This is true because their body can provide a perfect hiding haven for the bed bugs and other insects.
For safety purposes, you need to ensure that your pet does not have any bed bug on them before you start cleaning.�Check their fur and if you find that they have bed bugs or signs of them, use a non-toxic

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-life-cycle/">are tiny pests</a>
that will disturb your sleep by biting and sucking your blood before retreating to the seams of your couch or bed.
The insects are carried between places (unknowingly) by pets or humans on their bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bug bites appear as irritating bumps that are red - they are inflicted on any exposed skin all over your body.
In this article, I will outline the various DIY Bed Bug Sprays you can use to repel or kill the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-diy-bed-bug-sprays">Details: DIY Bed Bug Sprays</h2>
<p>Commercial bed bug killers and repellents are pricey and may come infused with preservatives and chemicals.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, to create a DIY spray to control bed bugs, gather the required ingredients such as essential oils, baking soda, Diatomaceous Earth, and rubbing alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-essential-oils-bed-bug-spray">1. Essential Oils Bed Bug Spray</h3>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/essential-oils-for-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/)/">Essential oils</a>
are a critical ingredient that can be used to
<a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q1/study-identifies-essential-oil-compounds-most-toxic-to-bed-bugs.html">repel bed bugs</a>
.
But bed bugs can go for months without taking a blood meal and so the effectiveness of essential piles will be as good as how frequently you will spray them.</p>
<h4 id="athymol-from-essential-oil-thyme">a.Thymol from Essential Oil Thyme</h4>
<p>The thyme plant produces the essential oil thyme which has Thymol as its active compound.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thyme plant is popular for being an effective animal repellent and insecticide - it has been used for years.
Thymol (its scent) has been
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6408565/">documented</a>
to overwhelm the bed bugs&rsquo; nervous system and so it will repel the pests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-geraniol-from-rose">b. Geraniol from Rose</h3>
<p>Some aromatic plants such as rose, and palm produce essential oils that contain terpene alcohol known as c.Geraniol.
Geraniol is an essential oil that is popular for
repelling cockroaches in apartments
but it has also been shown to repel bed bugs.
A
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4592615/">2014 research</a>
that was comparing the effectiveness of traditional pesticides with a spray that contained Geraniol reported positive results in the latter.</p>
<h4 id="d-citronella-from-asian-grass-plant">d. Citronella from Asian Grass Plant</h4>
<p>Another essential oil that will repel the bed bugs is citronella oil.</p>
<ul>
<li>Citronella oil is extracted or produced from Asian grass plants that are already being used to repel mosquitoes.
Other medical applications of citronella oil take advantage of its wound healing and antifungal properties.
Recent
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926421/">research</a>
shows that citronella oil is an effective repellent against some insects such as bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e-eugenol-from-clove-plant">e. Eugenol from Clove Plant</h3>
<p>Eugenol is another ingredient that will repel bed bugs and it is derived from essential oils like those in a clove.
Besides just repairing the bed bugs, a recent
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7074276/">study</a>
shows that eugenol will also kill some bed bugs.
f.Carvacrol from Oregano plant
The oregano plant is one of the plants where you can extract essential oils that contain carvacrol.
The most recent
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6408565/">research</a>
appliance that carvacrol had the highest potency in repelling bed bugs during a fumigation process.</p>
<h3 id="g-lavender-oil">g. Lavender Oil</h3>
<p>Lavender oil
will kill bed bug eggs and adult bed bugs - an effective bug repellent too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lavender oil is one of the mosteffective natural solutionsfor persistent bed bugs since they hate its aroma, smell, and taste.
But the lavender oil smell is just normal or great to humans.
So, once you spray the oil in the house, I love that one too the space smelling sweat while also repelling the bed bugs.</li>
<li>To apply the lavender oil bed bug repellent, simply put the oil into a spray bottle and on the sheets and on the bedding.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzD_madhlCw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzD_madhlCw</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-vinegar-solution">2. Vinegar Solution</h3>
<p>Vinegar solution and spray will be an effective technique that a homeowner can use to
repel and kill bed bugs
.
Check places that have signs of bed bugs (such as window sills, crevices in furniture, and bed frames) and soak them with the vinegar solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>The vinegar solution will drown the tiny pests but you may require to reapply the spray once weekly to fully control the infestation.
So, yes, the vinegar solution when sprayed directly on the bed bugs will kill them.</li>
<li>This is because vinegar contains acetic acid that is very strong and the chemical will damage the nervous system of the insect.
Despite the DIY vinegar solution being effective in controlling fleas, it is not recommended as a standalone treatment.</li>
<li>I advise that you, therefore, continue applying the vinegar spray on the affected areas before getting a longer-lasting remedy for the bed bugs.
The vinegar solution is evidently not a pesticide but will be effective and safe for handling an early bed bug infestation.
Here&rsquo;s how you can make your DIY vinegar solution for bed bug spraying.</li>
<li>Fill one spray bottle with your vinegar and ensure to tighten its lid securely.</li>
<li>Spray the vinegar solution on the bed bug-infested locations such as cracks and crevices, between furniture, in tight spaces, and walls.
As you continue spraying the vinegar solution, the bed bugs will escape from such locations and get into the tight spaces where you&rsquo;re bug-treated.
You can hinder future bed bug treatment infestation by spraying the vinegar solution in the cupboards, mattresses, furnishing, walls, and window sills.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget to spray the underside and corners of the various services and repeat the application for a number of weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-diatomaceous-earth">4. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth is also a natural, safe, and effective spray that you can
use to control bed bugs
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diatomaceous Earth will be great for treating those objects that you cannot be tossed into the washing machine.
By definition and practicality, diatomaceous Earth may not be classified under the bed bug repellent class.</li>
<li>This is because it is its diatoms (small fossilized particles) that break the exoskeleton of the bedbugs, dehydrate and kill them.
The diatomaceous earth diatoms are accumulated over time in water bodies such as lakes and oceans.
As a side note, FDA recognizes diatomaceous Earth as safe and it is used in beverages, food, medicines, paints, and various beauty products.
Homeowners will sprinkle the DE powder around their rooms and home perimeter to kill the bed bugs.</li>
<li>A recent<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/5/4/942/pdf">study</a>shows that diatomaceous Earth generated moderate effectiveness in controlling bed bugs during a six-month time.
Therefore, expect bed bug exterminators recommend using integrated approaches while trying to control these pests.
Sprinkle the diatomaceous Earth on the mattress and box springs control bed bugs.</li>
<li>Finally, you should vacuum spaces where the diatomaceous Earth was applied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-spraying-rubbing-alcohol-91-isopropyl-alcohol">5. Spraying Rubbing Alcohol (91% Isopropyl Alcohol)</h3>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/">Rubbing Alcohol</a>
can help with early intervention, a bed bug infestation, or a prevention mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, rubbing alcohol will only offer temporary relief for bed bugs in your home.</li>
<li>So, if you have a massive infestation of bed bugs, I would advise using chemical sprays or professional exterminators.
But how will rubbing alcohol kill the bed bugs? Well, rubbing alcohol is classified as a solvent and it will dissolve the bed bugs&rsquo; exoskeleton.
Besides, rubbing alcohol functions as a drying agent or as that will dry out the adult bed bugs and their eggs.</li>
<li>Finally, rubbing alcohol will repel bed bugs and therefore discourage them from laying eggs or crawling on treated surfaces.
So you can spray the rubbing alcohol on furniture and bedding to win the fight against the bugs.
But spraying the rubbing alcohol on furniture, bedding, and mattress may leave the surfaces (especially if they are not painted or varnished) with stains on marks.</li>
<li>Rubbing alcohol may not repel the bed bugs effectively but it will remove does bed bugs that are running on cracks and crevices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The DIY bed bug sprays will help exterminate the bugs - I recommend using essential oils, rubbing alcohol, vinegar, and diatomaceous earth.</p>
<ul>
<li>These bed bug-repelling or killing sprays are effective and safe to use in the house or in business premises.
Cheers!</li>

. So, the question is. Do ants eat <a href="/posts/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/">bed</a> bugs?
<strong>Short answer, YES  While some ant species kill and eat bed bugs for food, most of them scavenge on carcasses of bed bugs. However, they usually dont hunt them down for their food. Ants mainly feed on sweet foods especially honeydew, and will only eat bed bugs and other small creatures to get some protein in their diet.�</strong></p>

<p>Pharaoh ants will feed a variety of foods, especially sweet stuff like honeydew. Their diet also includes other insects including bed bugs. They are small in size, about 1/16 inch long and have a light yellow-brown color.</p>
<p>Since they prefer to stay indoors, these ants will kill bed bugs and feed on them. However, they reproduce as quickly as the bed bug themselves. So, you can imagine having a colony of ants to help you eradicate bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="2-do-carpenter-ants-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>2. Do Carpenter Ants Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h3>
<p>These are black large ants and very common in the US. They actually dont feed on wood as their name depicts. The holes they excavate in wood are for laying eggs, storing food and living.</p>
<p>Carpenter ants usually stay indoors and will feed on a wide variety of food, especially leftovers. However, they also feed on carcasses of insects inside the house and even outdoors.</p>
<p>They feed by sucking the fluid inside the insect, and leaving the carcass intact.�Simply speaking, carpenter ants will not hunt for bed bugs in your house. They however feed on their dead carcasses. Although they have a sting, they dont use it for hunting.</p>
<h3 id="3-do-argentine-ants-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>3. Do Argentine Ants Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h3>
<p>These are very small ants, stretching about 1/10 of an inch at maximum. Their color ranges from dark brown to black. Unlike many ant species, Argentine ants will not make deep nest to live in.</p>
<p>They live in crevices in walls, wood and other surfaces.�They feed on different things, especially sweet foods.</p>
<p>Their protein diet is mainly composed of carcasses of dead insects, including bed bugs. Since they lack stingers, these ants will neither hunt nor kill bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="4-do-red-imported-fire-ants-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>4. Do Red Imported Fire Ants Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h3>
<p>As their name depicts, fire ants are worse creatures to have around. Their bite contains a venom which causes intense pain and can cause anaphylaxis in some people.</p>
<p>Being omnivorous, these ants will feed on any food including carcasses of animals and insects.�Although they prefer to scavenge on dead bodies, they will feed on small insects including bed bugs whenever they come across them.</p>
<p>After killing the bed bug, they either drain the carcass of its internal fluids or drag it back to their nest.�As scavengers, fire ants are therefore not likely to hunt bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="5-do-asian-needle-ants-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>5. Do Asian Needle Ants Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h3>
<p>This is another ant species that is known for killing and eating small insects. They are very fond of termites but will also kill and eat bed bugs whenever they get a chance.</p>
<p>Similar to the Red Imported Fire Ants, these ants have an extremely venomous sting capable of instigating an anaphylactic shock in some people. This venom makes it easier for them to kill or paralyze their prey.</p>
<p>Although their diet is composed of mainly termites, they eat a great deal of, arthropods, bed bugs and other invertebrates. They paralyze their prey before dragging it back to their nest for later.</p>
<h3 id="6-do-european-fire-ants-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>6. Do European Fire Ants Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h3>
<p>These ants are known for their aggressiveness and their venomous sting. They are however not as widespread in the U.S. as the Red Imported Fire Ants. Their diet is mainly composed of sweet food like honeydew, but will also feed on small creatures including bed bugs to get some protein.</p>
<p>They are very defensive and will attack and sting any creature that comes near their nest, including humans. They get their prey by immobilizing it with their venom before they can drag it back to the colony.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-for-ants-incontrollingbed-bugs">Limitations for Ants inControllingBed Bugs</h2>
<p>You have heard instances where natural predators have been successfully used to eradicate pest infestation. While some ants are natural predators for bed bugs, they cannot be relied on because of the following limitations:</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bugs-are-elusive-">**1. Bed Bugs are Elusive **</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are quite elusive and will hide in very narrow and dark places where theres minimal disturbance. Unlike ants, bed bugs have a flat body that allows them to fit and hide in small cracks.</p>
<p>In addition, bed bugs come out to feed at night, meaning ants have little chances of getting them.</p>
<h3 id="2-ants-are-pesky-pests"><strong>2. Ants are Pesky Pests</strong></h3>
<p>Similar to bed bugs, ants are pesky pests you dont want to have around your premises. Although they dont feed on people, they are much irritating in several other ways. Such nuisance may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damaging wooden furniture and structures.</li>
<li>Foraging on your food.</li>
<li>Some have a venomous sting which may cause intense pain and anaphylaxis in some people.</li>
<li>They are nagging when they crawl around the house.
In addition, these creatures reproduce rapidly, meaning they can easily become an infestation. Plus they live in hidden places, making it hard to eradicate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-they-cause-damage-in-your-home"><strong>3. They Cause Damage in Your Home</strong></h3>
<p>When inside your house, ants will cause unimaginable damage. One of the most disastrous ant is the carpenter ant which excavates wooden things to make nest for living and breeding.</p>
<p>Some ants will force themselves into tiny cracks such as in floorboards and baseboards, gradually causing those spaces to widen and lose their splendour. Similar to bed bugs, some ants hide in electronics, which may present a fire risk in your house due to short-circuit.</p>
<p>Whats more, damage can include even the waste they dumb out of their colony.</p>
<h3 id="4-cost-of-eradicating-ants-is-high"><strong>4. Cost of Eradicating Ants is High</strong></h3>
<p>The cost of eradicating ants is much higher than if you had to use DIY remedies or hire an exterminator to eradicate bed bugs. If you get ants to feed on bed bugs, they will reproduce rapidly, eventually becoming an infestation.</p>
<p>Therefore youll incur extra costs in DIY pest remedies or in hiring a professional exterminator to get rid of them.</p>
<h3 id="5-ants-might-become-an-infestation"><strong>5. Ants Might Become an Infestation</strong></h3>
<p>Ants find it east to colonize new areas rather than fighting for limited resources. So if you get ants to eradicate bed bugs in your house, they might split into colonies and shift in various locations.</p>
<p>When therere many colonies of ants in your compound, you might end up having an infestation which is hard and costly to eradicate.</p>
<h2 id="getting-rid-of-bed-bugs--ants"><strong>Getting Rid of Bed Bugs &amp; Ants</strong></h2>
<p>Both ants and bed bugs present varying difficulties in eradicating. Thus, if you have the two infestations, youll need to invest in different approaches to eradicate them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv4qs7_ZXz8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv4qs7_ZXz8</a></p>
<h3 id="bed-bugs"><strong>Bed bugs</strong></h3>
<p>The size and shape of bed bugs makes it easy to hide in very narrow crevasses, where they live and breed rapidly. This makes it difficult to completely eradicate each and every bed bug even with the best pesticide in the market.</p>
<p>In addition, bed bugs reproduce rapidly, up to 4 generations in twelve months. That means, a few bed bugs can become an infestation within a very short period. Plus they can stay for long without feeding.</p>
<p>However, with the best pest eradication strategies, it is possible to significantly reduce their numbers or eradicate completely. Bed bug treatment should entail the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimizing the spread by vacuuming infested things.</li>
<li>Heat treatment targeting bed bugs at all stages of their life cycle.</li>
<li>Use of the most effective pesticides in the market such as boric acid, silica gel and diatomaceous earth.</li>
<li>If the infestation is beyond your control, you should call a professional exterminator to assess and determine the correct bed bug treatment to use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ants"><strong>Ants�</strong></h3>
<p>Ants are equally hard to eradicate especially due to their tendency to exist in large colonies. A single colony can have up to hundreds of thousands of ants, meaning it is hard eliminate all of them at a go.</p>
<p>Secondly, ants build their nests in hidden places away from human interference. Thus, it may be difficult to locate each and every hideout and kill every ant. Since ants are very industrious, there will be so many of them foraging for food outside the colony. So, even if you bombed their colony, therell be survivors to start and build a new colony.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that its impossible to eradicate ants. With a proper pest control plan, its possible to get the job done even without the help of an expert. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessment of the extent of the infestation.</li>
<li>Use pesticides to destroy their nests and colonies.</li>
<li>Clear any trash and food debris that may attract ants to your house.</li>
<li>Create repellent barriers at any possible entry point using, talcum powder or any other effective chemical.</li>
<li>Be on the lookout for new infestations so as to act on them promptly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>While some ant species can kill and eat bed bugs, they are not a reliable method for eradicating bed bugs. Usually, ants dont go hunting down bed bugs.</p>
<p>They prefer sweet food like honeydew and will only eat bed bugs to get a protein meal.�In addition, most ant species are not predators. They scavenge on carcasses for their food.</p>

may not work and are expensive - but you can use natural treatments such as pests. So, below we answer this question - do ants kill bed bugs?
<em>In summary, ants (among other insects) such as the red-imported fire and pharaoh ant species predate and kill bed bugs. But exterminators also recommend heat treatment for bed bugs.�</em>
<em>The predators of bed bugs are Masked Bed Bug Hunter, House Centipedes, Thanatus Flavidus Spiders, American Cockroaches, Pharaoh Ants, Red-Imported Fire Ants, and Argentine Ants.�</em>
*Pharaoh ants are considered the most dangerous ant species in killing and eating bed bugs - especially for few bed bugs - besides fire ants and argentine ants. But *
<em>ants won&rsquo;t help remove massive bed bug infestations.�</em>
<em><strong>See top spider killers.�</strong></em>

<h2 id="details-do-ants-kill-bed-bugs">Details: Do Ants Kill Bed Bugs??</h2>
<p>But ants will also help locate the bed bugs&rsquo; hiding places -but you won&rsquo;t have to introduce the bugs into your house - as may also prove difficult to
<a href="https://nysipm.cornell.edu/whats-bugging-you/bed-bugs/bed-bug-faqs///">control these pests</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="1-pharaoh-ant">1. Pharaoh Ant</h3>
<p>Most ant species will eat various insects an
d food types - and besides pharaoh ants eating various foods, they&rsquo;ll also feed on bed bugs. Compared to other ant species, pharaoh ants feed on bed bugs more.
The pharaoh ants are described as indoor pests - their color may be considered as light yellow-brown. Equally, the pharaoh ants are also fast-producing just like with bed bugs.
Therefore, employing the wrong control techniques could on the ants split them into a number of colonies that&rsquo;ll spread all over your house and surrounding spaces - this is a pest-control headache.
Pharaon ants are yellow-brown in color and will easily feed on bed bugs - but they, like other ants, will produce very fast. Ants will multiply fast - and this could lead to a large number of them in your house.
Further, you may contaminate the food - which could lead to dysentery and salmonella - and thus using the ants on bed-bugs could lead to problems. Also,
exterminating ants
could be challenging than bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="2-masked-bed-bug-hunter">2. Masked Bed-Bug Hunter</h3>
<p>The masked bed-bug hunter (R
<em>eduvius personatus</em>
) is considered to be an assassin bug with 6 spider-like legs, oval and flattened body - they&rsquo;re active predators of bedbugs and different insects.
This spider species mainly feed on insec6ts and bedbugs - but if mishandled, it can bite humans to defend themselves.�The nocturnal feeders plus their nymphs cover themselves using insect parts, lint, and house dust - glued on their bodies.
The Masked hunter live in dry and warm areas - such as your home - they&rsquo;re gray and brown (they&rsquo;re able to fly too) - measuring anywhere around� 17 - 22 millimeters.
The bed bug hunters are named so because they&rsquo;ll hide in the dust when in their nymph stage. The bugs have symbiosis life relationships with pigeons and bats - bed bugs will feed on insects attracted by the pigeons and bats.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, it is not advisable to introduce masked bed-bug hunters and some subspecies into the house as they may bring diseases to you and other humans.</li>
<li>Also, these masked hunters will bite humans (painfully) whenever they feel threatened - some liken the bite tothat of snakes.
Masked hunters have wings and may also fly with elongated bodies - found in the eastern and central areas of the US. You&rsquo;ll find the bugs in colder areas - plus the warm and dry areas.

</ul>
<h2 id="do-ants-eatinsects-andbed-bugs">Do Ants EatInsects andBed Bugs?</h2>
<p>The Salt Lake scientists report that lizards ate different insects including flies - and the black ants would also exterminate bed bugs. Ants will also feed on nectar and rotting fruits - while Aphids also feeding on sap.
Other ant species, some red or black, smaller or even larger will scavenge but won&rsquo;t be an effective treatment for the bed bugs. The scavengers and predators will besides feeding on leftovers eat insects.
You&rsquo;ll find the masked hunters in houses and barns -� and places with pigeons and bats - they also
eat arthropods
.</p>
<h2 id="bed-bugsversusargentine-ants">Bed Bugs�versusArgentine Ants</h2>
<p>The small Argentine ant is domiciled in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina - it measures about 1/10-inch in length but their queens have longer bodies - and all have black and dark brown colored.
Argentine ants, like the
carpenter ants
, will in both wood and wall cracks - but there won&rsquo;t be deep nests. They&rsquo;ll colonize new locations and collaborate - you&rsquo;ll find them around West Coast, Mississippi, and Louisiana.
These ants will love sweet foods but may also extract the protein content in the dead insects. But the Argentine ant lack stingers and hence won&rsquo;t bite bed bugs or even kill them.</p>
<h2 id="bed-bugs-vsred-imported-fire-ants">Bed Bugs vsRed-Imported Fire Ants</h2>
<p>The red-imported
fire ants are domiciled in South America but they&rsquo;ve also colonized the U.S., Asian countries, New Zealand, and Australia.
The sting or bites
cause a burning sensation with some swelling.
The ants may cause anaphylaxis - omnivores - they&rsquo;ll feed on insects and dead mammals.
The various ant species will also eat honeydew droplets - RIFAs are described as being voracious predators.</p>
<h2 id="bed-bugs-versuseuropean-fire-ant">Bed Bugs versusEuropean Fire Ant</h2>
<p>The red ant is an equally invasive ant species that has colonized Canada, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York state, Europe, and South America.
The ants primarily
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">eat honeydew and may also feed on bed bugs</a>
to gain extra nutrition including proteins. Further, the Pharaoh ants will kill various pests - including those in temperature indoors.
The protein-rich and carbohydrate-rich insects will provide ents will great nutrition. The ants won&rsquo;t work effectively and may require DIY treatment or even use an exterminator.</p>

<h3 id="1-ants-will-bug-your-spaces-too">1. Ants will Bug your Spaces too</h3>
<p>Despite that ants will eat bed bugs, ants are equally pests too that&rsquo;ll disturb your peace. Some of the irritating ways that the ants will bug on your spaces and items including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crawling on the various spaces</li>
<li>Causing damage to various structural items</li>
<li>Like carpenter ants - these pests will damage the structural integrity of the houses and homes</li>
<li>Damaging food
Thus, trying to kill bed bugs using ant may lead to other problems - hiding in various places and may lead to a re-infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-bed-bugs-are-hard-to-reach">2. Bed Bugs are Hard to Reach</h3>
<p>Bed bugs will hide in the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">challenging-to-reach places</a></p>
<ul>
<li>the ants will hide into places that they won&rsquo;t get disturbed.
Ants, on the contrary, will prefer areas that they can move freely as they search for some food sources - and not the tight cracks.
Equally, the dead bed bugs won&rsquo;t be found in open spaces - but will be hiding in the walls and cracks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ants-will-break-structures">3. Ants will Break Structures</h3>
<p>Ants just like with
termites
, ants (like carpenter ants) will damage or even break your structures including the house as they&rsquo;ll burrow into materials such as wood - damaging the property.
The bugs will dig into the wall cracks, floorboards, and baseboards - making the cracks become wider. Others may also damage your electronics - as they&rsquo;ll hide inside and hence may cause short-circuiting.
Ants will love the dark and moist areas as they plan plus execute the house-damaging mission. Further, ants will be challenging to exterminate even with your regular pesticides.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The use of bed bug bombs to kill bed bugs is increasing day by day. The aerosol foggers contain insecticides like pyrethroid, permethrin, or pyrethrin -� administered in different dosages. So, do bed bug bombs work?
Simple answer, Yes,
bed bug bomb kills all bed bugs and eggs
that get into contact with the chemical being sprayed. But any beg bug,
baby bed bugs/)
, or
eggs-bug-eggs/)
that are not reached by the chemical wont be killed.
The
Killing power of any bed bug
bomb is determined by the concentration in each can, penetration action, and the area being served. Most bed bug bombs can
reach bed bug hideouts
within your room, especially if there is continuous air circulation. So, lets get into the details.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bug-bombs-work-foggers---do-they-work">Do Bed Bug Bombs Work? Foggers - Do They Work?</h2>
<p>Bed bug bomb kills bed bugs by continuously fumigating/spraying the entire room with bed bug killing insecticide - any bed bug or eggs that come into contact with this chemical dies.
The bed bug bombs, also known as foggers, are packed in pressurized can/canister in aerosol form. Most of these
bed bug killers
contain pyrethrins, permethrins, or pyrethroid mixed with other chemicals in a suitable ratio.

Does Lavender Kill Bed Bugs?</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-safely-use-the-bed-bug-bomb">How do I safely use the bed bug Bomb?</h2>
<p>Simple! You will need to set the bed bug aerosol at a proper point within the bed bugs infested room and activate the canister. Ensure that all the doors and windows are closed for at least 2 to 3 hours during the application time.
Improving air circulation in your room using a fan or air conditioner helps the
bed bug bomb penetrate effectively
into crevices/cracks beneath beds and furniture.
Bed bugs bombs contain flammable
chemicals that can affect
both your humans and pets. However, you must properly identify the bugs - check the
pictures of bed bugs
.
Therefore, the following precautions should be followed during use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read keenly and follow directions given in each aerosol canister during application. You will need to note main things like cautions/warnings,
application procedures, and side effects
.</li>
<li>Cover all food substances in your room and gaming toys for children and pets airtight. Children may put fumigated toys in their mouths. Food absorbs this chemical leading to food poisoning.</li>
<li>Get the accurate area/volume of room you want to
treat with
bed bug bombs. To do this,
<em>measure the length, width, and height</em>
using a foot or tape measure.
Then, multiply the measurements of these sides to get volume. Do the same for other rooms and sum the volumes of each room. Compare the total with the indicated volume in the aerosol canister.</li>
<li>Switch off lights/deactivate sockets from mains and remove anything that can spark. Bed bud bombs are highly flammable due to aerosol propellants used. Ensure that you place your aerosol can/canister at least 7 feet from any spark source within your house/office.</li>
<li>Vacate your humans and pets from the room being treated. When inhaled, beg
bug bombs cause air track discomfort
.
Bed bug bombs can kill
pets such as dogs. Keep off the house for two to three houses.</li>
<li>Use the right number of bed bug bombs in a given area/space. Excess Bed bud bombs are dangerous as it may take long before it leaves your room.
Also, some residuals may be difficult to get rid of. Less quantity of
bed bug bombs will cause inefficient killing
of these bloodsuckers. You will therefore need to stick to application instructions  if you are unable to engage an examiner.</li>
<li>Inform your neighbors about bed bug bomb application  this will minimize any effects that may cause chaos on the eve of application. Recommend them to switch off any spark source during that time.</li>
<li>Keep off people from accessing the room. Ventilate the office/room/s well before entering. Ensure you open doors and windows to let in fresh air for 60 minutes.</li>
<li>Store the unused bed bug bombs in an enclosed place away from children and pets.

What Causes Bed Bugs?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-bed-bug-bombs-wont-kill-all-your-bed-bugs">Why Bed Bug Bombs wont kill all your bed bugs.</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, most bed bug bomb users cannot complete all bed bugs in their place. This is one of the many challenges in
household pest control
.
However, several reasons may lead to the incomplete killing of bed bugs in your room/office/house or warehouse while using a bed bugs bomb. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incomplete Penetration. Bed bug bombs work by
spraying the gaseous insecticide killer
over bed bugs and their egg, thus killing them.
Any
bed bug or eggs
that are not reached is not killed. The insecticide is expected to access the cracks/crevices, mattress seams, and roofs, sealing those points, thus
killing bed bugs
by suffocation.</li>
<li>Incomplete air circulation in your room limits the
bed bug
bobs&rsquo; action from penetrating some bed bugs&rsquo; hideouts such as crevices/cracks, ceiling, inside the mattress, bedding, clothes, or under the carpets.
You will need to turn some of your items like chairs, couches, beds, clothes, picture frames, and drawers to enable killing gas to properly penetrate these sections.</li>
<li>Less quantity application. All bed bug bombs have application descriptions, which also indicated volume capacity, mode, and area that each aerosol canister could serve. Administration of larger space wont kill all bed bugs.</li>
<li>Mutation/chemical resistance. Most bed bug bombs contain pyrethrin or pyrethroid. EPA banned the use of DDT in 1972  this led to the development of synthetic pyrethroids,
which were then used to kill bed bugs
.
According to Economic ecological research, report shows that
most bed bugs
are becoming immune to these chemicals. They undergo mutation, and there these chemicals may not kill them.
By 2010, some
bed bugs species
had gained complete resistance/mutated and could not be killed by these chemicals. In case you find yourself in such a case, ensure your use of an alternative method such as heat treatment.</li>
<li>Using the wrong bed bug bomb. There are varieties of bug bombs in the market. Purchasing the wrong
bug brand wont kill bed
bugs. You will need to be keen on the labels indicating the kind of insects killed by a given fogger.</li>
<li>Less powerful bed bug bomb. The market is currently flooded with
varieties of bed bug
bombs. Check
diatomaceous earth for bed bugs
.
Though they can
kill bed bugs
, these aerosol foggers do not have enough concentration to kill bed bugs. You will need to test various bed bug bombs or get insight through the reviews from other users in the universe.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="which-alternative-bed-bug-killers-will-work">Which alternative bed bug killers will work?</h2>
<p>Bed bug bombs may fail to kill bed bugs in your house/office effectively due to some of the reasons I have highlighted above. Below are some of the alternatives that you can use instead.
1.
<strong>Heat treatment</strong>
. This involves heating the
bedbug-infested
room to a temperature of 125 degrees Fahrenheit.
At this temperature, all
bed bugs and their egg will be dead
. Check the
bed bug steamer
.
This will take a longer time and cost as compared to bed bug bombs. This calls you to
vacuum clean all your bed
bugs-infested�items and house.
The vacuum machine sucks both the adult and their eggs. However, this method may not remove some of the
bed bugs hidden deep in mattresses
and crevices.
2.
<strong>Dry cleaning/using a dryer</strong>
. This requires you to put your bed bug-infested clothes or bedding into a dryer operation at a temperature of 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Here&rsquo;s
how a dryer kills bed bugs
.
This temperature will
kill all the bed bugs
and their eggs. This method may not kill
bed bugs in some items
like couches, mattresses, or beds since these items cant fit in your dryer. The dryer is unsuitable for entire room treatment.
3.
<strong>Using bed bug sprays</strong>
. Spray
bedbug-infested
room or items directly using bed bug spray available in the market.
This method is dangerous as you are directly involved in spraying, and thus you may get affected by these aerosols, which cause nausea, dizziness, breathing discomfort, and stomach upset.
4.
<strong>Dispose of all bed bugs, infested item</strong>
s. This is not easy since you may not be willing to dispose of your newly bought items.
But, it is recommendable to dispose of old bed bugs infested items or burn them. NB: Desist from purchasing any second-hand items  they are one means of transferring bed bugs into your home/office.
5.
<strong>Setting bed bug traps</strong>
. These will
trap bed bugs
that crawl into them. They are not very efficient as they
may not trap bed bugs
that do not come from other hideouts and their eggs.</p>
<h2 id="ways-that-will-make-bed-bug-bombs-kill-bed-bugs-efficiently-">**Ways That Will Make Bed Bug Bombs Kill Bed Bugs Efficiently **</h2>
<p>Though bed bug bomb may not completely kill bed bugs in your bed bugs infested office, home, or warehouse, you can improve its action/performance by doing some of the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring your room/house/office doors and windows are airtight closed during the 2 to 3 hour application time will concentrate the killing gas within all possible
bed bugs hideouts
in the room.</li>
<li>Turning all bed bugs-infested items in your room. Ensure you
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-bed-bugs-spread/">spread bed bugs</a>
infested clothes, bedding, chairs, couches, or footwear and turn the beds and wall units in your room to offer ample penetration of bed bug bombs into those places without obstructions.</li>
<li>Using several small quantity bed bug bombs. Place several bed bugs aerosol canisters at various points in your room. This helps in quick access and penetration of active insecticide simultaneously in the room.
It also prevents
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs from hiding</a>
in one part of the room when they sense danger.
*NB: The total of all these canisters should not be more than the room&rsquo;s volume being served. *</li>
<li>Boosting air circulation. Insufficient air circulation within the bed bugs infested room cause incomplete penetration of the bed bug killing gas to such place as beneath the bed, shelves/drawers, under the table, couches or carpets.
You can boost room air circulation using a fan or air conditioner.
<em>Remember to power these devices from outside to prevent any spark.�</em>

<h2 id="can-bed-bug-bomb-cause-sickness-to-humans--pets"><strong>Can Bed Bug Bomb Cause Sickness to Humans &amp; Pets?</strong></h2>
<p>Chemicals such as pyrethrins or pyrethroids that make bed bug bombs can kill both your humans and pet when taken to a given concentration.
The 2025 research bed bug report on Improper use of Bed bug Bomb done in America shows that most people who get exposed to bed bug bomb had weak immune and were highly susceptible to diseases compared to others who were not.
Bed bug bombed rooms are unsuitable for your humans or pets as the gas may choke or respiratory when inhaled. Chemicals such as pyrethrins or pyrethroids found in bed bug bombs cause toxicity in cats and dogs.
You will see your pet&rsquo;s tremor, vomit, drooling, seizure, or lethargy when under
effects from exposure to a bed bug
bomb. Some
pets such as dogs and cats
have been reported dead in rooms that have been fumigated using bed bug bombs.
NB: If your humans or pets are exposed to bed bug bombs, move the person/pet to a place with fresh air. Once they regain strength, rush them to the hospital/health center/dispensary for medication.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-side-effects-of-using-bed-bug-bombs"><strong>What Are Side Effects of Using Bed Bug Bombs?</strong></h2>
<p>When you are exposed to bed bug bomb in a substantial quantity, you may experience some of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headache, dizziness, and wheezing.</li>
<li>Burning and stinging sensation in the eyes.</li>
<li>Muscle cramp and stomach upset.</li>
<li>Difficulties in breathing and irritation of the upper airway.</li>
<li>Gastrointestinal problems, coughing, or nausea.</li>
<li>It can even trigger Asthma and allergic reaction, especially in children.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-bed-bug-bomb"><strong>How Much Does It Cost to Buy a Bed Bug Bomb?</strong></h2>
<p>The cost of a package of bed bug bombs varies according to quantity, number of canisters in a single kit, or the manufacturers costing system.
However, you will require between 10 to 50 US dollars to purchase a package.� This may vary according to economic shift too.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bug bombs do work by killing all eggs, nymphs, and adult bed bugs that come into contact with it. However, bed bugs that are in unreachable hideouts will not be killed.
This method is affected by incomplete air circulation within the room being treated. Proper administration of bed bug bombs is important to avoid side effects associated with it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first left my parent&rsquo;s house and got my apartment, it was a frustrating hustle to get rid of bed bugs. Just like myself, most homeowners fear and get a chill with the mention of a bed bug infestation. In todays post, I&rsquo;ll be answering this question
<strong>can bed bugs fly?</strong>
<strong>Lets face it:</strong>
Controlling
<a href="https://www.cornellcollege.edu/student-health/bed-bug-info.shtml">bed bugs</a>
can be a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming task given that they&rsquo;ve�become
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35421742">more resistant to insecticides</a>
such as neonicotinoids. But imagine what it would be like if
bed bugs could also fly-hide/)
? Well, this would be a notable horror. So, let&rsquo;s dive right in for more details.
<strong>In short, NO - Bed bugs do not�jump or fly</strong>
but have dysfunctional wing pads. They mainly use crawling to move around looking for a blood meal, a
hiding place
, or a new host.
So, if you&rsquo;ve seen an insect that closely resembles a bud bug flying around the house, most probably we&rsquo;re talking about carpet beetles or stink bugs (bet luckily these don&rsquo;t bite).
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Before we move on with bed bugs and their movement, I recommend that you also view this
guide on stink bugs vs. bed bugs
.</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-fly-bedbug-movement">Do Bed Bugs Fly? Bedbug Movement</h2>
<p>You ever wondered
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-bed-bugs-spread/">how bed bugs spread</a>
? Maybe you previously thought that bed bugs jump/ or fly from one room or house to another.
<strong>Well</strong>
, you were wrong because bed bugs only move through crawling. But do they have wings, or it&rsquo;s equivalent maybe?
Well, bed bugs are wingless insects. However, on the flip side, these bugs winglets make it look like they have wings, but the wings do not develop fully.
So, the flat body (oval too) and underdeveloped wings are the bugs&rsquo; key features. To put it into perspective, bed bugs are something just some inches larger than your largest fleas.
<strong>To avoid confusion</strong>
,� bed bugs are about apple-seed-sized insects living off blood from human beings and animals. Before sucking blood, the bugs will be flat in
shape but swells into a reddish colored
bug after the blood meal. However, since bed bugs only feed on blood, seeing them on your premises does not signify that you have a dirty living.
<strong>What about baby bed bugs?�</strong>
Just like the adult bed bugs, their
nymphs (the Immature bedbugs)
are also wingless but will also shed some skin (molting) 5 times before attaining the adult stage.
So, since they cannot jump around quickly to hide from human beings and other enemies, these bugs will hide in tiny spaces, particularly in a cluster.
For example, you can find the bed bugs and their eggs in headboards, bed frames, box springs, and mattresses. But don&rsquo;t worry, I created an article on
<em>�</em>
how to get rid of stink bugs.</p>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-climb-walls"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Climb Walls?�</strong></h2>
<p>As noted above, bed bugs and their nymphs will move only through crawling. Their crawling sprees will most likely lead the bugs to climb on different favorable walls and finally getting onto beds, cupboards, and cabinets.
Besides, bed bugs can crawl through drain pipes to get from one house to another. Therefore, its always a good idea to unblocked clogged drains, possibly using one of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaners</a>
.
However, the bugs tend to have reduced crawling ability when it comes to smoother surfaces such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-climb-metal-or-plastic/">metal or plastic pipes</a>
, porcelain, or glass.
For example, bed bugs will have a difficult time climbing up the porcelain walls of your bathtub. However, they can climb up on another nearby (and rough) wall and finally fall off to your bathtub.
But dont be too happy; the bugs can still use electrical runs and pipe chases. Control the bed bugs
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">through spraying</a>
or
bed bug steamers
.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Its clear now that, despite having some wing pads, bed bugs will not jump or fly like your regular insects such as flies and fleas.
The legs of these bugs do not have enough energy to propel it into a distance through jumping. Therefore, the sole method of movement for the bed bugs is through crawling.</p>

Pre-historic bed bugs had wings, while current-day ones only possess under-developed wing pads that don&rsquo;t allow bed bugs to fly.
Thus, bed bugs can only crawl or climb while moving - they can&rsquo;t jump or fly. Read also,

<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-have-wings-can-they-fly">Do Bed Bugs Have Wings? Can They Fly?</h2>
<p><em>Bed bugs have un-developed wings</em>
that can&rsquo;t be used for flight. These wings (wings pads), even for mature bed bugs, aren&rsquo;t suitable for flying.
Bed bug&rsquo;s
wings pads are tiny, plus
they&rsquo;re located slightly above their abdomen. However,
baby bed bugs
won&rsquo;t have wing pads or wings.
Bed</p>
<ul>
<li>bugs can&rsquo;t fly, and so their movement is mainly through crawling or hitch-hiking on humans. Read also, Differences in *
Scabies Vs. Bed Bugs
.
So, don&rsquo;t confuse bed bugs with bugs that can fly. But equally important is that bed bugs, even without flying, will cause massive problems for pets and humans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-identifybed-bugs">How to Identify�Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>From the onset,
<a href="https://wagner.edu/campus-services/operations/bed-bug-policy/">bed bugs</a>
are brownish, tiny ( 1/4 inches) and oval-shaped insects feeding on a cat or dog blood - but also humans&rsquo; blood. But the adult bed bugs are about the apple seed but a flat body.
Following a full blood meal, the adult bed bugs will become reddish in their color and a swollen body. The bugs will be moving quickly around the ceilings, walls, and floors.
<a href="https://youtu.be/hW4RTY7k2lw">https://youtu.be/hW4RTY7k2lw</a>
Further, you&rsquo;ll notice
females as they&rsquo;ll lay eggs</p>
<ul>
<li>look anything like dust specks. The eggs are off-white in color, have sticky skin &amp; exist in clusters -
can be confused with dandruff.
However, the baby or immature bed bugs (1 millimeter) will take a blood meal each time to progress past each of their 4
life stages</li>
<li>as they also shed skin when molting.
Notably, with high humidity, bed bugs will develop to full adults within a month and get 3+ generations every year. However, bed bugs don&rsquo;t carry diseases but will cause anemia.
Bed bugs
have long antennae plus
their characteristic six insect legs. These blood-suckers will look swollen after taking a blood meal. So any small bugs that&rsquo;ll be jumping around could be
fleas
.
Bed bugs will be hiding
in dark areas like crevices and cracks.
Bed bug bites
are very painful but won&rsquo;t cause the spread of any diseases - but you&rsquo;ll require to treat bed bug-infested areas.</li>

<h2 id="what-looks-like-a-bed-bug-with-wings">What Looks Like a Bed Bug with Wings?</h2>
<h3 id="1-fleas">1. Fleas</h3>
<p>Fleas, particularly Ctenocephalides felis, are comparable bed bugs, but they have no wings. Fleas are reddish-brown, with a round head, plus equally long legs.
Fleas will also bite humans
but are  inches in size with a segmented and flattened body. Flea bites are itchy and will carry different
<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases">vector diseases</a>
, particularity from wild animals.</p>
<h3 id="2-bat-bugs">2. Bat bugs</h3>
<p>Bad bugs are brown-colored insects that are highly comparable to bed bugs - but also have no wings. Also, bat bugs have heads that are covered with long hairs.
Nasty bugs are oval-shaped and  inches in size, looking like the apple seed. Equally, bat bugs only have wing pads, and hence their &ldquo;wings&rdquo; are not functional.

Further, bat
bugs don&rsquo;t bite
humans, but they do bite on bats. You&rsquo;ll mainly get these
bugs on or around the areas
that bats live - these include the attic or similar dark areas.</p>
<h3 id="3carpet-beetles">3.�Carpet beetles</h3>
<p>Carpet beetles have red or orange scales on their black-patterned body. They have short antennae emerging from their hidden heads - when viewed over them.</p>
<p>These oval-shaped bugs 2 to 4 millimeters, which is about �1/16 inches. However, carpenter beetle, as opposed to bed bugs, has wings but will only take flight in the daytime.
However,
carpenter bees don&rsquo;t bit
e like bed bugs but will trigger allergies and dermatitis on the human skin. You&rsquo;ll find them on carpet fabrics and flesh flowers.</p>
<h3 id="4-booklice">4. Booklice</h3>
<p>Booklice are creamy and brown-colored bugs that look like bed bugs or termites (
top termite killers
), plus they have a soft body. They measure about 1 to 6 millimeters in body size or about 1/32 inches.
Booklice have a body and head being separated on their segment body parts. Some Booklice have wings that look like roofs, but dead Booklice can cause asthma.
Booklice will mainly be
hiding around damp places
or high humidity since these bugs tend to be dehydrated easily. Further,
spider beetles are black or reddish-brown with long antennae
plus thin legs.</p>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-fly-into-your-house">Can Bed Bugs Fly into your House?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs
will move into any house, including those that are super clean. Even though bugs enter the house via windows and doors, they will fly since they have no wings.
You&rsquo;ll mainly find bed bugs in areas like schools, households, motels &amp; hotels, homeless shelters, and dorm rooms. They&rsquo;ll hide inside fabrics and move around the house.
You may find bed bugs inside public transportation, rental cars, and taxis - in the indoor spaces, you&rsquo;ll find the bugs moving between rooms or attaching to carpets or household objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, bed bugs can&rsquo;t fly - they have no wings. You&rsquo;ll mainly find them on beds, mattresses, and mattress seams but will also be on headboard, bed frame, cracks, and box spring.</li>
<li>Old or second-hand furniture can also hold bed bugs - particularly on the seams of couches and chairs, curtain folds, and on cushions.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will<a href="http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef636.asp">feed when they&rsquo;re hungry</a>as opposed to just eating only at night. Therefore, the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-your-skin/">bugs will also bite your skin</a>during the day when you get near them.</li>
<li>As compared to fleas and other similar insects, bed bugs can&rsquo;t jump around the house, andspray won&rsquo;t be enough to kill all the bed bugstages, including eggs, nymphs, and adults.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">Can you squish a bed bug</a>
? Well, YES, it&rsquo;ll burst, leaving red bloodstains. Bed bugs will move over distances by hitchhiking on human beings, clothing, or send-hand furniture - particularly around mattress or couch seams.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do bed bugs have wings?�No - bed bugs have no wings - but you can identify them with their oval, flat any tiny body measuring about 1/4 inches but have wing pads as opposed to having fully-functional wings.
Adult bed bugs can be seen with your naked eyes, but babies and nymphs will mainly exist in clusters - you&rsquo;ll find both on crevices and cracks.
Bed bugs measure roughly the size of an apple seed or a pinhead. However,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>
are off-white in color and only exist in clusters.</p>

can jump! Well, bed bugs are crafty creatures and youll find them anywhere in the house.</p>
<p>Youll find them on your bed, inside furniture, on walls and even on the celling. But do they jump from one place to another.
<strong>A short answer is  No. Bed bugs cant jump. Their legs are meant for crawling rather than jumping. Their lack of wings also prevents them for flying around. However, they can crawl at relatively high speeds (about 1m per minute).�</strong>

<h2 id="details-do-bed-bugs-jump---bedbug-movement"><strong>Details: Do Bed Bugs Jump? - Bedbug Movement�</strong></h2>
<p>Therere several household pests that look like bed bugs. So, when you see small creatures jumping from one place to another you might be tempted to think you have bed bugs.</p>
<p>Well, the first pests you should rule out are bed bugs. Unlike fleas, bed bugs cannot jump around. Their short limbs and flat bodies are designed for crawling  Not jumping. Thus, you dont expect them to jump into your clothes or items.</p>
<p>However bed bugs can crawl into items you bring home such as old furniture, bedding and luggage among other items. These items only act as a means of transportation. Or they can crawl from an adjacent house if you live in an apartment or college hostel.</p>
<p>When bed bugs fall or crawl into items, they might end up covering long distances and infest new areas. In fact they can hitch hike a ride from one country to another! Social areas such as theaters, trains, public buses and hostels are some of the areas youre likely to pick bed bugs.</p>
<p>If bed bugs crawl into your luggage or clothes, you might end up carrying them or their eggs to your house.</p>

<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-climb-on-surfaces"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Climb On Surfaces?</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps their most outstanding means of mobility is crawling and climbing on things like walls, furniture, fabrics, plastic and metal. The hooks on their feet help them in gripping on almost any surface.</p>
<p>However they wont climb on all surfaces. Polished surfaces such as glass and porcelain tend to be too smooth for bed bugs to climb. Also rugged surfaces such as those covered with fur and hair prove difficult for bed bugs to navigate.</p>
<p>Their small hooks get stuck on these materials.�Thats why you wont find bed bugs on your hairy pets or animals.</p>

<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-have-wings"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Have Wings?</strong></h2>
<p>Theres a popular believe that bed bugs have wings. Some online content will tell you so but thats not actually true. If they had wings, they could already be using them to fly. But as we see them, no bed <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">bug</a> cant fly.</p>
<p>They have wing pads which only suggest that <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs could have evolved to lose their wings. These wing pads are very tiny and cannot be used for flying. Bed bug nymphs have no wing pads and cannot also fly.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you have come across a flying bed bug, that could be a mistaken identity. The fact that bed bugs dont fly is perhaps a good reprieve for homeowners. You can imagine the problem bed bugs could cause if they had the ability to fly.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-bed-bugs-travel-from-room-to-room"><strong>How Do Bed Bugs Travel From Room to Room?</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bugs lack wings and so they wont jump. So, the only way that bed bugs will travel from one room to another is by crawling or catching a ride on people or objects. Knowing how bed bugs travel and spread can be helpful to homeowners in their efforts to eradicate them.</p>
<p>When bed bugs come into your house, theyll stick around as long as they have their favourite meal-your blood. They stay close to the host. Thus you will find them in your bed, mattress and sofa set.</p>
<p>However, bed bugs are not limited to bedroom and living room only. They can harbour any room that is frequented by humans. They get into these rooms by crawling on surfaces and hooking on your body or objects. When items are moved from room to room, therere high chances of spreading these creatures.</p>
<p>Bed bugs can also move from one house to another. When you go on a vacation, bed bugs in a house get starved and start looking for a new host. They have an acute sense of carbon dioxide that humans breathe out. Thus, it wont be long before they discover a new territory in your neighbours house.</p>
<p>Bed bugs may also crawl into other houses as they run away from repellents or chemicals used to eradicate them.</p>

<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-jump-from-one-person-to-another"><strong>Can Bed Bugs Jump From One Person To Another?</strong></h2>
<p>You might wonder how bed bugs ended up in your house. Well, bed bugs are clever pests- they know how to find new hosts. These tiny creatures are so hard to spot when they hook on our clothes. Thats how they end up being transported from one place to another. But, unlike fleas, bed bugs wont stick on your body for long.</p>
<p>The only way bed bugs will move from one person to another is by crawling. They dont jump like fleas do. Fleas have long and powerful hide limbs which help them in jumping around. In fact, they can jump up to 100 times the size of their body length.</p>
<p>On the contrary, bed bugs have flat bodies and small legs which make it difficult for them to jump. So, if you find bed bugs on your clothes or luggage, the only way they could have got there is by crawling.</p>
<p>Perhaps its good news to know that bed bugs cant jump from one person to another. Otherwise, this could provide them with an easy way to hitch a ride into new homes. At least they cant crawl into your clothes fast enough like fleas can jump.</p>

<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-jump-from-the-floor-to-your-bed"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Jump From The Floor To Your Bed?</strong></h2>
<p>As you have seen, bed bugs wont fly or jump around. So, if you find bed bugs in your bed, they should have crawled to get there. If your bed is adjacent to the walls, bed bugs will crawl from other places to your bed at night in search of a blood meal.</p>
<p>They can also access you bed through the legs of the bed, bedding that hang on the floor or furniture that is adjacent to your bed.</p>
<p>You can however prevent bed bugs from crawling into your bed by ensuring that its not adjacent to the wall. Also ensure that items such as lampstands and furniture are not connected to your bed. Do not allow bedding or clothes to hang on the floor from your bed.</p>
<p>One more thing! Block bed bugs from climbing up the legs of your bed by installing climb-up cups. These are cups with polished surfaces which bed bugs cant climb. When placed on each of the legs, bed bugs wont be able to crawl in to your bed.</p>
<p>In addition, bed bugs that are coming from the bed to the floor also get trapped in the inner wall of the climb-up cup.</p>

<p>Bed bugs will go all the way to your ceiling. However they wont intentionally drop themselves from the ceiling. But therere is a possibility of losing grip and falling on your floor, bed or other items.</p>
<p>When youre treating your house for bed bugs, chances are that bed bugs will run way from the chemicals being used. The safest place for them happens to be the ceiling. If you treat your bed, floor, baseboard and other furniture, bed bugs that survive will retreat to safe areas like the ceiling.</p>
<p>Bed bugs are also attracted to the heat emitted by human bodies. But they wait until night we you fall asleep to feed on your blood. So, during the day they can seek warmth elsewhere and that happens to be the ceiling.</p>
<p>Whichever the case, bed bugs will always find their way to the ceiling. However theres no single reason to think that they will intentionally dislodge from the roof to the floor or your bed.</p>
<h2 id="what-time-do-bed-bugs-travel"><strong>What Time Do Bed Bugs Travel?</strong></h2>
<p>Its commonly believed that bed bugs will come out during the night when you fall asleep. Well, they prefer to feed when the host is still. However, bed bugs will come out to feed whenever they are hungry.</p>
<p>Normally bed bugs feed at least once a week. And they require a blood meal in each of their successive life stages. Thus, when they are hungry, theyll travel from their hideouts to where they can get a blood meal.</p>

<p>Bed bugs will neither jump nor fly. They dont have wings for flying and their legs are not meant for jumping. However, these creatures are skilled crawlers.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can crawl and hitch a ride into people, luggage, and furniture among other items.</li>
<li>Therefore, its important to take preventive measures whenever you return from a trip or college.

**Simple answer, YES  Cockroaches are known predators of bed bugs, which wreak havoc in millions of homes. However, only some species of cockroaches eat bed bugs. **
<strong>Particularly the American and the German cockroaches are very fond of feasting on bed bugs. Others cockroaches that eat bed bugs include the oriental and the brown-banded cockroaches.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-cockroaches-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>Details: Do Cockroaches Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>It is very uncomfortable to have bed bugs inhabit your home. They hide in furniture, pillows, clothing and luggage near their human host. Bed bug bites cause unbearable irritations and allergic reactions to human bodies.</p>
<p>However, cockroaches can save you from these bites by feasting on these nocturnal insects. Both insects emerge at night after you switch off the lights. In their four hours of actively scavenging for food, cockroaches will feast on bed bugs before they even get a chance to feast on human blood.</p>
<p>To roaches, bed bugs seem like a nice snack. You might wonder how roaches are able to locate bed bugs. They have acute sensory and survival instincts that enable them to easily locate and feed on bed bugs.</p>

<p>Several species of cockroaches are very fond of eating bed bugs. The most common bed bug-eating cockroaches include the German and the American cockroaches. Others in the list are the oriental and the brown-banded cockroach.</p>
<h3 id="1-american-cockroach-waterbug"><strong>1. American cockroach (waterbug)</strong></h3>
<p>Its the largest household roach in America. They are fond of fermenting material, but will feed on almost any kind food. When indoors, they feed on crumbs that scatter on the floor, under appliances, behind kitchen cabinets and insects such as bed bugs.</p>
<p>Their typical outdoor diet may include, small insects, decaying leaves, fungi, algae, etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-german-cockroach"><strong>2. German cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>German roaches are almost the size as American ones. They will eat anything that has nutritional value including other pests like bed bugs. They easily find their way into new houses by getting a ride in cartons, bags and second-hand appliances
<strong>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="do-cockroaches-hunt-bed-bugs"><strong>Do Cockroaches Hunt Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Just like bed bugs, cockroaches come out to search for food during the night. So, theyre likely to hunt and feed on bed bugs as they search for something to eat. The two insects have adapted to feed at night as a way of avoiding predators and enemies like us.</p>
<p>At night, when everyone is asleep, therere fewer disturbances and these insect know its their time to eat. If they were to feed during the day, you would of course be their greatest threat. But, at night, these creatures will feed uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Cockroaches will harbour in your mattress and furniture, making them very close to the bed bugs that are waiting for you to sleep in order to feed on your blood. Usually, cockroaches will hunt on these bed bugs as they emerge from their hideouts.</p>
<p>Since they will have to cross walls from their hideouts to get to their human host, they became easy targets from the active cockroaches.</p>
<h2 id="are-cockroaches-a-sign-of-bed-bugs">Are Cockroaches a Sign of Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Once cockroaches get into your house, they will stick there as long as there is something for them to eat or until you exterminate them. You probably know that roaches can eat anything that they come across. They scavenge for anything from food to things like paper, wood and glue.</p>
<p>If theres nothing for them to eat, including bed bugs, roaches will quickly leave your house and go hunting for food. That means, if roaches have nothing else to eat and you have bed bugs, it possible that they will stick around.</p>
<p>However, you cant have a scenario where cockroaches have nothing to eat at all. And since they dont depend on bed bugs as their main diet, roaches will stick in your house whether you have bed bugs or not.</p>
<h2 id="cockroaches-vs-bed-bugs--which-is-easier-to-control"><strong>Cockroaches Vs. Bed Bugs  Which is easier to Control?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches are simpler to kill because of their tendency to eat any food or even non-food substances. So, if you lay poison baits or traps having food, it is possible to kill cockroaches. A good example of a cockroach trap is bait traps with glucose. Since they love to eat sweet things, glucose will easily lure them into your poison baits or traps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bed bugs only feed on blood from warm blooded animals. So you wont expect them to be lured into baits and traps meant for cockroaches. However there are traps and lures for bed bugs.</p>
<p>One of the best method to kill roaches and bed bugs, is to use heat treatment.</p>
<p>In heat treatment, your house is heated to temperatures above 120C, so that no bed bug or cockroach can survive. The bugs are exterminated quicker with increase in temperatures. It requires professional equipment and expertise to heat the room to the required temperatures.</p>
<p>Not only will you effectively kill bed bugs and cockroaches. If other pests including ants, flies and termites reside in your house, they will also die during the heat treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the available pesticides can be used against roaches and bed bugs. A good example is permethrin.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-roaches-to-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Disadvantages of Roaches To Kill Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>While cockroaches can help you kill bed bugs in your home, they could escalate into a real problem. These creatures are known to be survivalist and can multiply rapidly in a very short period. Dont be tempted to depend on them to kill bed bugs in your house. Just like bed bugs, roaches are equally difficult to rid of.</p>
<p>Roaches are also associated with a lot of contamination in our houses. They are known to pass on germs that may cause diseases such as gastro-enteritis and dysentery in humans. Other diseases that may be transmitted through these creatures include, salmonella and stomach related illnesses.</p>
<p>These diseases become possible when roaches leave their pathogenic infected faeces or secretions on surfaces and food substances.</p>
<p>Cockroaches also cause asthmatic reactions among children and the elderly during their regular molting.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do cockroaches eat bed bugs? NO. The fact that cockroaches eat bed bugs does not make them a reliable pest control method. You have noticed that bed bugs dont constitute the main diet for cockroaches.</p>
<p>Cockroaches feed on almost anything they come across. That means, they dont go hunting for bed bugs wherever they are.�Obviously, you cant resolve to have enough cockroaches to feed on the bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>You would end up with a hoard of roaches, hence creating another problem. Furthermore, bed bugs reproduce very rapidly and will replenish their population in a matter of time.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, these natural predators will never make a difference to your bed bug infestation. The best solution is to adopt some of the well-known methods like pesticides, bait traps or the DIY bed bug controls.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bed bug infestation in your spaces may be
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4080563/">challenging to control</a>
; you&rsquo;ll require professional help and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-vacuum-for-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-cockroaches-eat-bed-bugs/)/">top-quality bedbug control equipment</a>
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">natural bed bug predators</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the ban of DDT and other synthetic pesticides some 40 years ago, bed bugs have been noted to make a major comeback.
The technique chosen may have different side effects and effectiveness. So, below I&rsquo;ve discussed the issue of &ldquo;do spiders eat bed bugs?&rdquo;
<strong>In summary, YES, most spiders (especially the Cobweb <a href="/posts/spider-bite-vs-bed-bug-bite/">spider</a> and Philodromid crab spider species) will eat bed bugs and all the insects that get trapped in their webs.�</strong>
<em>So, let&rsquo;s check the details!�</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs-what-spider-species">Do Spiders Eat Bed Bugs? What Spider Species?</h2>
<p>Well, maybe you should not get worried when you find that spider around the house - as they may actually help you not just control flies but also bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Philodromid and cobweb spider species are the two main species that are known to trap and eat bed bugs; these spider species are common all over America.
Despite that spiders will feed on bed bugs, it&rsquo;s impossible for these creatures to feast on all the bed bugs (in all life stages such as the
Baby Bed Bugs
).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-will-philodromid-crab-spidersfeed-onbed-bugs">1. Will Philodromid Crab Spiders�Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>The Philodromid crab spiders may be physically and in features similar to the crab (both front and rear); this is a very common spider species both in America and all over the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Philodromid (Thanatus flavidus) spider will mainly inhabit the outdoors but may sometimes get into the house.
These spiders will get into the house with the mission of hunting and eating those small insects including bed bugs. However, the phildromids will not employ webs to trap the bed bugs.</li>
<li>So, how do they catch the bed bugs? Well, the phildromids move faster than bed bugs and thus they&rsquo;ll hunt them down, inject some venom into their body and eat them.
The Philodromids are distributed all over the globe including Canada, North America, Asia, South America, Europe, and even Africa.
Since these spiders will take residence in the wild and the house, they&rsquo;ll hunt those many insects and flies by injecting venom into their bodies.</li>
<li>When the Philodromids aren&rsquo;t indoors (which is most of the time), these spiders will hide under grass and undergrowth in your garden or yard</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-will-cobweb-spiderfeed-onbed-bugs">2. Will Cobweb spider�Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>The Cobweb spiders will also be helpful in feeding on the bed bugs around your house; at least that&rsquo;s a positive use for the spiders that you fear.</p>
<ul>
<li>These Cobweb spiders will create their webs on the house corners and they&rsquo;ll use the structures to trap the various insects including bed bugs.
However, there are some cobweb spiders that are poisonous and hence we might not want their services in eating bed bugs around our houses.
Thus, I advise you get a professional spider or pest exterminator to check the type of cobweb spiders that are in your residence, yards, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-willjumping-spidersfeed-onbed-bugs">3. Will**Jumping Spiders�**Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>There are over 600o jumping spider species globally. The food they take includes crawling insects - both those that live outdoors or even indoors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, if the spiders are in the indoor spaces, they&rsquo;ll also feed on bed bugs among other insects.
If the jumping spiders are living in the outdoor spaces, they will feed on flies, grasshoppers among other insects.
The jumping spiders will mainly Hunt in the daytime since they have a great sense of sight.</li>
<li>These spiders can be found in those unique house corners where it will be difficult for one to notice them easily.
The jumping spiders may be considered to be slow spiders. Thus, they will eye their prey such as the bedbugs from a distance and jump to eat them.</li>
<li>The jumping spiders may even jump up to 30 times their body length and thus the witch many of the insects.
An interesting point that you will note is that the jumping spiders may also Hunt other spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-will-cellar-spiders-feed-on-bed-bugs">4. Will Cellar Spiders Feed on Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>So on the question of whether cellar spiders will feed on bedbugs, I am happy to note that these spiders, like other spiders above, will also eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>On their body structure, the cellar spiders look like the harvestman (<a href="https://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html">Daddy-Long-Legs</a>) but they have venom and also create webs.
To know whether you have them in your house you need to check any of their carcasses that may be on webs.
However, the cellar spiders will not chew bed bugs. They will simply inject venom into the body of the bedbugs and swallow them whole.</li>
<li>The bedbugs among other insects will be digested by the digestive juices that are found in the cellar spiders.</li>
<li>However, the cellar spiders and their webs sometimes get out of hand and you might need to control them.
For this, I recommend that you contact your local pest exterminators or get some certified technicians that will control
both the webs and the spiders
.
But most of the time you might not need to control this by the cellar spiders.</li>
<li>This is because these spiders will help you also control other insects including mosquitos, flies, or moths in the garage shed, yard, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-avoid-spiders-in-controlling-bed-bugs">Why Avoid Spiders in Controlling Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>In this section, I will outline reasons why you should avoid using spiders in controlling bed bugs in your spaces.
<strong>1. Spiders Feed on Many Insects</strong>
We&rsquo;ve noted that spiders can act as great natural predators to eat those spiders that are in your spaces.
However, it is also clear that spiders may not effectively reduce the whole bed bug population.
This is because spiders will not just feed on bedbugs but will consume a range of insects to satisfy their dietary needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, as you wait for the spiders to feed on their whole bed bug population, they will be elsewhere feeding on other insects.
Thus, the spiders will not significantly reduce bed bugs in your house.
<strong>2. Spiders are Feared�</strong>
The next issue in using spiders to control bed bugs is that spiders are generally feared by most homeowners.</li>
<li>So, it will be unimaginable that you&rsquo;ll keep so many spiders to control bed bugs in the house.</li>
<li>Finally, after controlling the bedbugs, you could have a major spider problem in your spaces.
Therefore, most of us will avoid spiders due to fear and also avoid creating a spider&rsquo;s problem in the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the spiders could also frighten those in your house as they&rsquo;ll generally hide around the coaches, sofa sets, and near your bed.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re not confident enough to be seeing spiders roaming around you may need to avoid them in controlling bed bugs.
<strong>3. Spider Webs are Unsightly�</strong>
Finally, you may notice that spider webs may make your spaces look unsightly and shaggy.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, most of us hate the job of removing the spider webs from various corners of our houses.
Therefore, if you hate the site and the work that comes with spider webs, you might need to exterminate them instead of using them as natural predators for the bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-other-predators-for-bed-bugs">Any Other Predators for Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>As an expert, I have to note that there are other natural predators that you can use to control spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, you must take into consideration that some of these predators may also the household pests.
First, I have to note that pets such as cats and dogs will only eat bed bugs by accident.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-lizards">1. Lizards</h3>
<p>Lizards such as geckos are notable predators that can eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike spiders, lizards are considered harmless and cute but may also eat most insects including bed bugs.</li>
<li>However, if you&rsquo;re not keeping the results as pets, you may need to check the lizard population as too many may be unpleasant.
A key disadvantage with the lizards, just like with spiders, is that you might need to keep too many of them, and finally, they&rsquo;re not removing the whole bed bug population.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cockroaches"><strong>2. Cockroaches</strong></h3>
<p>Some cockroach species, such as the German and the American (which are very common) are known to eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, spiders including the Oriental and the brown-banded species will eat many insects.</li>
<li>However, just like with the other natural predators, cockroaches have their large share of problems while controlling bed bugs.
For example, cockroaches will reproduce fast and hence leave you with another pest control issue.
Alternatively, you may need to use techniques and an appropriate pace that will control both the bedbugs and the cockroaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-pharaoh-ants">3. Pharaoh Ants</h3>
<p>Ant experts have concluded that the pharaoh ants are an appropriate species that we can use to target and control bed bugs.
One unique benefit is that ants may be used as a giveaway and hence they&rsquo;ll draw the experts to locations that bed bugs could be hiding.
Pharaoh ants are a major natural predator for bed bugs. Other species of arms that you can use include their fire ants and the Argentine ants.
However, a disappointing fact with these predators including ants is that they won&rsquo;t be effective to remove bed bugs.
These animals will mainly feast on bed bugs especially when the population is high but they won&rsquo;t make a major difference in controlling the bed bug population.
So, the major advantage is that you can use the bed bugs to pinpoint locations that bed bugs have burrowed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>In conclusion, spiders are considered as natural predators for bed bugs but using them may prove inefficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, the method could make you neglect professional help that can help reduce the bed bug population rapidly.</li>
<li>Also, bed bugs are creative creatures that will hide even in small crevices and cracks to stay off predators.
In fact, you might need a very large population of spiders to significantly reduce the bug bed bugs in your house.
Therefore, instead of using spiders to control bed bugs, using
professional spiders exterminators
may be the best option.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But, if you&rsquo;re anything like me, you hate
<em>�second-guessing when handling household�pests</em>
, and I hope you do too. Therefore, in this post, Ill be answering this question� &ldquo;Does Ammonia Kill Bed Bugs? Yes!But how? what about their
nymphs/)
?&rdquo;
**So, ammonia good for bed bugs? YES. Ammonia (or Ammonium hydroxide, a compound of nitrogen + hydrogen) kills bed bugs only on contact. But, you might need a combination of bed bugs control methods such as heat (done by an exterminator) or bed bug bombs. **
<strong>Check other bed bug killers.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bug Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="does-ammonia-kill-bed-bugs-and-their-eggs-whats-this-ammonia">Does Ammonia Kill Bed Bugs and Their Eggs? Whats this ammonia?</h2>
<p>As noted above,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"><strong>Ammonia</strong></a>
(NH
3
) is a chemical compound that&rsquo;s created from�hydrogen�+ nitrogen�to create what we generally call�household ammonia.
The chemical is also used in
<a href="https://www.tfi.org/sites/default/files/documents/ammoniafactsheet.pdf">ammonium nitrate fertilizer</a>
for adding nitrogen to the soil and, thus, your flowers or grass.
Ammonia is also used to make household cleaners clean tough stains on kitchen counters, bathrooms, toilets, sinks, and tubs.
It&rsquo;s also great for eating away oil/ grease stains, killing bacteria, and food fermentation. It&rsquo;s no wonder that ammonia is
recommended for use in killing bed bugs
.
You&rsquo;ll thoroughly wipe out the roach infestation in your house. At this point, every homeowner would like many options (like
bleach
,
Lysol
,�or Ammonia,
spraying the bed bugs
), provided they get rid of the nagging bugs.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-bed-bugs-with-ammonia">How to treat Bed Bugs with Ammonia</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Summary</strong></dt>
<dd>So, take the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LOUJOUC/?tag=p-policy-20">household ammonia</a>
, mix with water (plus alcohol), and put it into a spraying bottle with a secure lid. Next,
spray all the bed bug
hiding places such as bed frames, mattresses, and attics.
<strong>1.�</strong>
To get started, get your Ammonia and dilute it as advised on the product label instructions. Generally, it should be 1 part of water and 1 part of Ammonia.
The critical consideration when at this step is to ensure that you dont waste your ammonia while still making sure that it quickly
kills the bed bug
.
<strong>2.�</strong>
Next up is a consideration that confuses many homeowners - i.e., should you add alcohol to the ammonia to effectively
kill the bed bugs
?
So,
<strong>my answer is  absolutely YES!</strong>
Ammonia combined with alcohol is like having a dual-rocket propelled grenade against the
nasty bed bugs
. So, get the ball rolling by mixing the two bed-bugs solutions for fast and effective action.
<strong>3.�</strong>
Third, get the solution into a secure spraying bottle. However, remember that Ammonia is toxic to the human skin, and hence you must not allow it to get to your bare body. Therefore, you might need to put on some gloves thatll protect your skin.
<strong>4.�</strong>
Its finally time to spray! Now, take the bottle with the ammonia
plus alcohol solution and spray the bed bug
hideouts. Such areas include carpets, baseboards, bed frames, and mattresses. While spraying, ensure you lift any covers or lids that could be
hiding some bed bug
, their eggs, and larvae.
<strong>5.�</strong>
Finally, some people recommend using the ammonia solution in healing
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pictures-of-bed-bug-bites/">bed bug bites</a>
. Is this method safe? Is it effective? My informed opinion is that ammonia will be great in healing
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-bite-through-clothing/">bed bug bites</a>
.
However, the main issue is that most of us might get the concentration wrong, which might be toxic to our skin. Therefore, I advise that you avoid ammonia in
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">Bed Bug Bites Vs. Mosquito Bites</a>
.</dd>
</dl>
<ol start="6">
<li>Repeat the bed bug spraying process after 24 hours until you can see no moving bugs. Also, ensure that you machine-wash the infested clothing and fabric with the highest allowable temperature. Also, ensure that you vacuum the floor and wash all the carpets and rugs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="safety-precautions-for-handling-ammonia">Safety Precautions for handling Ammonia</h2>
<p>On its own, ammonia wont be toxic if used as prescribed by the manufactures. However, if you decide to mix this chemical with other substances, youll need to be extra careful to avoid toxic reactions and possible poisoning to humans and pets.
However, when mixed with chemicals such as bleach, you must be extra cautious to avoid poisoning. For example, bleach (which is chlorine) combines with ammonia to produce
<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/bleach-and-ammonia-chemical-reaction-609280">chloramine - hazardous for humans and pets</a>
.
For the avoidance of doubt, yes, Chloramine (existing a tri-chloramine, di-chloramine, and mono-chloramine) is the same chemical used when disinfecting water.
However, tri-chloramine (the toxic fumes) is known to be highly poisonous and would harm your respiratory system.
Other health effects of Chloramine poisoning (from the ammonia and bleach reaction) include pneumonia, wheezing or sneezing, nausea, and chest pains. Therefore, if you get Chloramine poisoning, you must seek immediate medical attention.</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>The short answer is, NO, baby powder can&rsquo;t kill bed bugs. Baby powder will only irritate bed bugs or will only musk the scent from the bugs.</strong></em></li>
<li>*<strong>However, the powder may kill the bed bugs only by trapping them.�Related: Pictures of Bed Bugs.�</strong>

<h2 id="does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs-diy-bed-bug-treatment">Does Baby Powder Kill Bed Bugs? DIY Bed Bug Treatment</h2>
<p><strong>Myth 1:�</strong>
<em>Baby powder will dry the bed bugs skin</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Well, homeowners wrongly claim that baby powder�will work like
diatomaceous earth</li>
<li>that it&rsquo;ll dry the bug&rsquo;s skin.
You&rsquo;d need to sprinkle the baby powder on floors, furniture, and mattress.</li>
<li>If it were true, the powder would dry out the bed bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton and thus dehydrate them - includingbaby bed bugs.
<strong>Myth 2:�</strong>
Locking bed bugs in containers with baby powder
will kill them
. This is partly true, but the bugs wont die from any
poisoning from the bed bugs
.
However, youll need to
put the bed bugs
and baby powder together in a bowl or cup  creating something like a trap. The talc will be chemically dangerous to the bugs.
The
bed bug trap
will ensure that the bugs cant escape  the bowl or cup has a slippery surface on the inside, and thus the bloodsuckers cant climb over and escape.
Therefore,
bugs will quickly climb
into the trap but cant escape  theyll die from hunger.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-about-dual-purpose-baby-powder">What about Dual-Purpose Baby Powder?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs will escape any evidence of baby powder that youll have poured around the floors, furniture,
carpets
, and
mattress encasements
.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the powder willwork when used as a bed bugtrap.
Its important to remind you that baby powder talk isnt
hazardous to bed bugs
, and thus, using it as a trap wont help in the long term to exterminate the bloodsuckers.
The baby powder may only reduce the
bed bug
odor&rsquo;s strength or irritate the bugs exoskeleton. Thus, even the dual-purpose baby powder won&rsquo;t be effective.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="an-effective-bed-bug-trap---baby-powder">An Effective Bed Bug Trap - Baby Powder?</h2>
<p>As noted above, a
bed bug trap will work well
if created using baby powder having talcum - particularly when combined with some other ingredients.
Dr. Changlu Wang put down this bed bug trap research from Rutgers University. Below are the retirements as outlined by the researcher:</p>
<ol>
<li>Masking tape,�Gloves,�Talcum baby powder,�A cotton ball, and dry ice cubes</li>
<li>Thermos flask, flat-bottomed pet dish, and fabric that&rsquo;ll fully cover the pet dish&rsquo;s outer surface.
So, let&rsquo;s dive into how actually to assemble this bed bug trap to achieve top effectiveness.</li>
<li>Cover the out surface of the pet dish using the fabrics plus the glue from the masking tape. This enables thebed bugs to climbonto the pet dish.</li>
<li>Next, place the baby powder with talcum on a cotton ball and dust it into the side of your pet dish. Now, put on some gloves and get the dry ice bag and place them inside your thermos.</li>
<li>Now, put the pet dish upside-down while also placing the thermos on top of it. So, set the pet dish trap in anarea where bed bugs may frequent.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide is produced - when the dry ice starts melting - willattract the bed bugs.</li>
<li>The talcum in the baby powder will make the bloodsuckers slide and thus won&rsquo;t escape.</li>
<li>So, place the bed bugs trap near areaswhere bed bugs hide- including upholstery, couches, cushions, crevices, and cracks.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-kills-bed-bugs">Alternatives to Kills Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Exterminators and
professional pest control
may be outside the budget, or you might not have time for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider both non-chemical approaches and chemical approaches.
Besides using baby powder, below are the other
methods we can use to control
bed bugs. Check this
guide to check where bed bugs hide
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-bed-bugaerosol-spray">1. Bed Bug�Aerosol Spray</h3>
<p>Bed bugsprays
will be great insecticides that&rsquo;ll quickly get into the crevices and cracks.
Using
aerosol and liquid concentrate, we&rsquo;ll efficiently exterminate the be bugs.</p>
<h3 id="2-boric-acid-for-bed-bugs">2. Boric Acid for Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>Boric acid is also an excellent solution to
get rid of roaches
, but it&rsquo;s also suitable for bed bugs. However,
bed bugs must ingest the boric acid
.
But is

      <description>Does Baking Soda Kill Bed Bugs?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does Baking Soda Kill Bed Bugs?</p>
<p>Dealing with pests in your home can be costly and unsettling. Pests such as bed bugs replicate rapidly by laying 2 or 3 eggs every day, and if not tackled properly, they can spread all around the house. How then do you remove such infestation? Could you have a similar problem?
<strong>Well, the question at hand is, does baking soda kill bed bugs? The direct answer is YES - including baby bed bugs. Usually, the sodium carbonate salt found in this powder composition destroys the bed bugs exoskeleton upon contact. In addition, the bug is instantly dehydrated, thus leading to its sudden death.</strong>
<strong>When ingested, baking soda causes abdominal swelling (due to carbon dioxide generated), which ends up suffocating the bug to death eventually. Indeed, baking soda has a sharp crystalline structure that can cut the bugs alimentally canal (abrasion) thereby killing it.</strong>
During bed bug extermination, you can either sprinkle the powder, prepare a paste, or pile the compound into layers for effective killing action.�Related:

<h2 id="details-does-baking-soda-kill-bed-bugs">Details: Does <a href="/posts/does-baking-acid-kill-crickets/">Baking</a> Soda Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<h3 id="killing-action">Killing Action</h3>
<p><strong>1. By Dehydration</strong>
When a bed bug comes into contact or gets covered with baking soda, the salt will continuously absorb water from its body, thus causing sudden dehydration.</p>
<p>Usually, salt is a desiccant that absorbs water from its environment upon exposure. The process of dehydration may take a maximum of ten hours to sufficiently kill a bedbug.
<strong>2. By Destruction of Exoskeleton/Abrasion</strong>
The crystalline structure in baking soda injures the bedbugs digestive system (if swallowed), which eventually leads to an involuntary death.</p>
<p>Abrasion due to body contact with baking soda crystals wears and tears the bugs exoskeleton  exposing internal tissues and leading to death.
<strong>3. By Ingestion</strong>
The chemical reaction that occurs when a bed bug ingests baking soda makes its stomach swell, which causes death with time.</p>
<ul>
<li>At times, the bugs stomach may burst (due to excess gas pressure) or just die of suffocation instead.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzD_madhlCw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzD_madhlCw</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methods-of-baking-soda-application">Methods of Baking Soda Application</h3>
<p>The following are common baking soda application methods that you can use:
<strong>1. Pasting/Smearing</strong>
Items required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Baking soda</li>
<li>A mixing container</li>
<li>Toothbrush
Procedure:</li>
<li>Mix sufficient volume of baking soda with water to form a honey-like dense paste</li>
<li>Using a hand brush, smear the paste onto the mattresses, sofas, armchairs, or other bed bugs&rsquo; hideout</li>
<li>Further, use a toothbrush to precisely apply baking soda paste into cracks in your bed or furniture, walls, as well as holes that might be housing bed bugs</li>
<li>Wait for 2 days  effective paste action time</li>
<li>Then, vacuum all the areas where you smeared the paste  use a vacuum cleaner/machine</li>
<li>Inspect your items once more  see if there are bed bugs that were not killed</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps until the entire infestation is destroyed.
<strong>2. Sprinkling</strong>
Sprinkle raw baking powder on any suspicious bed bug-infested surface  it could be your clothes, bed, closets, sheets, or carpet. Crucially, the powder should form a sizable layer on all surfaces. Ensure that cracks are well covered with baking powder during application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, it is recommendable that you vacuum up items a day or two after sprinkling to suck out dead bed bugs and baking powder remains.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Piling/Laying pile</strong>
Piling kills crawling bed bugs by causing impediments along the way. Actually, the baking soda layer forces all bed bugs that want to access your bed to inadvertently climb or crawl over, thus leading to a death trap.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can pile baking soda on any other item that provides an option for a fine undulating gradient, which prevents downflow upon use  the surface should allow bed bugs to climb over without challenges.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-using-baking-soda">Advantages of using baking soda</h3>
<p>Advantages of using baking soda to exterminate bed bugs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>**No chemical intoxication - <strong>no dangerous chemicals involved</strong>.**Baking soda is a natural substance that has neither additives nor fillers</li>
<li>**Environmentally friendly - **no pollution or environmental hazards</li>
<li>**Safe for both humans and pets  **wont affect your pets, skin, or items upon contact</li>
<li><strong>Its affordable</strong>- meets the budget. Not expensive as compared to chemical spray alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-alternative-ways-of-killing-bed-bugs">What are Alternative Ways of Killing Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>In case you have a bed bug infestation in your home or office, consider using either of the following elimination methods:</p>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth">1. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth contains a toxic chemical formulation that kills bed bugs instantly upon contact. The rough nature of this compound will rip bed bugs fragile exoskeletons and dehydrate their cuticles, thus causing sudden death.</p>
<p>For the best outcome, sprinkle Diatomaceous Earth on bed bugs-infested areas overnight or for a couple of days before you clean off the lifeless bugs and denatured eggs.
<strong>Note:</strong>
Ensure Diatomaceous Earth is kept away from children and pets, as it can be toxic if ingested.</p>
<h3 id="2-high-heat-treatment">2. High Heat Treatment</h3>
<p>By washing bed bugs infested beddings and clothes in hot water (60 degrees Celsius) for about half an hour, you will actually kill and destroy adult bed bugs and hatched eggs altogether -
or other life stages
.</p>
<p>All you need is to ensure that infested clothes/items are completely soaked and fully immersed in the hot liquid so that the bed bugs cannot crawl out.</p>
<h3 id="3-bedbug-spray">3. Bedbug Spray</h3>
<p>Commercial bed bug sprays contain toxic chemical formulation that either kills bugs on contact or by suffocation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and pyrroles found in spray destroy bed bugs exoskeleton and weaken the immune system as well.
During application, spray infested clothes, items, sheets, or closets gently and leave them for two hours before vacuuming. You need to further wash the items in hot water in order to remove any toxic chemical remains sufficiently.
<strong>Note:</strong>
Some bugs may develop immunity (mutation) against sprays; therefore, its advisable to invite a professional exterminator to assess any prevalence. Alternatively, use
<strong>neonicotinoids</strong>
if you sense the bugs arent responding to the current spray brand.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-using-isopropyl-alcoholrubbing-alcohol">4. Using Isopropyl alcohol/Rubbing Alcohol</h3>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/">Isopropyl alcohol kills bed bugs</a>
within 30 minutes upon contact with help of cuticle destructive additives, which not only causes suffocation but also disintegrates the exoskeleton.</p>
<p>The best approach when using this method is by direct spraying the solvent into bed bugs hideouts and infested items. Then, leave them for 10-15 hours  killing action time</p>
<p>NB: When using Isopropyl alcohol, wear hand gloves  it has a burning sensation that may irritate your skin upon contact.</p>
<h3 id="5-hot-watersteaming">5. Hot Water/Steaming</h3>
<p>Steam (vapor) kills bed bugs instantly  the high temperature destroys the exoskeleton and denatures the hormonal system, which is a protein in nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, connect and adjust your steamer to optimal gauge and jet the nozzle over infested items. Common hiding spots for bed bugs like mattress folding, crevices, and cracks should also be well steamed.
Alternatively, you can lock your bed bugs-infested item in a tight-sealed room and run the steamer for one or two hours  this method may be a bit expensive, but very effective. The steaming method is also suitable for commercial places like hotels, university hostels, or guest houses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-methods-wont-kill-bed-bugs">Which Methods Wont Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>The methods highlighted below wont kill bed bugs whatsoever:</p>
<h3 id="1-placing-infested-items-outdoor">1. Placing Infested items Outdoor</h3>
<p>Removing bed bug-infested furniture from your house and placing them outside may seem like a good fix though the solar heat only drives bugs into their hideouts.</p>
<p>Usually, solar-heated bed bugs seem dead, which is just but a fake death  the bugs recover when the temperature subsides.</p>
<p>Moreover, bed bugs hiding in crevices and cracks may never be killed by this method whatsoever.</p>
<h3 id="2-hand-picking-bugs">2. Hand Picking Bugs</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are pretty tiny little creatures  hand-picking them may not be easy as per se.</p>
<p>Besides, bed bugs spend most of their time hiding and only discretely come out to feed (especially at night) on your blood meal, which makes it difficult to see them. In addition, bed bugs run very fast upon danger onset - this makes it more difficult to hand pick them.</p>
<h3 id="3-flushing-them-into-the-drain">3. Flushing them Into the Drain</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are
crawling insects
; when you flush them down the drain, they are likely to cling onto the inner pipe surfaces  later, they may crawl back into your house.</p>
<ul>
<li>On other hand, when the drainage dries out, the swept bed bugs recover and crawl back to your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-vacuuming-alone">4. Vacuuming Alone</h3>
<p>Vacuuming is not a standalone method of killing bed bugs because bed bugs hide well within areas that are difficult for the vacuum to reach unless you make use of a vacuum hose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, sucking live bed bugs with a vacuum would require you to seal the plastic bag or the container they are landing after being sucked, and then dispose of it appropriately.
Although vacuuming can greatly paralyze bed bugs, you may have to combine this method with other effective ones like steaming, sprays, or heat treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its advisable to place vacuumed bed bugs in a plastic bag and freeze them (guarantees that bed bugs are dead) before proper disposal.</p>
<h3 id="5-making-sharp-noise">5. Making Sharp Noise</h3>
<p>Making sharp noise or vibrations in your house may scare out rodents, but unfortunately, it wont kill bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="6-sweeping-bed-bugs">6. Sweeping Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>Some of the methods we have discussed above may involve sweeping the dead bed bugs; however, it should be known that sweeping live bed bugs do not lead to their death.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it may not be possible to sweep bed bugs from their hideouts, and even if you manage to sweep, some bugs may actually hide in the broom or brush that you are using for sweeping.
Instead of killing bed bugs, sweeping will actually transfer them into other sections in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-best-ways-of-preventing-bed-bug-infestation">What are the Best Ways of Preventing Bed Bug Infestation?</h2>
<p>Removing bed bugs from your home is often a lengthy and costly undertaking. Consider the following alternatives as a way of preventing bed bug infestation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect infested areas (upon treatment) on a weekly basis</li>
<li>Surround your bed with bed bug interceptors around its stand/legs. These devices will ensure bed bugs are trapped well before they crawl onto your bed. Keep on monitoring the interceptors for any bed bug activity for several months</li>
<li>Cover your mattress with a zippered cover and ensure it is fully zipped  bed bug proof</li>
<li>Seal any crack/crevice in the house with caulk to block bed bugs from hiding. Pay attention to cracks/openings around electric sockets and baseboards as well</li>
<li>Regularly wash beddings, curtains, and carpets. It is also recommendable to vacuum them from time to time  dirt is a key bed bug attractant or hideout</li>
<li>Do not leave magazines, newspapers, or clothing on the ground - ensure they are neatly kept in their appropriate places</li>
<li>When checking in hotel rooms, inspect them for bed bugs to avoid transferring bed bugs into your home</li>
<li>Call a professional bed bug exterminator (including using<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-peppermint-oil-kill-bed-bugs/">peppermint oil</a>) if you try out several bed bug extermination methods unsuccessfully</li>
<li>Avoid buying second-hand furniture or other household items where possible  inspect them thoroughly in case you opt to purchase one</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on the question does baking soda kill bed bugs, the direct answer is YES. If baking soda is used in the right measure and conditions, it can effectively kill adult bed bugs and their eggs as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, the sodium carbonate salt found in the chemical and structural composition of baking soda destroys the bed bugs exoskeleton upon contact. In addition, the compound causes instant dehydration, thus leading to death.</li>
<li>When ingested, baking causes bed bugs abdomen to swell (due to the generation of carbon dioxide), which ends up suffocating the insect to death. Indeed, the sharp crystalline nature of this powder compound can cut the bugs alimentally canal (abrasion), thereby killing it.
Please note, that the baking soda method of killing bed bugs may be time-consuming and relatively less efficient, especially when a little amount is used.</li>

<p>According to Michigan&rsquo;s research, Hsp33 (a protein) tends to react with bleach and thus killed the bacteria under test.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, a similar reaction with bleach would alsokill bed bugs/).
Bleach (with chlorine as its active ingredient) is a chemical compound used in most homes to color-lighten and whiten fabrics and clothes.
As noted above, the chemical application is mainly as a disinfectant or cleaner. It&rsquo;s primarily loved for its remarkable ability to kill various algae, mildews, and bacteria.</li>
<li>Its primary function - bleaching- happens through chlorine-initiated reduction or oxidation.</li>
<li>Chemically, scientists say that Chlorine breaks down chromophore, making the compound non-reactive to all visible light.
Also, bleach can will disinfectant against various microbes through denaturing the bacterial proteins and hence rendering them harmless when they clump together - the same way you cannot uncook a boiled or fried egg.</li>

<li>Below, I&rsquo;ve outlined the reasons why you should avoid bleach as abed bug controlsolution.
Always ensure you carefully read the product label instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-requires-direct-contact-with-bed-bugs">1. Requires direct contact with bed bugs</h3>
<p>Bleach will only kill bed bugs through direct contact and be less effective for the bugs that are still in some of their odd
hiding places
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bleach cannot poisonbed bugsthat fall near it.</li>
<li>Therefore, the homeowner would require tospray the chemical directly on the bed bugbody  if not, youll have missed the train.
Therefore, if the bed bugs will be hiding in fabrics and clothes, you might unintentionally damage them.</li>
</ul>

, adult human beings, and kids. But how? If your kids or dogs/ cars accidentally ingest the bleaching liquid, they might get poisoned.
When used in combination with HCl, bleach may result in several conditions such as acute lung injury (ALI), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or death.</p>
<ul>
<li>This may come in the form of chloramine or chlorine dioxide.
Also, bleach may react with human skin leading to chemical burns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-bed-bugs-pheromones-sense-bleach-from-far">3. bed bug&rsquo;s pheromones sense bleach from far</h3>
<p>These
<em>C. hemipterus</em>
bugs use their pheromones to determine the type and concentration of chemicals or poisons in their environment and thus can escape if you&rsquo;ve sprayed any bleach.
Therefore, after detecting some bleach in their environment, they&rsquo;ll run into hiding cabinets, dresses, cracks, and crevices.
C. hemipterus were previously considered odorless, but various chemical compounds can signal to them and are described like
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068171/">alarm pheromones</a>

<ul>
<li>Luckily, this heat treatment method even kills insecticide-resistant bed bugs.</li>
<li>Heat treatment for bed bugs is Eco-friendly, produces no toxic gases, and will leave no residual like the bleach method we discussed above.
Equally, with this method, you&rsquo;d not mainly require to undertake follow-up treatments as the technique will

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does <a href="/posts/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">boric</a> acid kill bed bugs? Boric acid is one of the most famous pest killer in the market. It has various home applications. Some people use it to kill bed bugs.
<strong>But does boric acid kill bed bugs? The answer to this question is NO! However, Boric acid can kill bed bugs, but only when eaten/inhaled or injected into them.�</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, bed bugs feed on blood and unless boric acid is mixed with blood, from which they feed and get it into their body; then it may never kill them.</strong>
So, lets start.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-boric-acid">What is Boric acid?</h2>
<p>This is a salt chemical known as sodium borate, which is mixed with sugary baits and used to kill various insect. It is manufactured in different forms like powder (borax), gel or liquid.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-does-boric-acid-kill-bed-bugs">So, how does Boric acid kill bed bugs?</h2>
<p>Boric acid, when mixed with other pest killers or any powder or liquid substances may kill the bed bug once eaten.</p>
<p>Boric acid is manufactured with ability to dehydrate or suffocate the bed bugs thus killing them.</p>
<p>Borax is a common form of boric acid and is mostly used by people. This is easier to apply or mix with bait that may attract bed bug feed on it.</p>
<p>Steps to follow when using boric acid to kill bed bugs in your mattress or carpet.</p>
<p>Just in case you want to use boring acid to kill bed bugs in your house, then the most suitable form is Borax (powder Boric acid).</p>
<p>These steps will help destroy bed bugs eggs from mattresses and carpets. You can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the mattress covers.</li>
<li>Take borax and sprinkle it over the bed to create a thick layer.</li>
<li>Spray boiling water over the borax so as to create a foam that will suffocate the bed bugs.</li>
<li>Allow the borax to penetrate the mattress and dry.</li>
<li>Vacuum the dry borax.
This method works with the principle that once the bed bugs inhale the boric acid foam, they will suffocate and die.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other bed bugs that will not be dead will be trapped in the wet borax, where they will be dehydrated. Later, the dry borax will then be vacuumed out.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this method is suitable to kill large population of bed bug when together. You will even be forced to wash out your mattress after destroying bed bugs.</p>
<p>In addition, this method may kill very little number of bed bugs since most bed bugs hide deep in the mattress and the suffocating foam may not reach them.</p>
<p>Why waste money and energy doing all that when there are other easier options!</p>
<p>Why does boric acid becomes ineffective when it is being used for killing bed bugs?</p>
<p>We clearly know that bed bugs feed on blood. They do not eat boric acid. If you want to make them eat boric acid, then you must mixed it with blood, else they will not eat. This is null as you cant offer flesh blood for this purpose.</p>
<p>The other option of killing bed bugs is injecting boric acid into their body. You agree with me that this is impossible in the real situation. Therefore, these options of killing bed bugs offer you a very inefficient way of destroying their breeding sites.</p>
<p>The famous form of boric acid (borax), which is in powder form, is well known in market for its efficiency in killing home insects like cockroaches and ants. Do not be lied that when this powder is poured over bed bugs will kill them. No! It wont.</p>
<p>In fact, in a study published in September, 2018 in the Journal of Economic Entomology, Schal and his team reported that boric acid dust has least effect on the bed bugs. Actually, the data from the report showed that none of the bed bug died out of the exposure to boric power.</p>
<p>This information, definitely tells you that the two options available as a way of killing bed bugs, may not be feasibly appropriate for your current need. Therefore, it is clear that boric acid will not kill bed bugs once sprinkled in their breeding sites directly.</p>
<h2 id="then-what-do-we-do-instead">Then, What do we do instead?</h2>
<p>You will have to look for alternative means of getting rid of bed bug infestation in your house.</p>
<p>Before that, I will recommend you to look for an examinator, who will assist check on your current situation as you may even find it were other insects like flea instead.</p>
<p>Also, read properly our bed bug removal guide to acquire insight. To eradicate bed bugs in your house/home, you can use the options given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can set bed bug traps.</li>
<li>Ensure you remove mattress cover to expose them.</li>
<li>You can use other chemicals/sprays that destroy bed bugs.</li>
<li>You can throw away the items that are having bed bugs.</li>
<li>Room heat treatment kills bed bug completely though it is much more expensive, but environmentally friendly.
It may not seem a nice advice, however it is worth rather that investing in boric acid that may not help, instead make you waste your resources/money.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-eggs-be-killed-by-boric-acid">Can bed bugs eggs be killed by boric acid?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs eggs are the most complicated stage of bed bug eradication. Direct applications of boric acid over the breeding sites of the bed bugs will not kill their eggs.</p>
<p>Again, locating their breeding sites may be difficult and thus making the whole process challenging.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you can mix boric acid with your washing powder and wash items infested with bed bugs. Use very hot water-of course, this needs a washing machine.</p>
<p>This will destroy the eggs and kill the living bed bugs. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put powder form of boric acid (borax) into a washing machine.</li>
<li>Put clothes infested with bed bugs.</li>
<li>Add boiling water.</li>
<li>Add powder-washing soap.</li>
<li>Run the machine,</li>
<li>Remove the clothes and hung after rinsing.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="which-other-ways-can-i-use-boric-acid-in-my-househome">Which other ways can I use boric acid in my house/home?</h2>
<p>Boric acid is one of most important substance in home use. It is commonly used in laundry activities. It is used as a cleanser, disinfectant, stain-remover, deodorizer as well as mould-killer.</p>
<p>More importantly, it removes stains and odor from your clothes.
If mixed with honey or other sugary baits, it can be used to kill home insects like cockroaches and ants.</p>
<p>Boric acid is an anti-fungal, natural antiseptic agent, and astringent which when mixed with water can be used to treat rushes, minor burns or wounds.</p>
<h2 id="can-boric-acid-kill-other-insects">Can boric acid kill other insects?</h2>
<p>Yes, it can. Indeed, when boric acid is mixed with honey or other sugary substances, it can be used to kill insects like ants and cockroaches in your place.</p>
<p>You will need to put the mixture of boric acid in a basin and place it in an appropriate location in your house or home where these insect are or pass.</p>
<p>Once they eat the mixture, they will die in a couple of seconds. The liquid form of boric acid is the best as it makes your mixing with other liquid easier.</p>
<h2 id="can-boric-acid-make-you-sick">Can boric acid make you sick?</h2>
<p>Boric acid does not cause any irritation to skin when touched by hands. It is necessary to wash your hand once you use.</p>
<p>In case you rub your eyes with hands having boric acid, you will feel a basic sensation for a short time since boric acid is a salt compound.</p>
<p>It cant harm your eyes, as you will even realize that the eye contact lens is made up of a portion of boric acid.�Boric acid when swallowed may cause diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting and nausea.</p>
<p>It may not be extreme, however it is important to seek doctors checkup if symptoms persist.�Boric acid is dangerous to human when inhaled.</p>
<p>It has a sharp irritation to the breathing/respiratory system, which makes you uncomfortable- it may be accompanied by coughing (though rare).</p>
<p>This will persist for a few minutes, then stops. You may not need to see the doctor unless the symptoms persist.</p>
<h2 id="which-precautions-do-you-take-when-using-boric-acid">Which precautions do you take when using boric acid?</h2>
<p>Boric acid is harmful to pets and humans when swallowed. It should be kept away from children. Cover your nose with breathing mask while using boric acid to prevent respiratory irritations.</p>
<p>Wear hand protections like PVC gloves when using boric acid and wash your hands after to reduce chances of touching your eyes or licking your finger thus swallowing it.</p>
<p>In case symptoms persist, kindly seek medication as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Boric acid can kill bed bugs only when eaten/inhaled or injected into their bodies.</p>
<p>It is not efficient enough to be used for killing bed bugs as compared to other available options. I recommend that you should opt for other ways I have suggested above.</p>
<p>Boric acid can kill cockroaches and ants when mixed with sugary bait. It may not kill you, however if symptoms persist, seek medication as soon as possible.</p>

      <description>Diatomaceous earth</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/degen.html">Diatomaceous earth</a>
, commonly known as D. E, is a naturally occurring off-white soft, silicon-based sedimentary rock.�It is composed of fossilized marine-based algae called planktons.
Under a microscope, it looks like shards of glass (silica is used to make glass). But does diatomaceous earth
kill bed bugs (or even with vinegar)/)
?
<em>A simple answer is, YES, diatomaceous earth will kill bed bugs. The D.E particles stick to the insect&rsquo;s exoskeleton it punctures the carapace, thus, leaving the insect susceptible to dehydration.�</em>
<em>Also, when the insect inhales the powder, it cuts through the respiratory system and causes drying of the mucous membrane of breathing passages in the bug, thus, killing them. Related: Pictures of Bed Bugs.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-bed-bugs">Details: Does Diatomaceous Earth Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>But it only gets worse when you get to realize that, like cockroaches,
bed bugs are extremely hardy and difficult to kill
off. Due to their adaptability, they are can easily mutate to gain resistance to normal spray pesticides.
So, to understand how effective the D.E can be to
bed bugs invading your couch
and bed, lets first look, briefly, at how D.E works when put on an insect.
When an insect comes to contact with the D.E powder, two things happen, both of which are lethal to the insect;
Bed bugs, like any other insect
, have the exoskeleton that protects them.
When they roam over the powder, which should be kept dry always, its punctures or otherwise scrape away part of the exoskeleton and, therefore, dehydrate them.
However, studies have shown that while D.E can be
effective in killing bugs
, there usually needs to be a very high concentration of it to be effective, which means that the mist sprays here might not be effective. You will need to use a very high concentration of D.E.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-about-the-bed-bug-eggs">But What about the Bed Bug Eggs</h2>
<p>Short answer - no. Now, to the long answer. But, here&rsquo;s
how to kill bed bug eggs
.�Bed bugs are
extremely sketchy and evasive
and will most likely remain hidden from your sight most times unless there is an invasion that forces them to find alternative hiding spots.
This is also true of their eggs. Like other bugs such as cockroaches,
bed bugs lay their eggs
in secluded, far to reach corners of your house like under the carpet, behind photos and wallpapers or behind light-bulb switches or in furniture, say under the couches, within the threading of the couch and many other hidden places.
This then means that the D.E will be unlikely to work because the egg, unlike the bug itself, is not moving anywhere, thus will most likely not come into contact with the powder.
And the
bed bug eggs
are very hardy, just like the bugs themselves, which means then that in the event you manage to get the powder to them, it still may not be enough to neutralize the egg.
However, not to despair. Since the D.E has an indefinite shelf life and thus will remain effective for long (if kept completely dry), this means that even if you dont manage to
kill the eggs
, once they hatch, the D.E will then be able to work on them as they crawl over it.
An important part of this process then is how you will apply it. After identifying areas likely to contain the bedbug eggs, spread the D.E mist all over the area.
This will help minimize the spread of the infestation in other areas, meaning that the bugs will be closed into the spot until they are grown enough to be affected by the D.E.</p>
<h2 id="do-diatomaceous-earth-kill-bed-bug-nymphs">Do Diatomaceous Earth Kill Bed Bug Nymphs?</h2>
<p>Again, the answer is no. D.E is only effective on adult bedbugs. Bedbugs nymphs (
baby bed bugs
), once hatched, often go through several molting stages before attaining sexual maturity, which could take up to five weeks.
To go through the cycle, these nymphs will require periodic blood meals, which explains the bites keeping you awake at night, or perhaps the bites that come from beneath your shirt when you are going about your business.
But, back to the nymphs. When a nymph gets a treat for its bloody meal, it then sheds its old cuticle and develops a new one.
Thus, if the nymph crawls over the area powdered with D.E and then gets to feeds soon after, they will be able to shed the infected cuticle and grow a new one that will then provide them insulation against water loss, meaning that they will no longer be at risk to succumbing to dehydration.
Taking blood meals periodically is also a way of replenishing water loss; thus, if a nymph bites you soon after rolling over the D.E trap, you set for it.
It will effectively be killing two birds with one bite -
replenishing its water
content, as well as building a new cuticle that will replace the old one, ensuring that the bugger remains alive to continue the family cycle of pest terror.
An experiment was done by the University of Kentucky researchers and pest professionals put D.E to the test under real-world conditions.
The group chose six infested apartments for the experiment, with each apartment checked thoroughly for the number of bedbugs (both adult and nymphs) found on beds, furniture, and other places in the building.
Short story, the
reduction recorded showed that there was only a 1 percent reduction in the bed bug
population on average, with the biggest percentage experienced in the house in which the researchers had put the highest amount of the powder.
The nymphs seemed responsible for continuing this cycle, too, as they often remained unharmed due to their ability to shed off their cuticle during the molting stages of their growth, ensuring that the D.E never got to work on them.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-de-to-kill-a-bed-bug">How long does it Take D.E To Kill a Bed Bug?</h2>
<p>Previous experiments placed the number of bedbugs killed between four days to ten days, with the length of the period
dependent on the
bed bugs strain.
So, What Does This Mean? As a stand-alone
bed bug pesticide
, D.E remains largely ineffective, and thus, in the event of an infestation, you will be less likely to contain the
spread of the bugs
using D.E.
Let&rsquo;s not even begin on the event that if you live in an apartment complex, D.E will unlikely help you if your neighbors aren&rsquo;t in on the item.
If indeed you want to keep using the D.E
powder for your bed bug extermination
exercise, perhaps you should consider a few things, most of which will need professional help, or at least, above-basic application of the powder.</p>
<h3 id="high-applications-necessary-for-bed-bugs"><em>High Applications Necessary for Bed Bugs</em></h3>
<p>The above experiment found that while D.E was effective
against other bugs, it performed rather poorly against the bed bugs
, but save for the one house in which they put a lot of the powder.
Therefore, for the D.E to be effective, you will need to have quite a large portion of the powder.</p>
<h3 id="proper-application-of-the-powder"><em>Proper Application of the Powder</em></h3>
<p>During the experiment, the researchers from the University of Kentucky dusted D.E thoroughly on all crevices, on seams, folds, and edges using professional dusters, most of which many homes don&rsquo;t have access to.
So, for better results, proper applications are not just a requirement, but a necessity, with proper dusting that would allow for the particles of the powder to stick to the surface to avoid drifting properly - where the powder gets blown away by either the vacuum cleaner or any slight draught in the house.
Therefore, to increase the D.E working chances, one will need to put the material where the bugs are and where they frequent, a fact that maybe you do not follow through thoroughly.
For example, one needs not just put the
powder on the edges of the carpet
or the edges of the couch on the drawer&rsquo;s frames.
One will need to turn over the couches and apply the dust beneath the upholstery, disassemble bed or any other furniture with a build that allows for many gaps or, in the event of a major infestation, throw away the entire furniture and maybe even the house.</p>
<h2 id="dont-use-de-as-a-stand-alone-bed-bug-treatment">Dont Use D.E as A Stand-alone Bed Bug Treatment.</h2>
<p>As we have seen above,
diatomaceous earth
powder requires very many specific conditions to be effective.
Even then, their effectiveness is minimal. Therefore, to properly
rid your house of bed bugs
, integrate it with other bed bug extermination methods such as;</p>
<h3 id="1-heat-treatment">1. Heat treatment</h3>
<p>This might involve washing and drying your clothes, bedding, shoes, pillows, curtains, and other upholstery items at high temperature for about 20 minutes.
Alternatively, for materials such as carpets, couches, sofas, and bed frames, you recommend using high powered steam cleaners, which can hit the high temperatures necessary to kill.
When you do this, be slow and thorough, giving enough time to each area for the heat to properly catch on and kill the bugs.</p>
<h3 id="2-vacuum-thoroughly">2. Vacuum Thoroughly</h3>
<p>Vacuuming
will help lift the bed bugs, along with their eggs, of the floor. Check the
best bed bug steamers
.
Once you are done with this, empty the bag outside your home or create a small fire in which you dump the insects and watch them burn with glee.</p>
<h3 id="3-sun-heat-treatment">3. Sun Heat Treatment</h3>
<p>If you are unable to buy any of the expensive toys, dont worry. The good old sun is
still a reliable
bed bug killeras long as it shines in the right temperatures.
You can use this on items that cant be washed, such as some types of carpets, bed covers inside duvets. Also, check
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-dryer-kill-bed-bugs/">how the dryer kills bed bugs</a>
.
Seal them in a black plastic bag (absorbs suns heat faster and retains it) and put them out in the sun, and let them sit for several hours in a day.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-approved-pesticides">4. Use Approved pesticides</h3>
<p>The bed bug is resistant to many known pesticides, and thus,
your normal insecticide
will not do the trick. This is mostly because they arent concentrated enough to
penetrate the bed bugs
tough cuticle so as it has the desired effect.
Compounds such as silica gels can work well. You will most likely come across these gels severally when you buy electronics or clothing items as they are used to prevent the accumulation of moisture on electronic items during shipping and/or storage.
These gels contain high concentrations of silicon dioxide, which is highly absorbent and, thus, will absorb the insect&rsquo;s cuticle waxes faster than D.E.
Also, unlike D.E, these silica gels can work one time, needing a bug to crawl over the dusted surface just once for it to be effective, and because it is
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-salt-kill-bed-bugs/">highly absorbent, it will kill</a>
the bug in a far shorter time than the D.E.</p>
<h3 id="5-use-91-rubbing-alcohol">5. Use 91% Rubbing Alcohol</h3>
<p>This one comes with a disclaimer. Alcohol works as a solvent, eating away the bug&rsquo;s outer shell, thus, exposing them to dehydration, like silica gels.
But then, it goes further and dries the insides of the bug, finish off the buggers in a satisfying overkill. Use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/">91% Rubbing Alcohol to kill bed bugs</a>
.
The disclaimer is that alcohol only kills on contact and, therefore, may not be effective in the event of an infestation, where there could be countless eggs.
It is also a fire hazard as Isopropyl alcohol is highly flammable. Its lingering vapor is also highly flammable.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, as we have seen,
Diatomaceous Earth can be an effective
bug control in general, but you will need to back it up with several other treatments when it comes to bugs.
D.E will also not work effectively if you have an infestation, as it doesn&rsquo;t harm the eggs nor nymphs, thus, limiting its potency.
Similarly, proper application is also a requirement, which will need you to possibly disassemble the furniture and dust it in the far to reach corners of the homes or items and using specialized equipment.
Even then, as the stated experiment has shown, it is only just effective.�Therefore, D.E will not
rid you of your bed bugs
on its own. Back it up with other methods for excellent results.
All the best, and no more bites!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>But, do dryers kill bed bugs? YES, the simple answer is that the high temperature in dryers (between 39o�C to 51o C) will kill bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs  especially when the exposure is for over 30 minutes.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Kill Bed Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Lets get into the details.�Related:

<h2 id="does-dryer-kill-bed-bugs-keenly-laundering-items">Does Dryer Kill Bed Bugs? Keenly Laundering Items</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are
caused�by different factors
, such as purchasing second-hand furniture. Bed bugs
can bite through clothing
.
To kill bed bugs, youll need to set your
<a href="https://www.bedbugs.umn.edu/bed-bug-control-in-residences/laundering">dryer temperature between 39oC to 51oC</a>
. However, below are the
steps to take in the drying process
.
**1. Sorting **</p>
<ul>
<li>Select bed bug-infested clothes according to:
<strong>2. Fabrics</strong>
Cotton, wool, linen, nylon synthetic, etc.
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th><strong>3. Fabric dying temperature range</strong></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Cotton 150  160 C</li>
<li>Wool 30  40 C</li>
<li>Synthetic 140  150 C</li>
<li>Silk 110  120 C
**4. Vacuum **
Next, vacuum your bed bug-infested clothes. However, attach a crevice tool on your vacuum machine to suck or capture the visible
bed bugs and their eggs
on the fabric or in crevices and cracks.
This
prevents the crawling of bed bugs
from finding their way into the washing machine&rsquo;s compartment or dryer before it is turned on.
<strong>5. Loading -</strong>
Feed one type of fabric directly into the dryer at a time- this is done if you do not need to wash your clothes first. NB: Consider fabrics drying temperature guide.
<strong>6. Dryer Operation</strong></li>
<li>Set the dryer&rsquo;s temperature at medium, i.e., 100 Fahrenheit- this is necessary to ensure gradual heating of bed bug-infested clothes.</li>
<li>Please turn on the dryer and allow it to run for the first 10 minutes at the set temperature.</li>
<li>**Change **the temperature to optimal (any temperature between 120 to 135 Fahrenheit) and leave it to run for another 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Please switch off the dryer and allow it to cool for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>**Unloading and storing **- Once the dryer has cooled, remove the clothes and store them in a laundry basket separately and away from other bed bug-infested clothes.
Then, repeat the procedure for other fabrics.
<strong>NB:</strong>
<em>It is necessary to hang the clothes or use a blower immediately you remove them from the dryer - this helps in aeration and removal of dead bed bugs from clothes.�</em>

<h2 id="how-long-do-bed-bugs-take-to-die-while-in-a-dryer"><strong>How long do bed bugs take to die while in a dryer?</strong></h2>
<p>At an optimal temperature of around 120 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit, a
bed bug will take
2 minutes to die in a dry cloth. A colony of
bed bugs may take 5 to 10 minutes
due to clouding acting as an insulator.</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the type of fabric you are drying, the temperature may take time to penetrate every corner of the clothesbefore killing bed bugs.
Feeding moist or wet clothes in the dryer will take you 40 or more minutes to kill all the bed bugs as water from clothes must be dried before killing bed bugs commences.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-temperature-kill-bed-bugs-and-their-eggs-instantly"><strong>Which temperature kill bed bugs and their eggs instantly?�</strong></h2>
<p>Adult bedbugs and their eggs wont die at the same time. The
eggs are killed
at any temperature between 108 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit.
However, the
bed bug dies
instantly if exposed to any instant temperature around 123 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit.
Bed bug killing
temperature may vary from place to place due to the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weather change</strong> Humid temperature alters room temperatures, thus compelling you to adjust the dryer.</li>
<li><strong>Altitude</strong> When operating a dryer at a high altitude, you will need to use a higher temperature input than those in low altitude areas.</li>
<li><strong>Climatic conditions</strong> Hot desert climate need low dryer working temperature to enable it to reach optimal heating. In contrast, a cold rainy climate will call for a higher working temperature.

<h2 id="can-a-dryer-kill-germs">Can a dryer kill germs?</h2>
<p>Absolutely! We know that bacteria cause most of the germs. At a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, most bacteria will be dead.
Your clothes from the dryer will be free from germs as there are no bacteria that can survive beyond a temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h2 id="can-a-hairdryer-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Can a hairdryer kill bed bugs?�</strong></h2>
<p>The answer is simple: YES. Hairdryer generates heat, which can be directed to
kill bed bugs - you can also use
ammonia.</p>
<p>You will only need to concentrate the heat from the hairdryer at a point
infested with bed bugs
for a longer time - this may be tedious.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, most hair dryers have a low power rating and are also regulated by a thermal start.
This limits them from producing enough heat that is required to kill bed bugs instantly.

Where Do Bed Bugs Hide?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-might-the-dryer-fail-to-all-the-kill-bugs">When might the dryer fail to all the Kill Bugs?</h2>
<p>Below are some reasons why your dry might fail to
kill all the bed bugs
in your clothes  either cotton, linen, or wool.
**1. Loss of heat in the inner chamber of the dryer **</p>
<ul>
<li>The inner section of the dryer may be having leakage, which causes loss of heat as opposed to radiating it within the chamber.
Also, the shiny radiant surface of the inner chamber (drum) may be worn out, thus reducing its heat radiation efficiency  this may require replacement.
**2. Too much feed **
Overloading your dryer with
bed bug-infested clothes
may reduce the efficiency of bed bug extermination.
This is due to incomplete healing of clothes in the dryer, leaving some sections as escape/hideouts of these bloodsuckers.
**3. Using a low-power rated dryer **</li>
<li>A low-rated dryer does not generate enough heat,
which can kill bed bugs
.
You will need to check the maximum temperature that your dryer can achieve while in operation before
selecting it for bed bug
killing-
<strong>any temperature rating of fewer than 100 degrees Fahrenheit wont work for you.�</strong>
You should also not select a very high-rated dryer as it may destroy clothes fabrics during the drying process.
**4. Faulty heating element  **
Often, the dryers heating element may malfunction due to any of these causes:</li>
<li>Get spoilt due to continued use for a long time.</li>
<li>Wrong connections.</li>
<li>Short-circuiting.</li>
<li>Power fails to cause the dryers element to blow off.</li>
<li>Being clogged by scam or scale from clothes moisture.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure you consult an electrical specialist for such a check-up lest you destroy the dryer.</strong>
**5. Mechanical failure **
Signs that shows the mechanical failure of a dryer includes:</li>
<li>Abnormal sound from the dryer when in operation or when stopping.</li>
<li>Incomplete air circulation from the blower.</li>
<li>Difficulties when closing or turning the drum.</li>
<li>Motor coupling failure.</li>
<li>Instant stopping while in the operation of long stopping time than expected.
<strong>6. Less operation time  The drying</strong>
process requires 30 to 45 minutes for the
efficient killing of bed bugs
. This time may vary slightly upwards.
<strong>Any duration of fewer than 30 minutes wont completely kill bed bugs.�</strong>
**7. Climate/weather change **
Change in weather within your locality alters a working dryer&rsquo;s room temperature.</li>
<li>For colder areas, use high-temperature feed, while in the hot region, set the dryer at lower temperatures.
Example  Texas 160 degrees Fahrenheit, Brazil 120 degrees Fahrenheit, etc.
High altitude regions demand more temperature due to atmospheric pressure compared to low altitude areas.
NB:
<strong>Before purchasing a dryer, consider your geographical location.�</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-the-washing-machine-kill-bed-bugs-like-a-dryer">Will the Washing Machine kill Bed Bugs like a Dryer?</h2>
<p>Yes! Washing machines generate no heat during their cycles operation. Bed bugs
are not affected by these cycles
.</p>
<ul>
<li>As long as the detergents used in the washing machine cant kill bed bugs, all the bed bug-infested clothes will come out with bed bugs after cleaning though somebed bugs soaked in washing waterget drained away.</li>
<li>Bed bugscrawl and hide in the compartmentsof the washing machines during waiting time.
Frequent repair and maintenance of the washing machine are necessary to assess if there are some breeding grounds or hideouts of these bloodsuckers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-dry-cleaning-chemical-detergent-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Can dry Cleaning chemical/ detergent kill bed bugs?�</strong></h2>
<h2 id="which-makes-them-fatten-and-easily-float"><strong>NO!</strong>
Chemicals mostly used in detergents (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-lysol-kill-bed-bugs/">apart from Lysol</a>
) do not kill bed bugs. Soapy water wont kill
bed bugs too
.
However, bed bugs suck foam from soapy water,
which makes them fatten and easily float</h2>
<p><em>a condition that they recover from after water is drained</em>
.
However, for high
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-vinegar-kill-bed-bugs/">efficiency in killing bed bugs</a>
, dry the infested clothes at about 123 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-pack-bed-bugs-infested-clothes-for-dry-cleaning"><strong>How do you pack bed bugs-infested clothes for dry cleaning?</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bugs infested clothes
, when kept together with other clothes will transfer these bloodsuckers to them.
To ensure safe packaging for dry-cleaning purposes, follow the guides below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep the
bed bugs-infested
clothes separate from others.</li>
<li>Sort the clothes according to their fabrics, i.e., cotton, linen, wool, synthetic, etc.</li>
<li>Put each bail in a separate laundry basket and ensure you seal completely
<em>- it should be airtight to accelerate the suffocation of bed bugs and prevent any of them from crawling out</em>
.</li>
<li>Bed bugs-infested clothes should be stored away from the other clothes in a laundry room or your house.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-much-do-you-need-to-acquire-a-dry-cleaning-machine"><strong>How much do you need to acquire a dry cleaning machine?</strong></h2>
<p>The cost of a dry cleaning machine varies. Factors like: govern cost variations</p>
<ol>
<li>Amount of load (clothes) that a dryer shall carry while in operation.</li>
<li>The control mechanism used by the dry cleaner - whether electrical, mechanical, or automatic.</li>
<li>Dryer Assembly - whether the washing and drying compartments are housed together or separately.</li>
<li>The power rating of the machine.
For commercial purposes, you will need a highly rated dry cleaner and of large load capacity. This will cost may cost you about 2000 dollars or more.
In case you need a dry cleaner for home use, 500 dollars or less is enough to purchase one from local vendors.
NB:
<em>Dry cleaners fail at times. Therefore, you need to connect with the right electrician for maintenance and frequent dryer checkups  factor this in your budget.�</em>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am sitting here in my rented property - and I am at a loss of what to do that&rsquo;ll clear this bed bug infestation. I moved into the house eight months ago! But, my son and I have had a nightmare with
bed bugs bites</p>
<ul>
<li>these red irritated and itchy bumps.
<em>There are many exaggerated claims out there on lavender and other essential oils for household &amp; medicinal uses. But,�does lavender Kill Bed Bugs (check pictures)?�</em>
<em>The simple answer is, No, Lavender won&rsquo;t kill bed bugs - but the bugs don&rsquo;t like its smell. So, mixing lavender oil with rubbing alcohol (91% proof) will repel or deter the bloodsuckers.�</em>
<em>Lavender won&rsquo;t be an excellent long term treatment but will keep the bites to a minimum!!! Side Note: Also, bed bugs hate cedar oil, bleach, vinegar, and tea tree.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="does-lavender-kill-bed-bugs-diy-bed-bug-removal">Does Lavender Kill Bed Bugs? DIY Bed Bug Removal</h2>
<p>No major scientific research points to the effectiveness of lavender in killing bed bugs. This
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-abstract/111/1/170/4662900?redirectedFrom=fulltext">entomology case study</a>
points out that essential oils, including lavender, aren&rsquo;t as effective as
bed bug sprays
.
This doesn&rsquo;t mean that all essential oils won&rsquo;t kill bed bugs. A
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/5/4/849">recent Rutgers University study</a>
reported an insecticide made from cedar and geranium oil kill bed bug in a quarter of the treated houses.
What about real lavender? Real lavender will repel bed bugs but won&rsquo;t be as effective as a lavender spray. Lavender is proven to poison pets and animals, causing vomiting and nausea.
However, bed bugs will wittingly move around the real lavender, and thus they won&rsquo;t get to ingest it - remember, bed bugs are only about 1/4 inch in body size.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwTzacUJugk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwTzacUJugk</a></p>
<h2 id="how-doeslavender-repel-bed-bugs">How DoesLavender Repel Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>However, for lavender,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/)/">bed bugs</a>
will mainly react to its harsh smell instead of being toxic to their bodies. Naturally,
bed bugs
will escape from any unique smell - as a defense mechanism.
For example, these bloodsuckers will escape when they small a new body scent, pesticides, or desiccant dust. Thus, lavender would only be useful if you spray all the house areas - this is impossible.
But is it just the smell? Well, no, Lavender can be toxic to the
bed bug&rsquo;s skin
and body. However,
bed bugs would need
to ingest the Lavender oil for the poison to work.
Bed bugs
will escape before they get to ingest Lavender - they&rsquo;ll hide and re-emerge as a more massive colony. Lavender will poison your kids, pets, and even adult humans.
Also, applying Lavender on your skin may cause hives, rashes, or other severe skin reactions for both humans and your lovely pets - so avoid any direct skin contact.</p>
<h2 id="willlavender-scented-candles-kill-bed-bugs">WillLavender Scented Candles Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>The lavender-scented candles will generate the scent that&rsquo;s hatred by bed bugs. But, can this lavender smell from candles kill bed bugs? Will it get into crevices and cracks.
Sadly, just like the regular lavender, the smell from candles won&rsquo;t kill these bloodsuckers. Also, the scent won&rsquo;t distribute into the whole house to entirely repel the bugs.
The Smell from the candles is low concentrated compared to essential oils. Hence, it won&rsquo;t repel bed bugs entirely or cause allergy on humans - even when inhaled.
Sadly, the small lavender reaches into the crevices and cracks, or the mattress folds and electrical outlets - which are the deep areas bed bugs hide.</p>
<h2 id="does-lavender-powder-kill-bed-bugs">Does Lavender Powder Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Next, we consider lavender powder -, this is a powder of the real lavender powered that&rsquo;s dried and then pounded. It is also available commercially in different stores.
However, like the candles, the lavender powder will repel the bloodsuckers but will not kill
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-bed-bugs/">bed bugs like diatomaceous earth</a></p>
<ul>
<li>DE will suck the insect&rsquo;s body fluids.
Therefore, despite being highly concentrated, the lavender powder won&rsquo;t kill bed bugs because they won&rsquo;t get to ingest it. However, the lavender powder would work for longer in repelling bed bugs since it&rsquo;ll stick on different surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="does-lavender-dryer-sheets-kill-bed-bugs">Does Lavender Dryer Sheets Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Lavender dryer sheets wont work to
kill bed bugs
! Sadly so, but thats the fact, just like it is with lavender sprays or powders. However, lavender dryer sheets will only repel the bed bugs.
In short, the dryer sheets are only sheets passed through a dryer and have a pleasant scent of your fabrics or clothes. But, this wont kill the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-get-in-your-hair/">bloodsucking bed bugs</a>
.
Interestingly, these Lavender producers might not also be using the real Lavender  explains why the products will only repel the bed bugs and not kill them. Practically, youll not cover all the surfaces of your house.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">on different surfaces</a>

But, does Lysol kill bed bugs, including their eggs?
So, in summary, does Lysol make for an effective pesticide for bed bugs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lysol will only kill bed bugs when your spray it on the bugs directly - drowning the bed bugs. Lysol is mainly a cleaning agent.</li>
<li>So, Lysol is unlikely to kill bed bugs (contrast this toBleach/)), but an exterminator can provide a more thorough and effective solution such as heat treatment.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bug Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kills-bed-bugs">What Kills Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Before we tackle the Lysol�question, people typically use a number of chemicals when they&rsquo;re looking for a
pesticide to kill bed bugs
.
To kill bed bugs fast, I recommend you use any one of the following: heat (
steamers
) or pesticides.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lysol will only</strong>**�****kill bed bugs if you spray and drown them directly with it. But ****bed bugs will ****escape contact with **<strong>humans by hiding and thus spraying is challenging.�</strong></li>
<li>**Since ****Lysol is **<strong>not an effective bed bug pesticide, I recommend using pyrethrin pesticides of your contact an exterminator to start a more robust pest removal program.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="primary-pesticide-ingredients-">**Primary ****Pesticide ****ingredients? **</h3>
<p>Most bed bug pesticides are
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/pesticides-control-bed-bugs">made of desiccants, pyrethroids, and pyrethrin</a>

<h2 id="what-is-lysol-spray-ingredientsdoes-lysol-kill-bed-bugs">What is Lysol Spray? Ingredients?Does Lysol Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed what scientists typically recommend, let&rsquo;s explore if Lysol kills all bed bugs and their eggs.</p>
<h3 id="lysols-ingredients-">**Lysol&rsquo;s Ingredients **</h3>
<p>Lysol is a liquid cleaner for floors like concrete and wooden floors, in the bathroom, and also on couches.
<em>Lysol is chemically 80% ethanol, but here are all its other ingredients:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.quatchem.com/manufacturing-solutions/biocidal-raw-materials/benzalkonium-chloride"><em>Benzalkonium chloride</em></a>* (0.01 - 5%)*</li>
<li><em>&lsquo;Free line Hydrogen peroxide</em></li>

<li>Isopropyl Alcohol, a synthetic non-volatile solvent.
The ingredients in Lysol are sanitizing and disinfecting agents that&rsquo;ll kill germs and bacteria; but are not suitable for attracting and exterminate bed bugs and other insects.
**Therefore: **</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>**Lysol is not designed to kill bed bugs and other insects - its for cleaning and sanitizing surfaces - and not an insect ****killing agent. **</li>
<li>**Similarly, pesticides such as ****pyrethroids ****cannot be used for cleaning because they are specifically designed to exterminate bugs. **

</ul>
<h2 id="does-lysol-kill-bed-bugs-eggs">Does Lysol kill bed bugs eggs?</h2>
<p>Short answer, NO!</p>
<ul>
<li>Lysol won&rsquo;t kill bed bug eggs. Lysol may only drown the eggs as they have aprotective cover or exoskeleton, making it unreachable until they hatch to become pupae and larvae.
The eggs will hatch in a few weeks and then adults will come out. They&rsquo;ll make more eggs, too.
But to drown the bed bugs eggs:</li>
<li>Spray Lysol indiscriminately on surfaces to kill any living eggs while also disinfecting furniture, cracks and frames where bed bugs typically hide.
There are many
ways of killing bed bugs
.
One of the drawbacks for using Lysol to kill bed bugs is that it doesnt work very well on eggs.
The eggs provide a protective surrounding, allowing the egg to survive until they are ready to be born into the world.</li>
<li>Fortunately, heat treatment offers a good solution to eliminate bed bug eggs, if you exceed the allowable temperature ranges.

?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-risks-in-using-lysol">Any Risks in Using Lysol?</h2>
<p>Lysol is a concentrated product that should never be used on sensitive surfaces like mattresses and pillows.
However, it can be sprayed to drown bed bugs and their eggs with the proper precautions observed (i.e., ventilation).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use only Lysol and not combined with other bed bug control methods, the eggs will hatch, become larvae, pupae, and adults.
Lysol is flammable. Be careful when spraying it near a flame, or while you are using it near a stove.
Ultimately, Lysol does not work effectively enough to exterminate bed bugs.</li>
<li>Additionally, remember that Lysol can harm certain floors and surfaces. Check the product label for instructions.

<h2 id="alternative-method-for-bed-bug-treatments-">**Alternative Method for Bed Bug Treatments **</h2>
<h3 id="1-heat-treatment-">**1. Heat Treatment **</h3>
<p>Heat treatment provides a very long-term solution to bed bug infestations.
It works by heating up the room and all objects in it, including any bugs or eggs that may be present.
It requires heating the objects or spaces to over 118 degrees Fahrenheit for at least one hour.
Heat treatments also require lots of energy as the room or objects must be heated to this temperature.
An important thing to remember is that heat treatments can&rsquo;t kill bed bugs in hard-to-reach areas like inside of cushions, under carpets, and behind furniture.
Heat treatment may not work if there are no vents for air circulation and/or insulation so make sure these are sealed before trying this treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat treatments can also be lethal to animals and humans so make sure everyone is out of the room when it&rsquo;s being heated.</li>
<li>The heat must be maintained for at least one hour, but could take several hours if not done correctly or a lot of furniture is present.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-diatomaceous-earth"><strong>2. Diatomaceous Earth</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-bed-bugs/">Diatomaceous earth</a>
will kill bed bugs by dehydrating them.
It&rsquo;s a very cheap option, but can be ineffective if the infestation is severe because it doesn&rsquo;t kill eggs or nymphs.
You&rsquo;ll need to buy diatomaceous earth in powder form and pour some onto any spots where you suspect that the pests may be hiding.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will also need to use a dust mask or respirator because this material can irritate your lungs.
Use it like your bed bug prevention powder, but make sure to apply it around the edges of any beds or furniture and in corners that bed bugs could fit into.
They will die in the powder and then you can sweep them up with a broom or vacuum cleaner.
Diatomaceous earth, being natural and organic, is also safe for pets, so it&rsquo;s an option if you&rsquo;re worried about your dog or cat getting sick from using sprays around the home.</li>
<li>If your bed bug problem is severe, you can also use a steam clean machine to get rid of the pests.</li>
<li>Purchase the food-grade Diatomaceous Earth as its less hazardous to the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-rubbing-alcohol-">**3. Rubbing Alcohol **</h3>
<p>Rubbing Alcohol works like a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/">drying agent, desiccant, and solvent</a>
; it&rsquo;ll repel bed bugs from their hiding places but its
<a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/fs1251/"><strong>less effective</strong></a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol-based cleaners like 91% alcohol seem to repel bedbugs the best.</li>
<li>So, rubbing alcohol is an effective bed bug repellent and bug killer.
It is recommended that you place a bottle or two of rubbing alcohol in each bedroom and spray your bed sheets with the same.
Try to do this during the waking hours so you wont irritate sleeping family members.
But rubbing alcohol could also stains your bedding, mattress, and furniture that is painted, varnished, or lacquered.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-on-can-lysol-kill-bed-bugs">Conclusion on; Can Lysol Kill Bed bugs?</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon for homeowners to try Lysol to get rid of bed bugs, but the results have been mixed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people report that it does work and some say that it doesn&rsquo;t as well as other household products.
Extreme heat isn&rsquo;t good for eggs. It kills bedbug eggs, as it would kill any kind of egg at the same temperature&hellip;</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Current research shows that essential oils have antiseptic, antifungal, &amp; antibacterial properties. But which one really does
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/essential-oils-for-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/)/">kill or repel bed bugs</a>
?
In this article, I will discuss the question &ldquo;does <a href="/posts/does-peppermint-oil-repel-spiders/">peppermint</a> oil kill bed bugs?&rdquo; Bed bugs will hide in small crevices and cracks all over their home.
But in summary peppermint oil is an effective and safe remedy to repel and kill bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>To make the peppermint oil spray, mix about 9 drops of the oil with 28 ml of water and shake well.</li>
<li>Next, spray the peppermint oil mixture on and under the mattress and otherhiding locations for bed bugs.
However,
heat treatment (such as using bed bug heaters) has proven
to be a highly effective method of controlling bed bugs.
Lets get started with the peppermint oil!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-does-peppermint-oil-kill-bed-bugs">Details: Does Peppermint Oil Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Peppermint oil has been used for treating various conditions such as common cold, digestive problems, nausea, irritable bowel syndrome.
It has also been used topically (skin application Rose bracket for issues such as itching, joint pain, muscle aches, and headache.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peppermint is also used in aromatherapy for reducing stress, enhancing mental function, reducing pain, and for treatment of colds and coughs.
Important to us, in this article, is that peppermint oil is suitable for controlling household pests like ants, cockroaches, and bedbugs.
Peppermint oil contains higher amounts of menthol that will cause a cooling sensation if applied topically (on the skin) or inhaled.</li>
<li>You can also use peppermint oil to heal the stiffness of muscles - especially with your warm baths.</li>
<li>Dilute the peppermint by using some appropriate carrier oil to reduce the chances of burns or eye and skin irritations.
So, in summary, peppermint oil will both repel and kill bed bugs due to the high metal content in its scent.</li>
<li>The burning sensation you feel on your skin when you apply peppermint oil topically will cause death to bed bugs.
Peppermint oil therefore may be classified as a contact pesticide that exterminates bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-peppermint-oil-menthol-repel-the-bed-bugs">Will Peppermint oil (menthol) Repel the Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs hate the harsh scent of natural essences such as essential oils including peppermint oil.</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifically, peppermint oil will produce a very harsh and strong scent that the bed bugs will be unable to withstand.
I advise that you spray generous amounts of peppermint oil on the mattress and bed frame.</li>
<li>This will help repel or kill the bed bugs and allow you to enjoy a great sleep.
Related: Bed bug mattress covers
But peppermint oil is a short-term and temporary solution for the bed bugs since these pests will come back when the oils&rsquo; scent is dissipated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-make-the-peppermint-oil-to-kill-bed-bugs">How to make the Peppermint Oil to Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<h3 id="method-1-peppermint-oil--water">Method 1: Peppermint Oil + Water</h3>
<p>The first method that I recommend for mixing peppermint oil to kill bed bugs is;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 30 ml of water and 10 drops of peppermint oil in a bottle</li>
<li>Next, shake the bottom with peppermint oil + water thoroughly
Now it&rsquo;s time to spray the peppermint oil onto the mattresses. So, strip the various bedding on the bed and spray the peppermint mixture onto the mattress.</li>
<li>I also recommend that you lift the mattress gently and spray the peppermint oil mixture underneath.</li>
<li>Check if there are any visible bed bugs so that you can spray them directly.
Next, you can only make the bed and spray the peppermint oil mixture onto and between the sheets, duvet, and comforters.</li>
<li>Other items that you can target, with the mixture, on the bed include the headboards and pillows.
Also, spray the pest-repellent on home furniture such as couches, and don&rsquo;t forget the
carpets
, crevices, and cracks since this is where bed bugs hide.</li>
<li>NB: To make the bed bug repellent even stronger, you can add some lemongrass (just a few drops).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method-2-peppermint-oil--rubbing-alcohol">Method 2: Peppermint Oil + Rubbing Alcohol</h3>
<p>The next level for mixing the peppermint oil will require that you add 12 drops of the oil and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/">mix it with rubbing alcohol</a>
(1 oz).</p>
<ul>
<li>Rubbing alcohol will act as a drying agent and thus kill the bed bugs through dehydration.
Therefore, the mixture of rubbing alcohol and peppermint oil will be more effective compared to that with water plus the oil.
Expert exterminators approve that we use 70% isopropyl sprays and 91% alcohol to kill the bed bugs
<a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xrxSr9S_H3oC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;dq=bed+bugs+alcohol&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=earth&amp;f=false">by damaging their organs</a>
.</li>
<li>You may still get some of the desired outcomes but you will be required to reapply the alcohol.
The pests will lay many eggs for a short time and that is how your house may become reinfested fast.
The peppermint oil and rubbing alcohol will thus be very important as they will kill the bed bugs before the bed bugs hatch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternative-remedies-to-kill-bed-bugs">Alternative Remedies to Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Peppermint oil is a good repellent and killer for bed bugs but there are alternatives that you can use.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Obtru04wBE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Obtru04wBE</a></p>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth">1. Diatomaceous earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth will be a great and safe remedy you can use as an alternative to chemical pesticides.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diatomaceous earth is made of non-chemical grains (sand-like) that are made of silicon and it is a safe alternative.
Despite that diatomaceous Earth is abrasive to bed bugs, it will be safe to use around pets and kids.
So, sprinkle the Diatomaceous Earth in the house around the window sills, furniture, and bed.
Also, target the crevices and cracks on the baseboards and floors since some bed bugs will hide in these locations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-silica-gel">2. Silica Gel</h3>
<p>Another alternative to peppermint oil will be using silica gel as it is also cheap and effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>For context, you will find silica gel inside small packets in products such as shoes and bottles to reduce mold growth.
So, simply get the silica gel from the packets and grind it to form a powder.
Next, sprinkle the silica gel powder on locations that you believe the bedbugs hide most times.
Once the silica gel touches the bed bug, it will damage the pest&rsquo;s exoskeleton leading to dehydration and death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-steam-or-heat-treatment">3. Steam or Heat Treatment</h3>
<p>Another safe and effective remedy for killing bed bugs is through steam or heat treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toss all the curtains, clothing pillowcases, mattress covers, and bedsheets into the washing machine with the highest temperature setting allowable.
The high temperature and steam will kill the bed bugs that are trapped inside the fabric.</li>
<li>Besides, machine washing will also remove the adult bed bugs in the fabrics plus the bloodstains that they left behind.
But not all fabric materials can be tossed into your washing machine.
Objects such as stuffed animals, toys, and coaches require another method of applying hot water or steam.</li>
<li>This is where abed bug steamerwill come in handy as it will help kill the bed bugs all items that can&rsquo;t be thrown into the washing machine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, will peppermint oil really kill the bed bugs? Yes, peppermint oil is a common pest repellent and its chemical power is strong to allow it to repel or kill bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the caveat is you must spray the peppermint oil directly on the bed bug&rsquo;s body - to hit its skeleton.</li>
<li>This is to say that if you don&rsquo;t spray them play on the bed bugs&rsquo; bodies, these pests can walk safely on services that have been sprayed with peppermint oil.</li>

<h2 id="how-does-alcohol-work-to-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>How does alcohol work to kill bed bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>First, you want to use the right concentration of alcohol when

<h2 id="using-rubbing-alcohol-against-bed-bugs---step-by-steps"><strong>Using rubbing alcohol against bed bugs - Step by Steps</strong></h2>
<p>Okay, so now that you know that rubbing alcohol can be quite effective in
killing bed bugs and their eggs
before an infestation gets really bad, just how do you kill them?
Rubbing alcohol
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-bed-bugs/">kills bed bugs</a>
on contact because they have sensitive skin and can easily dissolve with the right concentration of alcohol.
<strong>Step 1:</strong>
Spray the bed bugs
directly with alcohol  this could be directly on the mattress, the mattress rims, and any other items that have bed bugs on them.
**Step 2: **
Apply to rub alcohol onto a cleaning brush and rub
surfaces to kill eggs
.
**Step 3: **
Spray rubbing alcohol in any cracks and holes where the
bed bugs may be hiding
and then seal these spaces.
**Step 4: **
Wipe furniture and smaller items, such as electronics, with rubbing alcohol.
**Step 5: **
Spray small items and linens with rubbing alcohol, bag them leave them out in direct sunlight for a few days. The heat can also kill bed bugs.
**Step 6: **
Apply rubbing alcohol onto your body before going to sleep to prevent bites.
**Step 7: **
Hire or buy a
steamer and steam remaining bed bugs
and eggs directly.
**Step 8: **
Vacuum-clean your entire house. This should be done regularly anyway to prevent future outbreaks. Dont forget to clean out and safely dispose of the contents immediately.
**Step 9: **
Consider other
natural methods
described below if these steps havent worked. Some items might need to be thrown out completely if they are very infested.�If all else fails, call in the exterminator!</p>

<p>Did you know that you can make your own bed bug sprays using essential oils? All you need is an empty spray bottle, some
essential oils
, and water.
One method is to mix 20 drops of
tea tree oil
with water and spray infected areas. Sometimes the above solutions by themselves wont work.
Here is a
bed bug spray
recipe made up of natural ingredients such as vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and essential oils.</p>
<h2 id="rubbing-alcohol-alternatives"><strong>Rubbing alcohol alternatives?�</strong></h2>
<p>How effective is
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-vinegar-kill-bed-bugs/">vinegar in killing bed bugs</a>
? Well,�Vinegar is another natural way to
kill bed bugs directly
on contact but is not always effective as a repellent. Yes, bleach will kill bed bugs. However, it is a chemical so use it sparingly.
Diatomaceous Earth is another natural solution that you can try, which also dehydrates
bed bugs and their eggs
. You will probably find it more effective when combined with other solutions mentioned above - or use
bed bug sprays
alternatively.
Despite that, it is named alcohol, human beings cannot drink it since it has added bitterants.
Mainly, rubbing alcohol is used as a topic antiseptic but also has other home and industrial applications. Rubbing alcohol is created from ethyl alcohol, a mix of ethyl alcohol and poisonous and bitter substances.
However, you must first know the difference between bed bugs (including the
baby bed bugs
) and other insects such as
Ants
.
<strong>You must be wondering, but what is rubbing alcohol?</strong>
Rubbing alcohol is either
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol">ethanol-</a>
based liquids or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol">isopropyl alcohol</a>
(propane-2-ol).
However, isopropyl alcohol is the most popular in the market. You might try different natural solutions until you find one that works  and if all else fails, youll probably have to call the exterminators.
Bed bugs are tiny brown insects that
can very quickly and easily spread
through your home. As the name implies, they are mostly found on
bed mattresses
and frames. But they can also spread throughout your house, infesting every furniture, item, and piece of clothing. While they dont spread disease,
bed bugs do bite
as they feed off the blood, causing a rash in some people. So you really want to get
rid of them fast
!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Weve shown you different natural remedies to kill bed bugs without harsh chemicals. It might take some trial and error to find the right one for you.
However, combining alcohol with other steps such as steaming and vacuuming will likely give you the best results. If all else fails, call in the exterminator.</p>

Salt is cheap and readily available and is also easy to use. However, not all of them will give you the best result. So, does salt
kill bed bugs

<em>The short answer is, Yes and NO; bed�bugs have a waxy shell. Therefore, if you apply salt on them, the waxy shell will prevent the salt from being absorbed into their body to dehydrate them. Also, bed bugs feed solely on blood. Therefore, there is no way you can poison them with salt.�</em>

<p><strong>Why salt Might Kill Bed Bugs</strong>
For many reasons, individuals believe that they can use salt to
exterminate bed bugs
. For instance,
salt has been used for a long time to kill
other insects such as snails and slugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>People link this association to think that salt can affect bed bugs andbed bug babies.</li>
<li>Diatomaceous earth can kill bed bugs- this makes it easy to believe that salt can be used in the same way.Diatomaceous earth is one of the naturalways to rid bed bugs. Also, it is a short leap to create a connection to salt.</li>
<li>Bed bugs are best killedby dehydrating them, and salt might be a great tool to provide that result.
The statement above tends to show that salt cannot be used to
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/do-it-yourself-bed-bug-control">exterminate bed bugs</a>
. Nevertheless, there are tips to help you use salt in the right way to help you
eradicate bed bugs
in your house successfully.

</ul>
<h2 id="does-salt-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Does Salt Kill Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>It is hard to make it evident that salt
kills bed bugs
. There is no scientific proof of the claim.
Also, there are no blogs that prove that it works. With that, good reasoning reveals that it might not be sufficient.
Unlike
other pests, bed bugs
do not ingest poison since they only feed on blood. Still, you cannot expose them to salt and expect them to dry up and die off. Below are many other reasons why salt may not work to achieve your expectations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs know the thingsthat might hurt them, and they know how to avoid such. Even if salt were poisonous to them, theyd walk around it.</li>
<li>Bed bugs are highly mobile. If you treat one area of the house, they will relocate to safer areas. Therefore, you need something that can spread widely to kill them.</li>
<li>Unlike pesticides that diffuse to other locations, salt sits there.
From that, you can see that you might not use salt to get
rid of bed bugs
. Compared to other treatment methods, you will achieve the least with salt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-table-salt-be-used-on-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Table Salt be used on Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Table salt is one of the best solutions for other
pests, but not for bed bugs
. The top reason table salt doesnt work is that people have formed many
misconceptions about bed bugs
.
They think you can use salt to kill them through dehydration. Though it is possible, you cant use salt to dry bed bugs out.
Diatomaceous earth
is a perfect solution if you want to dry them out. You cant do the same with salt because the diatomaceous world uses a different technique to dry bed bugs and
their eggs
out.
Instead of sucking water directly from their body, diatomaceous earth peels the
exoskeleton of bed bugs
. It does this without drying them off, but they end up dying.
The property that gives the diatomaceous earth the ability to do this is quite rough at a molecular level. Though table salt is also coarse, it cannot match
diatomaceous earth
.

<h2 id="can-salt-water-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Salt Water Kill Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Sprays are the most effective
way to kill bed bugs. This is because, with spraying, you get to spread the toxic substance widely. This way,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/">bed bugs will have to walk through</a>
them.
If you spray a highly effective substance, you will get the best results. Alternatively, check these commercial
bed bug sprays
.
However, in this case, we are talking about saltwater. Salt is not
toxic to bed bugs
. Hence, it cannot kill them even though spraying. If you took a jar full of saltwater
and dropped the bed bugs
in it, theyd die.
But if you spray, they will live on and keep reproducing. This is true because it is not the salt that kills them; the water in the jar drowns them. Spraying saltwater on your mattress will give you the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>They will run and hide in other parts of the room until you are done trying to spray them.</li>
<li>They will back and infest your mattress as soon as you are done trying to kill them using the saltwater.
You certainly will not kill the
bed bugs by spraying
them with saltwater.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="salt-and-baking-soda-on-bed-bugs"><strong>Salt and Baking Soda on Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>The chances are that you have heard about using salt and
baking soda to kill
bed bugs. For a long time, people have used salt and
baking soda to clean
around the house. Some also use it to clean their teeth.
The idea in this belief is that salt and baking soda can be used to suck moisture from the body of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-vinegar-kill-bed-bugs/">bed bugs to kill</a>
them. However, this cannot happen as long as their waxy shell is not broken into. Sadly, baking soda does not have the right texture. Hence it cannot do that.
Also, there is nothing so special in the mixture than just baking soda. Mixing salt and baking soda does not improve anything or create a special mix that can
kill bed bugs
.

<p>Sodium borate or simply borax is another cleaning powder. However, unlike other solutions that we have mentioned on this list, it can be effective against bugs.
<strong>How Sodium Borate Works on Other Bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It sticks on the legs of bed bugs when they walk through it.</li>
<li>By trying to clean themselves, they ingest some borax accidentally.</li>
<li>Though it does not kill them instantly, it is a slow-working poison used tocontrol some bed bugs.
That said, borax might
kill other bugs such as cockroaches
. However, there is no way it can kill bed bugs since they only ingest blood. Therefore, it is not possible that they will ingest sodium borate accidentally. They dont use mouth to feed. Instead, they have an elongated tube similar to that of mosquitoes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-epsom-salt-really-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Epsom Salt Really Kill Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Also known as magnesium sulfate, Epsom salt is another type of salt used for many home and industrial purposes. Farmers use it to add sulfur to the soil to enhance productivity by getting rid of pests. Also, Epsom salt is used to brew beer.
Whether it
kills bed bugs
, there is no proof of that. Just like other types of salt, Epsom salt will not dry bed bugs off. Moreover, bed bugs dont ingest anything other than blood, which means you will not use the salt to poison them.
It is accurate to mention that it is not possible to use Epsom salt to

sense since the bed bugs
will be forced to stay around the salt since they get their food, which is your blood as you sleep.</p>

<p>If you are looking to kill bed bugs using salt, there are many ways to achieve that.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can put some salt around the feet of your bed. This will keep the bed bugs from around your house to come and feed on your blood.</li>
<li>Use salt to target their entry and hiding points. These can be the holes, cracks, and crevices in your house. They will not be able to come out and feed.</li>
<li>Look for thebed bug harboragesand apply salt in those areas. Consider doing this under the mattresses and the furniture in your bedroom.

<p>It is not possible to use salt to exterminate bed bugs. It is not rough enough to destroy the exoskeleton of the bed bugs.

      <description>&amp;#39;Goodnight, sleep tight, and don&amp;#39;t let the bed bugs bite!&amp;#39;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, sleep tight, and don&rsquo;t let the bed bugs bite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of sharing our beds with resilient critters that live off our skin and blood is enough to make your flesh crawl.
<strong>So, does Steam Kill Bed Bugs?�</strong>
<strong>The short answer is, Yes, using steam is a great way to kill bed bugs and allow us all to sleep a little easier in our beds.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="does-steam-kill-bed-bugs">Does Steam Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are small insects that look a little like the seeds from an apple. They are usually brown but can look red when they have had a full feed of blood.</p>
<p>Bed bugs live off the blood of animals and humans and don&rsquo;t only live in our beds, although it&rsquo;s easy to see why a thick warm mattress can make a great home and hiding place with a regular, easy food supply.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_tTehoyQng">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_tTehoyQng</a></p>
<p>Bed bugs don&rsquo;t have wings but travel quickly across floors and can climb walls. Infestations are not always easy to spot until their numbers have grown and they can be difficult to get rid of.</p>
<p>Bed bugs usually enter your house through clothing, luggage or bedding materials, and their tiny eggs are no bigger than a speck of dust which makes them very difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Bed bugs can cause skin irritations, although they do not usually carry other infections so are generally not harmful to people. That said, bed bug bites can be extremely irritating and these parasites are definitely not our friends.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-bed-bugs-using-steam">How to Kill Bed Bugs Using Steam</h2>
<p>Fortunately, bed bugs do not tolerate very high temperatures and the heat generated by steam is very effective at killing both the bugs themselves and their eggs.</p>
<p>The ideal temperature for bed bug extermination is over 160 degrees; ideally, your steamer should have a temperature control dial to help you ensure efficiency.</p>
<p>You will need to be very careful, however, as the steam itself will need to be even hotter in order to create this temperature on a surface and could be as much as 220 degrees.</p>
<h3 id="1-mattresses">1. Mattresses</h3>
<p>The best way to use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/">vacuums or steamers</a>
to kill bed bugs is to apply the steam using a brush or tool attachment. The broader the attachment the better in order to distribute the heat to a wider area at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15mfpAmrlqg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15mfpAmrlqg</a></p>
<p>The good thing is that bed bugs do not need to be exposed to this degree of heat for a long time before they succumb so you will not need to concentrate the steamer on the same area for long.</p>
<p>Taking slow strokes, concentrating the steam on each area for a few seconds, and making sure you do not leave out any spaces in between should be enough to eliminate all the bed bugs and eggs in the upper surfaces of your mattress.</p>
<p>Turning your mattress over and applying the same heat to the other side is a good way to help you access more of the mattress area.</p>
<p>The steam will only be able to penetrate the upper layers of the mattress, meaning that any bed bugs nesting in the middle of a thick mattress will escape.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is best to repeat the process every two or three weeks until you are satisfied that you have eradicated the entire colony.</p>
<h3 id="2-other-bedding---pillow-duvets-carpet">2. Other Bedding - Pillow, Duvets, Carpet</h3>
<p>You can also use a steam attachment or wand to apply heat to bedding like duvets and pillows. Don&rsquo;t forget the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/)-live-in-carpet/">carpet</a>
beneath and beside the bed and any rugs that bugs might have run towards.</p>
<p>If you have a wand attachment, it is also a good idea to focus on the crevice between the carpet and skirting board.</p>
<p>Tips</p>
<ol>
<li>Vacuum thoroughly before beginning</li>
<li>Remove sheets and bedding material (wash on a boil wash, or <a href="/posts/does-steam-cleaning-kill-fleas/">steam</a> first if possible)</li>
<li>Work on small areas, about an inch at a time</li>
<li>Work methodically in rows</li>
<li>Overlap your rows</li>
<li>Keep the nozzle or attachment about half an inch from the surface of the mattress or bedding</li>
<li>Hold the nozzle over each area for about 10 seconds</li>
<li>Pay close attention to the seams of the mattress</li>
<li>Empty your vacuum and wash the dust container if possible, or dispose of the vacuum bag in a sealed bin bag to avoid bugs escaping</li>
<li>Allow everything to dry before remaking the bed</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-steamer">What to Look for in a Steamer</h3>
<p>There are some key features that you should look out for in a steamer including:</p>
<ol>
<li>High temperature levels</li>
<li>Broad attachment tools</li>
<li>Dry steam vapor</li>
<li>Temperature dial</li>
<li>Large tank</li>
<li>Boiler
As already mentioned, you need a steamer capable of creating steam of over 200 degrees with a number of attachments including a broad brush or triangular tool.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the nozzle is too small, you will need to go over the same area too many times and there is a risk of missing tiny spots that could be enough to allow some bed bugs to escape.</p>
<p>You will also need to choose a model that emits a fairly dry steam vapor as you won&rsquo;t want to get your mattress wet in the process.</p>
<p>A damp mattress is not only uncomfortable but it can cause mold; breathing in these spores as you sleep can cause serious health problems.</p>
<p>A large boiler is important to allow the steam cleaner to reach the intense temperatures required.</p>
<p>For one thing, you won&rsquo;t want to stop the process while you refill the tank and wait for it to reach the right temperature again. Secondly, a small tank means the water might have completely evaporated before the steam has reached 200 degrees.</p>
<h2 id="risks-of-using-steam-to-kill-bed-bugs">Risks of Using Steam to Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>High temperatures focused on small areas in your mattress might melt some of the contents and could release some fumes. To avoid this, only keep the nozzle in one spot for 10 seconds and keep the room well ventilated as you work.</p>
<p>Allow plenty of time for the room and mattress to air before you remake the bed. Ideally, you should leave the room air for a day before sleeping in it again. If this is not possible, aim to steam the mattress as early as you can in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="other-approaches-to-kill-bed-bugs">Other Approaches To Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>While a steamer is a great way to eliminate bed bugs, there are other methods you can use in combination to maximize the effect.</p>
<h3 id="1-chemical-treatments">1. Chemical treatments</h3>
<p>You may want to avoid using harsh chemicals if you have allergies or concerns, in which case you will simply need to repeat the steaming method several times.</p>
<p>Always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s guidelines and keep the room well ventilated. Make sure any sprays have fully dried before using your bedding.</p>
<h3 id="2-mattress-bed-bug-covers">2. Mattress Bed Bug Covers</h3>
<p>Even after treating your mattress with steam or chemicals, some resilient bed bugs may still survive.</p>
<p>You can trap these effectively by purchasing a purpose-made mattress cover that bed bugs are unable to pass through. This way, any remaining bed bugs will be unable to bite you and will be unable to survive without a food supply.</p>

<p>Now you know its
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-lysol-kill-bed-bugs/">possible to kill bed bugs</a>
using vinegar. A highly concentrated vinegar will certainly kill bed bugs on contact. But does
it also repel bed bugs
and prevent them from coming back?
A simple answer to this question is yes. As an acid, vinegar has a pungent smell, which quickly diffuses to the surrounding area.
Bed bugs hate the pungent smell
emitted. When you spray on an
infested area, bed bugs
will start running away from the smell.
While this can be good news, it might create another problem. Well, you might successfully repel bed bugs
from your bed and mattress
. But these creatures will find their way into other places inside the house where theres less repellent smell.
When the smell subsides, these bed bugs will come back to look for you. Thus, its advisable to use vinegar regularly to
kill bed bugs
that keep coming back. Check
bed bug images
.</p>
<h3 id="which-type-of-vinegar-kills-bed-bugs"><strong>Which Type Of Vinegar Kills Bed Bugs?�</strong></h3>
<p>The most common types of vinegar are white vinegar (corn),
apple cider vinegar
(apples), red vinegar (grapes), rice vinegar (rice), and malt vinegar (barley).
They vary in their concentration of acetic acid and other elements. Thus, they will have varying levels of effectiveness against bed bugs. White vinegar tends to have the highest concentration of acetic.
That means white vinegar will have quick and
effective damage to bed bugs
. It is also cheap and readily available in your local shop. Compared to other types of vinegar, white vinegar is the best for
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/">bed bug treatment</a>
.
Apple cider vinegar is usually kept in households due to its use for cleaning purposes. However, white vinegar can do cleaning as well in addition to bed bug treatment. Apple cider vinegar wont help you eradicate bed bugs.
However, you can use it to treat
bed bug bites
. It is mild on the skin. When
applied on bed bug bites
, it can reduce the irritation and help in the healing process.</p>
<h2 id="does-vinegar-treat-bed-bug-bites"><strong>Does Vinegar Treat Bed Bug Bites?�</strong></h2>
<p>If you have a bed bug infestation, vinegar will help you in control and treat the bites. Normally,
bed bug bites are painful and itchy
to the touch.
However, it is possible to ease the itchiness with the help of apple cider vinegar. Its low PH level causes a mild soothing sensation on the bites.
Also, apple cider will reduce the inflammation
usually associated with bed bug bites

<p>Below is a step by step
guide for getting rid of bed bugs
using vinegar.</p>
<h3 id="1-inspection"><strong>1. Inspection</strong></h3>
<p>Bed bugs prefer hiding
in certain areas in your house. So, the first thing to do is to identify the infested areas. Use a flashlight to inspect along the baseboard, floorboard, and any crevices in the house.
Check for bed bugs in the drawers and under your mattress.</p>
<h3 id="2-vacuuming-and-steaming"><strong>2. Vacuuming and Steaming</strong></h3>
<p>A
vacuum cleaner can help
you pick bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs that are near the surface. Places to vacuum can include carpets, floor, sofa set, bed, curtains, among others.
Once you are done with vacuuming, empty the canister&rsquo;s contents in a plastic bag and dispose of it carefully. Use one of these
best bed bug steamers
.</p>
<h3 id="3-prepare-the-vinegar-solution"><strong>3. Prepare the Vinegar Solution</strong></h3>
<p>I recommend buying white vinegar for bed bug eradication. You also require a spray bottle. Buy one that will not spill stuff on your hands. Here&rsquo;s the procedure;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix equal parts of vinegar and water. The amounts will depend on the area you want to spray</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into a spray bottle.</li>
<li>Shake thoroughly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-spraying-">**4. Spraying **</h3>
<p>Spray all your infested areas - with any of the suitable
bed bug sprays.
Start with your mattress and bed because these are the most affected places.
Vinegar works best when saturated on a surface. So, you can drench your mattress, pillow, and cushions with vinegar and take them out for drying.
Respray the house after a few days to kill
bed bugs that might have survived
. This will also kill bed bugs that might have hatched from the eggs.
You can wash your
bedding, clothing, and other clothes with a vinegar solution to kill bed bugs and their eggs
. When used regularly, vinegar can help reduce the
bed bug population
.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-using-vinegar-to-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Limitations of Using Vinegar to Kill Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>Although vinegar can help you control a
bed bug infestation
, it has some limitations or downsides. Lets look at some of the restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="1-it-wont-kill-bed-bug-eggs"><strong>1. It Wont Kill Bed Bug Eggs</strong></h3>
<p>It is easier to kill bed bugs with vinegar than it is to kill
bed bug eggs
. Bed bug eggs tend to be resilient to even the most effective insecticides.
The outer shell shields and prevents vinegar from penetrating the egg. Thus, it cannot deter the eggs from hatching.</p>
<h3 id="2-it-has-a-pungent-smell"><strong>2. It Has a Pungent Smell</strong></h3>
<p>Vinegar is a strong acid with an offensive pungent smell. Of course, a few drops of vinegar cannot be very harsh. Since you will have to soak your room and other vinegar items, the smell can become quite unbearable.
The smell is also persistent. Thus, it will take a long time before it can go out entirely.</p>
<h3 id="3-vinegar-can-damage-furniture"><strong>3. Vinegar Can Damage Furniture</strong></h3>
<p>You will be using a highly concentrated vinegar to kill bed bugs. The acidic properties of vinegar can substantially damage your furniture, especially wood and surfaces, such as ceramics and granite.
You are required to soak surfaces with vinegar. But these surfaces tend to be susceptible to the scouring effects of acetic acid.
Undiluted vinegar can also damage your exposed skin. So, youll have to use gloves to prevent such injuries. However, vinegar wont affect your couches, beds, and other fabrics.</p>
<h3 id="4-won"><strong>4. Won&rsquo;t clear Large Bed Bug Infestations</strong></h3>
<p>Vinegar
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/">kills bed bugs on contact</a>
, leaving no residual activity. So, it wont have any effect on bed bugs once the surface has dried.
If you dont manage to kill all bed bugs, they will emerge once more and continue breeding.
For this reason, its advisable to spray vinegar frequently to kill bed bugs that escape previous treatments.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-bed-bug-bites-using-apple-seed-vinegar">How to treat bed bug bites using apple seed vinegar:</h2>
<p>**Requirement: **
Apple cider vinegar and A soft cloth or cotton ball
<strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soak a cotton ball or a soft cloth in apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>Rub the affected area gently until its soaked with vinegar</li>
<li>Allow some time for the vinegar to dry before rinsing.</li>
<li>For quick relief, you can reapply the vinegar two or three times a day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When used properly, vinegar can provide a natural solution to bed bug infestation. However, like many other non-chemical bed bug treatments, it cannot provide a long term solution.
Thus, it is necessary to combine it with other effective treatments such as chemical sprays and
bed bug powders
.
If you have a persistent bed bug infestation, you need to seek help from a professional pest exterminator.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Essential oils for bed bugs? Make a list of natural treatments for bed bugs.
Whenever conventional bed bug treatments fail, many homeowners opt for natural treatments,
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4592615/">including essential oils</a>
. But do they really work effectively?
*Well, many essential oils have been in use for pest control for decades. These include lavender, tea tree oil, thyme, peppermint, among others. *
<em>Let&rsquo;s get started!�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="essential-oils-for-bed-bugs---top-9-oils">Essential Oils For Bed Bugs - Top 9 Oils</h2>
<h3 id="1-lavender-oil-for-bed-bugs"><strong>1. Lavender oil for Bed Bugs</strong></h3>
<p>As an essential oil, lavender has been in use for many years for pest eradication. Although this floral herb has a pleasant fragrance to humans, it is
disgusting and toxic to bed bugs/)
.
It works in two ways: When
sprayed directly on <a href="https://pestpolicy.com/proof-bed-bug-spray-review/">bed bugs</a>
, the lavender essential oil will kill bed bugs. The scent will
repel and deter bed bugs
.
The effectiveness of lavender essential oil depends on the type of oil you use and how well you use it. Since therere different lavender herb species, its possible to get fooled into buying ineffective products.
Therere four lavender oils commonly used in pest eradication. You can distinguish them from the synthetic substitutes using their botanic names. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>French Lavender (Lavandula dentata)</li>
<li>English Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)</li>
<li>Spanish Lavender (Lavandula stoechas)</li>
<li>Dutch Lavender (L. Angustifolia x L. latifolia)
All these differ in their applications. For example, the ideal lavender oil for your skin is the English one. When applied on the skin, this
oil can repel bed bugs
. So, applying the oil on your skin before you sleep can prevent these critters from coming near you.
However, this is only temporary relief from
bed bug bites
.
To kill bed bugs
, you will need to spray the oil directly on the bed bugs. Since its impossible to
saturate every bed bug
with the oil, they might find their way into other places in the house.
Therefore, when using a lavender essential oil, it is important to spray every corner of your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-tea-tree-oil-for-bed-bugs"><strong>2. Tea Tree Oil for Bed Bugs</strong></h3>
<p>Tea tree essential oil has natural insecticide
and insect repellent properties, making it an ideal remedy for eradicating insects, including bed bugs. Tea tree oil is a natural solvent.
When it gets into contact with the insects exoskeleton, it dissolves into the internal fluids and suffocates them to death.�When sprayed
directly on bed bugs
, tea tree oil will kill bed bugs and repel them from the area.
To use it on bed bugs, dilute about 20 drops of the oil and spray
directly on the infected area
. Spray around your bed, curtains, carpets, and other infested place. This will
effectively repel bed bugs
.
To kill bed bugs, you need to spray directly with undiluted tea tree oil. However, undiluted tea tree oil is toxic when ingested by both humans and pets. Thus, its not advisable to use the undiluted form inside the house.</p>
<h3 id="3-thyme-oil-for-bed-bugs">**3. Thyme oil **<strong>for Bed Bugs</strong></h3>
<p>Thyme essential oil has characteristic antimicrobial properties that make it an effective substance for
eradicating bed bugs
. It is also a natural repellent that can be used to repel
bed bugs
and deter them from coming to your house.
Use the thyme essential oil, dilute about 10 drops with water and spray directly on the infected area. Or you can put the leaves in a net and place them in the affected places.
Set the leaves under the mattress, cushion, or inside the cupboard to repel the bed bugs. Alternatively, you can burn thyme sticks near the infested area.
To completely repel bed bugs, you need to apply these procedures for at least 30 days.�To
kill bed bugs
, you need to spray the bed bugs with undiluted thyme essential oil.
However, it is not safe to use undiluted thyme oil near your kids or pregnant women. Besides, the oil can increase the blood pressure to dangerous levels in some individuals.
Therefore is advisable to consult your medical doctor before you use it on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="4-peppermint-oil-for-bed-bugs"><strong>4. Peppermint Oil for Bed Bugs</strong></h3>
<p>Peppermint essential oil has a pleasant smell that has seen its use in food flavoring, soap production, and aromatherapy. However, its strong scent is quite
unbearable to pests, including bed bugs
.
This makes it a safe substance to get
rid of bed bugs
from our premises.�To
repel bed bugs
, spray them with diluted peppermint. It works best when applied directly on the infested places.
You can also soak cotton balls in peppermint and place them around the infested areas. This will only help repel
bed bugs and deter them from the area
. When applied directly to the bed bugs, undiluted peppermint essential oil will kill them instantly.
However, concentrated peppermint oil can cause a severe burning sensation when it comes into contact with your skin. To reduce the burning effect, peppermint can be diluted with an appropriate oil such as carrier oil.

<h3 id="5-lemongrass-oil-for-bed-bugs"><strong>5. Lemongrass oil for Bed Bugs</strong></h3>
<p>Lemongrass essential oil kills bedbugs by creating unfavorable conditions around the insect. When sprayed directly on the insect, lemongrass oil raises the acidity level inside the
body of the bed bug
. This causes an imbalance in the insects internal fluids causing it to die.
Also, the scent of lemongrass is quite unbearable to bed bugs. This makes it a good
remedy for repelling bed bugs
and deterring them from your house. To use lemongrass oil on bed bugs, follow the following instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 20 drops with water to dilute.</li>
<li>Pour the oil into a spray bottle and spray it on the infested places. Spray directly on thebed bugs to killthe bed bugs and repel them from your house.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="6-cedar-oil-for-bed-bugs"><strong>6. Cedar oil for Bed Bugs</strong></h3>
<p>Cedar oil spray has been in use as an insect repellent for many decades. Many insects, including bed bugs, dislike the scent of cedar oil.
So, when
sprayed along the areas affected by bed bugs
, it is possible to repel them. However, you wont kill bed bugs with cedar oil.�To prepare your cedar oil spray, dilute one teaspoon of the oil with one cup of water.
Put the solution in a spray bottle and spray directly on the infested places. This will repel bed bugs from their hideouts and deter them for a few days.
Cedar oil can also be applied using a steamer to kill bed bugs and their eggs. Steam treatment will effectively
kill the bed bugs and their eggs
. At the same time, cedar oil will repel bed bugs that survive steam treatment.
Alternatively, you can directly sprinkle the diluted cedar oil on the infested places, especially the hard-to-reach crevices. You can also treat your bedding, clothes, and furniture with dilute cedar oil. Remember that undiluted cedar oil can damage your clothes and bedding.</p>
<h3 id="7-neem-oil-for-bed-bugs">**7. Neem oil **<strong>for Bed Bugs</strong></h3>
<p>Two types containing neem oil have been approved as biochemical remedies for
bed bug control
. TER-TRU1 (5.5% neem oil) and TER-CX1 (22.0% neem oil) are cold-pressed directly from the seeds, bark, fruits, and leaves of the neem tree.
It is commonly used to manufacture products such as soap, shampoo, cosmetics, and toothpaste. Research has also shown that the compounds found in neem oil can destroy bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs.
Direction for application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pour a few drops of neem oil into a spray bottle and add a little water and shake thoroughly to mix the ingredients.</li>
<li>Spray directly on the infected area to repel bed bugs, and To destroy bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs, apply undiluted neem oil directly.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="8-eucalyptus-oil-for-bed-bugs"><strong>8. Eucalyptus Oil for Bed Bugs</strong></h3>
<p>Eucalyptus essential oil is valued for its energizing scent and antiseptic properties. When combined with other essential oils, eucalyptus oil can be used to kill and repel bed bugs.
Directions for use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 20 drops of eucalyptus essential with a few drops of tea tree oil and lavender.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into a spray bottle and add water. Shake thoroughly</li>

<li>This mixture of essential oils might
work to some extent in repelling bed bugs
. However, its not an effective method for
combating a bed bug infestation
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternatives-of-essential-oil-for-bed-bugs"><strong>Alternatives of Essential Oil for Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-bed-bugs-steamers"><strong>1. Bed Bugs Steamers</strong></h3>
<p>Steam treatment is one of the best remedies for eradicating bed bugs, including their nymphs and the eggs. However, not all steamers will get the job done.
It would help if you had a high-quality steamer, preferably a commercial steamer. Theyre capable of achieving the required temperatures for destroying bed bugs.
Cloth steamers and carpet cleaners wont reach sufficient temperatures to kill bed bugs. Normally, a commercial steam cleaner is too expensive to be bought and used by a single household (up to $1200).
But, you can hire from local pest exterminators. A steamer works by raising the infested area&rsquo;s temperature to extreme levels (160F-180F).
<em>How to use a bed bug steamer.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Get yourself an effective steamer from your shop or online. It should produce high-quality steam to create unbearable conditions for the bed bugs.</li>
<li>Follow the user manual included in the package to set your apparatus. Remember, this is an expensive gadget. If you dont follow instructions carefully, you might end up destroying your expensive gadget or ruining your floor or carpet. Wrong use might even result in steam burns. But no need to worry; most steamers are quite easy and safe to operate.</li>
<li>Begin your operation and bombard your infested places with high-temperature steam. Treat your floor, carpet, bed, bedding, curtain, and any crevices that bed bugs might hide.</li>
<li>Remember, the intention here is to kill all bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs. Therefore, try to expose all the affected places to the steam. Do not soak the place with steam. It would help if you also were keen not to cause electric short circuits.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-bed-bug-sprays"><strong>2. Bed Bug Sprays</strong></h3>
<p>Bed bug sprays are perhaps some of the
most commonly
used insecticides. They tend to work best when sprayed directly on bed bugs.
Theres a `common misconception that bed bug sprays are not as effective as some alternatives. This can be attributed to the current bed bug resistance to many insecticides.
However, with the right spray, it is possible to
control bed bug
infestation in your house. Normally, therere three types of bed bug sprays depending on the form of the chemical used.
These include aerosol sprays, liquid concentrates, and liquid sprays.
<strong>- Bed Bug Aerosol Sprays</strong>
Bed bug aerosols
are rather meant for residual killing than for instant kill. Unlike contact sprays, aerosol sprays wont kill bed bugs rapidly. However, since they have a longer residue effect, they can continue killing even after weeks.
They are easy to use. You need to shake the can to build up pressure. Then you can spray directly on the infested place. Normally, aerosol cans do not experience pulses between triggers. Plus, when you spray, the insecticide tends to foam on the surface. This gives you a visual display of how the insecticide is spreading.
Aerosol sprays are manufactured using various compounds to allow their application on several surfaces. For instance, some
bed bug aerosols
are ideal, so use on your upholstery. Others are meant for use on wooden surfaces.
<strong>3. Liquid Bed Bug Sprays</strong>
Unlike aerosols, liquid sprays are meant to kill bed bugs on contact. The insecticide evaporates quickly, meaning it has no residue activity. Its trigger mechanism operates just like the sprayer you use to spray your plants.
Liquid sprays give you an efficient way of reaching bed bugs that hide in narrow cracks such as along floorboards and baseboards. This is because the nozzle can be adjusted to make the insecticide come out in a sharp streak.
They dont leave any residual effects that make them ideal for surfaces such as upholstery, bedding, mattresses, sofa set, and kitchen. Its advisable to saturate the infested place with the insecticide, then allow it to dry.
<strong>4. Concentrated Insecticides</strong>
The last type of
bed bug spray
is the concentrated insecticide spray. They are available as residual compounds, contract killers, or one that serves both purposes.
Unlike aerosols and liquid sprays, concentrated sprays take some time to prepare since they require mixed water. Concentrate insecticides are applied with the help of a tank sprayer.
The usage and safety manuals for these sprayers vary depending on the model. They all come with a hand pump for building pressure.
Most of the sprayers come with an adjustable nozzle. This allows you to achieve a narrow stream of the insecticide for use in cracks or crevices. The concentrate insecticide comes with a guide for diluting depending on the intended application.
Once your insecticide is ready, pump a few times until the handle becomes hard. Press the trigger and spray evenly on the infested place.</p>
<h3 id="5-bed-bug-mattress-encasements"><strong>5. Bed Bug Mattress Encasements</strong></h3>
<p>Mattress encasements are intended to vacuum your entire mattress and box spring. Its made of tightly-woven material to
prevent bed bugs from getting inside or out of the encasement
.
When you zip your mattress inside the encasement,
bed bugs that get trapped
inside will neither escape nor breed.
They will eventually starve to death.
Bed bugs that are locked outside
wont be able to get inside. Since the encasement has creases, the bed bugs become easy to find and remove.
Advantages of mattress
encasements in bed bug
control:
<em>They Keep Bed Bugs Off The Bed</em>
. If new bed bugs come to your house, they wont have a chance of hiding in the mattress or the box spring. The
bed bugs can only crawl
on the surface where theyre easy to spot and remove.
<em>Protects New Beds From Infestation</em>
. When you replace your bed, bed bugs trapped inside the encasement wont come out to hide in your bed.
<em>Allows You To Retain Your Infested Mattress</em>
. You dont have to dispose of your infested mattress. Just zip it inside an encasement, and your mattress will be as good as new. This can also prevent the
spread of bed bugs
to other places through discarded mattresses.
<em>Bed Bug Control Becomes Easier</em>
. Mattresses and box springs happen to be the most preferred
hiding places
for bed bugs. A mattress encasement
traps some bed bugs
and exposes others for easy eradication.
<strong>6. Bed Bug Powders</strong>
Bed bug powders
provide an easy and effective way to eradicate bed bugs. They are also cheap and safe to use. For this reason, powders are among the most commonly used
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/scabies-vs-bed-bugs/">bed bug treatments</a>
.
Bed bug powders vary in their effectiveness and strength. When selecting a powder for
bed bug treatment
, look for the following qualities.
<em>Effectiveness:</em>
Consider powders that
kill bed bugs
rapidly and work for a wide range of surfaces.
<em>Toxicity:</em>
Many of the commonly used bed bug powders are safe for humans and animals. Be sure to buy non-toxic powders because they dont present to your kids and pets&rsquo; health risk.
<em>Durability:</em>
Most bed bug powders tend to have a long residual activity. So, when you apply the powder, it can kill bed bugs for a long depending on the brand. For instance,
diatomaceous earth kills bed bugs
for a long time if kept dry and as long as its not swept.
<em>Cost:</em>
Usually, bed bug powders are not expensive. You can save a lot in the cost if you buy in bulk.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-mites/">Bed bug infestations differ</a>
in their severity. So, it stands out that no single treatment can successively eradicate bed bugs on its own. Although some essential oils can be used to repel and kill bed bugs, they will not eradicate an infestation.
However, they are effective when combined with other treatments such as steam treatment,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/harris-bed-bug-killer-review/">bed bug sprays</a>
, and powders. More importantly, its advisable to consult a pest expert for advice.</p>

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255965/">bedbug</a>
bites.
<strong>Both these bites swell up and can be itchy, so here are some tips thatll help you tell the difference between them:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fleas prefer animal blood but can drink human blood as well. Whereas bedbugs only drink human blood.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flea bites appear to be red, swollen, and hard. Bedbug bites, on the other hand, seem to have a dark red spot in the center of the bitten and raised area of the skin.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fleas tend to <a href="/posts/do-fleas-bite-humans/">bite</a> randomly over the body, and you might notice clusters of three dots together. Bedbugs, however, tend to bite their hosts strategically in a pattern of a linear row, you can find a group of 10 or more together.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flea bites can be found on the lower half of the body, in places like ankles, calves, or moist areas such as elbows and knees bends. Whereas, bedbug bites are found in the upper half of the body in areas such as the neck, arms, shoulders, and back.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cat ScratchingLets go into detail about all the things that make the two bites different, as well as how to deal with them.</p>
<h2 id="flea-bites-vs-bedbug-bites--the-physical-differences">Flea Bites vs. Bedbug Bites  The Physical Differences</h2>
<p>As both the insects are small in size and feed on blood, the result of their bites look almost the same. However, if you have the right information, you can easily differentiate between the two. Its crucial that you identify them correctly if you want to succeed at the pest control battle against these blood-sucking pests.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-the-bite-occur">Where Does the Bite Occur?</h3>
<p>**Flea Bites **
are expected to occur in the lower parts of your body like your legs, ankle and feet. They are likely to be found in any area where the skin folds such as around the waist and under your arms.
**Bed Bug Bites **
usually appear in the upper areas of your body such as your face, neck, hand and arms. However, at times they can appear anywhere on your body.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-bite-look-like">What Does the Bite Look Like?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
appear in clusters, and look like small bumps surrounded by red patches. They look quite similar to mosquito bites as theyre itchy and might break if you scratch them too much. Since fleas tend to jump, youd notice that the bites would be scattered all over your skin.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
also result in red, small and round bumps. These bites usually have a dark red spot thats raised at the center. Theyre itchy and if you make the mistake of scratching them, itll become worse and you can end up with blisters. As bedbugs crawl on your skin, the bites mostly appear in a linear pattern. They bite several times in the same place before moving on.</p>

<h3 id="what-reaction-does-the-bite-cause">What Reaction Does the Bite Cause?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
might not cause any reaction for some people; others at the same time can suffer from horrible reactions causing you to scratch your skin. It all depends on the sensitivity of your skin. Scratching them may lead to a secondary infection. It triggers hives or an allergy attack for people who have sensitive skin or tend to have strong allergic responses to insect bites.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
would show different reactions for different people depending on the sensitivity of their skin. You might feel the urge to scratch them but the irritation doesnt last for more than a week. People with sensitive skin might experience serious allergic reactions causing you to develop hives or blisters.</p>
<h3 id="can-the-bites-lead-to-infection">Can the Bites Lead to Infection?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
are quite dangerous, as fleas are prospective carriers and transmitters of human diseases, like typhus. They might pass on cat scratch fever to your feline pet thats transferable to humans as well. Fleas are known to host tapeworms, which can make their way to your family and your pets.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
however are much safer, as they arent known to cause any disease. They can, however, be itchy and lead to allergic reactions for some people. Scratching the bites might expose your skin and result in secondary infections. Other than that, they dont pose any major health risks.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-do-they-last">How Long Do They Last?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
heal depending on the sensitivity of your skin, and might take between one day and two weeks. Many might not experience any severe reaction to the bite, and would notice the symptoms disappearing within a day or two.</p>
<p>However, if you have sensitive skin, you might have a more serious reaction to flea bites, as well as itchiness and swelling resulting from the fleas saliva thats left behind on your skin. As a result of continuous scratching, you may end up with severe blisters on your skin that can take up to two weeks to heal.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
might take different time to heal for each individual. The bites usually stay for about two weeks. If you dont have very sensitive skin, itll take less than a week for the effects of the bite to go away. Some of you may be lucky enough to not experience any symptoms at all.</p>
<p>However, if your skin has an allergic reaction to bedbug bites, you can experience severe reactions. The bites will be extremely itchy and you may not be able to resist the urge to scratch them constantly, resulting in blisters that usually take long time to heal.</p>
<p>Now that youve identified whether its a flea bite or a bed bug bite, you need to know how to treat them. If youre lucky enough not to be one of their victims, learn preventive methods so you can stay safe.</p>
<h2 id="flea-bites-vs-bedbug-bites--treatment-and-prevention">Flea Bites vs. Bedbug Bites  Treatment and Prevention</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, if youre already scratching yourself, youve got an infestation on your hands. But you dont have to let go of your beloved pet or set your bed on fire to get rid of these parasitic pests. Weve got a simple way out for you.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-treat-the-bites">How to Treat the Bites?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bite</strong>
treatments require you to keep the bitten area clean, so wash it daily with soap and water. To reduce the chances of allergic reactions, incorporate an oral antihistamine in your treatment. Get hold of a soothing antipruitic (anti-itch) cream thatll ease the itching on your skin, ensuring that you dont end up with a secondary bacterial infection. To reduce inflammation, consult your doctor regarding a topical steroid that you can use. If the bite doesnt heal and seems to get worse, visit your doctor for an antibiotic prescription.</p>
<p>To treat the bites naturally, you can use Aloe Vera gel to lessen the itchiness and redness. For healing, use black or green tea to wash the area of the bite.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
become worse when you scratch them. To deal with the swelling and itchiness, you can apply a topical anti-itch cream or calamine lotion to the bites. For pain, an over-the-counter pain reliever should be sufficient. If the bites persists for more than two weeks, even after your home is infestation free, or youve developed a secondary infection, go visit a doctor. They may prescribe you an antibiotic.</p>
<p>For a treatment that you can do at home on your own, use water and baking soda and mix them together make a paste. Apply the mixture on the bite directly, and wash it off after an hour.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="2-my-detailed-review">#2: My Detailed Review</h2>
<h3 id="1non-staining-formula">1.Non-staining Formula</h3>
<p>Harris Bed Bug Killer won&rsquo;t stain your clothes, fabrics, or linen. The spray formula won&rsquo;t damage furniture finished despite leaving a residue that&rsquo;ll be active for long.
The long residue effect (7 to 10 days) means that the formula will continue
killing bed bugs
over time and won&rsquo;t require frequent re-application after the first day.</p>
<h3 id="2-suitable-for-indoor-and-outdoor-spraying">2. Suitable for Indoor and Outdoor Spraying</h3>
<p>This product will
kill bed bugs
excellently for both your outdoor and indoor spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would say that you&rsquo;ll require to combine thisspray with bed bugbaits.
However,�Harris
Bed Bug Killer is more effective
in controlling bed bugs in indoor spaces where roaches tend to create their safe havens.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-liquid-spray-formula">3. Liquid Spray formula</h3>
<p>Being a spray formula, this product will be suitable to spray places that
bed bugs are hiding
or have created a bug nest.</p>
<ul>
<li>I found the nozzle to be highly convenient in distributing the liquid.</li>
<li>Luckily, the liquid spray tends to dry out just about 5 minutes after the application.
Therefore, it&rsquo;s great to apply to your bedding, mattresses, and furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-odorless-formula-or-mild-smell">4. Odorless formula (or mild smell)</h3>
<p>In addition to being effective
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dead-bed-bugs/">against bed bugs</a>
, this product is odorless and non-irritating to both human beings and your pets.
However, some customers note that they experience some mild (though non-irritating) smell, which would disapprove of the &ldquo;odorless&rdquo; claim.</p>
<h2 id="3-my-experience">#3: My Experience:</h2>
<h3 id="1-deltamethrin-irritates-the-skin">1. Deltamethrin irritates the skin</h3>
<p>Harris Bed Bug Killer contains the Deltamethrin that tends to irritate the human skin, particularly the eyes, and thus you must take care when spraying or use goggles.
However, the Deltamethrin in this product is less toxic if minimal amounts are eaten or ingested, and that person would tend to vomit a lot to remove the poison.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bugs-are-resistant-todeltamethrin">1. Bed bugs are resistant to�Deltamethrin</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common fact that current bed bugs are continually developing resistance against Deltamethrin. Therefore, at the usual dosage, the bed bugs will still endure.
Recent
<a href="https://www.npmapestworld.org/default/assets/File/newsroom/magazine/2015/nov-dec_2015.pdf">research</a>
shows that over 85 percent of the cockroaches don&rsquo;t die from exposing them to Deltamethrin-containing pesticides while also ranking bed bugs as the worst pests.</p>

<h2 id="details-9-home-remedies-for-bed-bugs">Details: 9 Home Remedies for Bed Bugs</h2>
<h3 id="1-use-extreme-heat-or-extreme-cold">1. Use Extreme Heat or Extreme Cold</h3>
<p>One of the endless ways of killing bed bugs is by use of high or low temperature. Temperatures above 120 degrees Fahrenheit will destroy the entire infestation of bed bugs (eggs, larvae, and adults) in your home. To achieve this, you will need to carry out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all the infested items with bed bugs/)and scatter them in one room to allow heat action on them.</li>
<li>Open all the closets in your house/room to enable heated airflow.</li>
<li>Lock all the windows, doors, and available ventilation to boost heating efficiency.</li>
<li>Remove all heat-sensitive items such as plastics and nylon clothes for special treatment (vacuuming).</li>
<li>Place the room heating machines centrally to enhance equal distribution of heat within the room (uniform heat transfer.)</li>
<li>You can put the indicator on window panes or doors to show a given color when<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/">bed bugs killing</a>temperature (119 degrees Fahrenheit) reaches.</li>
<li>Switch on the machine and let it heat the room for 30 to 60 minutes, after which you will switch off.</li>
<li>Open the doors and window and let in fresh air for 30 minutes (helps in cooling the room) before cleaning the bedbug treated room and items.
All eggs and larva stage of bed bugs will begin to die at a temperature of 98 degrees Fahrenheit while adult bed bugs will start breaking at a temperature of 118 degrees Fahrenheit. It is essential to maintain the killing temperature anywhere between 120 to 140 (max) degrees Fahrenheit to allow the complete killing of bed bugs infestation.
Alternatively, you can freeze the
bed bug-infested items
or room to a temperature below zero degrees. The low temperature denatures enzymes&rsquo; action in the
bed bugs lifecycle, thus killing
it.
You will need to carry out freezing at least four days for complete
bed bugs killing
to take place.�NB:
<em>This method may be slightly expensive but very efficient and environmentally friendly (it cause no pollution).�</em>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-vacuuming">2. Vacuuming</h3>
<p>In vacuuming, the
vacuum machine
sucks very tiny particles, including small insects (bed bugs). You will require a vacuum cleaner and a source of power/energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug the vacuum cleaner into a power source and switch it on.</li>
<li>Run the machine for 1 to 3 minutes to enable it to reach the maximum working point.</li>
<li>Point the nozzle of the vacuum on the surface ofbed bugsinfested items. Make sure you leave ample space to allow effective sucking.</li>
<li>Ensure your vacuum walls, floor, cracks/crevices, and closets wherebed bugs can hide.</li>
<li>After thoroughly vacuuming all the places, empty the vacuum cleaners trash bin into a furnace to burn all the sucked substances. Burning is the best way of ensuring all that has been sucked (includingbed bugs) is dead.
The vacuuming kills bed bugs by sucking and whirling them at a higher velocity/speed. Those
bed bugs that are not destroyed
during sucking are secured at the trash bin, ready for destruction.
This method eliminated over 90% of
bed bug infestation, including eggs
and larvae. Ensure you vacuum your bed bugs infested items thrice a month to remove bed bugs traces thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-diatomaceous-earth">3. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth
is naturally occurring sedimentary rocks that are formed from microorganisms that decomposed for many years. Your need to carry out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grind the Diatomaceous Earth in fine grain powder.</li>
<li>Wear gloves and sprinkle the powder into bed bugs infested area. You canrub bedbug-infested�items with Diatomaceous powder or sprinkle it over the items.</li>
<li>You can also fill cracks and crevices with this powder too.</li>
<li>Leave the treated area or items for 1 to 3 days. You will need to do this after every three weeks for complete bed bugs elimination.</li>
<li>Then, vacuum the area or items to remove the Diatomaceous Earth and dead bed bugs.
Diatomaceous Earth kills bed bugs on contact. The sharp edges of the rock particles penetrate/easily pierce the exoskeleton/cuticle of the bed bugs, thus dehydrating them to death. The arsenic component found in the Diatomaceous Earth poisons the bed bugs when ingested (rare). This product is quick-acting and increases its working with the quantity applied.
Diatomaceous Earth is poisonous to your pets and children when swallowed though it does not cause irritation to your hands-on contact. When purchasing Diatomaceous Earth, buy the one that is pest-related such as safe brand Diatomaceous Earth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-using-a-dryer-hair-and-clothes">4. Using a Dryer (Hair and clothes)</h3>
<p>A
Dryer (for clothes)
is a suitable device that can be used to kill bed bugs in bed bugs infested clothes and smaller items, which can fit in a given dryer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a dryer with a power rating that will generate a temperature above 110 degrees Fahrenheit (bed bug killingtemperature).</li>
<li>Plug the dyer into the power supply/socket.</li>
<li>Putbed bug-infesteditems into the dryer and close.</li>
<li>Switch on power. Set the dryer into a maximum temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit and a run time of 15 minutes. Then, press the dryer start button.</li>
<li>Stop the dryer after 15 minutes if its not automatic and remove the items.</li>
<li>Blow flesh air over the treated items to remove dead bed bugs or hung them for 2 to 3 hours.
The Bed bugs in the infested items will die due to the high temperature on the dryer and swirling in the chamber. 99% of the live bed bugs, larvae, and eggs will be destroyed by this method. Its not advisable to put temperature-sensitive items in the dryer.
Alternatively, you can use a hairdryer.</li>
<li>Plug the hairdryer into the power supply and switch on.</li>
<li>Once heated, point the hot air from the dryer over the bed bugs infested items or areas.</li>
<li>I was once treated, leaver the items to cool before blowing cold air over them.
The heat generated from the hairdryer kills the bed bugs on infested items on contact. This method can destroy 93% of the infestation (eggs, larvae, and adults).
The killing power of hair dryer or
bed bug heaters
is a function of the dryer&rsquo;s power rating (select a higher rated hairdryer to help generate high temperature).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-steam-cleaning">5. Steam Cleaning</h3>
<p>Steam cleaning involves the use of superheated steam from a steam generator to kill bed bugs infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat water in a steam generator to 117 degrees Fahrenheit (bed bugs killing temperature).</li>
<li>Direct the steam nozzle of the steam generator onto bedbug-infested items or areas.</li>
<li>Steam all closets, crevices/cracks, and floor. Take care since superheated steam may burn badly.</li>
<li>Leave the treated items to cool for 30 minutes before cleaning them.
Superheated
steam kill bed bug eggs
, larvae, and adult bed bugs on contact. This method is quick-acting though it may require a specialist for complete bed bugs elimination.
Keep off all heat sensitive items and pets during treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-using-borax-boric-acid">6. Using Borax (Boric acid)</h3>
<p>Borax, also called boric acid, is a home solution that can instantly kill bed bugs on application. The borax concentration determines the ability to kill bed bugs�and the amount fed/breathed by a bed bug.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear hand protection (gloves) and sprinkle borax on bed bugs infested items (mattress, bed sheet, clothes, etc.) or area (cracks, floor, or closets).</li>
<li>Leave them for 20 to 50 hours for the chemical to work.</li>
<li>After treatment, clean the items to remove borax and dead bed bugs.
Box kills bed bugs by suffocating them. Though
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">bed bugs wont eat</a>
box as per se, the environment will make bed bugs difficult to breathe, thus dying. This method will kill up to 95% of adult bed bugs. This method wont kill eggs. Therefore, you need to combine it with a complement method such as steam treatment.
Borax will cause a burning sensation when in contact with eyes and upset your stomach when swallowed and should be kept away from children.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-using-vinegar">7. Using Vinegar</h3>
<p>Vinegar is a robust bed bug killer
since it contains a strong acetic acid, which affects the bed bugs&rsquo; nervous system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure 100ml of vinegar (Kroger Brand Heinz Distilled or Walmart) and mix with an equal amount of water.</li>
<li>Put the mixture in a spray bottle and spray over the bed bugs infested items or area (cracks, floor, or closets).</li>
<li>Leave the area for 30 minutes for the medicine to act/kill.</li>
<li>Clean the items after treatment to remove vinegar and dead bed bugs.
Vinegar will kill adult bed bugs on contact. The acetic acid in the vinegar will attack the nervous system, thus inhibiting transport activities.� Most of the bed bugs larvae wont die on contact (especially if the concentration wont be much). Therefore, it is recommended to supplement this method with others, such as the use of Diatomaceous Earth. It would help if you did not use vinegar on acid-sensitive items.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-rubbing-alcohol">8. Rubbing Alcohol</h3>
<p>Alcohol is able to kill the entire life-cycle of bed bugs
(eggs, larvae, and adults) on contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put concentrated alcohol in a spray bottle.</li>
<li>Spray over the bed bugs infested items (beddings, clothes, couch) and areas (crevices/cracks, walls, floor, and closets).</li>
<li>Leave the area for 4 to 6 hours for the chemical to work.
All the bed bugs that come into contact with alcohol will be killed. Wear a breathing mask (irritates nasal cavity on inhaling) and hand protection when spraying.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-baking-soda">9. Baking Soda</h3>
<p>To kill bed bugs using baking powder, carry out the following steps. The baking powder kills bed bugs on contacts. It will dehydrate the exoskeleton/cuticle of bed bugs, thus killing them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle baking powder over the bed bugs infested areas (floor, wall, cracks/crevices, and closets) and items (clothes, couches, beddings, or mattresses).</li>
<li>Leave the items for 2 to 6 hours.</li>
<li>Clean the treated items/area to remove baking powder and dead bed bugs.
This method will kill up to 97% of bed bugs infestation. Though some eggs may be destroyed, it is advisable to supplement this method with other ways, such as steam or Diatomaceous Earth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-use-of-bed-bug-herbals-indiana-lilac-leaves">10. Use of Bed Bug Herbals: Indiana Lilac Leaves</h3>
<p>Bed bug herbals entail plant and plant extracts that keep away or kill bed bugs in your place.
Indiana Lilac or lavender emit a scent that either poison the bed bugs
or keep them off. To achieve this, you can carry out the following procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crush the Indiana Lilac lives into fine particles.</li>
<li>Spread the crushed leaves in bed bugs infested area and items.</li>
<li>Alternatively, boil the Indian Lilac leaves and strain the solution.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the solution over the bed bugs infested items or areas.
The Indiana Lilac leaves extract/liquid will kill bed bugs on contact. The insects breathe the scent and get paralyzed to death. Moreover, this product will also keep off bed bugs in your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-spraying-tea-tree-oil">11. Spraying Tea Tree Oil</h3>
<p>Tea Tree Oil has anti-microorganism properties that will kill bed bugs on contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dilute 20 drops ofTea Tree Oilwith little water.</li>
<li>Put the solution in a spray bottle.</li>
<li>Spray over bed bugs infested items (clothes, beddings, mattress, or couches) and areas (cracks/crevices, closets, walls, or floor).</li>
<li>Leave the liquid to act for 5 hours.</li>
<li>Clean the area and items to remove the oil and dead bed bugs.
Once bed bugs breathe Tea Tree Oil, they get suffocated and die since they affect both the nervous and respiratory systems. Undiluted Tea Tree Oil is unsafe for humans during use. Well-diluted Tea Tree Oil will leave a lovely scent on the items or areas sprayed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-will-kill-bed-bugs-instantly">What will kill bed bugs instantly?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Heat treatment</strong>and use of household dryer will kill bed bugs instantly. The generated heat denatures the hormonal system and enzymes (protein in nature), thus destroying them.</li>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>will also kill the entire lifecycle of the bed bugs. They destroy the exoskeleton/cuticle and inhabit the transport system, thus killing them. Superheated steam destroys the incubation stage of bed bugs eggs and their larvae.</li>
<li><strong>Use of bed bugs sprays</strong>such as Eco Defense Bed bugs killer will kill bed bugs instantly. The sprays contain ingredients that destroy the bed bugs eggs or inhibits the hatching of the eggs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-bed-bug-bites-last/">Bed bugs bite</a>
human beings and pets, injecting pain and leaves marks that may swell or lead to allergic reactions. It is also necessary to observe proper bed bugs in preventive measures.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How big are bed bugs? Bed bug bites are painful and
cause excessive irritating
, but most of us don&rsquo;t know the bug&rsquo;s appearance, shape, size, and color.
So, how
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)-appearance-and-life-cycle">big the bugs</a>
are;
*In summary, adult bed bugs (last in the life cycle) measure  inch in length - roughly the size of an apple seed in length - and can be seen with a naked eye with no magnification. *
*Also, bed bugs are oval-shaped (but long and flat), plus they&rsquo;re brown. *
But bed bugs are cryptic and nocturnal - they&rsquo;ll highly avoid detection. They may quickly reproduce (including nymph adults and eggs) and spread all over the house.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bug Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="how-big-are-bed-bugs-identification--removal">How Big are Bed Bugs? Identification &amp; Removal</h2>
<p>The bugs will bite pets and
humans
when they&rsquo;re resting or asleep - which implies that they&rsquo;ll be difficult to notice - but
what causes bed bugs
.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bug-identification">1. Bed Bug Identification</h3>
<p>As noted above, bed bugs are reddish-brown, oval-shaped insects (with thorax and abdomen) with antennae and six legs. But
bed bugs can&rsquo;t jump
, and
they have no wings
.
Despite having a lat body, bed bugs will become rounded, and long when they take a blood meal - they&rsquo;ll be blood-engorged and thus may be
mistaken for stink bugs
.
<a href="https://youtu.be/ObVqT9daRuc">https://youtu.be/ObVqT9daRuc</a></p>
<h3 id="2-how-big-are-bed-bug-nymphs">2. How Big are Bed Bug Nymphs?</h3>
<p>Bed bug nymphs measure
about 2.5 mm (0.09 in) while mature bed bugs measure 4.5 mm (0.18 in) - their length is about that of an apple seed. But nymphs measure about 1 mm (size of poppy seeds).
In loose terms, the nymph will be translucent in color and measure like a pinhead. But the nymph will change color after the suck blood from pets or humans. The Nymphs will molt within six weeks to become adult bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="3-signs-of-bed-bug-infestation">3. Signs of Bed Bug Infestation</h3>
<p>So, what do bed bugs look like to the human eye? Well, you can see
bed bugs with a human eye, but their bite
marks are even more prevalent.
On the human skin,
bed bug bites
are itchy and sore, but you must consult a medical practitioner for analysis and further treatment if confirmed.
Therefore, examine these
<em>bed bug pictures,</em>
and it&rsquo;ll help you determine if you have a bed bug infestation in your house or home - know how big the bugs can get.
As noted earlier, the baby bed bugs are dark-brown colored, but their color will change as they suck blood and grow through the life cycles.
Therefore, to control these bugs, wash and dry your mattress, bed covers, pillowcases, duvet covers, and other similar bedding.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-see-bed-bugs">Can You See Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are visible to the naked human eye - but most humans prefer not to come across these bugs. The adults will measure about the size of a thumbtack&rsquo;s head.
But the bed bug&rsquo;s actual size may vary with different conditions. For example, considering their life cycle, baby bed bugs are tiny and grows in size as the nymph stages develop.
Despite that you can see bed bugs with naked eyes, it would be impossible to see the bugs without using a microscope or some form of the magnifying glass.
You may definitely mistake it for other insects such as swallow bugs, bat bugs or
confuse bed bugs for mites
. Therefore, it&rsquo;s not recommended to use a
DIY bed bug control
.

What&rsquo;s the
signs of bed bug
infestation. Well, it is possible to mistake bed bugs with other similar bugs, and thus here are the signs to check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blood-stained pajamas and sheets</li>
<li>Bites and irritating welts that are in rows or zigzag patterns or clusters</li>
<li>Bed bug shells, exoskeletons, or skins</li>

<p>Bed bugs will appear like seeds, but they may look anything like oval and brown colored body with some legs. The body size and color will change when they take a good blood meal - brownish to red in color.
The length of your regular bed bugs is about 1/4 - 3/16 inches - this will change as the bug progresses with the life cycle stages. The bugs&rsquo; oval-flat body will become longer and more rounded as the bed bug sucks blood from pets and humans.
After taking a blood meal, and before the female&rsquo;s mate and lay eggs, the bugs will have a cylindrical and long body shape. Being mainly blood-feeders, the bugs will also eat
bed bug poop</p>
<ul>
<li>and survive for several months.
The bloated body is derived from the blood meal, and they&rsquo;ll slowly consume their food reserves (a food conservation tactic) since they might not get another blood meal over some months.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-big-are-bed-bug-eggs">How Big Are Bed Bug Eggs?</h2>
<p>Once the small bed bugs feed on a pet or human blood, they&rsquo;ll get plumb about double their original size. Further,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-eggs/">Bed bug eggs</a>
are even smaller - and off-white in color.
Female
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/">bed bugs will lay</a>
roughly 500 - 600 eggs for their whole life-time. The eggs are white and equally tiny, looking like a salt grain or pinhead on physical appearance.
But the eggs will also be wet - covered by some sticky substance making them get stuck on different objects. However, within a week, the eggs will have a &ldquo;dark eye&rdquo; on their surface.
Bed bug eggs have a tough surface that&rsquo;ll withstand and survive most insecticides - the reason why you must use
steamers (with temperatures over 120 degrees)
-, and thus, over 90% of the eggs will hatch successfully.
Notably,
home solutions for bed bugs
such as�borax, diatomaceous earth, vinegar, baking soda, or rubbing alcohol won&rsquo;t kill the bed bug eggs or even break through their shell.
So, where will you mainly find the bed bug eggs? The eggs will mainly be hidden on some protected sites (like cracks), but equally, this must be close to some food source.
Therefore, please search for the eggs around the bed joints, headboard or mattress seams plus on box spring, or even attach themselves on the wall and wall cracks.
On smell, you&rsquo;ll look for sweetish plus pungent odor coming from areas that bed bugs and their eggs hide - the scent comes from the bug&rsquo;s scent glands.
<strong>Hatching?</strong>
Bed bug eggs tend to hatch within two weeks, given the right or optimal humidity and temperatures (room temperature). Further, for cold temperatures, the eggs will hatch over a longer time.</p>
<h2 id="how-big-are-bed-bug-nymphs">How Big are Bed Bug Nymphs?</h2>
<p>Nymphs may be described as
baby bed bugs
that have not developed fully to become adults. They&rsquo;re visible to humans&rsquo; eyes but won&rsquo;t be brown in color like adults.
After the bed bug nymphs come out, they&rsquo;ll start searching for blood from a suitable pet or human being to allow them to desiccate within a short time.
Blood helps the
bed bug nymphs to gain moisture
but will need to equally hide in some cracks or crevices behind living in the right room temperature. Nymphs will live even up to 4 months without a blood meal.
Nymphs may also look translucent, and thus they may easily camouflage with the environment. Further, Nymphs will grow after taking their full blood meal.</p>
<ol>
<li>1stnymph stage  1.5 millimeters</li>
<li>2ndnymph stage  2 millimeters</li>
<li>3?? nymph stage -2.5 millimeters</li>
<li>4thnymph stage  3 millimeters</li>
<li>5thnymph stage  4.5 millimeters

</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are tiny bugs, but you may see them only clear when there&rsquo;s a huge infestation. To effectively control bed bugs, you must know their average size, color, and shape- try
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">bed bug sprays for control</a>

So, for the question of how big are bed bugs?: Bed bugs are tiny bugs measuring about  inch in length - about apple seed&rsquo;s length - they&rsquo;re visible to the human eye.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-they-spread-so-fast">Why do they spread so fast?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are incredibly prolific insects. During its 6 to 12 month lifespan, a female bedbug can produce 500 eggs, and its offspring can reproduce within a month.
Pest management professionals can save money in the early
stages of infection and prevent bed bugs
from spreading quickly in your home.
Bed bugs also spread through the mattress (you can use
mattress encasements to control bed bugs
). Refurbished old mattresses often spread
bugs to shops and homes
, causing infection. Also,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-mites/">bed bugs can spread</a>
when old and new mattresses are shipped together.</p>
<h2 id="prevent-bed-bugs-from-spreading-in-your-bed-and-house">Prevent bed bugs from spreading in your bed and house</h2>
<p>Prevention is better than cure. Taking precautions against
bed bugs is much smaller than getting rid
of them after pests. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seal and repair any cracks outside the home to prevent any insects from entering. While at this, ensure you use effective
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">sprays against bed bugs</a>
.</li>
<li>Use a mattress cover - a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-climb-metal-or-plastic/">plastic or tightly woven mattress cover to prevent bed bugs</a>
from crawling in and out</li>
<li>Do not buy or pick up any used furniture, if possibleTy
Ammonia
, or
Rubbing alcohol
.</li>
<li>Clean your house regularly - reduce any unnecessary mess and vacuum mattresses. And finally, undertake

<p>You could do some things to
protect yourself from bed bugs
while traveling: Educate yourself about bed bugs, so you know what to watch out for.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you pack, pack clothes that can be easily washed in water: Pack disposable gloves, a small flashlight, and a series of garbage bags. You may also want to spray your luggage both inside and on the outside.</li>
<li>Install insect
bed and spring mattress on all beds in the home
before you leave.</li>
<li>When you arrive in your hotel room, inspect the room for any evidence of pests. Put your luggage and items in the bathtub; these insects are least likely to be hidden here.</li>
<li>During your stay, place your luggage on a luggage rack at least 4 inches from the wall or on hard furniture such as a desk. If you must put your luggage on the floor, put it in a re-sealable plastic bag. Never place a suitcase or clothing on a bed or upholstered furniture.</li>
<li>When you check out, inspect each item and the surface of the suitcase when packing. Seal the suitcase in large plastic bags before placing them in your car.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you take all precautions and find evidence of these
pests, contact a licensed pest control
company with pest control expertise.
Being aware of these guidelines about bedbugs will help you prevent the discomfort caused by these insects.</p>

<p>Bed bugs can pretty much bite
anywhere across the body, but mainly the bites are located on or near these areas: Face, Shoulders and upper back, Hands and Arms, Legs (mostly around the feet and ankles), and Neck.
Depending on how the bodies react, some people only experience the bite&rsquo;s inflammation and irritation. In contrast, others who are
sensitive tug bites
to a more severe reaction, such as nausea, sweating, and skin rashes.
A
bed bugs bite
can have different shapes and signs, but usually, the patterns that occur are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small red bumps with welts in a zigzag shape</li>
<li>Clusters of red bumps surrounded by blisters</li>
<li>Large raised itchy bump with an exact center</li>
<li>Small bloodstains from thebites on the bed sheet or pillows</li>
<li>Red itchy bump with a dark center and white blisters

During the day, the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bugs hide</a>
in cracks and window seals or furniture cushions and crevices. They tend to roam around beds and near pillows at night, even in vacuum canisters, if someone tried to clean and wasnt thorough enough.
Bugs
found in other household items

You can
prevent a bed bug infestation
by avoiding furniture that can be a potential spot of infestation and make sure that its not coming from a previously infested area in case its a used item.
Using steamers and regularly washing bed sheets and pillow sheets can help kill
eggs and prevent
any further colonization by the bed bugs. Still, usually, this technique is only useful in the early stages.</p>

<li>Finding a bed bug infestation early will aid in its control so that it doesn&rsquo;t spread further - they measure about5 - 7 millimeters in length.</li>
<li>Notably, treating that minor bed bug infestation will be easier and cheaper compared to trying to control a full-blown attack.
But these minor infestations will also be difficult to find or even identify their signs correctly. Check these bed bug killers.

<p>Further, there are many insects such as
*bat bugs, spider beetle, swallow bugs, carpet beetles, ants, book-lice, and roach nymphs that can be mistaken with or for bed bugs. *</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/bed-bugs-appearance-and-life-cycle">correctly identify the bed bugs</a>, that infestation may spread to various places of your residence like the yard or house - or even jump onto some humans and trigger an infestation in their house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-whats-not-truly-indicative-of-bed-bugs">Step 1: What&rsquo;s not Truly Indicative of Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>Bed bug bites may not be the right signs to look out for to acknowledge the presence of an infestation.
This is because the bites are similar to those of other insects such as
fleas
, chiggers, or
mosquitoes
, or even hives, fungal infections, and eczema rashes.
Further, some humans may also not react to bed bug bites - they affect people differently. Some may not even show bite signs or bite marks - that is they&rsquo;ll show no reaction.
But for other humans, signs may include anaphylaxis, painful swellings, and bite marks being enlarged. Also, differences in blood types may cause a disparity in bite numbers.
For instance, if bed bugs are used to O-positive blood type, they&rsquo;ll mainly bite people with that blood - they know and get used to that blood taste.
Will the bed bugs infest all the rooms? Bed bugs may reach one room rater and thus some people may not experience the bites. The female bug will move to other rooms and lay eggs.
They may even hitch a ride on a human to get to another house, room, or area in the same room. After feeding and mating, the female bed bug will lay eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, a bed bug infestation may remain locked in one room for some time. The females will move to another room once all hiding places in one room are occupied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-check-for-bed-bug-signs">Step 2: Check for Bed Bug Signs</h3>
<p>To find the bed bugs in your rooms and spaces, look out for definite physical bed bug signs.
You&rsquo;ll examine this when you&rsquo;ve been away from the house, or when changing or cleaning bedding.</p>
<h4 id="1-live-bed-bugs">1. Live Bed Bugs</h4>
<p>Getting live bed bugs in the spaces and house will be a sure sign of the bug infestation.
But bed bugs will only move around if they&rsquo;re pregnant females avoiding males, or if seeking food.
The bugs will hide in a specific location - and thus you might not notice an attack unless it grows severe.
They&rsquo;ll move also if their hiding areas are disturbed. Further, there are many bugs that you may confuse with bed bugs.</p>
<h4 id="2-shell-casings"><strong>2. Shell Casings�</strong></h4>
<p>The
bed bug life cycle
makes the bugs pass via 5 stages - and before molting onto the next stage, they&rsquo;ll feed on blook and shed the exoskeleton leaving behind the shell casings.
These shell or skin casings or husks will signify the presence of bed bugs in your spaces - this will be an especially growing bed bug infestation.
The casings will be hollow�and translucent falling off from the juvenile stages of the bed bugs. These will be simpler to locate (they won&rsquo;t be moving) compared to bed bugs that&rsquo;ll hide.
You&rsquo;ll find the casings on areas that bed bugs breed and hatch - so I advise you to examine the crevices, cracks, holes, upholstered furniture, and the mattress seams.</p>
<h4 id="3-bed-bug-eggs">**3. Bed Bug **<strong>Eggs</strong></h4>
<p>Bed bugs (their females) will lay about 1 to 7 eggs daily. Notably, the eggs will be ovular, pearl white, and measuring 1 millimeter in length. However, if you&rsquo;re not keen, you may miss the bed bug eggs.
The eggs can be stopped by a naked eye provided they&rsquo;re 5+ days in age -
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/bed-bugs-appearance-and-life-cycle">as outlined by the EPA</a>
. You&rsquo;ll find them stuck loosely on wood and fabric crevices - but they may hide anywhere.
As noted above, the female bed bugs (when pregnant) will wander around seeking hiding places or running away from males. So, they&rsquo;ll drop eggs in different rooms and apartments.
So, is it possible to carry the bed bug eggs on the human body? Well, the bed bugs will bite the human arms, hands, and legs but also the head and neck.
However, the bugs won&rsquo;t live on the human or lay eggs on your body - and so you won&rsquo;t get bed bugs or their eggs in the hair.�So, how should you kill those bed bug eggs? Well, I recommend using
Isopropyl alcohol to exterminate the bed bug eggs plus the adults.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R26-3bKJUEA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R26-3bKJUEA</a>
Further, you can repel the bed bugs using smells that they hate including Cinnamon powder, Lavender, Alcohol, Cayenne Pepper, garlic aroma, and Fresh mint.
Will the bed bug eggs wash away in your shower?� No, the bug eggs won&rsquo;t stay on the human skin and thus they won&rsquo;t be washed off when your bathe or shower. The bugs won&rsquo;t also infest the human
hair like lice or
fleas
, but they&rsquo;ll live in�wall cracks, furniture, and mattress.

Bed bug steamer
.</p>
<h4 id="4-fecal-marks">**4. **<strong>Fecal marks</strong></h4>
<p>With the bed bug infestation, you&rsquo;ll get bloodstains on pillowcases, mattresses, and sheets. Just like with
flea dirt
, bed bug fecal matter contains undigested blood and hence it&rsquo;ll leave red or dark brown discoloration.
Therefore, the bloodstains you&rsquo;ll find on the sleeping surfaces may be from the fecal matter of the bugs or blood arising from bed bug bites - especially when you scratch them.
However, the fecal marks from bed bugs will be much smaller compared to bloodstains. The dark sport from the fecal matter will look like a dot from a marker or pen.
Since bed bugs will exclusively feed on blood, the fecal matter will smear on the surfaces in a unique way. Further, you&rsquo;ll find these marks challenging to wash out.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may also find rusty stains on the pillowcases or bed sheets - this may be signs that bed bugs are around. The bloodstains are from bites caused by the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-bed-bug-odor">**5. **<strong>Bed Bug Odor�</strong></h4>
<p>Bed bugs will produce a slightly sweet�but musty smell similar to that of coriander or raspberries - with a massive
infestation
. The smell may change with the bed bug&rsquo;s state - and may feel different with various
olfactory senses.
Bed bugs will product alarm pheromones odor - a smell similar to that produced by stink bugs -
see a comparison of stink bugs versus. bed bugs
.
Unless there is a dog inspection for bed bugs, these odors won&rsquo;t be a great indication for bed bugs since its less perceptible to many humans.
Notably, if you&rsquo;re already perceiving the bed bug smell, then the infestation is overly massive and you may already be seeing live bed bugs around.</p>
<h3 id="step-3where-do-bed-bugs-hide">Step 3:Where Do Bed Bugs Hide?</h3>
<p>Bed bugs
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">will hide</a>
in clothes shelves, clothes seams, ceiling, mattress tags, piping, floor or wall cracks, couches, furniture joints, and chair joints.
You may also find the bed bugs&rsquo; eggs, feces, skin castings, and adults in the box spring when it&rsquo;s around the time of day for feeding. Further, check the headboard and bed frame.
For spaces that are heavily attacked by bed bugs, check the screw heads, ceiling/ wall joints, under the wall hangings or wallpapers, in appliances and drawer joints.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, bed bugs will measure roughly the credit-card width and hence they&rsquo;ll easily squeeze in the various small cracks and tiny spaces.

<h3 id="step-4bed-bug-habits-andbehavior">Step 4:�Bed Bug Habits and�Behavior</h3>
<p>You should comprehend the habits of
<a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-bedbugs">bedbugs</a></p>
<ul>
<li>their reproduction, living, and eating behavior. This will help in establishing their location and eliminating them.
The brownish, oval, and small bugs will suck blood from humans and animals too. They&rsquo;ll measure like an apple seed in its size. Once they feed on blood, they become reddish and swell in size.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-feeding">1. Feeding</h4>
<p>Check where the bed bugs are hiding including the ceilings, walls, and floors. Check too for eggs laid by the female bedbugs - they&rsquo;ll be about the speck of dust.
The bed bug nymphs will molt about 5 times to drop their skins as they grow to become mature - but they need to take a full human or animal blood meal before shedding skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs will suck blood from birds, mammals, and humans. They can also move 5 to 20 feet around their hiding places in search of a meal from a suitable host.</li>
<li>When will bedbugs bite - Bed bugs can feed or suck blood during daylight but they&rsquo;ll largely be active and feeding during the night - for about 3 to 12 minutes.</li>
<li>The tarry and rusty spots you&rsquo;ll find on the sheets and other hiding locations denote that about 20-percent of the nymphs and adults feed<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like/">while still pooping</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-mating-or-life-stages">2. Mating or Life Stages</h4>
<p>The bugs will require a minimum of 1 blood meal to enable them to reproduce and molt to the next stage - of all the 6 stages.
The bed bugs will only
survive for about 3 months
without feeding on blood. But, the bugs will feed for more than 1 time a day.
For effective mating and reproduction, both the female and male bed bugs require to feed on blood at least 1 time in 2 weeks.
Every of the female bed bugs will lay roughly 1 - 3 eggs each day and this will total to roughly 200 to 500 eggs over the bugs lifetime - with their lifetime being 6 to 12 months.
Further, the bugs will take about 4-5 weeks to complete the Egg-to-egg life cycle - especially when the conditions such as temperature and humidity are favorable.

<h4 id="3living-conditions">3.�Living conditions</h4>
<p>Bed bugs will survive and equally be active at temperatures from 46F (7C ) but will be dead when the temperatures rise to over 113F (45C ).
Therefore,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-heaters/">killing the bed bugs using heat</a>
requires that you raise the room temperature very high so that it&rsquo;ll exterminate the bugs even in their hiding places.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll find the bugs in many areas of your living and sleeping spaces hiding in bedding, crevices, and crack - which means that the killing temperatures need to be higher.
But the Cimex hemipterus will need higher temperatures to exterminate compared to the regular bed bug that is prevalent in the subtropical and tropical regions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on how to find bed bugs; check for various signs including bloodstains, live bugs, eggs, fecal marks, plus shell casing around the spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>But bed bugs have comparable features to other bugs such as ants and swallow bugs, carpet beetles, ants, book-lice, and roach nymphs.
So, effectively identify the bed bugs to easily and readily exterminate them from the rooms and residence.</li>

<li>Fortunately, you have the right to seek a refund for the inconvenience caused.
In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process, step by step, to ensure you get the compensation you deserve.
<strong>Note: Remember to collect evidence and document every step of the process for your refund request.��</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-gathering-evidence-of-bed-bug-presence"><strong>1. Gathering Evidence of Bed Bug Presence�</strong></h2>
<p>The first and most crucial step in securing a refund for a bed bug infestation is gathering concrete evidence. Bed bugs are notorious for their ability to hide in various nooks and crannies within a hotel room.
To effectively document their presence, follow these steps as outlined in
<a href="https://bedbugreports.com/">bedbugreports.com</a>
:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Photograph the Bed Bugs:**Use your smartphone or camera to take clear, high-resolution photographs of the bed bugs themselves and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>. Focus on capturing their size, color, and any unique markings.</li>
<li>**Inspect Hiding Spots:**Bed bugs often hide in seams and folds of mattresses, cracks in headboards, baseboards, and even behind picture frames. Carefully inspect these areas and document any signs of infestation, such as eggs, fecal stains, or molted exoskeletons.</li>
<li>**Date and Time Stamp:**Ensure your photographs are date and time-stamped. This will provide a clear timeline of when the infestation was discovered.</li>
<li>**Use a Ruler or Coin for Scale:**Include a common object like a coin or a ruler in your photographs to provide a sense of scale, which can be crucial in identifying bugs.
Gathering solid evidence of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">bed bugs&rsquo; presence</a>
is the foundation of your refund request. Without it, your claim may lack credibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-documenting"><strong>2. Documenting <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">Bed</a> Bug-Related Injuries</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bug bites can cause a range of reactions, from mild itching to severe allergic responses. To strengthen your case for a refund, it&rsquo;s essential to thoroughly document any injuries or discomfort caused by these bites:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Photograph Bite Marks:**Capture clear, close-up photographs of the bed bug bite marks on your body. Ensure the images are well-lit and dated.</li>
<li>**Maintain a Bite Log:**Create a detailed log of when and where you were bitten, the severity of the itching or pain, and any medical treatment you sought as a result.</li>
<li>**Medical Records:**If you seek medical attention for your bites, retain copies of all medical records, including bills, prescriptions, and doctor&rsquo;s notes.
Properly documenting your bed bug-related injuries will demonstrate the physical and emotional toll of the infestation, further supporting your refund request.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-seeking-medical-assistance-if-required"><strong>3. Seeking Medical Assistance (If Required)</strong></h2>
<p>While bed bug bites are generally not a serious health threat, some individuals may experience severe allergic reactions or secondary infections due to scratching.
If you are suffering from significant discomfort or any concerning symptoms, it&rsquo;s crucial to seek medical attention promptly.</p>
<h2 id="4-notifying-hotel-staff-and-management-about-the-bed-bug-infestation"><strong>4. Notifying Hotel Staff and Management About the Bed Bug Infestation</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have gathered substantial evidence and documented your injuries, it&rsquo;s time to address the issue with the hotel staff and management. Here&rsquo;s how to navigate this step effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Prompt Notification:**As soon as you discover bed bugs in your room, contact the hotel staff or management immediately. Be courteous but assertive in conveying the seriousness of the issue.</li>
<li>**Request a Room Change:**Politely request a room change or, if available, an upgrade to a different room that is free of bed bugs. Ensure that the new room is thoroughly inspected before moving your belongings.</li>
<li>**Treatment Request:**Alternatively, you can request that the hotel management arrange for immediate treatment of the infestation by professional pest control services. Ensure they provide you with a timeline for this action.</li>
<li>**Document Your Conversation:**Take detailed notes during your conversation with hotel staff or management. Record the names of the individuals you spoke to, the date and time of your communication, and any promises or actions agreed upon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-creating-a-formal-written-report-of-the-infestation"><strong>5. Creating a Formal Written Report of the Infestation</strong></h2>
<p>To formalize your complaint and maintain a clear record of your interaction with the hotel, it&rsquo;s essential to submit a written report of the bed bug infestation. Follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Compose a Detailed Letter:**Write a formal letter addressing the hotel&rsquo;s management, outlining the entire situation. Include the evidence you&rsquo;ve collected, your photographs, your conversation records, and your requests for a room change or treatment.</li>
<li>**Request Acknowledgment:**In your letter, kindly request written acknowledgment of your report from the hotel. This acknowledgment serves as an official confirmation of your complaint.</li>

Submitting a formal report in writing not only strengthens your case but also demonstrates your commitment to resolving the issue professionally.

<ul>
<li>**Polite and Clear Communication:**Express your concerns calmly and professionally. Clearly state that you are seeking compensation for the inconvenience, discomfort, and potential expenses you have incurred.</li>

<li>**Request a Timeline:**Politely request a timeline for when you can expect a response or resolution to your complaint. This sets clear expectations for both parties.
Effective communication is vital during this stage to ensure your concerns are heard and addressed by the hotel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-alerting-the-local-health-department"><strong>7. Alerting the Local Health Department</strong></h2>
<p>If the hotel is unresponsive, uncooperative, or fails to resolve the issue to your satisfaction, it&rsquo;s time to escalate the matter. Contact your local health department and report the bed bug infestation. Here&rsquo;s how to proceed:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Gather Information:**Prepare all your evidence, including photographs, written reports, and communication records, to share with the local health department.</li>
<li>**Explain the Situation:**Clearly explain the situation to the health department, emphasizing the potential health risks associated with bed bug infestations.</li>

      <description>Treating bed bug bites can become a problem if you dont act on them promptly.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Treating bed bug bites can become a problem if you dont act on them promptly.</p>
<p>Though hardly noticeable at first, these bites end up becoming irritable and embarrassing scars. So, how can you treat bed bug bite scars?
<strong>In summary, to get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-bed-bugs-fast/">rid</a> of <a href="/posts/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/">bed</a> bug bite scars, use (1) over-the-counter medications like corticosteroid creams and lotions, retinoid creams, Mederma advanced scar gel, vitamin E oil or (2) home remedies like baking soda, aloe Vera gel, and lemon juice.</strong></p>
<h2 id="use-over-the-counter-medications">Use Over-The-Counter Medications</h2>
<p>Wash the skin area with an antiseptic soap and clean water. This will help reduce the itching and also prevent occurrence of a skin infection.</p>
<h3 id="1-corticosteroid-creams-and-lotions">1. Corticosteroid creams and lotions</h3>
<p>Corticosteroid creams and lotions have antipruritic properties that make them potent remedies for skin allergy and itchiness.
They reduce histamine release to the areas that have been bitten by bed bugs, thus minimizing inflammation and itching. One of the best corticosteroid cream in the market is Cortizone 10 Maximum Strength.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash the affected area with cool water and allow it to dry naturally</li>
<li>Apply a thin layer of the cream and massage gently until it disappears</li>
<li>Do not exceed 1-2 applications in a day</li>
<li>If you are using other skin treatments, allow about 30 minutes before applying to avoid them mixing on your skin</li>
<li>It is also advisable not to use the cream for more than 3 days since it can get absorbed into the bloodstream</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-retinoid-creams">2. Retinoid creams</h3>
<p>Retinoid creams can be used to reduce scarring and improve the appearance of scars from bed bug bites. Retinoids are not meant to treat the scars, but to diminish them. I recommend using Retinol Serum.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your skin with clean water and soap</li>
<li>Allow your skin to dry completely. Damp skin allows retinol to be absorbed deeper into the skin, leading to irritation.</li>
<li>Apply the retinol serum using your fingertips.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="3-mederma-advanced-scar-gel">3. Mederma Advanced Scar Gel</h3>

<ul>
<li>For new scars apply the gel once every day for eight weeks</li>
<li>For existing scars, apply the gel once every day for 3-6 month</li>
<li>Do not use the gel on fresh bed bug bites- wait until the bites have closed up</li>
<li>Also do not use it on children below 6 months old</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-vitamin-e-oil">4. Vitamin E Oil</h3>
<p>Vitamin E has been proven to be a potent remedy for skin rejuvenation. When applied to a bed bug scar, vitamin E cream will promote skin healing, thus reducing the scarring.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the scar thoroughly to remove oils and bacteria</li>
<li>Break the capsule with a pin and squeeze out the oil on a cotton ball</li>
<li>Dab the oil on the scar lightly without rubbing</li>
<li>Do not touch or spill the oil on clothing.</li>
<li>If you have to cover the wound, let it be for a while, to avoid trapping bacteria and fungus.</li>
<li>Allow 4-5 hours and wash within 8 hours</li>
<li>Use Vitamin E oil once every day until your scars disappear</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-witch-hazel">5. Witch Hazel</h3>
<p>Witch Hazel contains natural Salicylic Acid which has a drying effect on scars. When used on bed bug scars, this natural remedy will disinfect them and promote the healing and scar reduction process. It is enhanced with Aloe Vera for soothing and easing the itchiness.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash the affected skin thoroughly and allow to dry</li>
<li>Test the sensitivity of your skin on a small portion of your skin. You know that your skin is sensitive if theres irritation, redness or rashes. Do not use witch hazel if you have a reaction</li>
<li>Use a cotton ball or pad to apply witch hazel on the affected skin</li>
<li>If you are using witch hazel for the first time, apply once in a day. Once your skin becomes used to it, you can apply 2 times a day

<h3 id="6-salicylic-acid">6. Salicylic acid</h3>
<p>Some over-the-counter scar reduction treatments contain salicylic acid as the main ingredient. Its main purpose is to get rid of dead skin cells and prevent scaling.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Put argan oil and shea butter in bowl. Mix them thoroughly to get a creamy mixtureAdd salicylic acid powder and whisk thoroughly</li>
<li>Add organic lemon oil and mix evenly to get a fine cream.</li>
<li>Apply a small amount of the cream to the affected areas every night until you get satisfactory results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-silicone-gel">7. Silicone Gel</h3>
<p>Silicon gels are some of the newest scar treatment products in the market. Though new, silicon gels have proven to be very effective at improving the appearance of scars resulting from insect bites, sunburns, rashes etc. One of the best silicon gel in the market today is the ScarAway Scar Treatment Gel.
<em>Directions for use:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the affected area thoroughly and allow it to dry</li>
<li>Apply the gel in a thin layer</li>

<li>Allow 4-5 minutes before removing the excess gel with a soft cloth.</li>
<li>If necessary, apply a sunscreen</li>
<li>For good results apply twice daily until you achieve the desired results</li>
<li>How to Identify Bed Bug Bites
Although bed bug bites resemble those of other insects, it is possible to distinguish them using the following observations.
Bed bug bites exhibit a unique pattern. They appear in straight lines or zigzag.
Bed bugs like to attack the exposed parts such as hands, neck shoulders, arms, legs and face. The bites appear as either flat or raised, inflamed, itchy, blistered or red areas on the skin.
Bed bug bites can take as little as a few hours to as much as a whole week to appear on the skin.

around metros, hotels, planes, buses, and trains in most developed nations. Theres a common saying that reads, prevention is better than cure. This means that avoiding any way of adult or
baby bed bugs
getting into your property can stifle them to death.
Prominent and reputable motels are
battling with bed bug
issues. So when lodging in a hotel, ensure that your luggage is not exposed on the floor or bed.</p>
<h3 id="3-diatomaceous-earth-powder">3. Diatomaceous Earth Powder</h3>
<p>It is important to note that the
diatomaceous earth powder
will not pose any health threat to human beings. This is because the powder remains safe and
designed to only kill bed bugs
.
Besides, not allowing pets and children to play in an environment where the DE powder is applied makes it safer. Besides using diatomaceous earth, you can use
flea foggers
to kill fleas and bed bugs.
Pour the power inside your box springs, headboards, furniture legs, bed frames, and other hard to reach areas of the home. One thing about the DE
powder is that it will kill the bed bug
in an ephemeral time. Other options include
rubbing alcohol
, and
Ammonia,
steamers
.</p>
<h3 id="4-pest-management">4. Pest Management</h3>
<p>In the battle against
bed bugs
, using only one method may not resolve the problem. Like the DE powder,
spraying
, vacuuming, and other pugnacious ways, the pest management control method can also help kill bed bugs.
By hiring
pest control experts
to clean your home, you can finally end the infestation of bed bugs. These
experts know where to find bed bugs
in your house and do away with them for good.</p>
<h3 id="5-treat-crevices-and-cracks">5. Treat Crevices and Cracks</h3>
<p>The ability of
bed bugs to hide in secret
places is beyond despicable. In window sills, electrical sockets &amp; outlets, curtains, sofas, mattresses&rsquo; lining, carpets, floorboards, crevices of furniture, and cracks, there is no
place difficult for bed bugs to hide
.
Ensure to check the mentioned areas and cover any cracks on items in your house. Crevices of furniture and wall cracks can keep bed bugs alive for several years. Use sealants, cement, and other tough measures to cover crevices and cracks.</p>
<h3 id="5-hot-water-treatment">5. Hot Water Treatment</h3>
<p>If you suspect an item in your home to be infested by bed bugs, then waste no time to wash it in hot water. Washing with hot
water will help to destroy the larvae and eggs of bed bugs
.
Ensure that the affected item is placed into hot water for better results. Pillow covers, bed sheets, linen, clothes, and other apparent items should be put into both the dryer and washer and run through the highest temperature.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Apart from the methods mentioned above, you can
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-traps/">trap bed bugs</a>
and dont pick up things in awkward areas. Ensure not to make use of
bed bug pesticides and bombs
. Repeating the treatment process every three weeks can also help.
Items that are under serious infestation by bed bugs
should be discarded. Knowing the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-see-bed-bugs/">signs and symptoms of bed bug</a>
presence is the first way to get rid of them. Give it a try now.</p>

      <description>Bed bugs eggs</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs eggs
are oval in shape and measure about 1/16 inches long. A female bed bug lays about 200-250 eggs. The eggs hatch in 6-10 days, and the nymphs suck for a blood meal from humans.
Homeowners are mainly worried about bed bug nymphs and adults  the biting stages. But should they?
Well, you&rsquo;ll find also bed bug eggs in
clothes-bite-through-clothing/)
, box springs, bed frames, &amp;
mattresses</p>
<ul>
<li>crevices &amp; cracks.
<em>In this article, I tackle these questions on bed bug eggs- can you see bed bug eggs - what do they look like? Where do bed bugs lay their eggs? How long do bed bug eggs take to hatch? And finally, how to kill bed bug eggs?�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs--kill-bed-bugs">How to Kill Bed Bug Eggs  Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Female bed bugs lay their eggs on hard surfaces, and theyll hatch in 1-2 weeks to become Nymphs. Nymphs develop to adults, with a blood meal and temperature, within 2 weeks to 1 month.</p>
<h3 id="1-non-chemical-methods"><strong>1. Non-chemical methods�</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt>First, ensure that the technique you use to kill either the bed bugs or eggs is legal, effective, and safe. Check</dt>
<dt><a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/stay-legal-and-safe-treating-bed-bugs">the legal techniques</a></dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>For the non-chemical techniques, use the most appropriate for your situation - some are more effective. Below is the method I recommend to</dt>
<dt>kill the bed bug</dt>
<dt>eggs.</dt>
<dt><strong>- Heat treatment</strong></dt>
<dd>Try the
clothes dryer to kill the bed bug eggs</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>but use high heat - about 39
o
C to 51
o
C for over 30 minutes. Try a closed car under scotching sun - but enclose the clothes in plastic bags (black in color).
However, the effectiveness of the above-discussed method is dependent on your local factors, such as climate. Definitely, the DIY heat-treating techniques may not be effective in different circumstances.
Thus, you&rsquo;ll need to hire an exterminator as they&rsquo;ll come with high intensive options to treat your whole house. However, I would recommend you get yourself a
portable bed bug heater
as an alternative to hiring exterminators.
<strong>- Cold treatment</strong>
: I would recommend using this method for your home by placing infested items in a freezer fixed below -18
o
C.
However, the items under cold treatment must be placed in a sealed bag - this should be a cold treatment for about 1 week.
Also, check regularly that the freezer temperature is at -18
o
C - use a suitable thermometer.
<strong>- Steam treatment</strong>
(dry of wet
steamers
): Steam will very easily kill bed bug eggs that are hiding between bed frames, baseboards, carpets, fabric seams, and crevices.
Ensure that you use steam at a 55
o
C temperature and must not come with a tough airflow - this could make the bed bugs and their eggs to scatter. I would recommend using a diffuser to safeguard.
<strong>Bug bombs (foggers)</strong>
: I would recommend using
bug foggers/ bombs
cautiously, particularly ensuring the product is designed to kill bed bugs. However, bombs may lead to an explosion or fire if used carelessly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C84UEbRZWv4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C84UEbRZWv4</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-follow-up-with-and-inspection">2. Follow-up With and Inspection</h3>
<p>The next step will be inspecting your premises, home, rooms, and items such as furniture or clothes for evidence of any bed bugs, eggs, and
baby bed bugs
.
Any bed bugs evidence will signify that some bed bugs eggs may have hatched after the first clean up or bug treatment. You&rsquo;ll need to use another treatment method for another 1 or 2 rounds.
I would also recommend using desiccants that&rsquo;ll dry the fluids in the body of the bed bugs and their eggs. Luckily, no bed bugs will raise their chemical resistance to these desiccants.</p>
<h3 id="3avoid-food--or-pool-grade-diatomaceous-earth">3.�Avoid Food- or Pool-Grade Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>I recommend that you don&rsquo;t dare use the food- or pool-grade diatomaceous earth. These are dangerous because they are manufactured from fossilized diatoms.
The above DE may cause dangerous breathing problems. However, researchers recommend using DE that&rsquo;s approved as a pesticide - these will have diatoms of a different size.
Again, remember that
desiccants will kill bed bugs
and their eggs excellently, but it might take longer to show reliable results in your bug control process.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-bed-bug-eggs-look-like">What Do Bed Bug Eggs Look Like?</h2>
<p>**1. Color - **
Bed bug eggs
are pearl-white or semi-transparent colored &ldquo;beings,&rdquo; measuring about 0.1 inches (or just 2.5 mm).
However, for eggs that are over 5 days old - they&rsquo;ll have a dark mark that looks like an eye.
**2. Shape - **
Bed bug eggs are shaped like a barrel. But can you see them with your eyes?
Yes, in-fact bed bug eggs are about the size of an uncooked grain of rice or pinhead - this is just slightly smaller than
their nymphs
.
**3. Shiny and Sticky�- **
Bed bug eggs have a sticking body that allows them to cluster together easily.
Bed bugs (well, the females
) lay about 1 to 5 eggs each day.
The eggs&rsquo; sticky nature gives them a shiny appearance while also acting as glue to attack different surfaces.
**4. Egg husks - **
Well, the empty eggshells will also appear as if they&rsquo;re live eggs - but won&rsquo;t be shiny and flat plus dry. These husks also show signs of
bed bugs
in your space.
You&rsquo;ll find
bed bug husks on rough surfaces - you can see
them using a magnifying lens. But bed bugs
<a href="https://entomologytoday.org/2016/11/17/which-insecticide-spray-should-you-use-for-bed-bug-eggs/">won&rsquo;t die on their own</a></p>
<ul>
<li>so be sure there are some live bugs around.
<strong>Killing them</strong>
? First, vacuums will not strictly kill the bed bug eggs - but good
bed bug sprays
will do the magic - but ensure you do 2 - 3 treatments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-bed-bugs-lay-eggs">Where Do Bed Bugs Lay Eggs?</h2>
<p>Due to their sticky body, youll find bed bugs moving or
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/how-find-bed-bugs">stuck on cushions, couches, and wooden furniture</a>
, including different fabrics like cotton, wool, denim, and metal or plastics.</p>
<h3 id="1-beds---box-springs-bed-buttons--mattress">1. Beds - Box Springs, Bed Buttons, &amp; Mattress</h3>
<p>Bed bugs have a complete life-cycle - egg, the nymph, and the bugs adult. The name of this bugs denotes why theyll quickly infest your box springs, bed frames, and mattresses.
Youll see bed bug eggs near the bed edges, bed buttons, and mattresses too. However, you can also find them on rough surfaces glued tight.
But since the female adults (fertilized ones) will lay roughly 200 eggs total  which will hatch into Nymphs within 1-2 weeks.�Bed bug eggs will be deposited in protected areas, crevices, cracks, and dark areas.
<strong>Bed Buttons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Youll also find bed bug eggs around egg-laying areas such as the edges, folds, and seams of your mattress, as well as bed buttons. Further, inspect the box springs and the area they touch with your mattress.
I recommend you also inspect the walls, floor, and bed frame as these areas may also hide many bed bug eggs.
Bed bug encasement
has no phthalates, fire retardants, vinyl, or PVC  and are thus simple to clean.
Nymphs start sucking human blood promptly once theyre hatched. If the Nymphs get adequate food and appropriate temperature (just room temperature), theyll molt into adults in 2-4 weeks.
The Nymphs will Instar (shed skins) roughly 5 times until they develop into adults. Interestingly, mature
bed bugs will survive
for multiple months after taking a blood meal.

<h3 id="2floor-and-carpet-bed-bugs">2.<strong>Floor and Carpet bed bugs:�</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt>Bed bugs may hitchhike your clothes or even the pets</dt>
<dt>but they may eventually hide on your floor or carpet</dt>
<dt>after talking a full blood meal. So, you might want to inspect under chairs, dressers, and bed frame legs.</dt>
<dt><a href="https://youtu.be/nEbBWk-Zwq8">https://youtu.be/nEbBWk-Zwq8</a></dt>
<dt>So, you may want to</dt>
<dt><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/">check your carpet for bed bugs</a></dt>
<dt>, particularly the hidden areas, seams, crevices, and cracks. I would say that using heat treatment and steam will</dt>
<dt>kill the bed bugs</dt>
<dt>eggs while theyre hidden in the carpet fibers.</dt>
<dt>Further, check the around your baseboards and walls at the edges of the floor. Further, inspect and treat the joints and cracks around your hardwood floors. For the carpet, pull it off and check along or below the tack strips.</dt>
<dt><strong>Caution</strong></dt>
<dd>Dont just mop or sweep the floor since this will shift the bed bugs eggs to another location in the room or house.
However, a steamer or vacuum would be a great alternative since itll suck any of the bed bug eggs lying around on the carpet or floor.
<em>Vacuuming or Treating Bare Floors for Bed Bugs:�</em>
For bare floors, I recommend using a vacuum machine plus
diatomaceous earth for cat fleas
. Here are the steps to take while at it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Use a powder duster to spread the DE dust on the bare floor. However, remember to put on a dust mask to avoid hurting your breathing system, including the lungs.</li>
<li>Now, vacuum your floors keenly to remove all the DE. Pay special attention to vacuuming the crevices and cracks that are between the floorboards and the tiles.
*Vacuuming or Wall-To-Wall Carpet for Bed Bugs: *
To clean your carpet (the wall-2-wall), use
diatomaceous earth
, vacuuming, and shampooing the carpet.</li>
<li>Use a duster to spread the DE over the whole carpet. Equally, also put on a dust mask to protect your breathing system from the harsh diatomaceous earth.Next, keenly vacuum your wall-to-wall carpet to remove all thediatomaceous earththat was spread earlier.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dealing with bed bugs in carpets can be a frustrating and challenging task, as these pests hide deep within fibers and along edges. Fortunately, there are effective methods to eliminate them - from natural powders like
<strong>diatomaceous earth</strong>
and
<strong>borax</strong>
to
<strong>heat treatments, steaming, and thorough vacuuming</strong>
.</p>
<p>This guide explores five proven ways to eradicate bed bugs from your carpet, ensuring a pest-free home. Whether you prefer DIY solutions or professional help, these strategies will help you tackle the infestation effectively. Lets dive in!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-bed-bugs-from-carpets">How to Remove Bed Bugs from Carpets</h2>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth"><strong>1. Diatomaceous Earth</strong></h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth is a safe, affordable and easy to use powder that can be conveniently used to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">get rid of bed bug in carpets</a>
. Its a natural ingredient mined from decomposed organisms known as diatoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The microscopic diatoms in the diatomaceous earth are sharp fragments which can easily penetrate into the body of insects including <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs. Once in contact with the bed bugs body, DE powder gets through the exoskeleton and dehydrates the insect of its internal fluids causing it to die.</li>
<li>To use diatomaceous earth, apply a thin layer on the top side of the affected carpet and along the space between the carpet and baseboard. The substance works within a few hours but you can allow a few days to enable more bed bugs to interact with it.
Vacuum the carpet to remove the dead bed bugs and the remnants of the powder. If you have a large infestation you may have to apply the powder several times.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend using only food grade DE powder because it is safe around your kids and pets.</p>
<h3 id="2-borax-powder"><strong>2. Borax Powder</strong></h3>
<p>Another effective treatment for bed bugs in your carpet is the
borax powder and boric acid
. It kills bed bugs in a mechanical action like the diatomaceous earth powder. Once in contact with the bed bug, it rips the outer shell and gets inside. This dehydrates the insect, eventually causing it to die.</p>
<ul>
<li>To use borax powder on bed bugs, sprinkle a sufficient amount on the carpet and the space between the carpet and the baseboard or wall. This will ensure that bed bugs that hide under the carpet get into contact with the powder as they come out.
Vacuum the carpet after a few days to remove dead bed bugs and the remains of the powder. As a precaution, do not use borax powder around kids and pets since it can cause skin irritation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-heat-treatment-and-steaming"><strong>3. Heat Treatment and steaming</strong></h3>
<p>Treating your carpet to certain temperatures will kill bed bugs together with their eggs. One advantage of this treatment is the ability of heat to penetrate anywhere bed bugs may be hiding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat treatment will kill bed bugs even in the gap between your carpet and baseboard or wall.�However, heat treatment comes with high cost for equipment and energy used.</li>
<li>For this reason, you need the services of professional pest exterminators who will utilize specialized equipment to treat your carpet.
Heat treatment involves raising the temperature inside the house to levels which bed bugs, larvae and their eggs cannot survive. Before the treatment, all individuals, pets and everything that is sensitive to heat should be evacuated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-steam-treatment"><strong>4. Steam Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>Steam treatment can effectively kill bed bugs and their eggs when used with a carpet shampoo and a compound that kills bed bugs. The compound of choice should however not react with the cleaning agent or stain your carpet.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a heavy-duty steamer for this task. This treatment utilizes at triple action to kill bed bugs, larvae and eggs. These<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/">bed bug Steamers</a>will be a great addition to your DIY store.
Apart from the steam and the compound, bed bugs will be crushed to death by the physical movement of the steamer brush.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-vacuuming-bed-bugs-from-carpet"><strong>5. Vacuuming Bed Bugs From Carpet�</strong></h3>
<p>Can I use a vacuum cleaner to remove bed bugs in my carpet? This is a common question that I encounter as a pest eradication expert.</p>
<p>Well, while vacuuming can help reduce the number of bed bugs in your carpet, it will not give you a permanent solution to the problem. However, vacuuming can help you achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove clusters or groups of bed bugs in a short time.</li>
<li>Minimize the use insecticides in heavily infested areas that may require several treatment cycles.</li>
<li>Remove bed bugs that are resistant to insecticides</li>
<li>Remove isolated bed bugs.</li>
<li>Eliminate bed bugs in cluttered or hard to reach places.</li>
<li>Convenient removal of bed bugs from areas where it is not safe or practical to use insecticides.</li>
<li>Clean the area of dead bed bugs, feces and other debris to allow easy inspection for bed bugs or proper use of insecticides.
The effectiveness of vacuuming depends on the extent of the bed bug infestation. If the infestation is severe, vacuuming will only reduce the number of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no chemicals are used alongside vacuuming, new infestations will develop shortly afterwards.�Thus, most pest exterminators use vacuuming as a supplement to other bed bug control methods.</p>
<p>A vacuum cleaner cant just suck all bed bugs or even dislodge their eggs for your carpet. There are high chances that many bed bugs will be left on your carpet and will continue reproducing.</p>
<p>Even so, vacuuming is a great remedy for bed bug control. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results when vacuuming your carpet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make use of a handheld vacuum cleaner with a powerful suction. A special attachment can be used to suck the bed bugs that hide along the space between the carpet and the baseboard or wall.</li>
<li>The brush of the cleaner should press gently on the carpet. Pressing too hard might brush bed bugs off the carpet without sucking them.</li>
<li>You can sprinkle some diatomaceous earth powder on the carpet so that the bed bugs are picked up together with the powder. DE powder will kill the bed bugs when they mix up in the attached bag or canister.</li>
<li>When youre done, take the vacuum cleaner outside and make sure no bed bug escapes through the hose. Remove the vacuum bag carefully and seal it in an airtight plastic bag for later disposal.</li>
<li>If youre using a bagless vacuum cleaner, put the debris in a plastic bag and damp them in trash. The canister should then be cleaned with hot water and soap to kill any remaining bed bugs and their eggs. Care should be taken not to short circuit the electrical components.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>For better results, regular vacuuming is inevitable. Usually bed bugs will cluster in their usual favourite locations. These are the areas to concentrate on during subsequent vacuuming. Plus you can keep checking your carpet regularly for any signs of bed bugs.</p>
<p>Experts recommend using vacuum cleaning in conjunction with heat treatment, freezing or steaming to eradicate bed bugs. This improves the overall effectiveness of your vacuuming efforts. To minimise infestation, keep your house free from cluttered stuff. Bed bugs take advantage of this mess to hide and breed.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eucalyptus oil is a natural and effective way to get rid of bed bugs -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-lavender-kill-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/essential-oils-for-bed-bugs/)/">just like with lavender</a>
. So, for details on how to use eucalyptus oil for bed bugs, read on for this
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diy-bed-bug-spray/">DIY bed bug control</a>
guide.
<strong>You can mix 10-20 drops with 30 ml of water and use to spray the bedding and mattress. Lavender, peppermint, tea tree, and eucalyptus essential oils are good at keeping bed bugs away as they don&rsquo;t like their strong odors.</strong>
<strong>We suggest putting a couple of drops of each of these essential oils on the corners of your bed - but don&rsquo;t tough it: The odor should last for days, effectively driving away bed bugs.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-use-eucalyptus-oil-for-bed-bugs">Details: How To Use Eucalyptus Oil For Bed Bugs</h2>
<h3 id="1-mild-versus-severe-bed-bug-infestations">1. Mild Versus Severe Bed Bug Infestations</h3>
<p>Eucalyptus oil, an �essential oil, will effectively control mild infestations, and is a good idea to have on hand as an emergency measure. The best way to use it for bed bugs is in your washer when you&rsquo;re washing the sheet; this will also kill mites.
But for treating severe infestations of bed bugs, you should consult a
professional exterminator
or use Insecticides such as pyrethroids, pyrethrins (chrysanthemum flowers extract), and neonicotinoids.
Eucalyptus oil may cause skin irritation or damage so diluting with water before spraying clothes or furniture with it is recommended.
In some cases, eucalyptus oil may make symptoms worse if inhaled directly from the bottle without first mixing it up in another container because some individuals are allergic to this substance.</p>
<h3 id="2-on-mattressand-bed-sheets">2. On Mattress�and Bed sheets</h3>
<p>For your mattress�and bed sheets, spray�the eucalyptus oil solution on the mattress, then use a clean cloth to wipe it in.
You may also add the eucalyptus oil onto your laundry loads (like in washers) in order to kill bed bugs and their eggs.
A couple drops each of these essential oils can be applied in a few places around your room - on corners of furniture or underneath objects.</p>
<h3 id="3-f"><strong>3. F****urniture and other Household items</strong></h3>
<p>You can also use eucalyptus oil to clean your furniture and various household items, like carpets.
Ensure that the area is well ventilated before applying any of these oils because they may cause damage to our respiratory system when inhaled directly from the bottle without first mixing it up in another container!
When cleaning with this essential oil, be careful not get it on electric switches or furniture so that you don&rsquo;t accidentally start a fire with all those flames around.
The odor should last enough days (both by masking existing smells while providing the smell itself) to effectively drive them off once it is detected.</p>
<h2 id="making-eucalyptus-oil-spray-against-bed-bugs"><strong>Making Eucalyptus-Oil Spray Against Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>To make the eucalyptus oil repellent or spray; the requirements are as follows: 30 ml of water, 20 drops of eucalyptus oil, and a small spray bottle.
Next, mix the spray ingredients together in the bottle and shake it well. Heavy bug infestations might require a stronger eucalyptus oil to kill both adults and eggs.
Then, spray the mixture onto bedding or mattresses to deter the bed bugs from sleeping there - this will get rid or repel the bed bugs. Also, spray into those hard-to-reach corners where bed bugs love hiding out.
The bed bugs themselves will be deterred from crawling over those sprayed surfaces in order to avoid contact with the repellent effect and being killed by it as well.

<p>Eucalyptus oil may be toxic when ingested so it is important to be cautious around children and pets.
Avoid skin contact with eucalyptus oil as it may also cause skin irritation, contact dermatitis and an allergic reaction.
Lemon peel extract may help relieve any irritation from using eucalyptus oil on bare skin.
Don&rsquo;t forget to label any bottles of liquid (with the eucalyptus oil solution) - especially ones containing this potent substance like pure peppermint extract.
Eucalyptus oil-based products will act as both pesticides and insect repellents; these oils also have antimicrobial properties which can kill bacteria.</p>
<h2 id="other-alternative-bed-bug-control-methods">Other Alternative Bed Bug Control Methods?</h2>
<p>Another option is to buy
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">bed bug-proof mattress</a>
and pillows, as these are more likely to keep the bugs away from you while still being comfortable enough for a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<h3 id="1lemon-grass-oil">1.<em>Lemon Grass Oil</em></h3>
<p>Add the lemon grass oil to your washer (laundry) - it has high levels of citronellol and citronellal, which are both natural insect repellents.
So, add 30ml of lemon grass oil to the hot water and detergent for a full load (or use about 15 drops in your hand or spray bottle).
Spray on bedding every few days; can also be sprayed on mattress, carpeting, pillows, etc. You can put some drops on corners of bed as well - this will help keep bugs away from that area.
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/5/4/849/htm">A 2014 Changlu Wang�study</a>
showed that the citronellol in lemon grass oil (and other essential oils) is an effective deterrent against bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) in comparison to the synthetic repellent DEET.</p>
<h3 id="2tea-tree-oil">2.<em>Tea Tree Oil</em></h3>
<p>Tea tree oil has been shown to be effective against bed bugs - killing them and other insects on contact - but use it undiluted as it&rsquo;ll trigger allergic reactions and skin irritation.
Add a few drops of tea tree oil on the corners of your bed or mattress and around any doorway where you think they may enter.
Spray items in closets with tea tree essential oils as well for an added level of protection. Blood orange oil is also a great natural remedy for bed bugs.
Bed nets will also help protect against bed bugs; they can be put over your head when it&rsquo;s time to go asleep or laid out on top of the sheets before putting them in your hamper every day.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in conclusion, on how to use eucalyptus oil for bed bugs; simply mix 10 - 20 drops of that oil with 30ml of water and use to spray the bedding or other surfaces.
For laundry or when using washers, add some drops of this eucalyptus oil and this will help kill bed bugs and their eggs.
Sprinkling with peppermint will also work well at keeping good against these pests - so stay tuned in! The bottom line is that you may need more than one treatment before getting rid of all those nasty bed bugs.</p>

      <description>Bed bugs are warm-blooded, reddish-brown, and wingless pests that survive from blood meals.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs are warm-blooded, reddish-brown, and wingless pests that survive from blood meals.
But what&rsquo;s the lifespan of a bed bug without blood.
<strong>In brief; adult bed bugs will live for 400 days (a year) without taking�that blood meal (they&rsquo;re well resilient) while the nymphs will only survive for 20 to 90 days.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thus, there is a very limited chance that you can starve the bed bugs to their death as the 20 to 400 days will be too long before they die.�</strong>
But luckily for you,
female
bed bugs will not reproduce without taking that crucial and
regular
blood meal. The
nutrients in the
blood allow them to lay eggs - reproduce.</li>
<li>But the bed bug&rsquo;s flattened body allows them to hide in upholstered furniture, beds, carpets, and floor cracks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-do-bed-bugs-die-if-there-is-no-blood-meal">When Do Bed Bugs Die If There is no Blood Meal?</h2>
<p>Adult bed bugs will survive or live for about 400+ days without taking that blood meal (human contact) - but at the low laboratory temperatures.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the bed bug nymphs will die within 1-5 months if they don&rsquo;t get that blood meal. Further, the females won&rsquo;t reproduce without taking the blood meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bed bugs will molt to their next stage if they acquire a blood meal - this is to complete that life cycle - but they must also have the right temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, on how the bed bugs will survive or live without that blood meal, the answer depends on the bed bug&rsquo;s age. For example, age affects if the bed bug stage is resistant to temperature variations andspecific pesticides/).
The <a href="/posts/baby-bed-bugs/">bed</a> bugs that are newly hatched such as the Nymphs - will require to feed soonest (and very often) so that they can molt into adults - but that stage can survive for a number of weeks without that crucial blood meal.</li>
<li>But the adults will live for over 5 months with warm conditions - but most of these bugs will be in the digesting phase and not the feeding stage.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jPWM6peI38">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jPWM6peI38</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-bed-bugs-reproduce-without-feeding">Can Bed Bugs Reproduce Without Feeding?</h2>
<p>Female bed bugs will lay their eggs that have some adhesive and this makes sure they&rsquo;ll stick in one place - these will take about 6-17 days to hatch.
The young-lings will start feeding after emerging from the eggs - but the adults and nymphs will survive for some time with no food or blood meal.
So, the main challenge when controlling these bed bugs is having to know when they&rsquo;re done. Thus, since you can&rsquo;t see all the bed bugs in the space, it&rsquo;ll be hard to decide you&rsquo;ve won.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, after encasing objects, spraying, or even<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/">steaming for the bed bugs</a>- you&rsquo;re not sure when it&rsquo;s enough.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-can-bed-bugs-live-in-an-empty-house">How Long Can Bed Bugs Live in An Empty House?</h2>
<p>In an empty house, bed bugs will survive for about 8 to 18 months without that critical blood meal. Thus, leaving the house empty for over a year may reduce the bed bug population.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, even when there are no bed bugs in the house, the bed bugs might some blood source from petslike shrews, mice, andrats to survive.
But bed bugs are excellent in hibernating cold temperature and lack of blood meal in the spaces such as in the empty houses - thus it&rsquo;ll challenging to specifically pinpoint when the bugs will die from starvation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues or conditions that&rsquo;ll affect how long the bed bugs survive or live without that blood meal in your empty house are:
<strong>1. Bed Bug Life Stage�</strong>
Bed bugs will require massive blood to develop from nymph stage (via 5 steps) to become adults - these stages demand rapid development.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s the reason the bed bug nymphs will live shorter (about 2 months) if it won&rsquo;t get that blood meal after hatching.</li>
<li>However, when the nymphs have feed and appear reddish - they&rsquo;ll survive even up to 8 months without feeding - taking that human blood meal.
But the adults will prove more stubborn when it comes to starving when it lack a blood meal - they&rsquo;ll survive for slightly over 1 year (around 1.5 years) in their dormant condition without taking blood.</li>
<li>Thus, its evident that it won&rsquo;t be possible to starve those bed bugs by simply leaving the house for a another home and coming back later.
Thus, bed bugs largely survive for long with no blood meal thanks to remaining in that hibernation (semi-dormant) state as they use less energy and have slowed metabolism.
<strong>2. Weather and Temperature</strong>
Despite that bed bus will evidently survive for long even when your house is empty, this will depend largely on the prevalent temperatures.</li>
<li>The don&rsquo;t love overly cold or overly warm in the empty spaces and house - and if the temperatures are extreme, these bugs will die in a number of weeks.
Notably, the bed bugs will withstand just about 25 degrees Fahrenheit - just a number of days. Thus, for the houses in extreme weather - you can leave the empty space to exterminate the bugs.</li>
<li>Further, for the extreme high temperatures such as above 113 degrees Fahrenheit - the bugs would also die.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, the�lifespan of a bed bug without blood is about 2 months to 13 months - so you&rsquo;ll require
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/">spraying</a></p>
<ul>
<li>they won&rsquo;t reproduce easily with no that human blood meal.</li>
<li>So, you can reduce the scratching and itching brought by the bed bug bites - this is by reducing the supply of food. But practically, bed bugs will go hunting for any available host to suck blood from them.</li>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_bug">bedbug</a>
by just looking.
*On male vs. female bed bugs; female bedbugs have rounded abdomen while male counterparts have pointed ones. Unlike females, males don&rsquo;t lay eggs. *</p>
<ul>
<li>*However, they participate in the reproduction process (mating). Both male and female bedbugs are brown in color and move equally fast - including *baby bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-male-vs-female-bed-bug">Details: Male Vs Female Bed Bug</h2>
<p>Though male and female bedbugs have wings, they are too small to enable them to fly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since bedbugs are risky to human health, it&rsquo;s important to know signs and ways to curb their infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-body-structure-or-layout">a. Body Structure or layout</h3>
<p>Bedbugs (both male and female) are characterized by three body parts (head, thorax, and abdomen) and three pairs of legs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though both genders have wings, they can&rsquo;t help when it comes to flying - the wings are vestigial.
The body structure of male and female bedbugs is covered with an exoskeleton composed of soft body tissues.</li>
<li>*Bedbugs (male &amp; female) have stripe mark patterns on their abdomen and have equal body size. *
<em>Their body layout is made up of the head, thorax, and abdomen. The movement is made possible with the help of 3 pairs of legs that are strategically fixed.�</em>

</ul>
<h3 id="b-color">b. Color</h3>
<p>Male and female bedbugs are brown in color. The color varies from medium brown to dark brown, especially when they suck plenty of blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you pay close attention to their skin color (using a microscope or hand lens), you&rsquo;ll notice a slight variance in male color as compared to the female bedbug.
This is attributed to the internal organs each insect has. A female bedbug has hemocoel and ovaries, whereas a male doesn&rsquo;t have.
Therefore, the female bedbug has dark brown spots along the hemocoel lining towards the back.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-size">c. Size</h3>
<p>Generally, male and female bedbugs are the same. Actually, they are tiny and appear like apple seeds - about 1-2mm long.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since male bedbugs have pointed abdomen, they may appear longer, though that may not be the actual case - the length is negligible.
In comparison, for each stage of the bedbug&rsquo;s life cycle, both genders have similar sizes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-movement">d. Movement</h3>
<p>Female and male bedbugs move equally fast. Also, they scuttle in the same way.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, during the reproduction stage, the female bedbug may move slower than the male one due to the weight of eggs yet to be laid.
Since movement is the major option for bedbugs to escape for safety, the motion could be relatively high for you to catch them with your hands easily.

</ul>
<h3 id="e-shape">e. Shape</h3>
<p>Female bedbugs have rounded abdomen (when viewed side by side). Contrary, male bedbugs have pointed abdomen (towards the rear end).
When bedbugs feed on sufficient blood meal, the shape of the abdomen is not noticed easily - it unifies with the general body shape.</p>
<h3 id="f-bug-pattern">f. Bug pattern</h3>
<p>Both female and male bedbugs have patterns on their abdomen. These patterns are the necessary mechanism used when their body expand after a blood meal - just like an accordion does.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male stripe patterns run from left to right, while females one curve as they cross the ridge.</li>
<li>The female bedbug has a slight ridge at the back area near the hemocoel lining - the organ makes the patterns more conspicuous.
It&rsquo;s difficult to notice patterns on thirsty bedbugs because pattern marks shrink onto the body and camouflage with brown body color.

</ul>
<h2 id="do-male-or-female-bedbug-bites">Do Male or Female Bedbug Bites?</h2>
<p>Both male and female bedbug bites in search of blood meals. The extent or severity of the bite is the same for either male or female bedbugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice reddish-brown swelling on the skin (bedbug bite). Normally, bedbugs bite severally around a given area - this could be your arm, neck, or body.</li>
<li>Unlike a spider&rsquo;s bite, a bedbug&rsquo;s bite won&rsquo;t swell that much - it&rsquo;s just slight, but extended along the surface.
Bedbugs have a mouthpart that has a proboscis, which is sunk into your skin when sucking blood meal.
Bedbug&rsquo;s bite is accompanied by itching effects that make you tend to scratch your skin on that particular surface thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-bedbug-gender-is-more-dangerous">Which Bedbug Gender is More Dangerous?</h2>
<p>The severity of the bedbug&rsquo;s bite is a function of the number of attacks you experience and the degree of infestation.
If you are attacked by a huge number of bedbugs, then, you will have serious injuries or swellings as compared to limited numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male bedbug bites equally as their female counterpart. However, female bedbug tends to suck more blood at a time, especially when about to lay eggs.</li>
<li>Remember, it&rsquo;s a requirement for a female bedbug to have enough blood meal before laying eggs.
Contrary, male bedbugs don&rsquo;t need extra blood when mating and therefore, they bite gently on the skin surface.
We can say that a bedbug colony dominated by females is more dangerous than one with more males - this is just a comparative assumption derived from the above behavior of these insects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-male-bedbug-lay-eggs">Can Male Bedbug Lay Eggs?</h2>
<p>Male bedbugs can&rsquo;t lay eggs whatsoever. Basically, male bedbugs just mate to provide male reproductive cells necessary for fertilization.
In addition, male bedbugs don&rsquo;t have ovaries and hemocoel, which are necessary organs for reproduction and eggs preparation.

<h2 id="do-female-bedbugs-lay-eggs-without-male">Do Female Bedbugs Lay Eggs Without Male?</h2>
<p>Female bedbugs cant lay eggs without males since they need sperms (male reproductive cells) from males for fertilization purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, female bedbugs only lay eggs after fertilization has taken place - this occurs after mating has occurred.</li>
<li>During the mating process, the male bedbug transfers sperms into the female hemocoel, upon which the female ova get fertilized.
However, female bedbugs may not lay eggs immediately, it may take some time until there is the uptake of enough blood meal after which the eggs are laid.
Female bedbugs can store male&rsquo;s sperms for long and allow fertilized eggs to be laid at a convenient time of the year - perhaps when there is plenty of blood meal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-signs-show-you-have-bedbugs-infestation">Which Signs Show you Have Bedbugs Infestation?</h2>
<p>You will be having bedbugs infestation if you notice some of the following signs in your place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presence of dark spots on clothes, couches, or mattresses - these are usually bedbug&rsquo;s waste</li>
<li>Debris of dead bedbugs (exoskeleton) on sheets, mattresses, couches, or furniture</li>
<li>Reddish-brown swellings on the skin surface - they are usually itching and makes one scratch themselves</li>
<li>Live bedbugs moving about at night or partly during the day</li>
<li>Presence of bedbug&rsquo;s eggs on your items - lumps of eggs

<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-bedbugs">How Do You Get Rid of Bedbugs?</h2>
<p>The following are possible ways of getting rid of bedbug infestation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum thoroughly, bedbug-infested items - using a vacuum cleaner</li>
<li>Wash infested clothes or items with super hot water - bedbugs can&rsquo;t survive in very high temperature</li>
<li>Soak infested items in soapy detergents for 12 hours - the detergents over hydrate bedbugs leading to death. At times bedbugs die of suffocation</li>
<li>Heating bedbug-infested room to a temperature above 120 degrees</li>
<li>Steam all bedbugs infested items - use a steam sprayer</li>
<li>Dispose of bedbug-infested items- you can burn them or throw them far away</li>
<li>Using bedbug sprays or commercial killers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-see-bed-bugs/">male vs female bed bugs</a>

<p>The bites are usually found on the body parts that are
exposed to the bed bugs
while you sleep. These could be the neck, hands, shoulders, legs, arms, and face. Though not the usual case,
bed bug bites
are usually found in small groups.</p>
<p>In the bitten area, they might be linear or in the form of a zigzag. If you see small, raised, or flat spots that might become itchily inflamed or blistered, then you might be a
victim of a bed bug bite
.
The type and time of reaction depend on the type of
skin and the number of bites
from the insects. Some people get skin reactions long after the bites, while some call it almost immediately.
The fact is that reactions dont occur immediately you receive a bite. It could take from a few minutes to one week. This is also the time that your body starts to manifest the bite symptoms. When they pierce the skin to suck blood,
bed bugs inject with their saliva
, an anti-coagulant.

<h2 id="symptoms-of-bed-bug-bite-bite-identification">Symptoms of Bed Bug Bite-Bite Identification</h2>
<p>Some people will develop itching, and some will develop red welts or swelling the following day after receiving the bite. Still, other people will not show any signs of bites several days after the event.</p>
<p>Moreover, some people dont react to the bed bug bites; neither do they have any marks after getting bitten. This means the problem will go totally unnoticed.
Compared to bites of other insects, the
bed bug bites will always appear
in grouped, small red marks on the areas that have been bitten.
In the beginning, the victim will encounter a slight burning sensation. This is followed by itchiness, and then the area might turn red and or swell slightly. The duration for the symptoms to appear varies among individuals.
The red bumps formed after the bites are known as wheals or papules. If the biting was extreme, the swellings might turn into skin inflammations that look like blisters.</p>

Sleep deprivation is another
problem caused by bed bugs
. The bites come with the itchiness that could keep you awake all night. Due to a lack of adequate sleep, one might suffer from heart infections, impaired thinking, and accidents.
Due to the quick
spread of bed bugs
at home, living in a house infested with some might be stressful and frustrating. If you live in a stressful condition for a long period, you will end up with emotional anxiety, hence reducing your work productivity.
From emotional anxiety, you might develop unhealthy behaviors such as excessive smoking and drinking that might impact your immune system.

The size of bed bugs tends to change as it feeds and grows from
one life stage to the next
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their eggs measure about 1/32 inches long, while adults will measure 3/16 inches in length. Once the bugs suck blood - itll engorge to roughly 1/5 inches to 1/4 inches.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Color</strong></dt>
<dd>The color of Adult
bed bugs will vary depending
on when they are fed on a meal of blood from their host. Theyll be
<em>light brown</em>
and have an oval-shaped/ flat body when theyve not recently fed on blood.</dd>
<dt><strong>Shape</strong></dt>
<dd>Adult
bed bugs
are small, flattened, and oval-shaped insects that have considerably reduced wings. Theyre visible to the human eye. Other names of these bugs are mahogany flats, chinches, or red coats.
Adults are about one-sixth of the whole
bed bug population
.� The hemelytra (fore wings) are broad and short with a rectangular shape. Also, the bed bugs sides are covered by stiff and
short hair
.
<strong>Bed Bug Legs</strong></dd>
<dd>Bed bugs have two antennae plus six legs. The bugs body looks stripped due to their
short
body hair thats golden looking in color.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Media coverage on bed bugs recommends searching behind walls, examining bed and mattress, looking behind picture frames/ pictures, and in walls.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Real bed bug waste</strong></dt>
<dd>Bed bug poop will look like tiny clustered spots on the bed frames. The poop is mainly made of digested blood that turns black, rust-colored, and darker after drying.</dd>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Definition</strong></dt>
<dd>Adult bed bugs will measure about a quarter-inch (4 - 5mm) in length and are reddish-brown.
They are flat to oval-shaped, depending on the amount of blood theyve sucked. However, adult bed bugs and make just one-sixth of these bugs population.
<em>Baby bed bugs</em></dd>
<dd>But, baby bed bugs will mainly be pale white and about a millimeter in millimeter at birth and will readily blend with the background. So, lets get into the details.</dd>

<p>Bed bugs will hide
in most furniture types - particularly in their undersides, seams, and corners.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rule of thumb is that bed bugs will fit in any crack that can also take a credit card.<em>Check the bugs below hanging on sofas!�</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Rarely will bed bugs hide in vinyl, suede, or leather sofa or couch materials.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if you sit on an infested chair or couch - its highly likely that youllcarry the bed bugs to your home.

*So, youre wondering, would keeping your very clean prevent a bed bug infestation? *</li>
<li>Well, not really; bed bugs will attack whether the place is dirty or clean. However, with a clean house, youll find it easy to spot any bed bugs lucking around.</li>
<li>Exterminators recommend that youwash the bed sheets using hot water, avoid buying second-hand furniture, use a mattress cover, reduce room clutter, and inspect hotel rooms for bed bugs.

<p>Youll find most
dead bed bugs
to be shriveled and lying on their back. If you inspect your mattresses and box spring, you might notice
signs of bed bugs

<p>Some may include dead bed bugs or specks of blood.�Have you found some dead bed bugs in your house? - Check the one below.</p>

<li>Therefore, any of them that remains entirely still after some disturbance is most likely dying or dead.
Any bugs that are still alive will run away with subtle lighting (

<h3 id="2-pictures-ofbaby-bed-bugs"><strong>2. Pictures of�baby bed bugs</strong></h3>
<p>Baby
bed bugs will hatch from eggs
(theyre pinhead-sized) and grow to be adults in only one month. But these insects will require a dry and warm environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bug eggs (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/bed-bugs-appearance-and-life-cycle">nymphs</a>) are visible using your naked eye - theyre colored translucent (when freshly hatching) to whitish-yellow/ brownish as they continue feeding.</li>
<li>After hatching from the eggs, baby Cimex lectularius quickly hunts for a good blood meal. Without a blood meal, the bugs wont develop to their next stage.
Despite that they can endure days even up to 1 month devoid of feeding, the bugs can feed even once daily while also casting their skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bed bug larvae measure about a millimeter when they are born, and they tend to be pale white, which makes them blend readily with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can see blood inside a nymph babies body after it has had its generous blood meal.
Youll notice that these bugs look anything like a small swollen balloon. To treat these bed bugs infestations,

<h2></h2>
<p>Well, for a small bed bug infestation, could be just one female whos mated and shes in a package or your home - and thats all theyll require.
The bed bug needs to feed on blood to nourish the eggs shed produce.</p>
<h3 id="3-pictures-of-bed-bug-eggs-theyre-oval--white">3. Pictures of Bed bug Eggs (Theyre Oval &amp; White)</h3>
<p>Females will lay about
250 eggs over their lifetime
, which is about 2-4 months.
The oval and white eggs are 1/16 inches in length - something like the rice grain - and youll mainly find them in crevices and cracks.</p>
<p>The eggs have round ends with an elongated and oval-shaped body.</p>
<ul>
<li>The eggs are attached to a glue-type substance thatll render them challenging to remove or move.</li>
<li>But the eggs have a wet spot look - you can use a flashlight plus a magnifying lens to search for them.
Theyll hatch into babies in about 6-10 days.
Further, its nymphs tend to mold about five times before attaining adulthood. Need a video instead? Check this right below.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-males-vs-female-bed-bugs">3. Males vs. Female Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>The main
difference between females vs. male bed bugs
is that they have a rounded abdomen while the males have a pointed abdomen.

<dt>[/caption]</dt>
<dt><em>Females</em></dt>
<dd>Female
bed bugs will only lay eggs
if they mate with their male counterparts - they need the males sperm. Females have a
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/2/2/151">hemocoel</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>an empty abdominal space to store their eggs.</li>
<li>After mating, the females will store sperm from the males and even draw from it to create mature eggs multiple times.
Besides sperms, female bed bugs require a
bed bug blood meal
before creating and laying their eggs.
<em>Males</em>
: Male dont produce eggs, and they lack ovaries. Males will break through the females shell, aim at the abdomen (its tiny dark spot) to deposit their sperms in the hemocoel.
The sperms
spread via the blood of the female bed bugs
until it reaches the ovaries - in what we term traumatic insemination.
**Bed Bug Patterns **</li>
<li>Female and male bed bugs have stripes patterns that move right to the left. They use this system to allow abdominal expansion when feeding on blood.</li>
<li>However, the females will show a small ridge at the back near its tail - the exact hemocoel location.</li>
<li>Therefore, youll notice that the stripes will look somehow curved as they cross this ridge on their back.
<strong>Bed Bug Skin Color</strong></li>
<li>Definitely, it&rsquo;s possible to
see through the bed bugs&rsquo;
skin despite brown hair. So, weve noted that females and males hold (based on their functions) internal organs differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, you can see the hemocoel and ovaries in the female bed bugs.
Further, you can see a dark area on the females abdomen (at its back) - which we noted is its hemocoel.</p>
<h3 id="4-bed-bugs-engorged-with-blood">4. Bed Bugs Engorged with Blood</h3>
<p>Bed bugs will mainly feed on blood meals during the night - this is when sleeping humans release carbon dioxide that tends to attract these bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 5 to 10 minutes, the Cimex lectularius will be fully engorged with your blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bugs will also suck blood from different warm-blooded hosts despite being feasting on human blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>But for heavily-infested places, bed bugs will also feed take their blood meal in the daytime.</li>
<li>One hollow tube will inject anesthetics (saliva-looking liquid) into the human skin, making the area numb.
The other hollow tube will draw the hosts blood. The bugs will hide for about 5 to 10 days; theyll digest the blood, mate, and lay eggs during the time.

<p>Female Cimex lectularius will lay their eggs in crevices and cracks, particularly on the edges of your bed frames, box springs, and mattresses.</p>
<p>The pest will also occupy crevices and cracks - hiding in bed rails, headboards, empty bed stands, mattresses tufts or folds, and spring soils. Youll see cast skins, fecal stains, and even eggs.</p>
<p>First, to control these bugs, stay off the home, change your bedding, and clean up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check reddish or rusty stains on mattresses and bedsheets from the pests that may have been crushed.</li>
<li>Check for nymphs and their skins (colored pale-yellow) or the dark spots mainly caused by Cimex lectularius poop.
Further, examine the clothing and under crevices.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, Proof qualified to our list of
best bed bug sprays.
But how good is it?
The manufacturer claims that Proof will effectively kill all the bed bugs, their larvae, and eggs.
Plant-based spray (actually Neem-Oil derived) is marketed as a natural solution and alternative to chemical pesticides.
In this post, I&rsquo;ve reviewed the good and the bad of the�Proof bed bug spray.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But first,�Proof is produced from the Neem tree and thus it&rsquo;s a�plant-extracted insecticide with

but it&rsquo;s non-toxic to humans (and kids), cats or dogs. Therefore, it&rsquo;s safe to use around the house.
Further, it&rsquo;s a residue (as left on various surfaces) will continue
repelling the <a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like/">bed bugs</a>
for about two weeks - which is a pretty long residue effect.
Proof, 100% spray, is made from neem oil that&rsquo;ll mainly disrupt the bed bug&rsquo;s reproductive cycle but may not control a massive infestation or kill bed bugs.
Proof, the all-natural bed bug spray, might not give you a 100 percent guarantee in controlling all bed bugs, but it is great if you combine with
bed bug traps

?
*In summary, bedbugs are ovular light brown parasites that measure about 4 to 5 mm in length and 1.5 to 3 mm in width. *
*But, scabies is caused by small mites whose bites appear as tiny white dots. *
<em>Scabies bites cause a red rash (that appears in a line) and Intense itching.�</em>

<h3 id="1itchiness"><strong>1.Itchiness</strong></h3>
<p><em>Both bedbug bites and scabies bites are itchy.��</em>
This is due to the presence of two chemicals in their saliva. An anticoagulant stops blood from clotting and Anesthetic chemicals, which leaves a numb feeling preventing the bite from itching for a few seconds.
For scabies mites, the itch is caused by the parasite burrowing through your skin, and since it&rsquo;s under the top layer of your skin, you cannot scratch it away.</p>
<h3 id="2-appearance"><strong>2. Appearance</strong></h3>
<p><em>Both baby bed bug bites have a similar color.�</em>
Bedbug and scabies bites range from pink to red colors and become darker if you consistently scratch them.</p>
<h3 id="3-clustering"><strong>3. Clustering�</strong></h3>
<p>*Both scabies and bedbug bites appear in clusters. *
Where they bite, the clustering in scabies bites appears like pink dots mottled against the skin. Given that scabies mites attack in groups, the small dots will be many in one location hence appear as clusters. The scabies
bites are clustered more together than bed bug
bites.
Similarly, bedbug bites appear in clusters even though bedbugs don&rsquo;t purposefully bite in clusters; they only go for exposed parts of our body. Given their size, bedbug bite clusters are further apart.</p>
<h3 id="4-disease-transmission"><strong>4. Disease Transmission</strong></h3>
<p><em>Both don&rsquo;t carry infectious diseases.�</em>
Bedbugs feed on one or two people in a single bed for most of their lifespan. This also applies to scabies because they spend most of their life in one person.
The infestation is only spread if the individual mite lived on two or more people; however, it won&rsquo;t pass any diseases.

<h3 id="1-size"><strong>1. Size</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Bedbug Bites</em></dt>
<dd>They are large and appear as red raised lumps.
<em>Scabies Bites</em></dd>
<dd>They are relatively smaller.
Bedbugs bites swell up because as it feeds, it injects saliva that numbs the area so as it can feed undisturbed.
Given their larger bodies, bedbug bites, therefore, will appear larger. On the other hand, scabies mites start by laying eggs inside our skin then dig in, leaving behind a small dry spot.
The spot is much smaller than a bedbug bite; however, the line that the mite leaves behind is longer. Scabies bites are less raised than bedbug bites due to the histamine that swells the bite.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="2-where-they-bite"><strong>2. Where they bite.</strong></h3>
<p><em>Scabies bites:</em>
scabies mites can affect any part of the body.
<em>Bedbug bites:</em>
Bedbugs only bite exposed areas.
Given their small size, scabies mites can crawl almost everywhere without our notice. However, they tend to prefer attack parts with folded skin typical to become sweaty or damp.
These parts are between fingers and toes, palms, wrists, ankles, armpits, breasts, or around the groin.
Bedbugs, however, are bigger, and this hinders their mobility, limiting where they can bite us. They, therefore, only bite exposed areas that mostly are arms and legs.
Bedbugs also bite your side that gets in conduct with the mattress. Bedbugs&rsquo; priority is to the first feast on the exposed part of your body and not explore different places to bite.</p>
<h3 id="3symptoms">3.<strong>Symptoms�</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bedbug�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Red, Itchy Bites. You will experience a strong feeling of itchiness, irritation, and scratching them can lead to bleeding.</li>

<li>Uncomfortable nights could be another sign of bedbug infestation given they are most active at night when humans are with them sleeping.</li>

<h2 id="2-my-detailed-review">#2: My Detailed Review</h2>
<h3 id="1non-staining-and-no-odor-quite-long">1.Non-staining and No odor (Quite long)</h3>
<p>Spectracide Bug Stop produces a fine mist that&rsquo;ll cover various surfaces to kill bed bugs but won&rsquo;t stain the�clothing,�furniture,�linens,�bedspreads,�beds, and�carpets.
Therefore, the insecticide reduces the cleaning cost that would be required after treating the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-mites/">areas for bed bugs</a>
. Further, the cost of replacing stained objects like clothes will be significantly reduced.</p>
<h3 id="2-on-contact-exterminationformula">2.� On-contact Extermination�Formula</h3>

kills all the fleas
, eggs, and larvae through the on-contact extermination method that&rsquo;s easy and highly effective.

<h3 id="1-has-a-2-weeks-residue-effect">1. Has a 2-weeks residue effect</h3>
<p>Despite that�Spectracide Bug Stop is marketed as an on-contact extermination solution for bed bugs, it also has a long residue effect - going up to 2 weeks.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to apply the fogger in the recommended spaces (areas) after 2 weeks, where it&rsquo;ll kill all the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-jump/">adult bed bugs</a>
and the�sterile bed bugs or roaches.</p>

<p>The short answer is, YES! Just 1 Spectracide Bug Stop fogger will readily treat your car from all bed bugs and their larvae growing around. However, you&rsquo;ll need to leave the car�trunk and the windows�open.
However, you should be aware that the Spectracide Bug Stop fogger is meant to treat a confined space like a 5 x 5 rooms, and thus, you&rsquo;ll have to leave your car unused for 3-4 days after

<h2 id="spider-bite-vs-bed-bug-bite-top-7-difference">Spider Bite Vs Bed Bug Bite: Top 7 Difference?</h2>
<h3 id="a-physical-appearance">a. Physical appearance</h3>
<p>Bedbug&rsquo;s bite is usually small and appears as a reddish bump on the skin surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bites are multiple/several/clusters in numbers. Contrary, a spider&rsquo;s bite appears as a single swollen mark.
The outlook feature of the bedbug&rsquo;s bite usually leaves fang marks on the surface, especially if it&rsquo;s from species such as the black widow spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-size-of-bite-mark">b. Size of Bite Mark</h3>
<p>The size of the bite mark from a spider is usually big/wide (deep fangs can be seen when the bite is still flesh), whereas the size of the bedbug&rsquo;s bite is small - no visible marks at times.
Further, the
<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/need-know-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/)/">bedbug&rsquo;s bite</a>
may appear like a flat patch on the skin or tiny-pus rashes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9UzvclvEQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9UzvclvEQ</a></p>
<h3 id="c-number-of-bites">c. Number of Bites</h3>
<p>Spider leaves one <a href="/posts/flea-bites-vs-bed-bug-bites/">bite</a> at a time in a given surface/location, while bedbug carries multiple bites (clusters) in a given surface/point - you will see small shallow marks or swellings on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="d-signs-and-symptoms">d. Signs and Symptoms</h3>
<p>The outstanding symptoms of a spider&rsquo;s bite include high blood pressure, large swelling, severe pain, paralysis, increased heartbeats, muscle cramping, headache, nausea, and a high breathing rate.
Contrary, bedbugs symptoms include red swollen bumps, itchy rashes/blisters (with pus), smelly odor on the surface, and prevalent painful sensation.</p>
<h3 id="e-duration-of-bitewould">e. Duration of Bite/would</h3>
<p>Upon being bitten, the spider&rsquo;s bite may take one week (7days) to heal, particularly when the right treatment is undertaken.
However, the bedbug&rsquo;s bite will take a slightly longer period (one to two weeks - 14 days) to heal under proper medication.</p>
<h3 id="f-degree-of-bite-pain">f. Degree of Bite Pain</h3>
<p>The fact that the spider&rsquo;s bite is deeper and larger as compared to that of the bedbug, the bite mark on your skin is more painful and may bleed profusely for some time.
Further, the venom injected into your body worsens human health conditions through intoxication and paralysis  this is more pronounced if bitten by some particular species of spiders like the black widow.
Bedbug&rsquo;s bite is sharp and short-lived on bite onset. However, the reddish pimples formed on the skin later generate an itchy feeling that makes one scratch themselves in search of relief.</p>
<h3 id="g-bite-location">g. Bite Location</h3>
<p>Spider&rsquo;s bites are usually found on the fingers, arms, and legs (these are areas bitten mostly), while bedbug bites almost all parts of the body i.e. legs, arms, face, neck, torso, feet, and back.
Further, the bedbug bites either appear as a linear pattern or cluster on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="h-severity-of-bite">h. Severity of Bite</h3>
<p>Most spiders bites are known to be more venomous than bedbugs. Black widow and
brown recluse spider
bites inject hemotoxic venom that impairs the human response system and paralyzes the immune system, thus leading to death with time.
Most spider bites lead to large swollen proportions that may lead to severe wounds if not attended to instantly.
On the contrary basis, bedbug&rsquo;s bites never go beyond mere pimples, which appear like red boils with under-skin pus.
Though the bedbug&rsquo;s bite takes a slightly longer time to heal as compared to the spider&rsquo;s counterpart, the intensity of pain is less severe/painful - the pain fades away easily.

<h3 id="i-biting-time">i. Biting Time</h3>
<p>Usually, bedbugs bite night more than daytime. They tend to be more active in dark than a day  they are nocturnal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The light scares the bedbugs into their hideouts. On the other hand, spider bites during the day than at night.
The presence of light is a key factor that helps the spider to locate the biting point (either leg, arm, or fingers). This doesn&rsquo;t mean that a spider can&rsquo;t bite you at night - however, the chances are limited.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="j-bite-frequency">j. Bite Frequency</h3>
<p>Spider normally bites once at a given point (one bite and then runs always), while the bedbug may bite several times on a particular skin surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, unlike bedbugs, spiders tend to bite only when you threaten them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-ways-of-preventing-spiderbedbug-bite">Best Ways of Preventing Spider/Bedbug Bite?</h2>

<h2 id="how-to-treat-spiderbedbug-bite">How to Treat Spider/Bedbug Bite</h2>
<p>In case a spider or bedbug bites you, consider any of the following treatment approaches:</p>
<h3 id="a-spider-treatment-methods">a. Spider Treatment Methods</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using Plantain</strong>- smear the flesh plantain on the spider bite area. This helps draw and neutralize the venom before a reaction takes place. Further, the fluid reduces severe reaction, swelling, and prevents anaphylactic shock.</li>
<li><strong>Activated Charcoal</strong>- rub activated charcoal on the spider bite gently and leave it for five minutes before cleaning. Rub once more and repeat this daily until the skin heals. The activated charcoal has high absorption properties that remove toxic venom and reduces acute pain</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>- dissolve baking soda in warm water and wipe the bitten area gently. The alkaline substance (in baking soda) reduces inflammation, itching, pain, and draws out the venom</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Meat Tenderizer</strong>- rub meat tenderizer onto spider bitten part, softly. The papain enzyme in the tenderizer breaks down the proteinaceous toxins in the bites, thus eliminating inflammation as well as itching/swelling occurrences.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for antihistamine medicine</strong>- apply for antihistamine medicine on the spider bitten area after washing the part with soap and warm water. The medicine helps in reducing itching, swelling as well as in preventing intoxication.</li>
<li><strong>Get Tetanus Booster</strong>- for a poisonous spider bite, it&rsquo;s advisable to take a tetanus injection booster to prevent intoxication and paralysis, which may be fatal if not attended to in time. This should be taken instantly if you note symptoms such as breathing difficulties and heart palpitations problems.

</ol>
<h3 id="b-bedbug-treatment-methods">b.� Bedbug Treatment Methods</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using Diatomaceous earth</strong>- Gently, rub diatomaceous earth on the bedbug bitten area and leave it for 10minutes before washing. Repeat the same two to three times. The active substance in diatomaceous earth reduces swelling and itching feelings that escalate if not attended to in time.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrocortisone cream</strong>- Apply the cream on the bitten section and leave it to heal with time. The paste does not only act as a pain relaxer but prevents swelling and curb further intoxication.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Antihistamine medicine</strong>- apply or get an antihistamine injection to prevent intoxication and further swelling of the bitten skin area. This should be carried out as soon as you discover the bite is bedbugs.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Herbal Lotion</strong>- consider applying herbal lotion over any bedbug bite since the compound contains components that prevent intoxication and swelling. Further, the herbal concoction acts as a pain relaxer too.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On spider bite vs bedbug bite, youll need to check on indicators such as the physical appearance of the bite, size of the bite mark, the number of bites on the surface/body, duration of bite to heal, location of the bite as well as the degree of pain instilled when you got bitten, in order to differentiate between the two.</p>

<h2 id="comparison-stink-bugs-vs-bed-bugs">Comparison: Stink Bugs Vs. Bed Bugs</h2>
<h3 id="1-feeding-mechanism">1. Feeding mechanism</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are blood-sucking in nature. Bed bugs feed on blood that makes them look round from their initial flat shape.
On the other hand, stink bugs like to feed on fruits, vegetables, and other insects. Stink bugs are often found in vegetable gardens and fruit trees. When found in a garden, stink
bugs can destroy a lot of items
and materials.</p>
<h3 id="2-appearance">2. Appearance</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are flat and round
in shape. The shield shape of stink
bugs makes them different
from their counterpart bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="3-wings---do-they-fly">3. Wings - Do they fly</h3>
<p>Stink bugs have well-designed wings that
<a href="https://www.terminix.com/pest-control/stink-bugs/behavior/do-stink-bugs-fly/">help them to fly</a>
. For
bed bugs, you will find no wings
in their makeup.
Bed bugs do not fly
because they have�dysfunctional wing pads - and not wings great for flying.</p>
<h3 id="4-color">4. Color</h3>
<p>Without any scintilla of doubt, stink bugs come in a gamut of colors. These bugs can either be green, red, purple, brown, and black. However, the easiest way to
notice a bed bug
is its reddish-brown or yellow color. But before they suck blood (this is particularly true for
baby bed bugs
), bed bugs will appear white or yellow and have a flat oval shape.</p>
<h3 id="5-body-odor">5. Body Odor</h3>
<p>Bed bugs may not
unleash any specific smell
when touched. Stink bugs are going to leave a foul odor on your hands when touched. One primary reason for calling these bugs to stink is that they often unleash a foul smell or odor when smashed.
When stink bugs touch anything, they often leave behind a distinctive lousy odor. These
bugs can fly because
they have well-crafted wings. It is essential to know that stink
bugs will also bite
or hurt you when disturbed in any way.</p>
<h3 id="6-living-environment">6. Living Environment</h3>
<p>Stink bugs like light and can be found in places like vegetable gardens and fruit trees. The different colors of these bugs make them adapt and remain comfortable in any environment. Bed bugs
like dark environments
. Since they suck, blood human beings are their final host.
In a living apartment, stink
bugs like hiding
beneath sidings and other hard-to-reach areas. When winter is over, you can
see these bugs
matching out in their multitude from your house. Due to their nature of loving clear lights, you can find stink bugs around your windows and doors.</p>
<h3 id="7-body-size">7. Body Size</h3>
<p>The adult of both bugs maintains around a one-quarter inch long. The babies of a beg bug can be smaller than their counterpart stink bugs.</p>
<h3 id="8-bite-differences">8. Bite differences</h3>
<p>When stink
bugs bite
, there is every possibility to experience an allergic reaction. Besides, the
bite from�stink bugs
can be painful at the same time. One fantastic feature of a stink bug is that it appears in a plethora of colors.
This feature makes it possible for stink bugs to blend and adapt to any environment they find themselves.
Bed bugs will leave red welts
that itch on your skin when they suck and bite.
Also, check this comparison between
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-ants/">Bed Bugs vs. Ants</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The bottom line is that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-bed-bugs-spread/">bed bugs are blood-sucking</a>
in nature and can spread fast like a wildfire. Stink bugs can be irritating, annoying, infuriating, and can make people uncomfortable.
Remember that both bugs can be dangerous to human health and being. Controlling these bugs at the early stage is the only way to prevent infestation.</p>

<p>Sources state that
<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-113/tea-tree-oil">tea tree oil is almost as effective as chemical insecticides</a>
. Also, chemical insecticides are mostly harmful to the human respiratory system.
Tea tree oil has a pleasant smell that you will like. It smells almost like pine disinfectant, only that it is a bit stronger. Check out the

<h3 id="how-to-do-patch-test">How to Do Patch Test</h3>
<p>Mixing tea tree oil for
bed bugs
is easy and only involves a few steps. Before you start using tea tree oil, make sure that it is safe for you. You can do this by running a quick patch test.
That way, you can quickly know whether you are allergic to the oil. However, you will need a day or two to get your results.
This is a natural step that entails choosing a
<a href="https://www.webmd.com/allergies/skin-test#1">patch of skin</a>
in an area that is not easily noticeable. You will test the oil on it and see how it reacts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place one or two drops of the oil in your inner forearm. This is the ideal area for patch testing since the skin is highly sensitive and cannot be noticed easily. Also, you will not run out of the oil unknowingly.</li>
<li>For the test, you can use any dilution ratio. Try to use somewhere between 1-50%. Anything more than that might be too much, and your skin might not handle it; hence, you will obviously get an allergic reaction.</li>
<li>Place a bandage on the area on which you placed the few drops of diluted tea tree oil.</li>
<li>Let it dry.�If you start to feel irritation around the area, remove the bandage immediately, andwash thoroughly with water and soap.
However, if you dont feel any irritation within the first 24-48 hours, you are not allergic to the oil. Note that while you might be allergic to the oil, you might still be sensitive to a high concentration of the same.
After running the patch test successfully, you can go ahead and
use the oil to kill bed bugs
.�If you learn that you are allergic to the oil, you can ask someone to do the work for you.
However, if there is no one to help, make sure that you cover your body well, leaving no skin exposed to the tea tree oil during the application.

<h2 id="how-to-mix-tea-tree-oil-for-bed-bugs">How to Mix Tea Tree Oil for Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>You are free to mix the oil to the desired concentration. It is essential to keep it between
<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/262944.php">1% and 5%</a>
since that would be enough to kill the bed bugs and
baby bed bugs
.
Still, you might consider using slightly higher concentrations since
bed bugs are sturdier insects
.
Whichever the concentration you decide on, make sure you dont apply the oil neat. Otherwise, you will also get a reaction. The other thing to know is that it is usually ideal to use carrier oils to dilute essential oils.
These are less reactive oils such as almond oil. Besides, you can get a perfect blend by mixing oil with oil. Though it is possible to mix oil with water, it is not effective enough.

<h2 id="how-to-use-tea-tree-oil-to-get-rid-of-bed-bugs">How to use tea Tree Oil to Get Rid of Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>To kill bed bugs using tea tree oil, you need to do more than just spraying your mattress. This makes sense since
bed bugs are good at hiding
.
Therefore, you need to target the folds of your mattress, bed frame, bedding, and behind the furniture in your bedroom. Naturally, bed bugs like dark cracks and crevices.
For an
effective killing of bed bugs
, consider clearing your room of clutter and other mess. You need to check the furniture, stuffed clothes and toys, closets, under carpets and rugs, cracks, and crevices.</p>
<h2 id="tea-tree-oil-and-its-effects-on-humans">Tea Tree Oil and Its Effects on Humans</h2>
<p>Some reviews reveal just how toxic to humans the tea tree oil can be. Half of them died when a dose of
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/peppermint-oil">2ml/kg was given to rats</a>
, while half of them recovered. This can also be called a 50% lethal dose.
The same dose of tea tree oil in humans might make them ataxic or lethargic from the observation. In simple terms, they will slur their speech, move involuntarily, and lose control of their normal body functions and movements.
A further study revealed that no human death would occur due to ingesting tea tree oil. However, some reasonable level of poisoning would be reported among children and adults.
Experts also point out that the toxicity of the oil is self-limiting. Therefore, you will not get hurt as long as you know what you are doing.
Make sure that you dont ingest it, and you must not apply it neatly. However, you can also try using
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/">bed bug steamers</a>
to kill the bugs using high temperatures.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tea tree oil can
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dead-bed-bugs/">kill bed bugs</a>
as long as it is mixed in the right ratio. From the start, you must ensure that you target the regions that the insects use for hiding.
Moreover, you should avoid getting in contact with the oil since it could irritate your skin. The oil contains natural components that can help make your

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering which animals will eat bed bugs (Hemiptera), read on to get the details. But you might not want some of these
<em>natural bed bug enemies</em>
around your home - maybe geckos? or Ants?
<em>So, what animals or insects will eat bed bugs? Well, common bed bug killers include ants (fire, argentine, or pharaoh ants), masked hunters, centipedes, spiders, cockroaches, and lizards such as geckos.�</em>
<em>With mattress encasements for bed bugs, it&rsquo;s possible to watch for bed bugs and also reducing the possible hiding spaces in your box spring or mattress. The bugs undergo metamorphosis - from egg to nymph - it has no larval stage.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>NB: Cats and dogs won&rsquo;t eat bed bugs - maybe by accident but dogs mayassistin searching for bed bugs- canine scent detection.

<h2 id="details-what-animals-eat-bed-bugs---bed-bug-predators">Details: What Animals Eat Bed Bugs? - Bed Bug Predators</h2>
<h3 id="1-masked-bed-bug-hunter">1. Masked Bed Bug Hunter</h3>
<p>Some of the natural bed bug enemies might be dangerous to bring into your spaces - so it would be best to hire
professional exterminators
to control both the adult and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/baby-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/what-eats-bed-bugs/)/">ba</a>
by bed bugs
.
These Masked hunters are even described as assassin bugs that&rsquo;ll colonize areas that are dry and warm - your home will be an excellent destination. These flying bugs will measure roughly 17 - 22 millimeters (with some gray or brown).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqfXiJxwuvg&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqfXiJxwuvg&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
These
bed-bug
hunters will mainly hide around dust - the location where their nymph will form. They&rsquo;ll have that symbiosis association with pigeons and bats - which they take like their food.
The predator masked hunter will eat many insects and bugs such as bed bugs - but it&rsquo;s not advisable to introduce the masked hunter into the home as a portion of their subspecies may bring disease to humans.
Further, Masked hunters could bite humans when they consider that they&rsquo;re threatened. They&rsquo;ll cause a painful bite - comparable to a
snake bite
. Masked hunters could overrun your home - as advised by entomologists.
So, to both monitor or trap those nasty bed bugs, I recommend using some great
bed bug traps</p>
<ul>
<li>the red and black colors will attract the bugs.</li>
<li>In summary, the Reduvius personatus will feed on bed bugs - they&rsquo;re in multiple United States&rsquo; regions. Being nocturnal feeders, they&rsquo;ll attack the bed bugs as they emerge during the night.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cockroach">2. Cockroach</h3>
<p>Roaches
are common animals that you can use to fight those bed bugs in your residence. Cockroaches will mainly settle in the house around areas (the quiet places) like pantries, cupboards, and kitchens.
Roaches are effective bugs against bed-bugs but most people don&rsquo;t recommend them as the solution for bed bugs menace. Also, they&rsquo;ll inhabit sewers and other dirty places eating food, garbage, and junk - check
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">quality drain cleaners</a>
.
Further, roaches will love dirty homes as they&rsquo;ll easily get bread crumbs and leftover food - but they won&rsquo;t be super effective against bed bugs like foggers, traps, and
sprays
.
Despite that roaches will east the bed bugs, the rate of exterminating them is too slow while the bed bugs reproduce too fast. Also, roaches tend to bite humans and contaminate their food.
But as
natural scavengers
, roaches will eat both bed bug eggs and their adults - but it won&rsquo;t be possible to exterminate the entire bed bug colony since the
<a href="https://www.terminix.com/blog/bug-facts/how-fast-do-bed-bugs-spread/">bed bugs do fast reproduction.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In summary, roaches will predators on bed bugs - as they&rsquo;ll feed on most things that&rsquo;ll act like food - but they won&rsquo;t eat and eliminate the whole colony of bed bugs in the house.</li>
<li>Thus, it is better to employ chemical bed-bug killers or even engage a professional exterminator to clear the whole colony of bed bugs in your residence and house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-pharaoh-ants">3. Pharaoh Ants</h3>
<p>From all the ant species, pharaoh ants are the best documented to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-ants-kill-bed-bugs/">kill or attack bed bugs</a>
. Further, they&rsquo;ll draw attention or pinpoint (give away) the specific hiding areas of the bed bugs.
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_ant">Pharaoh ants</a>
consider bed bugs as a great diet - but they&rsquo;re threatening to humans. The ants will help manage large bed bug infestations - the 1/16-inch workers will be honey-colored.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okbWPcx-ug4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okbWPcx-ug4</a>
The ants are fast in reproducing - with a female laying roughly 400 eggs over its whole lifetime. They have distinct trails - and they need humid and warm conditions - and will love fats and sugars.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pharaoh ants eat many objects such as bed bugs (plus their eggs) and clothing but will also transmit illness.
Pharaoh ants look yellow-brown and are fast reproducers but will also spread diseases such as dysentery and salmonella - and thus you must be cautious when using them for bed bug control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-red-imported-fire--argentine-ants">4. Red-Imported Fire &amp; Argentine Ants</h3>
<p>Fire ants will inhabit sunny and warm areas - while the red-imported fire ants will measure about 1.6 mm - 5 mm. They are known to feed on telephone wires - specifically the rubber insulation.
Their excruciating and potent sting will kill most young animals including bed bugs. The ants&rsquo; alkaloid venom will leave white pustules and red bumps - these are very irritating.
On the other hand, Argentine Ants will measure roughly 2.2 mm - 2.8 mm - the invasive ants will inhabit home foundations, ground debris, and moist or damp mulch.
During the cool weather, Argentine Ants will get into cracks and gaps around your house to get shelter - but they&rsquo;ll also attack and exterminate bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="4thanatus-flavidus-spider">4.Thanatus Flavidus Spider</h3>
<p>Thanatus flavidus (Philodromidae) is a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/">spider species that are effective in controlling bed bugs</a></p>
<ul>
<li>besides heat treatment, fumigation, and pesticides. They&rsquo;re native to Greece, Ukraine, and Russia.
The legend spider - as described by
<a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737831,00.html">Time Magazine</a>
, cleared the bed bugs infestation that was in Athens, Greece in 1929. They&rsquo;ll catch the bloodsuckers by their backs to remove their body fluids.
This Thanatus flavidus isn&rsquo;t toxic to humans - and hence are better suited to be in the house compared to kissing bugs, cockroaches, and ants. Other predator spiders include jumping spider, running crab spider, and the wolf spider.</li>
<li>Spider bites won&rsquo;t spread infections to humans and won&rsquo;t also invade your bedroom.
Bedbugs came back after the prohibition of synthetic DDT pesticides mainly in Europe and the United States - they attack warm-blooded animals and suck their blood.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-house-centipedes">5. House Centipedes</h3>
<p>The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutigera_coleoptrata">House Centipedes</a>
are hated by humans but they&rsquo;ll also eat many invertebrates including cockroaches, bed bugs, termites, and spiders.
The centipedes (that have a body that&rsquo;s yellowish-brown) are considered disgusting by most people but the house species will eat bed bugs.
These bugs have flattened and long bodies - that&rsquo;ll go up to1-1/2 inches in length. Each of their body section has a (thread-like, slender, and long) pair of legs - that have some white and black banding.</p>
<ul>
<li>The centipedes have well-developed and large eyes - they&rsquo;re beneficial and harmless to humans but will predate on insects, bed bugs, ants, silverfish, cockroaches,termites, spiders, andNo See Umstoo.
The thirty legged arthropods measure about 15 centimeters in body length - they&rsquo;ll hunt bed bugs and cockroaches. They might cause painful and poisonous bites - that look like bee bites.</li>
<li>House dust mites will also predate on bed bugs besides eating mold, animal and human skin flakes.
Further,
geckos will attack
and exterminate bed bugs - but the lizards will need special humidity, light, and heat conditions.</li>

(Cimex lectularius) are a fact of life, particularly after
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/ddt-brief-history-and-status">states banned DDT</a>
for its toxicity to humans. So, are bed bugs caused by dirty homes or living quarters? Well, NO!
You&rsquo;ll also find bed bugs in clean environs like high-end quarters and 5-star hotels. So, what
causes bed bugs
?
The short answer is that
bed bugs are caused
by traveling in bed bugs and infested places or acquiring second-hand furniture and mattresses. Bed bugs will hitchhike your luggage, clothing, and legs to suck blood. They&rsquo;re flat-bodied and wingless  it measures 5 to 7 mm.

[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Killer for Bed Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Let&rsquo;s get started!
<em>But first</em>
,
here are the signs of bed bugs:
reddish fecal matter, is there a sweet-musty odor?, crushed bedbugs  youll see blood smears, light-brown bed bug skin casting, and white eggs (small in size).</p>
<h2 id="details-what-causes-bed-bugs-causes-and-symptoms">Details: What Causes Bed Bugs? Causes and Symptoms</h2>
<h3 id="1-buying-used-and-infested-furniture">1. Buying Used and Infested Furniture</h3>
<p>You can buy and carry a piece of second-hand furniture to your home or business for cheap. But the bed bugs and
their babies
from the garage sales aren&rsquo;t easy to control.
Equally,
rented furniture may carry bed bugs
if their origin was a place that was infested by the blood-sucking insects. This is particularly common if pest-inspection is not done right.
Sadly,
bed bugs are hardy pests that&rsquo;ll live
for months after taking a full blood meal. Therefore, segregating the infested furniture won&rsquo;t help
get rid of the bed bugs
.
Therefore, for any of us renters and homeowners out here, we&rsquo;ll need to rightly
inspect &amp; treat, for bed bugs
, any old furniture you&rsquo;re to bring home.
<em>How to Treating Used Furniture for Bed Bugs�</em>
To prevent or control the bed bugs, you can use either chemical (
insecticide - like sprays
) or non-chemical ways. But be patient as the eradication may require several treatment cycles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam clean and vacuumall the old furniture and mattress  including the box-spring cracks.�You can usefoggers or bombsthat are approved for killing bed bugs.</li>
<li>Clean the dirt and clutter thats lying around the rooms  this will help cut the number oflocations that the bed bugscan hide.</li>
<li>Also, examine the second-hand furniture for cracks and holes  youll need to seal and caulk these to kill the bed bugs,their eggs, and babies.</li>
<li>Next, treat the bedbug-infested mattress or furniture using heat for about 15 to 30 minutes. If its a fabric, you can use a clothes dryer at medium-high temperatures.</li>
<li>But, you can bag and launder the second-hand items at about 120 F. For box-spring and mattress, youll need to encase them.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJeycCNgvtU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJeycCNgvtU</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-travelling---bed-bugs-hitchhike-clothes-and-suitcases">2. Travelling - Bed Bugs Hitchhike Clothes and Suitcases</h3>
<p>Besides the loss of luggage and food poisoning, most
travelers worry even more about travel bugs and bed bugs
! Bed bugs re-emerged and continued spreading after the banning of DDT.
While traveling, you can pick up bed bugs from hotels and resorts, libraries, movie theaters, retail stores, hospitals, universities, and colleges.
However, the bugs may also hitchhike your clothes either in private homes or other business premises.
In fact, a recent
<a href="https://www.npmapestworld.org/default/assets/File/newsroom/magazine/2015/nov-dec_2015.pdf">NPMA&rsquo;s case study</a>
reported that 75% of the respondents had an encounter with bed bugs in motels and hotels.
<em>How to Prevent and Control Bed Bugs while Travelling�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>First, inspect the hotel room todetect any signs of bed bugs. I note that for this, youll require just a good flashlight. So, examine luggage racks, the headboard, and mattress. Check the mattress seams for signs of spots and stains  change room/ hotel and notify the management.</li>
<li>Inspect the chairs. Sofas and behind beds headboard. This must happen first before starting unpacking. Any<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like/">bed bugs signs</a>will prove enough to change room/ hotel and notify the management.</li>
<li>Avoid changing to a room directly above or next to the oneinfested by bed bugs. Notably, bed bugs will readily hitchhike through wall sockets, luggage, and housekeeping carts to the next room.</li>
<li>Next, during room entry or exit, place your luggage on the luggage racks when youre unpacking or packing. So, dont place the luggage on the rooms floor or even the bed  further let the luggage be very far from the bed.</li>
<li>During your stay in the hotel, enclose your suitcase in some good protective cover or trash bag so that the bed bugs wont hitchhike waiting for you to move with them.</li>
<li>When you arrive home, unpack the language directly into the washing machine while also conducting a thorough inspection. Thehigh temperatures in the dryer will kill the bed bugs.</li>
<li>Clean and dry all the clothes you had during the trip and even those that werent worn or those you purchased on your way home.</li>
<li>Finally, vacuum the suitcase and ensure you store it in the garage or basement  or ensure its a long-distance from your bedroom.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-dirty-or-clean---bed-bugs-dont-care">3. Dirty or Clean? - Bed Bugs Don&rsquo;t Care!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a fact
<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-are-these-tiny-black-bugs-in-my-house-1968030">bed bugs don&rsquo;t give a fish if you&rsquo;re dirty or clean</a>
. As you already know,
bed bugs mainly feed blood from humans or animals
.
Therefore,
bed bugs will remain in the house
or other premises, be they clean or dirty, provided the host is available - the bed bugs will easily take their blood meal.
So, don&rsquo;t lie to yourself. Wealth won&rsquo;t help you
against bed bug
attacks; also, poverty isn&rsquo;t a ticket for getting a bed bug infestation. However, it&rsquo;s also a fact that poor people could lack the finances to
prevent or control bed bug
infestations.</p>
<h3 id="4-bed-bugs-will-hide-inclutter">4. Bed bugs will hide inClutter</h3>
<p>Clutter forms an excellent
hiding place
for bed bugs - this will include switch plates, wallpapers, baseboards, furniture, beds.�Therefore, reducing the clutter will guarantee that the bugs won&rsquo;t spread.
Further, it would help if you did not carry objects to a non-infested area from the already infected area. Sadly, if you do the contrary, the bloodsuckers will quickly move around, hiding in clothes and furniture.
Ensure to throw all the bed, bug-infested objects into some plastic trash bags. Also, ensure that you take the plastic bags when it&rsquo;s full of infested items. Don&rsquo;t throw clothes on the bed or the floor - discard the items you no longer wear.
Have plastic boxes to replace the cardboard boxes you have. Notably, cardboards are a great hiding place for the
blood-sucking bugs - bed bugs
. Further, throw away any newspapers and magazines lying around.
Sadly, a mature and fertilized female bed bug will
lay about 200 to 250 eggs
in its life. So, definitely, any clutter will benefit the bed bug as they reproduce and grow their babies. Get rid of the annoying clutter now!</p>
<h3 id="5-bed-bugs-love-high-human-traffic">5. Bed bugs Love High Human Traffic</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in an area with high human traffic - you should be worried since the bugs will easily hitch-hike humans in military barracks, motels and hotels, homeless shelters, dormitories, and apartment buildings.
Therefore, for all the large number of people you&rsquo;ll see entering and exiting a location, there is an even higher risk of bringing and leaving a few bed bugs, their eggs, or babies.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>First,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs mainly hide</a>
in closets, second-hand furniture, upholstery, upholstery, bed frames, box springs, and mattresses seams.�But as weve noted, bed bugs are caused by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">old- furniture and second-hand mattresses</a>
, infested luggage while on international travels.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs have
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-eats-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/">many predators</a>
.</p>
<p>So might wonder that <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bugs eat a variety of foods - from human blood, skin or the crumbs of food. So, what do bed bugs eat?
<strong>Summary: Most bed bugs species mainly feed on blood of mammals like human. For example, Cimex lectularius only feed on human blood.�</strong>
<strong>NB: Bed bug lack teeth and tongue for chewing and swallowing food - and thus they&rsquo;ll only eat blood.</strong></p>
<h3 id="does-food-attract-bed-bugs"><strong>Does Food Attract Bed Bugs?</strong></h3>
<p>When I say food, I am referring to the food we eat. Many household pests such roaches, mice and rats will hang around your house as long as theres something for them to eat. On the contrary, bed bugs arent attracted to any of the food we eat.</p>
<p>Thats why it is very rare to see bed bugs in the kitchen. Their most preferred places are bedrooms and living rooms where people spend most of their times.</p>
<p>It is common to find cockroach eggs on your food and inside the places where food is kept. However, bed bugs will not lay their eggs on food since they have no business there. They lay their eggs near their host especially under the mattress and the seams of sofa set.</p>
<h3 id="how-often-do-bed-bugs-feed"><strong>How Often Do Bed Bugs Feed?</strong></h3>
<p>The frequency with which bed bugs eat depends partly on the prevailing temperatures and partly on the availability of food. And though their feeding schedule is quite unpredictable, adult bed bugs feed at least once a week when food is readily available.</p>
<p>Basically bed bugs will require a blood meal to produce eggs and to survive in each of the 5 successive nymph stages. However, in the absence of a host, bed bugs can survive for a very long time.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that under favourable conditions, bed bugs can go without a meal for up to 400 days. However, when the conditions are unfavourable, they can barely survive 3-5 months without a meal.</p>
<p>Bed bugs have the advantage of a waxy exoskeleton that keeps them from excessive dehydration. And similar to many other insects their body requires very little water. Another reason why bed bugs stay long without feeding is because most of the nutrients they get from blood are meant for growth rather than for survival.</p>
<p>That means more nutrients are required as bed bug transforms from one stage to another. Once the lifecycle is complete, bed bugs feed less frequently.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, you cant eradicate bed bugs by vacating your house for a long time so as to starve them. People have inhabited their houses for more than one year but the bed bugs reappear once they return.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-on-each-other"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed On Each Other?</strong></h3>
<p>Some people have resulted to starving bed bugs by vacating their houses for more than one year only to return and the bed bugs resurface. Does it mean that the bed bugs survive by feeding on each other while youre away?</p>
<p>Not at all. In the absence of a human host or other hosts such as pets or bats, bed bugs will survive without their favourite meal for up to 400 days. They lack teeth and tongue for chewing and swallowing food. So, they wont even feed on the food crumbs or any food that you left in the house.</p>
<p>Bed bugs feed only on blood from humans and warm blooded animals. Instead of blood, a bed bugs body contains a fluid known as hemolpymh in which all the internal tissues are bathed. Since hemolpymh does not contain haemoglobin, it not possible for bed bugs to feed on it.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-on-other-animals"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed On Other Animals?</strong></h3>
<p>Bed bugs and especially Cimex lectularius have adapted to feed on human blood and blood from other warm blooded animals. In your absence, bed bugs will lodge themselves on your pets, rodents and other warm blooded animals around. However, they prefer human host to other warm blooded animals because of the following reasons.</p>
<p>Human skin is not covered by fur, meaning it is easier for bed bugs to pierce and feed. In contrast, the fur in other warm blooded animals, deters bed bugs from easily targeting them as hosts.</p>
<p>In addition bed bugs like to bite you when youre sound asleep. Unlike other animals, humans wont respond to bed bug bites when they are asleep. Pets and other mammals tend to respond with haste to bed bug bites. Thus bed bugs will find easier to bite humans compared to other animals.</p>
<h3 id="are-bed-bugs-attracted-to-certain-blood-types"><strong>Are Bed Bugs Attracted To Certain Blood Types?</strong></h3>
<p>While there are speculations and publications purporting bed bugs are attracted to certain blood types, there is no proof to ascertain that possibility. Your blood may fall within any of these types O+, O-, A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, or AB-. However, theres no reliable indication that bed bugs are attracted to one or two of these blood types.</p>
<p>New research has however shown that bed bugs prefer blood that has less alcohol concentration. That means a person who has been taking alcohol will have less bed bug bites compared to a person who has not been drinking.</p>
<p>However, I would not advice that you knock a few glasses of your favourite alcohol before you retire to bed. On the positive, this observation can help scientists in developing new ways of eradicating bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-eat-anything-else-apart-from-blood"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Eat Anything Else Apart From Blood?</strong></h3>
<p>The persistence of many household pests in your home depends on the availability of food. For example, roaches and rats will hang around as long as there are food crumbs and trash they can feed on.</p>
<p>Unlike other household pests, bed bugs solely depend on blood. Since they lack teeth and tongue, they wont feed on anything else apart from blood. They use their straw like mouth to pierce your skin and suck blood.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-eat-insects"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Eat Insects?</strong></h3>
<p>Studies have shown that some pests can be used to feed on some of the most nagging pests in our homes. For example, some species of cockroaches and spiders have been documented to feed on bed bugs for many years. But can bed bugs feed on insects or other small creatures?</p>
<p>Well, bed bugs will not eat insects or other small creatures. Bed bugs will only survive on blood from warm blooded animals. Their mouth parts are designed like a straw, meaning that they can only suck. They neither chew nor swallow food. Thus, it is in order to conclude that bed bugs cannot insects.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-on-wood"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed On Wood?</strong></h3>
<p>Bed bugs like hiding in wooden furniture especially in your bed. Thats why people often replace their wooden beds with metal beds as a way of eradicating bed bugs. So, does this suggest that bed bugs feed on wood?</p>
<p>The answer is no. Unlike metal furniture, the configuration of wooden furniture allows bed bugs to hide and avoid human interference. Although you might see bed bugs coming out of holes in wood, these holes belong to other insects like termites.</p>
<p>Metal furniture discourages bed bugs because therere usually few or no hiding places for bed bugs. Thus they feel very exposed and relocated to safer places.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-on-your-hair"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed On Your Hair?</strong></h3>
<p>If you have had a severe bed bug infestation, you might have suffered bites all over your body including your head. So, you might be worried that these creatures are feeding on your hair.</p>
<p>No need to freak! Bed bugs wont feed on your hair. Only cockroaches are known to eat hair and dead skin. Your hair only acts as a habitat for parasites such as mites, fleas and bed bugs, where they hide as they feed on blood on your head.</p>
<p>Bed bugs in particular will find it easier to crawl and suck blood on a bald head than a hairy head. They get entangled in hairy hair.</p>
<h3 id="for-how-long-do-bed-bugs-feed"><strong>For</strong>** How Long Do Bed Bugs Feed?**</h3>
<p>Basically bed bugs will spend the least time possible to complete a meal to avoid being detected by you or a natural predator. They survive by feeding and retreating to their safe-havens without being noticed.</p>
<p>They dont waste time searching for particular areas to bite. Once they locate the nearest area, they pierce the skin and suck blood until they are satisfied. Depending on its size and the last time it had a meal, a bed bug might bite you severally before satisfaction. In such instances, the bed bug bites in a straight line pattern in order to save time.</p>
<p>Once satisfied, they retreat to their hiding place, usually in crevices below the mattress. They take approximately 10 minutes to come out of hiding, get their meal and return into hiding. This is quite a short time for you to realize especially when youre in deep asleep. In fact their saliva contains analgesic which they use to ease the pain of their bite.</p>
<p>Ten minutes is the time taken by a single bed bug to feed. That means you are likely to experience multiple bites, as individual bed bugs in a colony come out to feed at different times.</p>
<p>Naturally, a bed bug will feed at least once a week. So, if you have a huge infestation, chances are that you and your family will suffer bed bug bites each and every night.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-during-the-day"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed During The Day?</strong></h3>
<p>It is usually assumed that bed bugs are nocturnal. Not at all! Their feeding schedule does not depend on the time of the day. So you expect them to come out even during the day whenever there is a host they can feed on.</p>
<p>Similar to other animals, bed bugs feed whenever they feel hungry. That means they will come out to look for a meal regardless of the time of the day. If they cant find a host to feed on, they will of course go back into hiding and wait for the right chance.</p>
<p>However, they prefer to feed at night and spend most part of the day hiding. This is a survival tactic they have adapted, to avoid being detected by humans and natural predators.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bugs-feed-at-night---with-lights-on"><strong>Do Bed Bugs Feed At Night - With Lights On?</strong></h3>
<p>The preference for feeding arises from two scenarios. The need to and the availability of a still host. While bed bugs survive by coming out in darkness, they wont skip a meal simply because theres light. They take meals when necessary and when conditions are right.</p>
<p>Youve already seen that bed bugs come out to feed even during the day. The same applies when you sleep at night and leave the lights on. Youre motionless during sleep. So, if bed bugs feel like feeding, they will come out and feed on you even if the lights are on.</p>
<p>Naturally, bed bugs will avoid light to evade possible threats from humans and natural predators. Initially, you may sustain few bites when you sleep with the lights on. However, these creatures will feel starved and come to feed on you regardless of the lights.</p>
<p>If you have a large infestation, bed bugs will come out to feed in broad daylight and at night even when lights are on. This is because, the larger the infestation, the more the sequences of feeding from individual bed bugs. That means, at any given time, you have bed bugs that want to feed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You have seen that bed bugs will eat nothing else apart from blood from warm-blooded animals. So, when they get into your house, their only source of food will be you and your family including pets.</p>
<p>Therefore, its advisable to prevent bed bugs or act quickly to eradicate them whenever they appear in your house.</p>

.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The brown-colored or orange adult <a href="/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/">bed</a> bug tends to turn red once they suck blood. On size, they&rsquo;re about 4 - 5 mm (or 3/16 an inch) - and they somehow slow.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>The oval-shaped and six-legged bugs will also appear relatively flattened on their top when they&rsquo;ve not sucked blood recently.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bed bugs can be seen with your naked eyes (you&rsquo;ll get them in crevices and cracks) but their nymphs could be too small - check their hiding places.�</strong>
Further, the nymphs that have hatched recently will have the size of a pin&rsquo;s head (or apple seed) - they&rsquo;ll be tan or white in color until their feed on blood.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-will-i-identify-thosebed-bugs">How Will I identify those<strong>Bed Bugs?�</strong></h2>
<p>**Hiding Locations **</p>
<ul>
<li>Clothing, on pets, curtains, mattresses, seams, bedding, beds, and other furniture - they hide at day time.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will hide both in dirty or clean spaces - and thus cleaning will not fully prevent these bugs.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re excellent in hiding and hence you might only notice their bites</li>
<li>Bed bugs cause red &amp; itchy welts on human skin - but they don&rsquo;t spread diseases. They find humans through the CO2 smell from their respiration.</li>
<li>The bugs bite to inject saliva into humans (painless bite) - while also producing that anticoagulant and anesthetic effect. Its allergic reaction causes bumps that are raised.
**Color - **
The reddish-brown or orange bugs will change to red once they&rsquo;ve had their blood meal. As the bugs continue digesting the blood, they&rsquo;ll change to paler orange.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will feed on blood from humans (their best choice) among other warm-blooded animals like cats and dogs.</li>
<li>But they can also remain dormant for about 6 - 18 months without sucking blood.
<strong>Shape -</strong>
Tapered and oval body shape - it&rsquo;ll remain flat on their body shape until they&rsquo;re full of blood.</li>
<li>These flat bodies enable the bugs to effortlessly squeeze themselves into tiny cracks &amp; crevices - including spaces that measure the width of a credit card.</li>
<li>Bed bugs undertake repeated bites in their single feeding session.
**Shape - **
Lenght of 4 - 5 mm (or 3/16 an inch)</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll only see bed bugs in the daytime during food scarcity (fewer blood meals) or if there are heavy infestations - otherwise the bugs are mainly active at night.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll get bed bugs in homes, motels, and hotels - and thus knowhow to vacuum for bed bugs.

</ul>
<h2 id="signs-or-indicators-of-bed-bug-problems">Signs or Indicators of Bed Bug Problems</h2>
<p>Below are the key indicators of the bed bug problems you&rsquo;ll get in your spaces.
<strong>1. Bed Bug Bites</strong>
-Bed bug bites may be
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">confused with mosquito bites</a>
. Bed bugs will bite humans on multiple sites that are close together - this differentiates them from mosquito bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bug bites mainly happen on exposed skin - especially on the shoulders, arms, necks, and upper body.</li>
<li>When bitten, you&rsquo;ll experience swelling, red welts, or itching - but it might not be obvious for some people or for several days.
**2. Fecal stains **</li>
<li>Bed bugs can also become evident when you notice their excrement (or fecal stains) - they&rsquo;ll appear brown, black, or red - mounds or stains.</li>
<li>The black feces that create stains are mainly digested blood - and will dry to create that raised spot.</li>
<li>The fecal spots will also appear like feces from the German roaches - check theseroach killers for apartments- but they&rsquo;ll be smooth-textured as opposed to being rough.
<strong>3. Molted exoskeletons</strong></li>
<li>Bed bugs will molt or drop their exoskeleton/ shell as they progress between the larval stages - the exoskeleton is light-colored and translucent.</li>
<li>Check the rooms or around the box spring to see if the area has molted bed bug exoskeleton - this is indicative of population growth among the bed bugs.</li>
<li>Once the bugs feed on that blood meal, they&rsquo;ll begin growing and will finally molt to develop to another stage. Molting allows them to grow larger in body size.</li>
<li>On color, these exoskeleton shells will appear lighter-colored but will be empty - but they may have different colors and sizes.
<strong>4. Physical evidence</strong>
(
flashlight inspection
) - Bed bugs can also be identified with physical evidence - being present in carpeting, upholstery crevices, headboard, box spring, on the bed frame, and mattress.</li>
<li>For heavily infested spaces, you can find the bed bugs around the coach or chair seams, oncurtain folds, and under the cushions.</li>
<li>You may also check for visual bed bug&rsquo;s activity such as being increvices &amp; cracks, furniture or pillows, fecal or spotting on furniture, pillows, and sheets.
<strong>5. Professional Inspection</strong></li>
<li>You may also hire professional pest inspectors or exterminators to check the signs or evidence of bed bugs in your spaces and home.</li>
<li>With a positive identification of the bed bugs, the professional exterminator can help create a suitable bug-treatment plan for your spaces.
**6. Use Active monitors **</li>
<li>To notice bed bugs you can also employ active bed bug monitors with insecticide or traps. These will produce carbon dioxide to attract such bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but-how-did-you-get-thebed-bugs">But How did you Get theBed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are great hitchhikers - but they
won&rsquo;t jump or fly, unlikefleas
. Bed bugs don&rsquo;t love hiding in the human body and thus you&rsquo;ll find that on various house objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, you&rsquo;ll simply require to check the cardboard boxes, furniture, and luggage.</li>
<li>Bed bugs may equally survive in your luggage on a plane - and thus they&rsquo;ll easily spread over many world locations.
Further, check on various second-hand items like furniture - these may carry bed bugs into your home.</li>
<li>From your traveling, you can also carry bedbugs from your various motels or hotels - especially for the low-budget hotels.</li>
<li>These low-quality hotels tend to have high guest turnover - and thus there is a high possibility of some dropping bed bugs.</li>
<li>Thus, if the bed bug that&rsquo;s dropped is a female and also fertilized - it&rsquo;ll lay eggs leading to the major population growth of the bugs.
Since bed bugs tend to spread easily, you&rsquo;ll find these bugs in many places.</li>
<li>Such places you may pick the bed bugs include concert halls, movie theaters, buses, planes, airport lounges, bars, and coffee shops.</li>
<li>Further, for the city, you can find the bed bugs inlibrary books.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identifying--treating-bites">Identifying &amp; Treating bites</h2>
<p>To identify bed bugs - you should know that they are a swollen and red bump that has a dark center.</p>
<ul>
<li>These bites are grouped together and in a line - they can have hives and blisters.
Bed bugs will be on any of your body parts that they&rsquo;ll mainly be on the exposed body parts (especially while you&rsquo;re sleeping) such as face, legs, arms, and hands.</li>
<li>The bite areas could appear like flea or mosquito bites - and they&rsquo;re slightly swollen.
You&rsquo;ll notice the bites will be aligned in a single straight line or in groupings - but flea bites will be on the ankles or lower legs while the mosquito bites will appear more sporadic.</li>
<li>However, other individuals won&rsquo;t be allergic to the bite from bed bugs and hence won&rsquo;t show bite signs.
<strong>Treating bites�</strong>
To treat the bed bug bites, you&rsquo;ll use a myriad of methods - but you may require a few weeks to achieve great results.
<strong>1. Ice Pack</strong></li>
<li>Besides using those over-the-counter treatments, ice packs can help relieve the pain from bed bug bites.</li>
<li>The ice tends to soothe the bite area - but you can also use some cold cloth or some water+baking soda paste.</li>
<li>The towel-wrapped ice will help relieve burning and itching sensations on the bite while also cutting the swelling.
<strong>2. Anti-itch Cream</strong></li>
<li>First wash the bite areas with some water + soap - this reduces itchiness and prevents further skin infection.</li>
<li>Next, to reduce the skin itchiness, apply some over-the-counter corticosteroid cream or calamine lotion onto the bed bug bite area.
**2. **
<strong>Oral medication</strong></li>
<li>Some of the approved over-the-counter (OTC) treatments for bed bug bites include hydrocortisone lotion or cream that&rsquo;ll relieve the swelling and itchiness.</li>
<li>Also, you can take some diphenhydramine (OTC antihistamine - also known as Benadryl) to help reduce the bite itchiness - but first, try some anti-itch cream.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, adult bed bugs will be oval-or flat-shaped but small and wingless (have wing pads, however) with a 4 to 5 mm length.</p>
<ul>
<li>The brown-colored bugs will turn orange or red as they feed on blood - they&rsquo;re visible with most naked eyes while the nymphs may not be visible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-do-bed-bugs-smell-like">What Do Bed Bugs Smell Like??</h2>
<p>There are many signs that an infestation of bed bugs might be present; some things you might commonly notice are blood spots and the bed bugs dropping, which appear as specks.
You may also notice that you suffer from irritation and itching as a result of these creatures. However, one of the giveaway signs that you have some unwelcome guests could be their scent - check these
bed bug nymphs
.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdntsIC2kCs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdntsIC2kCs</a>
It is more common to notice bed bugs&rsquo; odor when there is a much larger infestation; due to their small size, they need to be in a larger number for the smell to be potent enough to be detected by human nostrils.
There have been suggestions that the smell of
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef636">bed bugs</a>
can be compared to berries&rsquo; scent and has a musty yet sweet aroma. Some people have remarked that the smell is similar to the herb cilantro (or coriander, depending on where you come from).
That being said, there are various smells linked with bed bugs, and it is somewhat down to your personal ability to pick up on scents as to what you might smell. Some of the most common comparisons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotting wood</li>
<li>Must-similar to what you might smell in a damp building</li>
<li>Something along the lines of cinnamon</li>
<li>Crayons</li>
<li>Almonds</li>
<li>Stink bugs (check stink bugs vs. bed bugs)
It is quite likely that if you enter into a property where bed bugs are present with an odor, you will pick up on this right away; however, if you have an infestation in your home, you may become immune to the smell.

<h2 id="what-is-the-reason-for-bed-bugs-having-a-distinct-scent">What Is The Reason For Bed Bugs Having A Distinct Scent?</h2>
<p>There are many reasons that various
animals have an odor and the reason for bed bugs
is rather interesting. One of the main reasons is similar to a homing device.
On top of this, they will let off a scent when they are fearful; for example, when exposed to light, their bodies will react and emit a chemical that releases a scent - even for the
eggs
.
This is a defense mechanism seen in quite a few species across the animal kingdom, most famously the skunk. The bed bugs will leave their scent on their home so that they can quickly return to it later.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-best-way-to-identify-a-bed-bug-infestation">What Is The Best Way To Identify A Bed Bug Infestation?</h2>
<p>We briefly touched on how you might spot a bed bug infestation aside from their scent - e.g.,
flea bites vs. bed bugs bites
. Let&rsquo;s look in a little more detail at the signs you should be looking out for.
As we mentioned, to properly smell bed bugs, you will need to be met with a rather large gathering of these pests, so it is best to tackle the problem earlier or spot any of the following signs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The shells of bed bugs may be found on your soft furnishings or flooring.�You might find dead bed bugs.</li>
<li>You may notice that you have bite marks on your skin or find that your skin is irritated and itchy.</li>
<li>Bed bug fecal matter anddead bed bugs may be present in the home; this�is usually black, dust-like particles that will leave a red smear when rubbed or crushed.

<h2 id="common-misconceptions-about-the-smell-of-bed-bugs">Common Misconceptions About The Smell Of Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>You are probably beginning to understand that the smell of bed bugs can differ significantly from person to person, but some myths surround their odor far from being truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might have heard that these creatures give off an odor of urine, but this is not true.</li>
<li>It is also said that bed bugs smell similar to mothballs, but there is no truth in this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-dead-bed-bugs-smell-different">Do Dead Bed Bugs Smell Different?</h2>
<p>If you are concerned about a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-jump/">bed bug (they don&rsquo;t jump)</a>
infestation, one of the things that you might wonder is whether the deceased
<a href="%25view_link%25">bed bug</a>
s will leave a worse odor.
The odor certainly won&rsquo;t be putrid, you may notice the scent of cilantro to begin with, but if the bug was crushed whilst still digesting a feed, you might also pick up an aroma of blood.
Another thing to be mindful of with large infestations is that the buildup of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like/">bed bug poop</a>
may give off a rusty odor; this could be a warning sign that they are present. Read Also:

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bugs
have a distinct smell, but it can vary depending on how they interpret the scent.
That being said, it is possible to pick up on a bed bug infestation a long time before their odor becomes apparent.</p>

found in the garden
but on some rare occasions, they make entry into our homes.� But do ever wonder what do stink bugs to survive?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, stink bugs are well known for their pungent smell. There are many species of stink bugs and you can tell from their different colours.</li>
<li>Though the most common colour is brown other colours ranges from brown to red, yellow and white.</li>
<li>Stink bugs have mouth parts that have needle-like appendages that help in the consumption and uptake of nutrients in their bodies.
Stink bugs are not a

but when you find them, they are most probably hiding for winter.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Stink Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-stink-bugs-eat-food">What Do Stink Bugs Eat? Food.</h2>
<p>Stink bugs eat a lot of things in our garden and also in the house. But their favourite food is tomatoes, ears of corn, leaves, flowers, fruits and soya beans.</p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, they also attack and eat other small insects.</li>
<li>Through their needle-like mouthparts, they are able to pierce through the fruits and food and extract the delicacy out of them.
This mouth part has the capacity to absorb the food extracts into the insects body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-fruits-">**1. Fruits **</h3>
<p>Stink bugs are fond of fruits especially those on trees because they are soft and sweet. They like sticking around fruits like pears,
apples
and peaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because of their soft skins that are easy to penetrate and also suck the juice and the delicacy out of it.
To most farmers, this attack by the stink bugs results in huge losses because the affected fruits cannot be sold. Infested fruits develop scars that make them hard to consume.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-tomatoes-">**2. Tomatoes� **</h3>
<p>Stink bugs also like feasting on tomatoes too. They enjoy sucking of the juice from them just like they do on fruits.</p>
<ul>
<li>They feed on tomatoes by piercing through their soft skin and flesh, sucking as much as they need.
Just like fruits, infested tomatoes cannot to eat or sell to farmers making them suffer loss.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-soybeans-">**3. Soybeans **</h3>
<p>If you have soybeans, better be prepared to see stinky bugs on your farm because thats one of their favourite place to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their needle-like mouth will find its way into the soybean causing damage and drain the energy from the plant.
Their damage to soybean is extensive and can cause stunted growth, withering and less productive crops.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-corn"><strong>3. Corn</strong></h3>
<p>This is yet another favourite food for the stinky bugs. With corns, the bugs target the ears and the husks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like they do with other food sources, they project their needle-like mouth on the soft ear and suck the nutrients from the husk.
Infested corn appear withered and dehydrated too. For those with corn, stinky bugs can really be a menace causing huge losses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-stems-leaves-and-flowers-">**4. Stems, leaves and flowers **</h3>
<p>Apart from feeding on fruits, stink bugs are also capable of consuming other parts of the plant like leaves, stems and flowers.
The damage on orchards and farms can be extensively leading to huge losses.</p>
<h3 id="5other-pests-">5.**Other Pests **</h3>
<p>Not all stink bugs feed on plants, others are predators to another pest on the farm.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is also a beneficial part because it will help on reducing the pest population in the garden.</li>
<li>Do Stink Bugs Eat ants, aphids, orspiders?
They prey on aphids, caterpillars, larvae of beetles and other destructive pests.

First, they&rsquo;re not solid and difficult to pick up - they&rsquo;ll readily smear like toothpaste since it looks like a liquid.
<a href="https://nysipm.cornell.edu/whats-bugging-you/%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)/bed-bug-faqs///">Bed bugs</a>
will feed every 5 to 10 days and numb your pain using its anesthetic saliva (
see bed bug images
). You may notice eggs,
<em>feces</em>
, and skin castings on bed or old box spring.
<strong>In summary, bed bug poop looks like tiny-spot clusters that you&rsquo;ll find on your bed. The feces are made up of digested blood - but they won&rsquo;t be red because the blood has dried. The feces appear darker, black, or rust-colored. Check quality bed bug sprays below.�</strong>

<h2 id="what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like-7-tips">What Does Bed Bug Poop Look Like? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>*When smeared on different surfaces, bed bug poop leaves some dark or pink-colored stains - mainly, it&rsquo;ll go smooth and tiny drop when not absorbed by your fabric. *

.</p>
<h3 id="1-dark-colored">1. Dark-Colored</h3>
<p>Bed bug feces will be dark-colored as it&rsquo;s composed of the host&rsquo;s blood that&rsquo;s digested - hosts include human beings and pets like cats and dogs - check for
bed bug nymphs
.
Does old bed bug
poop smear? The fecal
matter of the bed bugs
leaves some dark marks when smeared. Once
bed bugs suck blood
, bed bugs combine into clusters in mattress seams (crevices, furniture, &amp; carpets.
You&rsquo;ll rarely get bed bug feces on your sheets. The
bugs won&rsquo;t digest their blood meal fast</p>
<ul>
<li>even a few days. After feeding,
bed bugs hide
under the mattress where they&rsquo;ll digest the blood and poop.
Bed bugs don&rsquo;t catch illnesses from the bed bug poop, and hence they&rsquo;ll drop their feces everywhere - particularly on areas that they digest on under mattresses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-smooth--whatdoes-bed-bugpoop-feel-like">2. Smooth -�WhatDoes Bed BugPoop Feel Like?</h3>
<p>Further, the fecal matter is smooth - compared to the
cockroach waste
that feels very granular. The feces will smear very quickly and thus stain chairs, sofas, furniture, drapes, bed sheets, mattresses.
The bugs will drop their poop,
eggs (hatched or live)
, and skins in their hiding places in the clusters. Further, the bugs collect into a big cluster that&rsquo;ll be easy to identify.
You&rsquo;ll mainly find the bed bug feces and also bed bugs around mattress seams. The mattress tufts will be an excellent concealing area for the bugs to molt and breed, waiting to suck blood.
Therefore, I would recommend using
bed bug mattress encasements
to prevent and treat the bugs - besides treating crevices and cracks plus box springs.

<h3 id="3-does-bed-bug-feces-smell">3. Does Bed Bug Feces Smell?</h3>
<p>Bed bug feces
will be different from fecal matter from various animals - considering their smell. But the poop will have a musty smell due to having a large amount of digested blood.
It is comparable to the smell you feel to the scent of blood when you cut your skin. However, the scent of bed bug droppings will be overtaken by other bed bug smells.
Bed bugs use the harsh smells to get them around different objects - the smell will come from their harbor-age. You&rsquo;ll feel the rusty smell like
coriander from the bed bugs</p>
<ul>
<li>including under mattresses.
Further, some humans consider
moldy &amp; wet smell
that would occur when you leave wet clothes in the washer for a long time. You&rsquo;ll notice the rusty smell like that of blood.
However, you&rsquo;ll notice the smell when you get near the bed bug feces or disturb the bed bugs like if you get under the mattresses&rsquo; sheets - check
flea spray for yard
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-you-pick-bed-bug-feces">Can you Pick Bed Bug Feces?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s relatively impossible to pick up bed bug feces since they&rsquo;re liquid and not solid like human feces or droppings. The wastes are soft and liquid and hence will only smear on surfaces.
Bed bug feces will smear like
toothpaste and soak into the sheets or mattress fabric to leave a tiny stain. Further, the droppings are about the size of small crumbs, and thus it&rsquo;ll be challenging to pick them.
But any of the droppings that&rsquo;ll be allowed to lie around for a long time will dry up and thus may be easy to sweep them off. The droppings need to be resting on some non-absorbent surfaces such as wood.
However, it won&rsquo;t be essential to pick
bed bug feces to control
the bugs from your house. You&rsquo;ll need to use a cleaning solution to clean them off after soaking.</p>
<h2 id="bed-bug-feces-on-mattress">Bed Bug Feces on Mattress</h2>
<p>A bed bug will drop their feces, particularly under your mattress - and they&rsquo;ll have the same appearance as those on the bedsheets. Hence, the feces, if wet, will smear over the mattress.
However, dried
bed bug feces will get absorbed into the
mattress fabric. Further, they&rsquo;ll occur on fecal matter clusters - particularly under the mattress.
You&rsquo;ll find most of the fecal matter
around the bed bug&rsquo;s harbor-age</p>
<ul>
<li>this as noted above the sheets and mattress - they&rsquo;ll signify that bed bugs are around their living areas.
However, you&rsquo;ll also find the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bug-bombs-work/">bed bugs around zipping</a>
, buttons, or mattress piping. You may notice
bed bug shells
that drop when the bugs molt.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYoDF2Uoec">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYoDF2Uoec</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-black-spots-or-stains-on-my-sheets-frombed-bugs">Are Black Spots or Stains on my Sheets fromBed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Have you seen some black spots on your bed - well, these don&rsquo;t bed bug feces? Sure, bed bugs will leave tiny and bright stains - but they&rsquo;ll appear in a line.
The tiny bloodstain is from hosts&rsquo; blood - the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dead-bed-bugs/">bed bugs</a>
drop the blood from their mouths as they move from harbor-age. Thus, the blood is undigested and hence will be brighter than bed bug feces.
You may also notice more significant bright red stains (equally on the sheets) that&rsquo;s irregularly shaped. These stains occur when you
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">crush the bed bugs</a>
after they&rsquo;ve taken their fresh blood meal.
Further, some blood spots may happen when you crash the bed bugs as you turn and twist in your sleep. However, any other tiny black spots on your sheets may be from
fleas
.
Further,
flea dirt
or bed bug feces may equally have some black spots if they&rsquo;ve dried - so conduct the right searches to ensure that you have or don&rsquo;t have bed bugs in your home.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-up-bed-bug-droppings">How to Clean Up Bed Bug Droppings</h2>
<p><strong>Hydrogen peroxide</strong>
further uses hydrogen peroxide as it&rsquo;ll work like an oxidizer or bleaching agent to clean the bed bug feces and remove stains on your fabrics.
Using the dilute hydrogen peroxide will, besides bleaching the mattress fabric, help loosen the feces stains, and thus it&rsquo;ll be effortless to wipe them off.
<strong>Dish soap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the all-time good dish soap would be an appropriate
remedy for cleaning bed bug
feces. Soak the fabric with feces - this will loosen the fecal matter, clean, and remove mild stains.
Let feces dry - Besides, you may let the bed bug feces to rest on the surface for some time and dry. So, you&rsquo;ll only need to wipe them off before encasing the mattress finally.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, what does bed bug poop look like? In summary, the fecal matter is brown or rusty-dark colored in color - NB - something that&rsquo;s dark than the color of fresh blood.
Also,
bed bug
feces will soak in your fabrics to leave a regular and tiny stain. This will look anything like you dropped some ink drop on your bed sheet.
Finally, bed bug poop will smear on your sheets to form a shape like that created by ink stains. Read Also:

      <description>Its very discouraging when you use the commercial as well as DIY bed bug solutions but still have bed bugs crawling in your house.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its very discouraging when you use the commercial as well as DIY bed bug solutions but still have bed bugs crawling in your house.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could be wondering whether bed bugs have natural predators which can used to control their population. So, What eats bed bugs?
<strong>If you need a quick answer, bed bugs have many natural predictors that will readily kill and eat them. For example, spiders, cockroaches, masked hunters, house centipedes - Some are household pests.�</strong>
So, lets get started!</p>
<h2 id="what-eats-bed-bugs">What Eats Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the use of natural predators will not have a significant effect on the bed bug population.</p>
<p>This is because natural predators have other sources of food and will therefore not go hunting for bed bugs. In addition, bed bugs reproduce rapidly. So, its difficult for predators to wipe them out.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-masked-hunter">1. The Masked Hunter</h3>
<p>The masked hunters have been characteristically named the masked bedbug hunters because of their tendency to hunt and feed on bed bugs.</p>
<p>Standing at between 17 and 22 mm long, masked hunters are non-native to the United States, but have spread across many states.</p>
<p>Their color ranges from dark brown to black and have wings for flying. Masked hunters typically inhabit warm places. In cold areas they live indoors, where they feed on bed bugs, house arthropods among other small creatures.</p>
<p>You are likely to see masked hunters in areas inhabited by pigeons and bats. This is because pigeons and bats harbor bed bugs and other creatures that make their diet. Though masked hunters feed on bed bugs, you shouldnt imagine of having them in your house!</p>
<p>Theyll bite even humans, especially around the mouth. Thats why they are sometimes called the kissing bug. Their bite is as painful as a bee sting.</p>
<h3 id="2-cockroaches">2. Cockroaches</h3>
<p>Roaches are very fond of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-cockroaches-eat-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/)/">eating bed bugs and their eggs</a>
. In fact roaches will eat anything from food crumbs, wood, paper, glue, trash, the list is endless.</p>
<p>Standing at between 1 and 3 inches long, roaches outsize bed bugs and can move very fast, making it easy to run after the bed bugs. However, not all roaches eat bed bug. The most common bed bug eating roaches include the American roach, The German roach and the oriental roach.</p>
<p>Although cockroaches can eat a great deal of bed bugs, therere good reasons for not relying on them to eradicate bed bugs in your house. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs reproduce more rapidly than roaches. Thus theyll grow quickly to replenish their population.</li>
<li>Roaches are pesky pest you dont want to have around. Apart from causing a lot of mess in your house, they can be possible carriers of diseases like salmonella.</li>
<li>Cockroaches are difficult and expensive to get rid of.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-spiders">3. Spiders</h3>
<p>Spiders are
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/">natural predators of bed bugs</a>
, mosquitoes, flies and many other small creatures. Some spiders make webs in different corners of the house to trap and eat small creatures that crawl or fly nearby.</p>
<p>Others like the Philodromid Crab Spiders are swift enough to track and run after the bed bugs.�Although some spiders are poisonous, many of them are naturally harmless and will feed on most of the nagging house pests including bed bugs.</p>
<p>Spiders that are known to eat bed bugs include, the Philodromid Crab Spiders, Cellar spiders, jumping spider and the Cobweb spider.</p>
<p>Usually, spiders dont chew their prey. Instead, they paralyze their prey and consume it with their digestive juices.</p>
<p>Similar to other natural predators, spiders will neither be a good option for eradicating bed bugs. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiders eat a host of other insects. So, they wont go hunting for bed bugs in your house.</li>
<li>Though usually harmless, spiders are scary to have around.</li>
<li>Their cobwebs make your house untidy</li>
<li>Some spiders are poisonous</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-ants">4. Ants</h3>
<p>Many ant species love sweet foods like honeydew but will also
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-ants-eat-bed-bugs/">ants feed on small creatures including bed bugs</a>
to add protein to their diet.</p>
<p>The most common bed bug eating ants include the pharaoh ant, fire ants and the argentine ant. But the pharaoh ant has been documented to be especially notorious for eating bed bugs.</p>
<p>However, given the elusive nature of bed bugs, ants will have a hard time getting them. So you expect that ants will not significantly reduce the bed bug population.</p>
<p>In addition, most ants prefer to feed on carcasses rather than hunting down their prey.�Another limitation for using ants to eradicate bed bugs is that they reproduce rapidly just like the bed bugs.</p>
<p>So, in a matter of time, you could have an ant infestation which will need extra costs to eradicate.</p>
<h3 id="5-house-centipedes">5. House Centipedes</h3>
<p>House centipedes are natural predators for most household pests including roaches, spiders, moths, bed bugs among other small creatures.</p>
<p>Standing at between 5 and 150 mm long and with between 15 to 175 pairs of legs, these arachnids are very good at hunting.</p>
<p>Their rather flat configuration allows them to get through tiny spaces or cracks where bed bugs usually hide and breed. Plus they can move swiftly compared to bed bugs</p>
<p>Although centipedes have a good chance of feeding on bed bugs, you will need a host of them to have any impact on the fast growing bed bug population.</p>
<p>However, having too many centipedes crawling around the house can be very irritating. Furthermore, they can bite humans in defence.</p>
<h3 id="6-lizards">6. Lizards</h3>
<p>Lizards are natural predators of insects including bed bugs. Their diet is essentially composed of insects and arachnids. Thats why lizards hang around places infested with insects such as lavatory, kitchen and store house.</p>
<p>Luckily, lizards are harmless and some of their species are usually kept as pets. But again you will need a host of lizards to eradicate the bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>A large number of lizards can be quite disturbing. Plus their body size prevents them from running after bed bugs in narrow spaces where they hide most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="can-natural-predators-help-eradicate-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Natural Predators Help Eradicate Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>You have seen that therere many natural predators that can be used to feed on bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>Although these predators can eat a significant population of bed bugs, they cant be relied on to eradicate the bed begs. Compared to other bed bug control methods, natural predators have a number of limitations. These include:</p>
<h3 id="1-cannot-eliminate-entire-bed-bug-population">1. Cannot Eliminate Entire Bed Bug Population</h3>
<p>As you have noticed, most of the predators feed on several other creatures apart from bed bugs. That means, they dont go looking for bed bugs in their hiding places.</p>
<p>Predators feed on bed bugs that come in the open. Therefore, they cannot significantly reduce the number of bed bugs in your home.</p>
<h3 id="2-bed-bugs-reproduce-and-spread-rapidly">2. Bed Bugs Reproduce and Spread Rapidly</h3>
<p>Compared to their predators, bed bugs breed and multiply rapidly. On average, an adult can lay up to 12 eggs every day or 500 eggs in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Thus, it doesnt take long before a few bed bugs grow and become an infestation. If you rely on natural predators, bed bugs will breed quickly and overwhelm them.</p>
<h3 id="3-youll-be-surrounded-by-too-many-pests">3. Youll Be Surrounded by Too Many Pests</h3>
<p>In order for natural predators to have any impact on the bed bugs in your house, you need to have enough of these creatures.</p>
<p>This means that youll be surrounded by a host of other creatures like roaches, spiders, centipedes, masked hunters among others.</p>
<p>Most of these predators are pesky pests that will wreak havoc in your house on top of your bed bug menace.</p>
<p>Some of them are carriers of diseases such as dysentery and salmonella. Others will destroy your property and make your house very untidy.</p>
<p>You might not escape bits from predators like spiders, masked hunters or centipedes. Whats more, bed bugs hide in narrow spaces inside mattresses and sofa set. You definitely dont want these creatures around these places.</p>
<h3 id="4-natural-predators-cannot-control-infestation">4. Natural Predators Cannot Control Infestation</h3>
<p>Usually, bed bugs breed in difficult-to-reach areas. So, it would very hard for predators to feed on their eggs and larvae.</p>
<p>In addition not all of the predators mentioned above will feed on bed bug eggs. Thus, natural predators cannot be used to prevent bed bugs from breeding</p>
<h3 id="5-cost-of-eradicating-natural-predators-is-high">5. Cost of Eradicating Natural Predators is High.</h3>
<p>If you introduce natural predators to feed on bed bugs you will be creating another pest problem in your house. Similar to bed bugs, many of these predators reproduce rapidly, meaning they can easily become an infestation.</p>
<p>The cost of eradicating these predators is also high. Even worse, some predators like roaches can be as hard to eradicate as the bed bugs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Although natural predators can be used to feed on bed bugs, they are not reliable methods for eradicating an infestation.</p>
<p>You can however use the available commercial bed bug treatments or apply the do-it-yourself procedures to get rid of bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>You can use chemical sprays such as permethrin, encasements and diatomaceous earth among others.</p>

,
traps
,

*When you squash a bed bug, it leaves bed bug eggs, a bloodstain plus a terrible odor. *
<em>Bed bugs, like cooked pea or beans, will be easy to squash. But baby bed bugs will be easier to crash - when they&rsquo;ve sucked blood.�</em>
<em>You may squash or burst bed bugs with your fingers or shoe leaving behind a red stain from the host&rsquo;s blood.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug">Details: What Happens When You Squish a Bed Bug?</h2>
<p>When you squash a bed bug that has freshly fed from its host, it&rsquo;ll leave blood and bloodstains on your finger. Any bed bug that hasn&rsquo;t sucked blood for some time will have a hard shell - this means that it won&rsquo;t squash easily.
But the nymph&rsquo;s exoskeleton is soft and thus makes it easy to squash.
Bed bugs only have wing pads
, and you can use Ammonia to kill bed bugs.
You can squash bed bugs unconsciously. For example, when you&rsquo;re sleeping, you can quickly squash some
bed bugs that will bite
you. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll see some large blood smears on your body - besides
bed bug bites
, clothes, and bed sheets when you wake up.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtnRmjDexjo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtnRmjDexjo</a></p>
<h2 id="are-bed-bugshells-soft-or-hard">Are Bed BugShells Soft or Hard?</h2>
<p>The bed bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton (outer part of its body) is a hard casing that&rsquo;s rigid to give the insect its body structure. Bed bugs will also shed or molt their exoskeleton as they grow.
However, the bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton can&rsquo;t prevent you from squashing the bug at will. Further, the back part of the bed bug is highly flexible - this allows an easy busting when you crush the bug.
Bed bugs feed, and their backside tends to expand, allowing the insect to take in more. Therefore, the bed bug&rsquo;s rear side will expand to hold more blood, food, and water.
The bugs will pop easily when they&rsquo;ve sucked blood - particularly when their backside has expanded. Notably, before sucking blood, bed bugs&rsquo; exoskeleton will be hard to crash like a raw pea or bean.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-easy-to-squash-bed-bug-eggs">Is it Easy to Squash Bed Bug Eggs?</h2>
<p>Well, just like the nymphs, bed bug eggs are soft, and thus, you&rsquo;ll find them equally easy to squash - they have a soft exoskeleton. But crashing eggs will only leave a clear fluid as opposed to red stains.
However, you&rsquo;ll find that bed bug eggs will be challenging to lift or scrape off the ground or
mattress encasements</p>
<ul>
<li>they&rsquo;ll be hidden off in dark places or small cracks.
But when in hidden areas, bed bug eggs are covered in the glue-type liquid that allows them to hide in wood or fabric. Thus, it&rsquo;ll be hard to pick up eggs and squash them. But bed bug spray will be the only sure weapon against bed bug eggs.
However, it&rsquo;ll be challenging to scrape off or pick bed bugs eggs from most surfaces. The eggs will mainly be hidden in crevices and cracks to avoid unnecessary disturbance.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYACvmm5zAE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYACvmm5zAE</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-aboutstains-from-squashed-bed-bug">What aboutStains from Squashed Bed Bug?</h2>
<p>Squashing bed bugs will leave blood-stained drops on your fabric, fingers, and clothes. The blood will be from the blood-meal from human beings.
Further, the bloodstains left behind will also come from any digested blood already in the bed bug&rsquo;s body - bust such blood will be thicker and darker.
Therefore, don&rsquo;t squash bed bugs, particularly if they&rsquo;re on fabrics, leaving hard stains. If not, you can clean the material to remove the bloodstain, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a fresh bloodstain, pour cold water on the stain as this will allow easier scrubbing and removal.</li>
<li>Next, now use some soap on the blood stain to create some lather,some little salt, and wash thoroughly.</li>
<li>However, for a dry blood stain, use a stain remover to pre-treatment the area and thoroughlysprinkle some ammoniaand launder.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-bed-bugs-smell-when-squashed">Do Bed Bugs Smell When Squashed?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs will smell
around to realize what&rsquo;s in the surrounding. For example,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs will sense the human skin&rsquo;s smell and hide</a>
under the mattress - you&rsquo;ll feel the strong, pungent odor.
