<ul>
<li><strong>Can I use <a href="/posts/what-do-baby-fleas-look-like/">baby</a> shampoo on my cat? No, its not a good idea to use baby shampoo on cats. Baby shampoo is not designed for cat pets and may contain some chemicals that may harm the furry pet.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Some shampoos may also affect the cats skin by causing irritation and dry skin too. Instead, its a good idea to use the cat shampoos that are available in the market.</strong>
In this detailed article, I have gathered all the necessary information about these shampoos. Also, get to learn more about the alternative shampoos that you can use on the cat.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-can-i-use-baby-shampoo-in-my-cat-a-healthy-pet">Details: Can I Use Baby Shampoo In My Cat? A Healthy Pet</h2>
<p>No, because baby shampoo is made for human skin which is very different from cat skin. Though cats are not good with water using shampoo is going to affect their skin by causing dryness and also irritation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats are also good with self-grooming and it will be rare to get them with real dirt that needs a bath.
However, if you find yourself in a position to bathe your cat, instead of the baby shampoo, replace that with cat shampoo. A cat shampoo is made with specifications that wont harm the cat&rsquo;s skin.

<h3 id="will-baby-shampoo-hurt-your-cat">Will Baby Shampoo Hurt Your Cat?</h3>
<p>Though in general baby shampoo is not safe for your cat, their damage levels differ. For instance, unscented shampoo is less irritating and has low alkaline levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of scent in the shampoo is a good much for the cat&rsquo;s fur alkaline.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a scented shampoo is not good for your cat. They will cause skin irritation and also dry skin.
Castile soap is among the good baby shampoo that you can use on your cat with fewer effects. You can treat this as the last option if indeed you fail to get the cat shampoo.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-i-use-baby-shampoo-on-my-kitten">Can I Use Baby Shampoo on My Kitten?</h3>
<p>No. kittens have more sensitive skin than the cats themselves. Baby shampoos are not good for them. Though kittens are easy to manipulate and make them have a bath, it should not be the reason to harm them too.</p>
<ul>
<li>They get themselves dirty and less skilled with self-grooming which makes it more important for you to bathe them. This could also serve as a good chance to train them on bathing.</li>
<li>If the baby shampoo is harmful to adult cats, then it is dangerous in kittens and should not be used on them.
If you have to wash the kittens, I recommend you get cat shampoo which has the right components to clean your cat. You can also consult with your vet for the recommended cat shampoos.

<h2 id="reasons-why-your-cat-might-need-to-be-bathed">Reasons Why Your Cat Might Need To Be Bathed</h2>
<p>Though cats hate water and getting them to bathe is strenuous. But there are times you have to take the bull by the horns and get the cat to bathe no matter what.
Below are several reasons explaining what happens when you dont make bathing your cat your business.</p>
<h3 id="fleas-infestation">Fleas infestation</h3>
<p>Fleas like attacking and hiding on furry pets like cats and dogs. If you do fleas control and fail to bathe your cats and dogs, you stand more risk of infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its easy to tell your cat is infected by fleas from the constant grooming and itchiness.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you spot fleas in your house, it goes without saying-your pets are also infested.
Among the suitable ways of eliminating fleas from pets is a bath with warm and soapy water. An unscented cat shampoo is also a good idea to use when bathing them to eliminate the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dirt-from-the-coat">Dirt from the coat</h3>
<p>Some cats will go hunting and some even go to the ceiling and attics where they get themselves dirty.
Though they may groom themselves, sometimes its had to get lots of cobwebs and other dirt from their coat. When this happens, you have all the obligations to make sure your cat is clean.
Cats are very fond of this getting the coats dirty and a good bath with a cat shampoo would be good for them. Related:

<h3 id="medical-reasons">Medical Reasons</h3>
<p>If your cat is sick or injured and can hardly groom herself, you need to take up the task of bathing her.
This is the same case with an aging cat who will also likely groom herself and may need your help bathing.
How do you tell, you need to bathe your cat? Well, the cat becomes smelly, has shabby fur, obese cats, and even the injured.
As a cat owner, these bathing your cat and others pets keep your home clean too.

<h3 id="why-is-my-cat-licking-their-fur-after-bathing-with-shampoo">Why Is My Cat Licking Their Fur After Bathing With Shampoo?</h3>
<p>After the bath, you are more likely to see your cat licking their fur. There are different interpretations to this. Both of you did not dry fur well and the cat is only trying to rinse herself.
Another alternative is that the shampoo could be irritating on the skin or the cat is trying to get rid of the scent.
This cats reaction just tells you the relationship between cat and water. It is also normal to see the cat running scared because of the trauma from a compulsory bath.

<ul>
<li>Though a cat wont like it a bath is necessary and healthy. For instance, its necessary to bathe your cat when its sick, obese, or even dirty young kittens.</li>

      <description>This article will answer the question, &amp;#39;can you use dog shampoo on cats?&amp;#39;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article will answer the question, &ldquo;can you use dog shampoo on cats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike dogs, cats don&rsquo;t need to be bathed as often; they
keep their fur healthy and clean
using their tongue.</p>
<p>So, caring for a cat can be easy, but there are some instances where your feline friend needs a more intensive shampoo, maybe to remove bad smells or contamination.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re worried if you can use dog shampoo for your cats; this article is for you!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The answer: Simply, NO. Most dog shampoos have harsh chemicals, ingredients (like tar and permethrin), and high pH that can be toxic to cats.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>Thus, only you use feline-friendly�shampoo for grooming your kitty. Also, If you use dog products on your cat, consult with your vet first before trying it.</strong>
Dog shampoo and other flea-control products (even those with natural ingredients) put cats at a
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-ok-to-use-dog-shampoo-on-cats">greater health risk</a>
than it does to its canine cousins.</li>
</ul>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Dog Shampoos&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="why-must-you-avoid-using-dog-shampoo-on-cats">Why Must You Avoid Using Dog Shampoo On Cats?</h2>
<p>Many people wonder why they should bathe their cats as self-grooming is a natural feline instinct. There are two things you might want to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may need to wash off something your cat got into and get it out of his fur so that he won&rsquo;t ingest it when grooming.</li>
<li>The second reason, which is probably more common, is that your cat may have <a href="/posts/best-dog-backpack-carrier-for-hiking/">fleas</a> or other parasites.
So, what should you use instead?</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re on the fence about whether or not your pet needs assistance with its grooming routine, at least consider using natural products that are skin-great for cats.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-harmful-chemicals-like-permethrin-and-tar">1. Harmful Chemicals like Permethrin and Tar</h3>
<p>Using <a href="/posts/best-dog-beds/">dog</a> shampoo on cats is not a good idea because some shampoos contain chemicals that are harmful to cats.</p>
<p>Some of these chemicals include permethrin, selenium sulfite, tea tree oils, and coal tar, etc.</p>
<p>You should not use dog shampoo on cats, just like you would never use baby shampoo on a cat to avoid the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-i-use-baby-shampoo-on-my-cat/">long-lasting effects</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some shampoos that are safe for cats include Oatmeal &amp; Aloe Shampoo, Herbal Conditioning Hair Rinse, Honeydew Melon Pet Shampoo, and more.</li>
<li>If you have a kitten or older cat with long hair then it is best to use some type of conditioner after shampooing especially if your home is dry.
Some people also leave the conditioner in their cat&rsquo;s fur after washing it to prevent tangles and matting, but this is not necessary unless your cat has long hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an alternative option for you and your pet, you can use some type of olive oil as a moisturizer.</p>
<h3 id="2-ph-differences-cats-ph-6">2. pH Differences (Cats pH 6)</h3>
<p>One can answer the question of whether one should use dog shampoo on cats by considering how pH levels are different for each animal.</p>
<p>The pH balance of an animal&rsquo;s coat is unique to its species. Dogs have a different pH level than cats, for example, and this denotes the coat&rsquo;s acidity.</p>
<p>Can you use dog shampoo on cats? No, this is not a recommended practice. Dogs have a higher pH level than cats and even humans!</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogs pH 7.5</li>
<li>cats pH 6</li>
<li>humans pH 5.5
When making shampoos it is important to take into consideration the pH levels of its various components and how the final product will affect the pet.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to animal grooming products, each type is made with different pH that is appropriate for the species.</p>
<p>If you use a shampoo labeled as dog shampoo on your cat, it might wash off his fur and cause health issues - like damaging their skin.</p>

<h3 id="3-cause-damage-to-sensitive-skin">3. Cause damage to Sensitive skin</h3>
<p>Dogs and cats have different skin needs, and it is not recommended that you use dog-specific products on your cat because it can damage their skin and fur, which will impact how they groom themselves.</p>
<p>Using dog shampoo on cats may attract parasites that are normally found on dogs and so cleaning or pest control will be much more difficult.</p>
<p>Are you considering herbal dog shampoos for bathing the cat? Please don&rsquo;t! They have natural oils such as tea-tree oil that are toxic to cats but may be safe for humans and dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Important, cats and kittens lack the enzymes required to break down these natural oils and so they can become toxic if they remain on your cat for long.
This is the case even with diluted oils as they&rsquo;ll accumulate to harmful levels that will end up blocking the cat&rsquo;s skin pores and it&rsquo;s harming its fur texture.</li>
<li>Sadly, the kitten&rsquo;s coat will also absorb these natural oils leading to skin damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-harmful-insecticides">4. Harmful Insecticides</h3>
<p>Some dog shampoos have pesticides or insecticides to deal with flea or
tick problems
. Sometimes these chemicals can hurt cats.</p>
<p>For example, ingredients meant to control fleas or flies on dogs may be harmful to your cat.</p>
<p>Permethrin is an insecticide that is often used in dog shampoo. It&rsquo;s harmful to cats, especially if the cat comes into contact with it for a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the alternative?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, use pyrethrin shampoos on your cat (but in lower quantities) as it&rsquo;ll be safer compared to the dog shampoos.
There are specific dog shampoos manufactured for the needs of dogs, and it can be tempting to use these products on cats.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, dog shampoo contains harsh chemicals that may damage a cat&rsquo;s skin or cause &ldquo;dandruff.&rdquo; If your cat has an open wound, avoid using these dog shampoos altogether.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-natural-products-to-wash-your-cat">Alternative Natural Products to Wash your Cat?</h2>
<p>Organic shampoos are usually the best choice for your pet. They use a variety of natural ingredients that will clean and condition their fur at the same time without leaving any harmful residue behind.</p>
<p>Organic shampoos also typically have less concentrated suds, which means you don&rsquo;t need to worry about them damaging sensitive skin on your cat&rsquo;s face or neckline.</p>
<p>You can find organic shampoo in most major retailers like Whole Foods Market, Costco, Trader Joe&rsquo;s, Walmart, and Target so it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to locate one near you!</p>
<ul>
<li>Harsh chemicals may strip away essential oils from their coat</li>
<li>Pets with allergies could react poorly if they come into contact with these products during bathtime</li>
<li>Added fragrances should

<li>Lemon Spray</li>
<li>Aloe vera juice</li>
<li>Cedar chips</li>
<li>Peppermint extract</li>
<li>Apple Cider Vinegar
So, to give you cat that clean wash, heal its wounds, and hydrates their skin use a cat shampoo and ensure its age-appropriate.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;ll be a plus if the cat shampoo or soap also has cat-friendly pest control ability such as exterminating fleas, flies, and ticks.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary on the question; can you use dog shampoo on cats? No, the cat-specific products will provide the best results for them during bath time.</p>
<p>You should only wash kittens with shampoos made especially for cats as well because they are more delicate and need gentler cleaning agents.</p>
<p>If you want your pet to feel clean after its bathtime session, I recommend some of these natural substitutes to wash your cat;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lemon spray (use this instead of bleach),</li>
<li>Aloe vera juice (great for dry or irritated skin)</li>
<li>Cedar chips (for waterproofing),</li>
<li>Peppermint extract(keeps fleas away).</li>
<li>Apple Cider Vinegar
I would love to hear what products other pet owners have found that they like best for their kitty!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cats love that clean life, they&rsquo;ll grom their skin regularly removing any dirt, dead skin, or loose fur. But, if you&rsquo;re to clean off piles of mud from the pet, can you use human <a href="/posts/best-puppy-shampoo-for-fleas/">shampoo</a> on cats?
<strong>Simple answer, NO, don&rsquo;t use human shampoo on cats - human shampoo&rsquo;s pH imbalance makes it aggressive and will make the pet&rsquo;s skin dry out.�</strong>
<strong>Also, human shampoo may cause painful irritation and flakiness on the cat. So, talk to the cat&rsquo;s veterinarian about mild shampoos that will be great for your cat.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Also, kittens have more delicate skin than adult cats, and thus to clean them off dirt, use shampoos formulated for kittens - avoid<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-use-dog-shampoo-on-cats/">dog Shampoo</a>too.

<h2 id="details-can-you-use-human-shampoo-on-cats">Details: Can You Use Human Shampoo on Cats?</h2>
<p>Shampoos are designed to be species-specific and thus you must not use human or dog shampoo to bathe your cats. Minimize the number of bathes - like once every 6 weeks for short-haired breeds.
But for the longer-haired cat breeds such as the Himalayans and Persians, you can bathe them more often since they tend to get dirty easily.
So, if the cat gets itself messed up such as when they knock down that food container, bathe them appropriately to avoid dirtying your laundry or seats.
For a household that has many cats, it&rsquo;s common that they&rsquo;ll take up the work of cleaning each other. An older cat will take up cat grooming - thus need that cat-specific shampoo.
If the cat-specific shampoo isn&rsquo;t available, use some gentle dish soap, as opposed to using human shampoo - also check the ingredients in the dish soap -

Further, don&rsquo;t use dog shampoo to clean your cat as it has harsh chemicals or ingredients that may harm the health of your cat or be toxic to your puppies.</p>
<h2 id="dont-use-human-shampoo-on-cats-but-why">Don&rsquo;t Use Human Shampoo on Cats! But Why?</h2>
<p>Veterinarians recommend not using human shampoos to clean your dog or cat - mainly because pets have different skin chemical compositions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The human skin, for instance, is more acidic compared to the pet&rsquo;s skin and thus they aren&rsquo;t usable interchangeably.</li>
<li>Equally, humans will sweat from various spots of their skin while pets will only sweat through the paws and thus the moisture distribution will vary.
Therefore, human shampoos will quickly dry out or burn the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s fur and skin - which may lead to long long-term health and skin problems.
Other health problems that may arise from using human shampoo include reduced immunity for the cats - which may make them susceptible to bacterial infections through the skin or open sores.</li>
<li>Therefore, I would recommend allowing the cats to undertake self-cleaning as opposed to cleaning them yourself - especially with harsh chemicals.
Further, ensure that the cleaning products your use on your cat has a pH that&rsquo;s very close to that pH in the cat&rsquo;s saliva and its ingredients are natural to avoid cat poisoning.</li>
<li>Also, remember that not all the cleaning products labeled as all-natural will be safe for your cats - despite being sage for humans and dogs.</li>
<li>Cats are known to be allergic to many all-natural ingredients and thus take care when considered such products that are not specially labeled as being cat-safe.
Check the
<a href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a>
website to know the allergic reaction that the product or ingredient it may cause on your cat or dog - this makes sure the product won&rsquo;t be toxic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="human-shampoos-arent-approved-for-cats">Human Shampoos Arent Approved for Cats</h2>
<p>On testing, human shampoos haven&rsquo;t be approved scientifically for use in cleaning cats - this is mainly because, as I&rsquo;ve noted above, cats have skin composition that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, no extensive tests have been undertaken on the reactions or side effects of human or dog shampoo products on their health.
Thus, if you&rsquo;ve used that human shampoo to clean your cats and haven&rsquo;t seen any significant side effects, then it might be that you&rsquo;ve used just minimal amounts for a limited time.</li>
<li>But vets recommend you avoid using human shampoo for bathing your cat even for that one time or few times since cats may ingest and digest the toxic shampoo ingredients.

<h2 id="what-to-do-about-toxic-effects-on-cats-related-to-using-human-shampoo">What to Do About Toxic Effects on Cats related to using Human Shampoo?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve washed your cat with human shampoo, they may already be showing some side effects from the toxic ingredients. So, what should you do?
First, remember that most shampoos aren&rsquo;t effectively and scientifically tested on cats, and thus the effects or symptoms after use could vary between brands.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, some of the signs of toxicity of the human shampoo on the cat may include discomfort, scratching loss of hair, irritation, and redness.</li>
<li>Further, if you notice the cat has diarrhea, vomiting, or lethargy, you&rsquo;ll require to contact the vet for emergency treatment of the cat.
So, if you suspect shampoo toxicity on your cat, you must talk to an expert vet. Also, take the cat to the vet for further examination of its skin outbreaks or infections.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question, can you use human shampoo on cats? Don&rsquo;t use human shampoos to clean your cats as they&rsquo;ll dry out their skin and cause irritation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats have sensitive skin compared to humans and dogs and thus you should only use cat-specific shampoo on dogs or very mild dish soap with vet-approved all-natural ingredients.</li>
<li>Vets also recommend usingdeodorizing and cleansing shampoo made from ingredients that are all-natural.
Should you use dish soap on your cat? Yes, but if used routinely, dishwashing soaps will remove the natural oils on the pet&rsquo;s skin - which will dry out or result in breakouts - unlike the
flea treatment for cats
.
So, finally, YES - both human or dog shampoo will be toxic on your cats and thus not safe.
The cat&rsquo;s skin has a different
pH balance to that of humans and dogs -
thus human shampoo will dry out the cat&rsquo;s skin. This may cause
painful irritation,
flakiness, skin drying, and aggressive behavior.</li>
