<h2 id="how-to-improve-your-lan-and-wifi-speeds">How to improve your LAN and WiFi speeds:</h2>
<p>The new router model is coming up with increased technological advancement.
Therefore, to get better WiFi signals in your residence, you might need to replace your are of model router with a newer technology one.</p>
<ul>
<li>What could be capping your internet transfer rate? Two key reasons: MoCA version and coax cabling.
Notably, you cannot get maximum transfer speeds with the coax cabling. However, upgrading all your devices to use MoCA 2.0 as opposed to MoCA 1.1 or 1.0 would increase the speed.
However, you can check the post understanding internet transfer speeds to gain a deeper understanding.

</ul>
<h3 id="1-change-the-routers-position-or-angle">1. Change the router&rsquo;s position or angle</h3>
<p>To achieve greater signal strength for your Verizon WiFi, you&rsquo;ll need to move your router to a more central location in the room or change its angle appropriately.
Further, if your house has internet cables laid out, you may move the router to the location with an internet outlet location and connect. Read Also:

<p>Verizon will use an Actiontec MI424WR router for your new installation, but this could be one of the critical problems. However, the router supports only the MoCA 1.1 and will thus limit your LAN transfer rate to 21.875 MB/s.
Therefore, to achieve better transfer rates on your LAN, you&rsquo;ll need to upgrade to a Quantum Gateway router. You might get the router for free from Verizon if you upgrade your plan, but you&rsquo;ll need to discuss this with the customer care reps. Read Also:
