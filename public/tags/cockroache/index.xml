<p>Advion Hot New Syngenta is highly effective due to its active ingredient, Indoxacarb. When roaches ingest Indoxacarb, they return to their nest and regurgitate, spreading the poison and causing a secondary kill effect.</p>
<p>By placing small dots of this gel bait on cardboard under the fridge and cabinets, you can target roach hotspots effectively. Its important to clear any food remains and debris to enhance the baits effectiveness.</p>
<p>Avoid using it alongside instant kill products, as it relies on progressive deaths to ensure the entire colony is affected. For maximum impact, combining it with boric acid can yield
comprehensive control
over roach infestations.

<ul>
<li>Quick action</li>

<li>Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach� (Only males can fly)
For Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach, its evident that just the male roaches have the capability to fly. Notably, it very easy to physically confuse the American cockroach with these Pennsylvania wood cockroaches.
The wings of the female Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach are underdeveloped and thus wont fly. However, the male Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach has poorly developed wings and will only fly for short distances.
Further, this roach species tend to be attracted to light sources, such as light bulbs, and tend to fly in that direction.
<strong>4. Smokybrown Cockroach (Males and females are flyers)�</strong>
<strong>Color</strong>
: Smoky brown
<a href="https://entomology.unl.edu/scilit/Urban%20Pest%20Profile-%20Smoky%20Brown%20Roach%20Amanda%20Newton.pdf">Cockroach</a>
has a shiny brown-blackish cover.
<strong>Wings and Length</strong>
: The adult roaches are about 1.25 inches. Smoky brown Cockroach has wings extending over its body and is known to be great flyers.
These roaches mainly jump from upper to lower spots; these pests show great stability when airborne.
They love chimneys and flat rooftops  which is how they can enter your home. Other facts on this roach are that it is nocturnal, and hence youll find it running up and down during the evening hours. Further, these cockroaches have a large body.
Further, youll most likely find these roaches in dark areas or on leaf litter in your homestead, wooded places, or areas that have high humidity. Thus they love tree holes and feed on decaying plants.
<strong>5. Madagascar Hissing Roach (Flightless)�</strong>
<strong>Color</strong>
:�Madagascar Hissing Roach is colored brown.
<strong>Wings and Length</strong>
: This is one of the largest roaches measuring about�2-3 inches.
Madagascar Hissing roaches (originating off Madagascar  the Gromphadorhina portentosa) have no wings and wont fly like other cockroaches discussed above.
But why hissing in its name? Well, this roach produces a hissing sound thats mainly helpful in scaring off any of its predictors.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="at-80-degrees-some-roaches-become-frequent-flyers"><strong>At 80 degrees, Some Roaches become frequent flyers.</strong></h2>
<p>Surprisingly, some roaches fly while trying to hide from the sweltering heat. So besides just crawling up the house drains, roaches might fly to get into your home.
The most common household roaches (the American cockroaches) do not generally fly and dont regularly use their wings.
Further, cold temperatures such as during winter and what you find
down drains and sewers
prevent them from using their flight muscles.
However, if the temperature rises to about 80 degrees and above (like with the summer weather), the American roaches will definitely become regular fliers. The hot weather also tends to increase the roaches metabolism and reproduction capacity, leading to an even higher roach population.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Different roach species have a varied�flying ability. However, roaches are not good flyers.</p>
<p>As noted above, American Cockroaches (both males and females) are good flyers.</p>
<p>However, other roach species may use their wings to glide or jump from higher to lower areas.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/best-roach-bait/">Cockroaches</a> are infamous for being one of the most resilient and pervasive pests, invading homes and often causing distress among homeowners. They are often associated with the transmission of diseases and can be a real nuisance.</p>
<p>But the question that often comes to mind is, &ldquo;Do cockroaches <a href="/posts/can-fleas-bite-through-clothes/">bite</a>?&rdquo; In this comprehensive article, we will delve into the world of cockroaches, exploring their behavior, what drives them to bite, the potential dangers, and how to treat a cockroach bite.
<strong>Cockroach Diet: Omnivores at Heart</strong>
Cockroaches are omnivorous pests, which means they have a diverse diet. They will eat just about anything that&rsquo;s edible, whether it&rsquo;s dead or alive animals, plants, or decaying matter. This dietary versatility is one of the reasons they are such persistent and adaptable pests in various environments.</p>
<h2 id="do-cockroaches-really-bite"><strong>Do Cockroaches Really Bite?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Yes, the answer is a resounding yes, cockroaches can and do bite. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that cockroaches do not bite humans as a primary source of food.�</strong>
<strong>Their natural inclination is to find food and shelter, and humans are not typically on their menu. Instead, cockroaches resort to biting in certain situations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>**Scarcity of Food:**When cockroaches cannot find their usual sources of food, such as crumbs or organic matter, they may explore alternative options, including nibbling on human skin.</li>
<li>**Feeling Threatened:**Cockroaches are primarily nocturnal creatures that prefer to remain hidden. If they feel cornered or threatened, they may<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641686/">bite as a defense mechanism</a>.</li>
<li>**Extreme Infestations:**In cases of severe infestations, cockroaches may become bolder and more desperate, increasing the likelihood of encountering humans and potentially resorting to biting.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-do-cockroach-bites-look-like"><strong>What Do Cockroach Bites Look Like?</strong></h3>
<p>Cockroach bites on humans are typically small, red, and raised welts. They may resemble mosquito bites but are usually smaller in size.</p>
<p>These welts can be itchy, but the discomfort is generally mild. It&rsquo;s important to remember that cockroach bites are not a common occurrence for most people.</p>
<h3 id="variation-in-cockroach-biting-behavior"><strong>Variation in Cockroach Biting Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>Not all cockroach species exhibit the same biting behavior. While all cockroach species have the capability to bite, some are more likely to do so than others.</p>
<p>German cockroaches, Australian cockroaches, and American cockroaches are among the species that are more prone to biting humans.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to note that the level of pain from a cockroach bite may vary from person to person. Some individuals may only feel a slight twinge or pinch, while others may experience more discomfort.

<h3 id="are-cockroach-bites-dangerous"><strong>Are Cockroach Bites Dangerous?</strong></h3>
<p>Cockroach bites, in and of themselves, are not dangerous. Unlike some other insects, cockroaches do not inject venom into their victims. Therefore, a cockroach bite typically causes irritation, swelling, and sometimes mild pain, but it does not pose a significant health risk.</p>
<h3 id="cockroach-allergies-vs-bites"><strong>Cockroach Allergies vs. Bites</strong></h3>
<p>While cockroach bites may not be particularly harmful, cockroaches can trigger allergies in some individuals.</p>
<p>These allergies are typically caused by cockroach allergens found in their saliva, feces, and shed skin. Symptoms may include sneezing, a runny nose, and itchy eyes when exposed to these allergens.</p>
<h2 id="cockroaches-and-disease-transmission"><strong>Cockroaches and Disease Transmission</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches are notorious for being potential vectors of disease. However, it&rsquo;s important to clarify that they do not transmit diseases through their bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead, cockroaches and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">baby roaches</a>can carry disease-causing pathogens on their bodies and in their excrement.
By crawling in unsanitary environments, such as drains, sewage, and garbage waste, they can pick up these pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>When they come into contact with food or surfaces that humans touch, they can transfer these pathogens, potentially causing diseases like typhoid, cholera, diarrhea, and dysentery.</p>
<h2 id="when-do-cockroaches-bite-and-where"><strong>When Do Cockroaches Bite, and Where?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches are primarily nocturnal creatures, which means they are most active at night. This is when you&rsquo;re more likely to encounter them if you have an infestation.</p>
<p>Biting usually occurs when they feel threatened or when their food sources are scarce. They may bite areas of your body with some food residue, such as hands, feet, and even dead skin.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-a-cockroach-bite"><strong>How to Treat a Cockroach Bite</strong></h2>
<p>If you suspect you&rsquo;ve been bitten by a cockroach, follow these steps for treatment:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Avoid Scratching:**It&rsquo;s crucial not to scratch the bite area to prevent additional inflammation and potential infection.</li>
<li>**Elevate the Bite Area:**Keeping the bitten area elevated can reduce swelling and irritation.</li>
<li>**Apply an Ice Pack:**Place an ice pack over the cockroach bite for about 20 minutes to soothe swelling and discomfort.</li>
<li>**Natural Remedies:**You can use natural remedies like honey, eucalyptus, coconut oil, rosemary oil, apricot oil, or lavender oil to soothe the irritation.</li>
<li>**Over-the-Counter Solutions:**Calamine cream can help reduce swelling and irritation caused by cockroach bites.</li>
<li>**Hydrocortisone, Peppermint, and Aloe Vera:**These ingredients can also be applied to the bite area to reduce irritation and swelling.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="when-do-cockroaches-bite-during-sleep"><strong>When Do Cockroaches Bite During Sleep?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches tend to bite humans when they are sleeping, mainly because most of your defenses are down at this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>If their food sources are limited or if the cockroach population in an area has grown too large, they may resort to biting.
This is particularly common aboard ships, where cockroach populations can multiply rapidly, and their food sources become limited.</li>
</ul>

.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In conclusion, cockroaches can indeed bite, but it&rsquo;s not something that should cause excessive concern for most people. Cockroach bites are usually mild, causing irritation and swelling, but they are not inherently dangerous.</p>
<ul>
<li>The primary focus should be on preventing cockroach infestations in your home, as cockroaches are more likely to bite when their food sources are scarce.</li>
<li>Maintaining a clean environment, sealing entry points, and using effective pest control methods can help keep these pests at bay.
Remember that cockroaches are more likely to transmit diseases through contamination rather than their bites, making proper hygiene and pest control crucial in keeping your home safe and pest-free.</li>

<p>Natural/biological pest control remedies like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-eats-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/)/">Bed Bug Predators</a>
have now become popular. So, do roaches <a href="/posts/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">eat</a> bed bugs?
**Simple answer, YES  Cockroaches are known predators of bed bugs, which wreak havoc in millions of homes. However, only some species of cockroaches eat bed bugs. **
<strong>Particularly the American and the German cockroaches are very fond of feasting on bed bugs. Others cockroaches that eat bed bugs include the oriental and the brown-banded cockroaches.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-cockroaches-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>Details: Do Cockroaches Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>It is very uncomfortable to have bed bugs inhabit your home. They hide in furniture, pillows, clothing and luggage near their human host. Bed bug bites cause unbearable irritations and allergic reactions to human bodies.</p>
<p>However, cockroaches can save you from these bites by feasting on these nocturnal insects. Both insects emerge at night after you switch off the lights. In their four hours of actively scavenging for food, cockroaches will feast on bed bugs before they even get a chance to feast on human blood.</p>
<p>To roaches, bed bugs seem like a nice snack. You might wonder how roaches are able to locate bed bugs. They have acute sensory and survival instincts that enable them to easily locate and feed on bed bugs.</p>

<h2 id="which-cockroach-species-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>Which Cockroach Species Eat Bed Bugs?�</strong></h2>
<p>Several species of cockroaches are very fond of eating bed bugs. The most common bed bug-eating cockroaches include the German and the American cockroaches. Others in the list are the oriental and the brown-banded cockroach.</p>
<h3 id="1-american-cockroach-waterbug"><strong>1. American cockroach (waterbug)</strong></h3>
<p>Its the largest household roach in America. They are fond of fermenting material, but will feed on almost any kind food. When indoors, they feed on crumbs that scatter on the floor, under appliances, behind kitchen cabinets and insects such as bed bugs.</p>
<p>Their typical outdoor diet may include, small insects, decaying leaves, fungi, algae, etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-german-cockroach"><strong>2. German cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>German roaches are almost the size as American ones. They will eat anything that has nutritional value including other pests like bed bugs. They easily find their way into new houses by getting a ride in cartons, bags and second-hand appliances
<strong>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="do-cockroaches-hunt-bed-bugs"><strong>Do Cockroaches Hunt Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Just like bed bugs, cockroaches come out to search for food during the night. So, theyre likely to hunt and feed on bed bugs as they search for something to eat. The two insects have adapted to feed at night as a way of avoiding predators and enemies like us.</p>
<p>At night, when everyone is asleep, therere fewer disturbances and these insect know its their time to eat. If they were to feed during the day, you would of course be their greatest threat. But, at night, these creatures will feed uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Cockroaches will harbour in your mattress and furniture, making them very close to the bed bugs that are waiting for you to sleep in order to feed on your blood. Usually, cockroaches will hunt on these bed bugs as they emerge from their hideouts.</p>
<p>Since they will have to cross walls from their hideouts to get to their human host, they became easy targets from the active cockroaches.</p>
<h2 id="are-cockroaches-a-sign-of-bed-bugs">Are Cockroaches a Sign of Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Once cockroaches get into your house, they will stick there as long as there is something for them to eat or until you exterminate them. You probably know that roaches can eat anything that they come across. They scavenge for anything from food to things like paper, wood and glue.</p>
<p>If theres nothing for them to eat, including bed bugs, roaches will quickly leave your house and go hunting for food. That means, if roaches have nothing else to eat and you have bed bugs, it possible that they will stick around.</p>
<p>However, you cant have a scenario where cockroaches have nothing to eat at all. And since they dont depend on bed bugs as their main diet, roaches will stick in your house whether you have bed bugs or not.</p>
<h2 id="cockroaches-vs-bed-bugs--which-is-easier-to-control"><strong>Cockroaches Vs. Bed Bugs  Which is easier to Control?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches are simpler to kill because of their tendency to eat any food or even non-food substances. So, if you lay poison baits or traps having food, it is possible to kill cockroaches. A good example of a cockroach trap is bait traps with glucose. Since they love to eat sweet things, glucose will easily lure them into your poison baits or traps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bed bugs only feed on blood from warm blooded animals. So you wont expect them to be lured into baits and traps meant for cockroaches. However there are traps and lures for bed bugs.</p>
<p>One of the best method to kill roaches and bed bugs, is to use heat treatment.</p>
<p>In heat treatment, your house is heated to temperatures above 120C, so that no bed bug or cockroach can survive. The bugs are exterminated quicker with increase in temperatures. It requires professional equipment and expertise to heat the room to the required temperatures.</p>
<p>Not only will you effectively kill bed bugs and cockroaches. If other pests including ants, flies and termites reside in your house, they will also die during the heat treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the available pesticides can be used against roaches and bed bugs. A good example is permethrin.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-roaches-to-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Disadvantages of Roaches To Kill Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>While cockroaches can help you kill bed bugs in your home, they could escalate into a real problem. These creatures are known to be survivalist and can multiply rapidly in a very short period. Dont be tempted to depend on them to kill bed bugs in your house. Just like bed bugs, roaches are equally difficult to rid of.</p>
<p>Roaches are also associated with a lot of contamination in our houses. They are known to pass on germs that may cause diseases such as gastro-enteritis and dysentery in humans. Other diseases that may be transmitted through these creatures include, salmonella and stomach related illnesses.</p>
<p>These diseases become possible when roaches leave their pathogenic infected faeces or secretions on surfaces and food substances.</p>
<p>Cockroaches also cause asthmatic reactions among children and the elderly during their regular molting.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do cockroaches eat bed bugs? NO. The fact that cockroaches eat bed bugs does not make them a reliable pest control method. You have noticed that bed bugs dont constitute the main diet for cockroaches.</p>
<p>Cockroaches feed on almost anything they come across. That means, they dont go hunting for bed bugs wherever they are.�Obviously, you cant resolve to have enough cockroaches to feed on the bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>You would end up with a hoard of roaches, hence creating another problem. Furthermore, bed bugs reproduce very rapidly and will replenish their population in a matter of time.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, these natural predators will never make a difference to your bed bug infestation. The best solution is to adopt some of the well-known methods like pesticides, bait traps or the DIY bed bug controls.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-eliminate-food-water--hiding-places">Step 1: Eliminate Food, Water, &amp; Hiding Places</h3>
<p>For cockroaches, such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/">German Roaches</a>
, to survive, they must have a consistent supply of food and water. Therefore, the key to getting rid of them is cutting off any food and water source in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by cleaning food crumbs, washing dishes before retiring to bed, putting food away after meals, and cleaning up spills. Also, avoid leaving uncovered food for extended periods and keep all food containers sealed.</li>
<li>Cockroaches love hiding in the fridge and munching on food crumbs back there. Clean the refrigerator as well, and always keep it locked. While at it, dont forget to wipe the range tops as cockroaches are attracted to grease as well.</li>
<li>Take out the trash regularly while ensuring the garbage bins are well sealed.</li>
<li>Any water leaks must also be fixed. Cockroaches can live for a month without food but no more than one week without water.
Roaches also prefer dark and damp where they hide and breed. These include under the sink, behind refrigerators, underfloor drains, in cracks/crevices, inside significant appliances, and others.
Target these areas when doing a thorough cockroach clean up. Also, seal cracks and crevices on the walls with caulk. All openings around the pipes in the kitchen and bathroom must also be filled. This will prevent the
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/faq/roach.html">roaches from entering your home</a>
.

<h3 id="step-2-use-roach-baits-roach-sprays--igrs">Step 2: Use Roach Baits, Roach Sprays, &amp; IGRs</h3>
<p>The triple-action of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-bait/">cockroach baits</a>
, sprays, and Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) will kill and prevent cockroaches from reproducing.
As the name suggests, cockroach baits help draw these pests out of
their hiding places
. The baits contain a high-consumption bait matrix with killer ingredients like fipronil and hydramethylnon.
Upon consuming the bait, the ingredients disrupt their nervous system, leading to their ultimate death in a matter of minutes. You may also consider
top roach bombs
.
Pesticide sprays contain active ingredients like Pyrethrin, which produce a knockdown effect on bugs like cockroaches - killing roaches even back in the
roach nest
. Basically, the sprays interfere with the bugs nervous system, which results in major paralysis and speedy death.
How to Use Baits, Sprays, and IGRs for Cockroaches</p>
<ul>
<li>If using the combination, spray a small amount in targeted areas like cracks, crevices, behind and beneath the sinks, behind and under refrigerators aroundpipes and drains, etc.</li>
<li>Ensure the spray penetrates well to ensure the pests are quickly eliminated
IGRs, on the other hand, cause sterility in adult roaches, making reproduction impossible.�When used together, the three treatment methods can quickly eliminate any roaches lurking in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-dust-with-boric-acid-powder">Step 3: Dust with Boric Acid Powder</h3>
<p>Boric acid
is one of the best natural remedies for eliminating roaches. When ingested,
boric acid
kills cockroaches in just a matter of minutes.�Although highly toxic in cockroaches, boric acid is completely
safe for humans and pets
.
The powder is best applied in areas where cockroaches are likely to walk through. Upon contact, the powder sticks on the cockroach and is absorbed into its body. Once inside, the acid destroys its digestive and nervous system, causing death.
The cockroach may also die from ingesting the powder.�Boric acid is a suitable natural
cockroach treatment if pesticide sprays
and baits are not an option.
How to Use Boric Acid for Cockroaches</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean all targeted areas, including cabinets, countertops, sinks, drawers, behind and under the refrigerator, and others</li>
<li>Lightly dust boric acid powder all over these areas. If dealing with a severe infestation, a heavy application may be necessary</li>
<li>Vacuum the remaining powder in the morning</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-thoroughly-clean-house-vacuuming">Step 4: Thoroughly clean house/ Vacuuming</h3>
<p>Its not unlikely to find a few roaches in a clean home. As long as there are cracks on the walls and perfect hiding places, youll still deal with a few of them crawling around
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-cockroaches-fly/">since roaches don&rsquo;t fly</a>
.
However, a clean home is more unlikely to experience a severe
roach infestation
than a dirty and cluttered home.
Even with countless treatments, roaches will still infest your cluttered home.�Regularly vacuuming and decluttering your
home is key to keeping these bugs
at bay.
How to Get rid of Cockroaches Through Vacuuming/Cleaning</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly vacuum and clean the floor, kitchen countertops, drawers, cabinets, insider appliances, behind and under the refrigerator, ovens, and other areas.</li>
<li>Declutter your kitchen, sitting area, laundry room, closets, cupboards, drawers, and any other potential hiding place.</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_cockroach">German cockroach</a>
(Blatella germanica (L.)) is a widely distributed pest mostly found in homes, the best roach killer for apartments, and the roach bomb hotels, restaurants, and other institutions.
If your home is infested with German cockroaches, you may see them running away immediately, you turn on lights or open the cabinet door. And since these cockroaches are known to spread germs that cause allergic reactions, its vital to eliminate them as fast as possible.

<h3 id="step-1-keep-your-bathroom-and-kitchen-clean-and-dry-at-all-times">Step 1: Keep your bathroom and kitchen clean and dry at all times</h3>
<dl>
<dt>We have discovered that German roaches thrive best where there are favorable conditions like good humidity, food, shelter, and water.</dt>
<dt>Unfortunately, your house offers all these favorable conditions.</dt>
<dt>To get rid of the German roaches in your house, keep all kitchen and bathroom surfaces and sinks clean and dry. Wash all your cabinets and appliances regularly. You should also pay close attention to your backyard by removing all unused items or woodpiles.</dt>
<dt>You can also install a dehumidifier in your home. �When your house is less humid, the German cockroaches will find it less attractive to settle in it.</dt>
<dt>Also, ensure you store food in airtight containers. Also, throw away your garbage regularly. Set aside time to do general cleaning in your house; you may mop, sweep, or vacuum regularly.</dt>
<dt><strong>Remember To</strong></dt>
<dd>(1)
Dry up all surfaces (1)
Keep the roaches hungry-put foods in tight containers and eliminate leftovers (1)
Do not offer them any shelter- seal all cracks and small holes in your house.
Besides cleaning, you can also seal all cracks and small holes in your home to block all pathways the bugs might be using to access your home.
If these measures are followed correctly, your house will be roach free. However, if the German cockroaches still find their way into your house, then its time to take more drastic measures to eliminate these annoying creatures!!
<strong>What are German cockroaches?�</strong>
The German cockroach has a unique ability of high reproduction compared to other cockroach species. The female German
cockroaches produce many eggs
per capsule; thus, they undergo a short time from hatching to sexual maturity, leading to quick population growth.
If not stopped in time, they can be difficult to control. These roaches are pretty smaller than other roaches species and can easily hide in numerous places inaccessible by humans. You can easily recognize this roach species as they are small in size (roughly  an inch) and contain two dark stripes on their back.
Like most cockroaches, German roaches prefer to settle in warm and dark places. Unfortunately, your home offers these favorable conditions, and they can easily create their habitat in your house. The availability
of food, water, and harborage increases the German roach&rsquo;s ability to develop populations and reduce growth quickly.
This disgusting creature loves to settle in an environment that is moist, warm, and dark. Hence, they are mostly found in bathrooms and kitchens where water and food leftovers are readily available. German roaches are scavengers that consume sweet foods, meat, grease, and garbage.
To eradicate these tiny creatures from your home, you should always keep kitchen surfaces clean,
use�drain cleaners
to keep all drainage and pipes clean, and repair leaking pipes. You can also fix all cracks and small holes where they are likely to hide.</dd>

is a natural and effective home remedy to kill German roaches. Sugar acts as an important bait for a German cockroach as it likes sweet products. On�the other hand, the baking soda acts as a poison that destroys the roaches digestive system.
Baking soda
works by creating huge amounts of gas, causing the stomach of roaches to burst, hence die instantly.
When using this mixture, ensure the cockroaches have access to little water. Water reacts with baking soda to give a bad solution that acts on
roaches to kill
them completely.

<li>Mix equal amounts of sugar and baking soda in the shallow dish</li>
<li>Place another small dish container of water in a suitable location</li>
<li>Sprinkle the mixture containing sugar and baking soda in various locations infested with the roaches</li>
<li>Ensure you refill the water and sprinkle more mixture from time to time to kill all the roaches completely</li>
<li>Be patient and watch the roaches
When using sugar and baking soda bait, youll need to be patient as the process might take a lot of time before achieving the desired results. This mixture may not

In this article, I outline How to Get Rid of Cockroaches in Apartments. If roaches find shelter, food, and water in your apartment, they are staying for as long as they want to!
<strong>First, notify the property manager about any roach activity on their property so that they can take action against this pest infestation. Next up, try using some baits (roach traps), dusting with silica powder or diatomaceous earth (DE) as well as a boric acid solution for long-term control measures.�</strong>
<strong>You may also want to set some glue traps around your apartment if you&rsquo;re not too keen on using toxic chemicals. Finally, if you want to get the roaches out for good (and your landlord doesn&rsquo;t have any better ideas), hire an exterminator!�</strong>

<h3 id="1-notify-the-property-manager-or-landlord-know-your-rights">1. Notify the property manager or landlord; Know Your Rights</h3>
<p>To control them, first, notify the property manager (or the landlord).�The property manager or landlord will handle the roach infestations as outlined by their lease agreement or offer some quick tips on how to deal with these bugs themselves (for example, sealing up cracks around doors).
It&rsquo;s important to know your rights as a tenant in regards to pest control.
Some leases may require the landlord or property manager to provide roach extermination services, while others just offer some tips on how you can manage them yourself (or not!). Read your lease agreement carefully!
For example, if you pay monthly fees to cater to pest control - the property manager may owe you some roach control rounds for that month.</p>

<li>their breeding and hiding location; and eliminate it. The inspections for these nocturnal bugs must be undertaken at night.
Try to identify if you have a high infestation in one area or if there are scattered sightings throughout your apartment; different strategies need to be used for each scenario.
An Integrated Pest Management approach would work better for a low-level infestation while complete elimination may require hiring exterminators with stronger chemicals like Cypermethrin.
Dispose of any exposed food or water sources, including anything that is spilling out of your garbage can (in particular those moist foods) - as they will also be attracting more roaches.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kXfEmupXc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kXfEmupXc</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-clean-up-the-apartment">3. Clean Up the Apartment</h3>
<p>The most important thing is getting rid of the food sources roaches are looking for in your apartment: crumbs on counters, pet food bowls, spoiled produce (especially potatoes), dirty dishes left overnight&hellip;anything that might attract roaches!
Dispose of garbage properly-use more than one bag if necessary because roach infestations usually start from trash cans outside that have been improperly disposed of away
Remove clutter and provide a clear path for these pests as they roam around seeking out food or hiding places (for example, keep dishes on top of shelves).
Make sure all surfaces are clean - including floors, walls, window sills, countertops/sinks&hellip;everything! Not only will this help with any infestations but it also
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">helps prevent ant</a>
s and other insects from coming inside.
Roach droppings can carry diseases like E-coli so be careful not to stir up dust bunnies while cleaning too close to where people eat when mopping up spills.
Clean up behind the cabinets, dishwasher, fridge - these would make great hiding places for cockroaches.
Keep your counters and sinks clean - this also helps prevent ants from making their way inside.
Don&rsquo;t leave dishes in the sink to collect dust or harbor bacteria, rinse them off as soon as possible after each use.
Clear away clutter (think pantry shelves) that could be hiding cockroaches or other pests like spiders! Cockroaches are opportunistic so they will take any opportunity to come inside if there are food sources available for them.</p>
<h3 id="4-seal-all-holes-and-cracks-in-plumbing-windows-and-doors">4. Seal all Holes and Cracks in Plumbing, Windows, and doors</h3>
<p>Roaches can get into small spaces, so sealing up as many of these areas as possible will help. You should also look for other potential openings or cracks in your home&rsquo;s foundation.
Covering any gaps with steel wool is a good temporary solution to keep them out while you seal the area permanently.
Use a caulk gun to fill cracks and holes where cockroaches could enter. Make sure you are sealing all sources of entry, including plumbing or electrical outlets - roaches will make their way inside if they smell food!
Inspect your home for any drafts that might be coming from the window sealings or door frames. Tighten up these areas using weather strips, caulking, or foam insulation to keep the roaches insects out.
Look around windows as well for signs of insect pests such as small piles of sawdust near them which may indicate an ant infestation right outside the wall in between things like wood siding and brick homes.
Seal openings in the plumbing system (particularly under the sink) - as the roaches will be attracted by water and food droppings.</p>
<h3 id="5-use-baits-sprays-and-treatments">5. Use baits, sprays, and treatments</h3>
<p>Consider a pre-emptive bait that will create an environment lethal for roaches - one well-known in particular is Combat Roach Killing Bait Gel which can be purchased at most hardware stores.
The process usually starts by placing bait stations such as apple cider vinegar &amp; soap in areas that roaches frequent (though these can also attract other pests like ants).
In a few days, they will come back with either poison bait or glue traps for capturing them alive so they may not pose any future problems if released into the wild. This is important because some poisons used in extermination could lead to secondary poisoning among pets who eat poisoned bugs.
Keep it out of reach of children as, if handled improperly, this could lead to poisoning or even death!
Sprays and other treatments will also work to kill roaches but are not always as effective. Some effective roach sprays include the Bengal Gold and the Ortho Home defense.
The insecticide sprays mainly contain Permethrin�or pyrethroids (comparable to botanical�insecticides�- pyrethrins). Sprays will also kill other insects, so be careful with where you are spraying.</p>
<h3 id="6-sprinkle-diatomaceous-earth">6. Sprinkle Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Some people have noticed success by using
Diatomaceous Earth (food grade)
sprinkled around their house but this treatment can take months for visible results. This should also only be used when pets are excluded from the spaces.
Diatomaceous earth�powder will create that abrasive effect which will break the roaches&rsquo; exoskeleton and exoskeleton.
Sprinkle the DE in areas where roaches are present, including all cracks and crevices around cabinets, behind refrigerators (baseboards if possible), along walls underneath appliances, especially under sinks.
Consider pouring it into any holes or gaps found on your countertops so that they can not crawl back out again. You should also sprinkle some inside of drawers for those places hidden from sight.</p>
<h3 id="7-cockroach-traps---boric-acid-or-dish-soap">7. Cockroach Traps - Boric acid or Dish soap</h3>
<p>For an extra effect set a trap with either boric acid or dish soap mixed with apple cider vinegar as bait by placing them at strategic points like corners and near drains.&quot;
You can make the DIY roach killer - from boric acid ( Cup)�&amp; peanut butter ( Cup).
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">Boric acid powder</a>
, if ingested, will exterminate the roaches while the peanut butter acts as an attractant.</p>
<h3 id="8-roach-treat-the-perimeter-walls-and-environment">8. Roach Treat the Perimeter Walls and Environment</h3>
<p>If you have already been successful with getting rid of them from inside the house but are still seeing signs outside (like small piles of sawdust), then you may need to take care of some around the perimeter.
This might involve using insecticides like cypermethrin on trees or shrubbery near. You may apply some insecticide dust on the exterior walls, inside the wall void, electrical outlets, and the light switch plates.</p>
<h3 id="9-hire-a-roach-exterminator">9. Hire A Roach Exterminator</h3>
<p>If you have tried everything else and are still seeing signs of cockroaches, it might be time to hire an exterminator that uses bait stations and commercial grade insecticides with pyrethrins or cypermethrin like Tempo Ultra Max Insecticide Spray Concentrate.
The pest control company will inspect your home for any areas where there is activity -including inside walls- before beginning treatment in those locations.
They typically spray along baseboards, cracks in corners (especially near doors), door jams, window frames.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on how to get rid of cockroaches in apartments - If you are a tenant in an apartment, be sure to notify the property manager immediately when roaches are spotted.
Use baits like boric acid or traps including apple cider vinegar mixed with soap and placed near drains. Also, conduct a thorough cleaning of the apartment.
Consider using diatomaceous earth as dusting under your appliances and along walls for more protection against them. Finally, if all won&rsquo;t work, hire that roach exterminator.</p>

<h2 id="what-animals-eat-cockroaches-roach-predators">What Animals <a href="/posts/do-cockroaches-eat-bed-bugs/">Eat</a> Cockroaches? Roach Predators?</h2>
<p>But how are roach eaters helpful? These bugs will trim down the roach population. They&rsquo;ll invade them in their ecosystem or natural habitat including
bugs in your backyard
.</p>
<h3 id="1-birds--the-avians">1. Birds / the Avians</h3>
<p>Despite that birds won&rsquo;t naturally feed on cockroaches, mainly because the roach adults, nymphs, and indoors will be hiding in moist, warm, and dark areas.
You&rsquo;ll get the roaches around the kitchen, bathroom, and attic - and hence they could be hiding from predatory birds. But birds will still pick them from around sewers - consult aviculturists.
But ensure to use expert bird keepers for your aviary birds to reduce chances of contamination or poisoning. Avoid using insecticides for roaches around feed mills and chicken farms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, to feed the roaches to the bird, ensure to fatten the bugs using roughage and vitamin C - including nutritious fruits and food.</li>
<li>Birds that will feed on roaches include Starlings (some species), Rail (Slaty-breasted Rail), Pheasants, Peafowl, Parrots (some species), Owls (Scops Owl), and Orioles.</li>
<li>Other birds include Mynas (many species), Makholas, Laughingthrushes, Junglefowl, Jays, Coucals, Babblers, Collared Kingfisher, and Oriental Magpie-Robin.

</ul>
<h2 id="2-dogs-and-cats">2. Dogs and Cats</h2>
<p>Normally, it is not okay to feed roaches to your cats and dogs. But roaches with poisonous insecticides (high dosage or through eating many roaches) are toxic to the pets.
Thus, keep cockroach
poisons and toxins off your spaces if you intend to feed roaches to your domesticated pets - dogs and cats or other household pets.
But indoor pets such as dogs and cats will also hunt to prey on different insects including roaches. But feral cats will equally roam the streets hunting birds, rats, and mice plus cockroaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats will achieve great satisfaction while hunting for roaches - but this may be disrupted by issues such as ingesting pesticides or digestive issues.
But why will dogs and cats hunt for roaches? Well, dogs and cats (including domesticated ones) will exercise their hunting impulses and the bug&rsquo;s hard-shelled texture ensure it&rsquo;s easy to capture.
Dogs and cats may also feed on roaches as a diet to help recover from diseases such as PICA or anemia. PICA could lead them to eat non-food objects due to psychological compulsion or boredom.</li>
<li>But the cats will<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/">snack on the roaches</a>- but may get choked or hurt in their throat due to the bug&rsquo;s exoskeletons that is hard - if not adequately chewed.
Despite that dogs and cats will actively hunt plus eat roaches, it&rsquo;s advisable to keep this away to reduce chances of digestive hazard or choking.
Will cockroaches be drawn to litter? Yes, roaches may get drawn to the litter depending on the litter box in question (like corn, beets, or wheat) - so they might not get new silica-based, sand, or clay litters.</li>
<li>On rodents including rats and mice, you may use monitoring traps (the sticky type) and this reduces the chances of entangling - leaving antennae, legs, and head.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3beetles">3.�Beetles</h3>
<p>Silverfish and beetles (and beetle larvae) are among the best roach predators - they&rsquo;ll hunt for the bugs and feed on them - plus controlling pests like the
<a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/7250.html">Hemlock-Woolly Adelgid</a>
.
But it&rsquo;s not advised to drop
<a href="https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/insects/predatory-beetles">predatory beetles</a>
into the house - these are the bugs that will feed on roaches; checkered beetles, lady beetles, rove beetles, and soldier beetles,�ground beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood-boring beetles (and their Larvae) will equally cause some amount of damage on your structures with carpet and wood, inside sheds and houses.</li>
<li>Beetles have mandibles that&rsquo;ll chew dead organisms, your cloth, carpet, and leather. They may damage things in the property including light-colored petals and plant-based fibers.
So, to control both the roaches and beetles, ensure to maintain clean surfaces - including water and food. Also, keep all the garbage airtight and locked.
Seal up all the cracks (on door frames) and openings that roaches and other insects may use to enter the house. Use natural repellents such as garlic, cucumber slices, and bay leaves for roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-opossums">4. Opossums</h3>
<p>Yes, Opossums are
<a href="https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/wildlife/the-virginia-opossum-our-only-native-marsupial/">extreme omnivores</a>
that will hunt and feed on roaches largely found in North America - they&rsquo;ll also eat garbage, worms, and roadkill.
They&rsquo;ll bear
<a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/marsupial/marsupial.html">semi-</a>
<a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/marsupial/marsupial.html">developed and small young ones</a>
that they&rsquo;ll hide in their belly pouches until when ready to move. The
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/group/opossums/">average-weighted Opossums (weighing 8-13 lbs</a>
) may also transmit rabies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, yes opossums can be beneficial organisms despite being catatonic-like and creepy animals - and are greatnature&rsquo;s exterminators.
Opossums will equally feed on frogs, insects, snails, slugs,
moles
, spiders, rats, and mice. They&rsquo;ll feast on those bothersome critters roaming your yard.
Further, Opossums love eating weeds (
check these weed killers
) and dead plants in your garden. These include the decaying or wilting plant matter as opposed to the fresh crops.</li>
<li>The opossum will equally feed on carrion (<em>dead creatures</em>) including decaying creatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-lizards">5. Lizards</h3>
<p>Lizards (including leopard geckos,
monitor�lizards
, and
bearded dragons
) will feed on roaches to acquire additional nutrition. Also, check with iguanas and geckos to control roaches.
Geckos and lizards will inhabit warmer areas (being cold-blooded animals) and some humans may pet them - but will also feast on cockroaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Geckos will maul on the roaches in the house but if the bugs are many I suggest chartering a professional as opposed to bringing more geckos.
Lizards (including iguanas or geckos ) will feed on insects including cockroaches.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRJboAboJfo&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRJboAboJfo&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
Other roach predators:</li>
<li>Some roach predators such as lizards, frogs, and toads will reach the bugs using their�sticky and long tongues - and ultimately crushing the roaches using the strong jaws.</li>
<li>Wasps also lay eggs that hatch into larvae that&rsquo;ll eat the roaches while also the spores of the entomopathogenic fungi will attack cockroaches to exterminate them within weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6frogs">6.�Frogs</h3>
<p>Frogs such as the popular
<a href="https://animaldiversity.org/site/accounts/information/Pseudacris_crucifer.html">Spring Peeper</a>
and
<a href="http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Lithobates_pipiens/">Northern-Leopard Frog</a>
will eat roaches - you&rsquo;ll find them in wet environments, lakes, and ponds.
Other frog species like the
<a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/whites-tree-frog">White&rsquo;s tree</a>
(found in New Guinea and Australia) will feed on roaches. They measure about 3 to 5 inches living in woodland or grassy areas - they&rsquo;re nocturnal.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXLafCdhw8&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXLafCdhw8&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
The dull-brown frogs will easily camouflage in the house and yard spaces and thus easily capture the roaches, small bugs, and also beetles for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the daytime, the Spring Peeper will hide from spiders, roaches (nocturnal bugs), flies, ants, and beetles but will capture them at night.
Further, toads (they&rsquo;re gray or dull brown) will slay roaches in the apartments and will mainly occupy backyards and places with shelter or water. But also red imported fire ants will eat roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-spiders">7. Spiders</h3>
<p>Spiders will eat cloth moths, mosquitoes, and roaches among other indoor pests. But you&rsquo;re required many spiders to effectively control a massive roach infestation.
But some homeowners will rear domesticated spiders and these
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-spiders-eat-cockroaches">take cockroaches</a>
for their food. Spider species including
<a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/spiders/giant_crab_spider.htm">Brown Huntsmans</a>
will also feed on roaches.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LiALjybcJA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LiALjybcJA</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Eating the adult roaches plus their larvae, the natural predators will ensure the bug population is checked. For instance, spiders and
some ants will prey
on bug roaches.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Waking up at the midnight hour for nature&rsquo;s call or a midnight craving and finding a big roach challenging your way with even bigger tentacles, could send chills down the spine!</p>
<p>Is this your every night story? Did you know that having roaches at home could pose a serious threat to your health? You need to get rid of them in no time. But! Why Do Cockroaches <a href="/posts/where-do-fleas-come-from/">Come</a> Out At Night?</p>
<p>If you are a bug hater and wonder why these night creepers are always awake to make you feel jelly in the knees, this article is where you fit right in.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-behind-the-night-creepers">The Story Behind the Night Creepers:</h2>
<p>While there is a wide variety of roaches, the majority of them are nocturnal. Science says that cockroaches have a circadian rhythm like all living creatures (organisms) on earth.</p>
<p>This rhythm is a sleep-wake cycle that keeps alternating between pause/activity periods of these nasty bugs and governing their conduct of different organisms.</p>
<p>In short, this rhythm is solely responsible for the night activity cycle of these insects.�In this activity cycle, cockroaches hunt for food and water in a low light environment and stay mostly inactive during the day.</p>
<p>Their immobility during the daylight hour is either to stay safe from predators or nature&rsquo;s extremities.</p>
<p>This means when the bedtime is approaching and the light goes off, a big welcome sign flag to your enemies.</p>
<p>And now they will cascade in bulk from under the kitchen shelves, store room cabinets, washroom holes, and the smallest crack and the crevices.�Stay SAFE!</p>
<h2 id="do-roaches-sleep-during-the-day">Do Roaches Sleep During the Day?</h2>
<p>Plenty of research has been conducted on the activity cycle of roaches and a few of them to find out whether they sleep during the day or not! And each one points to the aforementioned circadian rhythm responsible for a sustained bout of inactivity in these bugs.</p>
<p>In other words, studies indicate that cockroaches too have a resting session like other creatures on this planet.</p>
<p>Here, Professor Irene Tobler-Borbely best sums up the activity of the roaches inthree clear stages: locomotion, limb or antenna movement (no locomotion), and a period of immobility. And this period of hiatus is the same a human&rsquo;s &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; period.</p>
<p>So, if you are not finding traces of these little monsters during the daylight, probably they are taking a siesta&hellip; * LOL! *</p>
<h2 id="why-do-cockroaches-hate-light">Why Do Cockroaches Hate Light?</h2>
<p>A few studies indicate that cockroaches have a zero aversion to light. But, why do these annoying species run away from the lights then?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably because these tiny, wild beasts have evolved through all these years only to learn that flickering light is an indication of the arrival of their human predators!</p>
<p>A number of encounters have possibly taught them that human intervention means a mass killing. And so, whenever there is the light, they seem to scurry for their hideouts. Simple as that!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, a former body of research also emphasized the impact of artificial illumination on the roaches. It suggests that the artificial lighting, even with the lowest intensity could tamper with the circadian rhythms of these insects and obstructs their activity at night.</p>
<p>So, even a dim light in the kitchen area could reduce their appearance. Mind it!</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-they-scout-for-at-the-nights">So What Do They Scout For At the Nights?</h2>
<p>So, coming back to the question again, &ldquo;Why Do Cockroaches Come Out At Night&rdquo;, you should possibly look for an answer inside your house, more precisely the kitchen and the pantry.</p>
<p>Roaches are always out on forage for food and water during the darkest hours when you are crawling into the comfort of your bed.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-large-number-of-these-bugs-at-home">Have a large number of these bugs at home?</h2>
<p>You will surely discover hundreds of thousands of them wobbling and running for shelter when you suddenly turn on the lights after 4 hours of darkness interval.</p>
<p>And the reason is nothing but the leftover in the cooking and the dining space.�After the sundown, cockroaches are prone to emerge in a big group and hunt for foods.</p>
<p>In fact, roaches can feed on virtually anything, including the tiniest food scraps that you might have left uncleaned from the last supper.</p>
<p>It can be anything from the organic materials, soiled clothes, bookbinding to trash bin rubbishes, crumbs on the floor, sludges between the gas burner or pet bowl remains, no matter, fresh or rotten!</p>
<p>The best way to keep cockroaches at the bay is keeping these areas forever clean and free of every single residue.</p>
<p>Once you do that, you will soon find these roaches scavenging during the day.</p>
<p>And that means you have already managed a critical infestation of these seedy bugs and they are threatened with the scarcity of food. This is why they are forced to hunt foods when are they are not supposed to.</p>
