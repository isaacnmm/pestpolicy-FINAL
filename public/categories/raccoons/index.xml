      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for the best <a href="/posts/best-raccoon-traps/">raccoon</a> bait? Raccoons can leave costly damages behind them. They can also spread diseases such as rabies.</p>
<p>If theres a wild animal that will courageously venture into your property, then it is a raccoon. Their masked faces and piercing stare is terrifying to some people.
Others, however, find them adorable. Until they start knocking over garbage all over the backyard, stealing your fruits and vegetables, and nibbling on wooden fixtures. Related:

<h2 id="reviews-top-7-best-raccoon-bait-for-2025">Reviews: Top 7 Best Raccoon Bait for 2025</h2>
<h3 id="1-coon-gitter-dog-proof-bait-for-dp---1-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J81MQOY/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Coon Gitter Dog-proof Bait for Dp - #1 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Raccoons are easy to trap as they are not picky eaters and will be attracted to any bait that looks or smells good. Here are some of the best raccoon baits you can use around your home.</p>
<p>There are also raccoon bait products that you can buy from a local store or online. Here are two products that make for the best raccoon baits.
Raccoons have a sweet tooth. The Treeberry Paste Bait has a mixture of sweet-smelling tree-ripened fruits that will attract the raccoon into the trap.
You can smear it inside the trap or use it on the other edible baits such as marshmallows. While the paste has no harmful effects, you should still keep it out of the reach of children.
It can, however, attract other types of animals too.
Tin foil -
Raccoons are very curious animals. Shiny materials spark their curiosity.
You can hang a piece of tin foil inside the trap as bait. Use a string to tie the piece of foil to the top of the trap such that it dangles inside the trap.
This will lure them into the trap when their nocturnal eyes spot something shiny in the dark. It is important to use clean foils as a smelly one could attract other animals.</p>
<h3 id="2-ringtail-cocktail-bait---2-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A6TOYAC/?tag=p-policy-20">2. Ringtail Cocktail Bait - #2 Pick</a></h3>
<p>The Ringtail Cocktail bait is made from smoked salmon fish. While it works great for trapping raccoons, it might also lure your dog and other animals that like fish.</p>
<p>It is advisable to use traps that dont cause any physical harm to animals so that you dont end up hurting your dog, or other harmless animals.
The best raccoon bait should be one that forces the raccoon to fully enter into the trap and step on the plate that triggers the trap. You should wear a glove when placing your baits as a human scent will scare them off.
Because of wildlife conservation efforts and public health safety reasons, your local authority may have laws and regulations regarding the trapping of domestic pests such as raccoons.
Marshmallows -
Raccoons have a soft spot for marshmallows. They also make for good bait as they are unlikely to attract other unwanted wild animals.
It is advisable to use large marshmallows as they cant be easily pulled out through the sides of the trap, and small marshmallows might also attract skunks wandering about looking for grubs. The last thing you want is to trap a skunk in your property.

<h3 id="3-pete-rickard"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A6TOYAC/?tag=p-policy-20">3. Pete Rickard&rsquo;s-LC260 Fish Oil - #3 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Always place the bait away from the walls of the trap. Raccoons are intelligent and may grab the bait without getting into the trap.</p>
<p>Remember to place something heavy on top of the trap so that the raccoon doesnt knock it over.
If you need to trap more than a single raccoon, it is advisable to engage the services of a professional so that the nursery can be quickly relocated after trapping. This will guarantee the safety of the kits. The expert will also be able to put measures that prevent future invasions again.
Always find out the laid down wildlife regulation policies for your area so you dont find yourself on the wrong side of the law.�Related:

An egg -
Raccoons arent picky eaters. They eat anything and everything they come across. Eggs are some of their favorites. You can trap them by simply placing an uncracked egg at the back of the trap.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With an egg, there are very little chances of other animals walking into that trap so you have higher chances of landing the right target.
You can also use other food such as raw nuts, bread, sweet corn, meat, fruits, ham, peanut butter, and dry dog kibble among others.</p>

      <description>Opossums go through garbage,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opossums go through garbage,
hunt mice and snakes
, and hang around roadkill - which exposes them to dangerous diseases like rabies.</p>
<p>So, the question is: do opossums <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-carry-ticks/">carry</a> rabies?
<strong>In brief, NO, Opossum/ possums are very unlikely to carry rabies. Opossums&rsquo; body temperature is too low to inhibit the rabies virus compared to other wildlife like foxes, skunks, raccoons, and bats.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Opossums Cages&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="cold-body-temperature---do-opossums-carry-rabies">Cold Body Temperature - Do Opossums Carry Rabies</h2>
<p>The opossum is just one of the many animals that are immune to rabies.</p>
<p>Opossums have a body temperature about as cold as ice, which helps them avoid the diseases even when they consume infected food or water sources.</p>
<p>Their immunity isn&rsquo;t a result of their cool blood; it&rsquo;s because their bodies produce antibodies around the clock, day in and day out, against almost every virus you can think up - including rabies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums also heal fast from wounds due to bacteria-fighting cells called macrophages on top of those constant antibody production levels protecting their huge stomach lining.
Opossums have a low body temperature level which scientists believe may hold clues to the animals extraordinary resistance to rabies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only once in a blue moon does an opossum carry rabies (it&rsquo;s more than likely just regular old flu). The threat of leptospirosis, caused by bacteria, is much more common in Opossums.</p>
<p>Opossums are known carriers of leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that can be transmitted via contact with the animals feces and urine in the soil.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums aren&rsquo;t necessarily known for their hygiene - and so as they drive into the trash, they may get those parasites causing diseases like leptospirosis.
Many of these parasites cause bites and nips on the human ankles and feet.</li>
<li>Further, opossums won&rsquo;t carry or contract Lyme Illness despite carrying ticks.
If you are concerned about your pets and family members contracting the leptospirosis bacteria from an opossum excreting, there are some preventative measures that could help.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-a-rabid-opossum-do">What does a rabid opossum do?</h2>
<p>Rabies is comparably rare in opossums because of their cooler body temperature. But, can possums be rabid?</p>
<p>Well, Yes, the Center for Disease Control notes that Rabid opossums show symptoms such as reduced appetite, lethargy, vomiting, fever, and seizures.</p>
<p>Signs of rabies progress in the rabid opossum condition include excessive salivation, self-mutilation, aggression, abnormal behavior, challenges in swallowing &amp; breathing, paralysis, weakness, cerebral dysfunction, &amp; cranial nerve dysfunction.</p>
<h2 id="does-hissing-in-opossum-signify-being-rabid">Does Hissing in Opossum Signify Being Rabid?</h2>
<p>Hissing in opossums is not an indicator of being rabid. The sound the animals make can be triggered by a number of reasons, such as when they are mating or fighting with each other.</p>
<p>It also occurs when they get startled and have been known to hiss because their fur is caught on something like branches from trees that humans disturbed while passing through their territory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums may hiss if they feel threatened when cornered. They won&rsquo;t always do this unless they are frightened, but it is a defense tactic to scare away other animals.</li>
<li>To scare predators, the opossums can also produce some repugnant smell, growl, bare their teeth, and hiss - and so these not signs of being rabid.
If you have a problem with opossums, call your exterminator for help. They will come for an inspection and possible safe removal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="do-opossums-bite">Do Opossums Bite?</h2>
<p>Typically, opossums may bite when threatened or cornered. They might also bare their teeth in a threat display or hiss as well.</p>
<p>However, opossums may equally act dead and do not move when threatened.</p>
<p>Opossums may also bite if they are injured or struggling to get free from being captured in a person&rsquo;s hands, but this is relatively rare.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do Opossum have teeth? Yes, most often small incisors that grow throughout their life and wear down as the animal ages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can use these teeth for chewing food or defending themselves with a quick nip at an intruder who is getting too close.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, hissing is another defensive behavior that may be exhibited when an opossum is threatened.</p>
<p>It is rare for opossums to bite humans, but it can happen. So people should stay away from wild animals in the wilderness if they are not vaccinated against rabies or other diseases.</p>
<h2 id="which-diseases-do-opossums-carry">Which Diseases Do Opossums Carry?</h2>
<p>Opossums carry a relatively low risk of carrying rabies but they may have
<strong>dangerous pathogen and germs</strong>
that&rsquo;ll lead to illnesses like leptospirosis.</p>
<p>Leptospirosis causes flu-like symptoms and is caused by bacteria in contaminated bodily fluids and urine from infected Opossum.</p>
<p>The disease may infect rodents,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-squirrels-live/">squirrels</a>
, skunks, and raccoons but fail to show outright signs.</p>
<p>The disease can be passed on to humans through contact with infected animal&rsquo;s urine or by breathing in infectious droplets from an animal sneezing or coughing nearby.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent this illness from happening by wearing gloves when handling possums, keeping your yard clean of trash where they may live (build a fence if necessary)
Humans who contract Leptospirosis may fail to show
<strong>symptoms</strong>
for weeks or months and they may include fever, headache, chills, muscle aches.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid leptospirosis - especially from wild animals, stay away from places that may be contaminated with wildlife urine or water sources like swamps, rivers, and lakes.</p>

<h2 id="dont-let-opossums-into-your-yard">Don&rsquo;t let Opossums into Your Yard</h2>
<p>Without proper understanding and preparation, Opossums can pose a risk to domestic pets in your area.</p>
<p>Opossums require time and a place to warm up, so they are not likely to enter your yard during the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>They feed on fruits, snakes, vegetables, mice, nuts, and insects; however, their diet can be broadened by scavenging for any edible material such as garbage or pet food left outside.
Opossums are one of the few animals that can&rsquo;t get rabies but they can carry other diseases such as the plague, roundworm, and leptospirosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The animal&rsquo;s droppings could contaminate your yard with E-coli or salmonella.</p>
<p>Opossums can also cause a nuisance by attempting to get into trash cans, dog houses, or any small spaces where they would feel safe from predators.</p>
<h2 id="the-shy-and-reserved-opossums">The Shy and Reserved Opossums</h2>
<p>Possums are typically docile, so you can deal with them gently by nudging them away. You can also go towards them and speak in a slow, gentle voice to convince them that you are not any kind of threat.</p>
<ul>
<li>If they do not move after these actions then try scooping him up by placing your hands under their stomach and lifting upwards slowly.
If the possum still does not want to leave, or if there is more than one present, you will have to use a little bit of force on the animal so he knows who&rsquo;s boss!</li>
</ul>
<p>Opossums are often misidentified as rabies carriers because of their strange drool and hissing habits - but they use these for their defense.</p>
<p>The opossum primarily resides in one location for a short period of time, six months typically; they&rsquo;re transient animals - they&rsquo;re introverted and reclusive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums are very protective of their dens and move often if their homes are disturbed.
Opossums will contract or spread disease when they feast on dead animals. Even if the disease doesnt transmit to the opossum, there are risks of acquiring diseases from eating rotting flesh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Opossums are shy and reserved animals that tend to spend the majority of their time inside of their burrows, only coming out when its dark and no one will see them. This naturally prevents them from contracting various illnesses.</p>
<p>Opossums are fascinating, but they&rsquo;re fearsome predators too. Read more to find out how opossums use their special defense mechanisms against predators while conserving energy and remaining healthy themselves!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in conclusion, do opossums carry rabies? No, they do not; thanks to their colder bodies that inhibit the rabies virus.</p>
<p>But opossums will carry other diseases such as leptospirosis that can spread to humans, so it&rsquo;s always important to observe caution when you are around them.</p>
<p>Wild animals that&rsquo;ll carry rabies include raccoons, foxes, and skunks.</p>
<p>As you can see, opossums do not carry rabies!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raccoons are clever, resourceful animals that can be a real nuisance when they invade your home or property. Known for their masked appearance and dexterous hands, raccoons often find ways to enter attics, basements, garages, and even inside walls, leading to damage and health concerns.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with a raccoon infestation, this guide will provide you with effective strategies to safely and humanely remove these pesky animals.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-raccoons-invade-homes">Why Do Raccoons Invade Homes?</h2>
<p>Raccoons are opportunistic feeders and are attracted to areas where food, water, and shelter are readily available. Urban and suburban areas provide them with plenty of opportunities to scavenge, especially when garbage cans, pet food, or compost bins are easily accessible. Raccoons are also known to seek refuge in attics or chimneys, as these spaces provide them with a warm, secure environment for nesting, especially in the colder months.</p>
<p>Common signs of a raccoon problem include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noises in the attic or walls, especially at night when raccoons are most active</li>
<li>Droppings or urine stains around entry points</li>
<li>Damaged or torn vents, shingles, or roofs from attempts to enter your home</li>
<li>Tracks or footprints around your property, especially near trash bins or entry points</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-by-step-guide-to-get-rid-of-raccoons">Step-by-Step Guide to Get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">Rid</a> of Raccoons</h2>
<h3 id="1-identify-the-problem">1. Identify the Problem</h3>
<p>The first step in addressing a <a href="/posts/how-to-repel-raccoons/">raccoon</a> infestation is identifying where they are entering your home. Look for gaps around windows, doors, chimneys, vents, or the roof. Raccoons are known to squeeze through very small spaces, so you may need to inspect these areas thoroughly.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve located the entry points, it&rsquo;s important to check if there are any raccoon nests or young inside. If there are babies, its best to wait until they are old enough to leave before closing the entry points. Raccoons are protective of their young, and removing babies prematurely can lead to dangerous situations.</p>
<h3 id="2-seal-entry-points">2. Seal Entry Points</h3>
<p>After identifying the entry points, the next step is to seal them securely. This will prevent further access to your home. Use sturdy materials like steel mesh, hardware cloth, or metal flashing to cover gaps or holes. Avoid using materials like wood or plastic, as raccoons can easily tear through them.</p>
<p>Be sure to check around your roofline, vents, and chimneys, as raccoons often make their way into these spaces. Also, check if there are trees near the house that raccoons can climb to gain access to upper levels.</p>
<h3 id="3-set-traps">3. Set Traps</h3>
<p>Live traps are one of the most humane ways to remove raccoons from your property. Set up the traps near the entry points or where you&rsquo;ve seen signs of raccoons. Bait the trap with food like cat food, marshmallows, or canned tuna, which raccoons find irresistible.</p>
<p>Check the traps regularly to ensure that any captured animals are not left in them for too long. Once a raccoon is trapped, contact a wildlife control expert or local animal services for advice on how to handle the animal. In many areas, it is illegal to relocate raccoons, as they are considered a nuisance species and may carry diseases.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-repellents">4. Use Repellents</h3>
<p>While repellents can be effective as a deterrent, they should be used in combination with other methods. There are several types of raccoon repellents available:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Chemical repellents:**These are often made from natural ingredients like predator urine or capsaicin (the compound that makes peppers hot), which raccoons find unpleasant.</li>
<li>**Ultrasonic devices:**These emit high-pitched sounds that are irritating to raccoons but are inaudible to humans.</li>
<li>**Homemade repellents:**A mixture of ammonia, vinegar, or garlic can be sprayed around areas where raccoons have been active to repel them.
While repellents can provide temporary relief, they are not a long-term solution and should be used alongside other control methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-remove-attractants">5. Remove Attractants</h3>
<p>Raccoons are primarily attracted to food sources, so its crucial to eliminate any potential attractants around your property. Secure trash cans by using raccoon-proof lids, and never leave pet food outside overnight. If you have fruit trees, pick any fallen fruit promptly.</p>
<p>If you have a compost bin, make sure its properly covered to prevent raccoons from digging through it. Additionally, keep bird feeders out of reach of raccoons, as they will take advantage of the seeds.</p>
<h3 id="6-clean-up-droppings-and-nesting-areas">6. Clean Up Droppings and Nesting Areas</h3>
<p>If raccoons have been living in your attic or basement, they may have left behind droppings, urine, and nesting materials. It&rsquo;s important to clean these areas thoroughly to prevent the spread of disease and to discourage future visits.</p>
<p>Wear gloves, a mask, and protective clothing when handling any raccoon waste, as it can carry diseases like leptospirosis, rabies, and parasites such as roundworms. Disinfect the affected areas with a solution of bleach and water to kill any harmful pathogens.</p>
<h3 id="7-consider-professional-help">7. Consider Professional Help</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unable to get rid of the raccoons on your own or if the infestation is severe, it may be time to call in a professional wildlife control service. These experts have the knowledge, experience, and tools necessary to deal with raccoon problems safely and effectively.</p>
<p>A wildlife control professional can assess the situation, identify all entry points, and implement a comprehensive removal plan that includes trapping, exclusion, and deterrents.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-future-raccoon-infestations">Preventing Future Raccoon Infestations</h2>
<p>Once youve successfully removed raccoons from your property, its important to take steps to prevent future infestations. Here are some preventative measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly inspect your home for new entry points and seal any gaps or holes.</li>
<li>Trim tree branches that overhang your roof to prevent raccoons from climbing onto your house.</li>
<li>Maintain your yard and remove debris where raccoons might find shelter.</li>
<li>Store food securely and dispose of garbage promptly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dealing with a raccoon infestation can be challenging, but with the right approach, its possible to safely and effectively remove these animals from your home. By identifying the source of the problem, sealing entry points, and using traps and repellents, you can keep raccoons out of your home. Remember to always consider humane methods, and dont hesitate to reach out to professionals if the situation becomes overwhelming.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below is�how to repel raccoons?�A <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-raccoons/">raccoon</a> is probably one of the most tenacious and clever pests that boasts a wide variety of athletic skills.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon">Raccoons</a>
can jump, climb, run, or swim with ease, and they have an unparalleled ability to break into trashcans near your home.</p>
<p>Since they are omnivores, raccoons will eat anything they can get their dirty little hands on and this has made them a menace especially in suburban areas.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-repel-raccoons">How to Repel Raccoons</h2>
<p>Yards and gardens are their perfect hangout spot and sometimes they can decide to move into your basement or attic especially when looking for a safe place to raise their kids.</p>
<p>Raccoons may be nice to look at from far but you don&rsquo;t want them getting anywhere near your home. They will steal your food, spread illnesses, and if you run into them, they can scratch you up and leave you with painful injuries.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-identify-their-areas-of-damage">Step 1: Identify their areas of damage</h3>
<p>First, you need to find out where raccoons are gaining entry into your home or compound. Knowing where the raccoon spends most of its time when at your house and identifying the damage it&rsquo;s causing will help you determine the best way to repel them. Common raccoon activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raiding trashcans outside your house.</li>
<li>Eating your veggies.</li>
<li>Attacking your bird feeders.</li>
<li>Living under the porch.</li>
<li>Invading the attic.</li>
<li>Invading the basement.</li>
<li>Digging holes in the yard.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-choose-the-right-repelling-techniques">Step 2: choose the right repelling techniques</h3>
<p>Raccoons display high levels of persistence and ingenuity that can be alarming when you&rsquo;re trying to deter them. However, there are various ways you discourage raccoons from making your home or yard their home:
a) Protect your trash - raccoons love trash bins, so you&rsquo;ll need multiple
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-smells-do-raccoons-hate/">repelling strategies</a>
in this area.
Always lock your trashcans or secure non-locking trashcans with cinder blocks or bungee cords to prevent raccoons from opening them. Double-bag waste meat to reduce the odor that attracts raccoons to your trashcans.
b) Clean up - raccoons thrive in yards dirty and untidy yards with plenty of places to hide. To prevent this, always keep your lawn mowed and prune any overgrown shrubs.
c) Seal entry points - seal the spaces around the decks and bases of sheds that raccoons could use to gain entry into your home. Seal all the entry points to the chimneys, eaves or attics with hardware cloth or chicken wire to keep raccoons out.
d) Fence your garden - installing a fence can help protect your home from raccoons, but since they are excellent climbers, you will need a really tall fence or an electric fence to keep them out. Use a two-wire electric fence, with the wires 6 and 12 inches above the ground.
e) Use floodlights - raccoons hate light and having floodlights lighting up your yard can discourage raccoons from coming near your home. Even better, you can install motion-activated floodlights to stop raccoons in their tracks when they get too close.
f) Use motion-activated sprinklers - you can also install some motion-activated water sprinklers that blast raccoons with water when they get too close.
g) Use chocolate - scatter some chocolate bars outside your home. The raccoons will love eating the chocolate but since it&rsquo;s toxic to them, it will make them sick. After this, the raccoons may mark your home as a no go zone.
h) Use a repellent - there are various types of raccoon repellents you can use based on the places the raccoons are frequenting. Most of these repellents contain capsaicin which is a spicy ingredient extracted from cayenne peppers.
Liquid repellents are great for surface protection against raccoons in areas like garbage cans, bird feeders, plants, hard surfaces, and the roof. You will need to respray regularly as the repellent wears off.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-remove-all-attractants">Step 3: Remove all attractants</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to repel raccoons if you still have attractants like food, water, and shelter. Keep your yard clean and never let your trashcans fill up. Remember to wash the cans periodically to get rid of odors that attract raccoons.</p>
<p>Close any fence gaps and fix broken vents and screens to keep raccoons out. Remove any water sources outside your home and remember to clean up bird seed and pet food that could attract raccoons.</p>
<p>Raccoons are nocturnal in nature, wandering out in the wee hours to search for food.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Granular repellents are great for perimeter protection and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-raccoons/">creating a barrier</a>
around areas like the gardens, raccoon dens, flower beds, barns, sheds, attics, crawl spaces, and other raccoon pathways.</p>
<ul>
<li>They work best where there are flat surfaces and they last longer than liquid repellents.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-trap-raccoons">How to Trap Raccoons</h2>
<h3 id="step-1select-a-raccoon-trap">**Step 1:�**Select a Raccoon Trap</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.esf.edu/aec/adks/mammals/raccoon.htm">Raccoons</a>
are adaptive wild animals. They host pests like roundworms and spread rabies, and will forage in your garbage bins. Killing or hunting raccoons is illegal in some states.</p>
<p>You can trap and then relocate them. Raccoon traps are a humane way to remove these fur-bearing wild animals.</p>
<p>Exterminators recommend getting raccoon traps that are either extra-large or large-sizes (with its length measuring roughly 32 to 42 inches).</p>
<p>Raccoon traps will come with 1 or 2 doors  from which youll select the one that serves your specific purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-Door Trap Model</strong>: This model is a favorite among raccoon exterminators and provides superior level of protection on the trap bait. Allows faster and simple enter/ trapping of the raccoons and other wild animals.</li>
<li><strong>Two-door Trap Model</strong>: Allows double entry allowance and thus provides improved raccoon catch rate. Also, since its a see-through traps, the raccoons will be calmed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-decide-on-the-trap-placement-location">Step 2: Decide on the Trap Placement Location</h3>
<p>First, set up the trap around areas that you&rsquo;ve seen raccoons frequent or where there is evidence of their damage. Place the raccoon trap on a flat surface.</p>
<p>I had tried trapping some raccoons (around a creek that had animals tracks, near barns/ houses) for about a month but they kept eloping me.�However, raccoons will generally love location such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mulch beds</li>
<li>Attics</li>
<li>Woodpiles</li>
<li>Hollow Trees</li>
<li>Porches</li>
<li>Along walls</li>
<li>Below structures</li>
<li>Fence lines</li>
<li>Sheds

<h3 id="step-3-bait-the-racoon-trap">Step 3: Bait The Racoon Trap</h3>
<p>I noted great success with using trap baits like penut butter, marshmellows, sardines, cat food, fish oil spray, and vanilla. Ensure you put wool at the bottom as it&rsquo;ll hold the scent of the liquid for longer.</p>
<p>Raccoons, like most wild animals, definitely love sweet snacks and food such as watermelon and marshmallows.</p>
<p>However, keenly place the bait in the right position of your raccoon trap. This should be in a location thatll allow the raccoon to fully enter the trap.</p>
<p>Notably, some nasty wild animals like raccoons may knock over the trap as they target to steal your hard sourced bait. Further, place a brick or weight on the trap  this will secure the trap is safe.</p>

<h3 id="step-4finally-set-the-raccoon-trap">Step 4:�Finally, Set the Raccoon Trap</h3>
<p>Now, its now that you keenly set the traps door or doors in the raccoon traps ready to trap the nasty wild rodents. Do this keenly on a flat or even surface.</p>
<p>Check the trap usage instruction in the manual for different requirements. After setting the trap, now, its time to test-drive the trigger-and-close systems through pressing down the provided trigger plate.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re setting the trap in hard surfaces such as concrete, first lay down a protective surface like plywood to protect the animal&rsquo;s paws when attempting to dig its way out of the tar.</p>

<h2 id="rules-for-using-raccoon-traps">Rules for Using Raccoon Traps</h2>
<h3 id="1-open-trap-doors-only-at-night-raccoons-are-nocturnals"><strong>1. Open Trap Doors only at Night (Raccoons are Nocturnals)</strong></h3>
<p>Raccoons are very cunning wild animals (rodents for that matter). Therefore, recent
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74116.html">research</a>
shows that the back of the raccoon trap must be covered using a half-inch wire mesh to ensure that the raccoon wont steal the bait from outside the trap.</p>
<p>Definitely, the rodents will attempt to get the bait via the trap bars. However, because raccoons are nocturnal, you should only open the traps during the night. This&rsquo;ll prevent the trap catching animals such as cats or rats.</p>
<h3 id="2place-bait-trap-leading-to-trap-door">**2.�**Place Bait Trap leading to Trap Door</h3>
<p>Next, place the bait in a manner that itll leave a trail that leads to your raccoon trap. For example, one piece of the raccoon bait must be positioned around the raccoon trail.</p>
<p>Also, you can place it around places food was located. This will trap the raccoon as it attempts to get back to where it ate the food last time.� But first, ensure you remove the food.</p>
<h2 id="3-practices-for-humana-raccoon-trapping">3. Practices for Humana Raccoon Trapping</h2>
<p>For human treatment of the Raccoons, you
<a href="http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/nuisance/trapping.html">should</a>
put 1-2 tennis balls in the raccoon traps and thus allow the large rodents to release its frustration and energy. Further, for the smaller animal, you can offer some piece of wood.</p>

<h3 id="4-put-on-gloves">4. Put on Gloves</h3>
<p>Notably, since raccoons have some sensitive nose, youll need to put on some gloves when youre setting up the rodent trap.�Further, was the new raccoon traps using vinegar and water as this will eliminate animals oils.</p>
<p>Further, was the new racoon traps using vinegar and water as this will eliminate animals oils. Next, create a mist around the raccoon trap using a spray of aromatic vegetation (or fir needles) and water  this will help conceal the smell of human beings.</p>
<h3 id="5-fix-the-racoon-cage-securely">5. Fix the Racoon Cage Securely</h3>
<p>Lastly, by any possible way, ensure you fix the raccoon cage securely. But why? Well, raccoons are relatively heavy  weighting anything from 5-25 kg.</p>
<p>Therefore, with some simple manoeuvres, the wild animals can flip the cage and flee. Further, fixing the cage properly avoid cases where the raccoon would tilt the cage and easily pick the bait.</p>

      <description>Whether your home is surrounded by trees or skyscrapers, raccoons are likely a part of the wildlife population in your area.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether your home is surrounded by trees or skyscrapers, raccoons are likely a part of the wildlife population in your area.</p>
<p>Raccoons are some of the most adaptable pests in the Americas, and they can be found in both urban and rural areas in different climates.</p>
<p>We have compiled some interesting facts about these masked bandits that you should know:</p>
<h2 id="general-raccoon-facts">General Raccoon facts</h2>
<p>Raccoons, also known as Procyon lotor, are round, fuzzy animals with grey fur, bushy tails with 5-7 black rings around them, and a black mask of fur covering their eye area.</p>
<p>They have pointy snouts with black noses and dextrous front paws. Raccoons are about the size of small dogs.</p>
<p>A fully grown raccoon is usually about 23 to 37 inches tall and weighs 4 to 23 pounds. Raccoons may look cute and cuddly from far but they can become quite hostile and aggressive when approached.</p>
<h2 id="raccoon-history">Raccoon History</h2>
<p>Raccoons are natively found across North America, but thanks to humans, they can also be found in Japan and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>The first time raccoons were exported to Europe was in the early 1900s to stock fur farms. But, many of the raccoons found ways to escape and founded new populations in the wild which have been growing ever since. Today, raccoons are considered to be an invasive species in Europe.</p>
<h2 id="raccoon-intelligence-facts">Raccoon Intelligence Facts</h2>
<p>The first time raccoons made it to Japan was in the 1970s and you will never guess why. During that period, Japanese kids were obsessed with the amine cartoon &lsquo;Rascal the Raccoon&rsquo; which led them to demand raccoons of their own.</p>
<p>At one point, the Japanese were importing more than 1500 raccoons every month. Raccoon intelligence - naturally, most of the raccoons found a way to get back in the wild where they established populations.</p>
<p>Even though Japan banned the import and ownership of raccoons, they have spread to all parts of the country.</p>
<h2 id="raccoon-habitat">Raccoon Habitat</h2>
<p>Traditionally, raccoons live in heavily wooded areas with plenty of trees, vegetation, and water. They make dens in hollow trees or abandoned burrows and can travel for long distances in search of food.</p>
<p>Raccoons are highly adaptable, and they can be found in urban and suburban areas living in man-made structures such as sewers, garbage bins, barns, sheds, attics, and basements.</p>
<p>Diet</p>
<p>In urban and suburban areas where fresh vegetation and wildlife are limited, they&rsquo;re more likely to eat human food which they usually look for in trashcans.</p>
<p>Raccoons are omnivorous with an opportunistic diet; they eat almost anything they find. If you have a bird feeder or you feed your pets outside, they&rsquo;ll likely steal that too.</p>
<p>Diseases</p>
<p>Raccoons can spread various diseases to humans or pets by contaminating food or through scratches or bites. Some of these diseases include leptospirosis, roundworm, salmonella, and rabies.</p>
<p>Raccoons are notorious for spreading rabies to pets, so if you see one with excessive foam or drool in their mouth, aggressive and with unusual vocalization, call your local animal control expert immediately.</p>
<p>Other Raccoon facts</p>
<ol>
<li>They have unique hands - raccoons are known for having some of the most dextrous paws in nature.</li>
</ol>
<p>This explains why they are able to open doors, latches, jars, and bottles. It also gives them special climbing skills which they use to access food and shelter more efficiently.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Reproduction - raccoons usually reproduce in late winter. They usually give birth to around 6 babies in April or May.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mothers are extremely protective of their babies during their first year which is one of the main reasons why a raccoon would invade your home for shelter.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Activity - raccoons are nocturnal creatures and they are most active at night. While most animals rely on their sight, smell, or sound to hunt for food, raccoons use their sense of touch to find food.</li>
</ol>
<p>Their front paws have about 4 times more sensory receptors compared to the back paws, which allows them to tell apart various objects without even seeing them.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Their iconic black mask - the black mask around raccoons&rsquo; eyes is not meant just to make them look like cute little bandits.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to researchers, the black masks also help them to see more clearly. The dark mask absorbs incoming light which reduces glare that would obstruct their vision.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Life expectancy - raccoons can survive in the wild for 2-3 years and up to 20 years in captivity.</li>

      <description>Rodent control is crucial for maintaining a healthy and safe home environment, particularly in Tacoma, WA, where common rodents such as house mice, Norway ...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rodent <a href="/posts/rodent-control-in-puyallup/">control</a> is crucial for maintaining a healthy and safe home environment, particularly in Tacoma, WA, where common rodents such as house mice, Norway rats, and roof rats are prevalent.</p>
<p>Here are detailed steps and tips for homeowners in Tacoma to effectively manage rodent issues:</p>
<h3 id="identifying-rodents">Identifying Rodents</h3>
<p>Understanding the specific type of rodent you&rsquo;re dealing with is the first step in effective control. House mice are small, usually gray or brown with large ears and eyes.</p>
<p>Norway rats are larger, with a robust body, blunt nose, and a shorter tail relative to their body length. Roof rats are sleek with a pointed nose, large eyes, and a tail longer than their body.
<strong>Signs of Infestation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Droppings:**Rodent droppings are one of the most obvious signs of an infestation. Mouse droppings are small and pointed, while rat droppings are larger and more capsule-shaped.</li>
<li>**Gnaw Marks:**Rodents need to gnaw to keep their teeth sharp. Look for gnaw marks on food packaging, walls, or other materials.</li>
<li>**Nests:**Rodents build nests from shredded paper, fabric, and other soft materials. Nests are usually hidden in secluded areas.</li>
<li>**Sounds:**Scurrying, squeaking, or scratching noises, particularly at night, can indicate rodent activity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prevention-measures">Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>Preventing rodents from entering your home is critical to avoid infestations. Here are some preventive measures:
<strong>Seal Entry Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect your home thoroughly for any gaps, cracks, or holes, especially around the foundation, walls, and roof. Use materials like steel wool, caulk, or metal mesh to seal these entry points.
<strong>Proper Storage:</strong></li>
<li>Store food in airtight containers to prevent rodents from accessing it. This includes pet food and birdseed.</li>
<li>Keep garbage bins sealed tightly to avoid attracting rodents.
<strong>Maintain Cleanliness:</strong></li>
<li>Regularly clean your home, particularly kitchen areas where food crumbs and spills are common. Ensure floors and countertops are free of food debris.</li>
<li>Reduce clutter in your home and yard to eliminate potential nesting sites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eliminating-rodents">Eliminating Rodents</h3>
<p>If you already have a rodent problem, eliminating them quickly and efficiently is essential:
<strong>Traps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use snap traps, glue traps, or live traps strategically around your home where you suspect rodent activity. Snap traps are effective for killing rodents quickly, while live traps can be used to catch and release them humanely.
<strong>Bait Stations:</strong></li>
<li>Bait stations are useful for controlling larger rodent populations. These<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-rat-poison/">stations</a>contain rodenticides and should be placed in areas inaccessible to children and pets.
<strong>Natural Deterrents:</strong></li>
<li>Substances like peppermint oil used cat litter, or ultrasonic repellents can help deter rodents. However, these methods may not be as effective as traps and bait stations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="professional-pest-control-services">Professional Pest Control Services</h3>
<p>For severe infestations or if you prefer professional assistance, hiring a pest control service is a reliable option:
<strong>Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Professional services start with a thorough assessment of your property to identify the extent of the infestation and potential entry points.
<strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM):</strong></li>
<li>IPM combines multiple methods for long-term control, including habitat modification, exclusion, and chemical treatments. This approach minimizes the use of harmful chemicals and focuses on sustainable solutions.
<strong>Regular Monitoring:</strong></li>
<li>Professionals can set up regular monitoring to ensure the rodents do not return. This may include periodic inspections and maintenance of exclusion measures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health-and-safety">Health and Safety</h3>
<p>Rodents can pose significant health risks, so taking proper precautions is crucial:
<strong>Hantavirus Precaution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious when cleaning areas with rodent droppings to avoid hantavirus, which can be fatal. Use gloves and a mask, and disinfect areas thoroughly with a bleach solution.
<strong>Sanitization:</strong></li>
<li>After dealing with rodents, sanitize all affected areas to prevent the spread of diseases. This includes wiping down surfaces, washing bedding and fabrics, and vacuuming with a HEPA filter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="local-pest-control-companies-in-tacoma">Local Pest Control Companies in Tacoma</h3>
<p>Several pest control companies in Tacoma offer effective and professional rodent control services:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Pestpolicy:**Known for eco-friendly and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-much-is-an-exterminator-for-mice/">effective pest control methods</a>, they provide comprehensive services to eliminate and prevent rodent infestations.
Hiring a professional pest control service can save time and ensure that the problem is dealt with effectively and safely. Regular maintenance and vigilance are key to keeping your home rodent-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking these steps, homeowners in Tacoma can protect their homes and families from the risks associated with rodent infestations.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring marks a period of increased <a href="/posts/healthy-pets-rodent-control/">rodent</a> activity due to warmer weather and the availability of food and shelter. This season, rodents become more visible and active, which can lead to infestations if preventive measures are not taken.</p>
<h2 id="increased-activity">Increased Activity</h2>
<p>During spring, many rodent species enter their prime breeding season, resulting in a population surge. The abundance of food sources such as plants and insects supports this growth.</p>
<p>Rodents, including mice, rats, and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-yard/">squirrels</a>
, become more active as they search for food and suitable nesting sites.</p>
<h2 id="common-rodents">Common Rodents</h2>
<p>House mice and deer mice are frequently encountered during the spring. These small rodents seek food and shelter in homes, garages, and sheds. Norway rats and roof rats are also common.</p>
<p>Norway rats tend to burrow into the ground, while roof rats prefer to nest in higher locations such as attics and trees. Ground and tree squirrels are more visible as they forage for food and sometimes nest in attics or chimneys.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-infestation">Signs of Infestation</h2>
<p>Identifying a rodent infestation involves looking for specific signs. Droppings are a primary indicator, often found in cabinets,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-pantry-bugs/">pantries</a>
, or along baseboards.</p>
<p>Gnaw marks on wood, wires, or food packaging are also common. Rodents create nests from shredded paper, fabric, or plant material, usually in hidden areas. Additionally, you might hear scratching or scurrying noises in walls, ceilings, or attics, especially at night.</p>
<h2 id="entry-points">Entry Points</h2>
<p>Rodents can enter your home through surprisingly small openings. Common entry points include gaps in walls, doors, windows, and foundations.</p>
<p>Unscreened vents and chimneys offer easy access, as do gaps around pipes and utility lines. Even doors and windows that are not properly sealed can provide entry points for these pests. It&rsquo;s crucial to inspect and seal these potential entry points to prevent rodents from entering your home.</p>
<h2 id="prevention-tips">Prevention Tips</h2>
<p>To prevent rodent infestations, its important to take several proactive measures. Seal all potential entry points using materials like caulk or steel wool to close gaps and holes.</p>
<p>Maintaining cleanliness is essential; keep kitchens and storage areas free of food debris and crumbs. Store food in sealed containers, and ensure pet food is also secured.</p>
<p>Regular yard maintenance can help; trim bushes and trees, keep grass short, and remove any debris that could serve as a hiding spot for rodents. Additionally, use lidded garbage cans and remove trash regularly to deter rodents from foraging near your home.</p>
<h2 id="disease-transmission">Disease Transmission</h2>
<p>Rodents pose significant health risks due to their potential to transmit diseases. Direct contact with rodents or their droppings and urine can spread diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contaminated food and surfaces are another common transmission route, as rodents can leave behind bacteria. Inhaling dust that is contaminated with rodent droppings or urine can also spread diseases.
Some common diseases transmitted by rodents include Hantavirus, Salmonella, Leptospirosis, and Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-infestations">Dealing with Infestations</h2>
<p>If you discover a rodent infestation, there are several methods to address it. Traps are a widely used solution; snap traps, live traps, and glue boards can be effective when placed along walls and in areas with evident rodent activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baits and poisons can also be used, but they must be handled with caution, especially in homes with children or pets. It is crucial to follow all safety instructions when using these products.
For large or persistent infestations, hiring a professional pest control service is advisable to ensure thorough and
effective eradication
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="health-risks">Health Risks</h2>
<p>Rodents are carriers of diseases that can pose serious health risks to humans.</p>
<p>Beyond the diseases they carry, rodent droppings and urine can also trigger allergies and asthma, particularly in sensitive individuals. Managing and preventing rodent infestations is essential to protect the health of your household.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-considerations">Environmental Considerations</h2>
<p>In addition to direct control methods, encouraging natural predators can help manage rodent populations. Birds of prey like owls and natural predators such as snakes can be beneficial.</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing habitats for these predators can help keep rodent numbers in check. Eco-friendly options, such as humane traps and organic repellents, should also be considered as part of an integrated pest management strategy.
Understanding these aspects of rodent behavior in the spring can help you effectively manage and prevent infestations, ensuring a safer and cleaner environment in your home and garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking proactive measures, you can minimize the risks associated with rodent activity and maintain a rodent-free living space.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Groundhogs are underground rodents that spend most of their lives in underground tunnels. They spend a lot of time burrowing and coming out in the open to look for food.� But what do groundhogs <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> to survive underground?</p>
<ul>
<li>**Groundhogs are omnivorous that&rsquo;ll eat both plants and animals. But in most cases, groundhogs eat vegetables, grass, fruits, alfalfa, clovers, soybeans, dandelion, and apples, and other garden plants. **</li>
<li><strong>Groundhogs tend to be more herbivorous than they are carnivorous though on some rare occasions, you will find them eating insects.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Repellents for Groundhogs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Groundhogs greatest enemy is the human being but their damages in the garden cannot be ignored. Related:

<h2 id="details-what-do-groundhogs-eat">Details: What Do Groundhogs Eat?</h2>
<h3 id="1-plants-fruits-and-vegetables"><strong>1. Plants, Fruits and Vegetables</strong></h3>
<p>When we talk about groundhogs feeding on vegetables, plants, and fruits, what are their favorites? These fruits are apples, raspberries, hackberries, mulberries, and other types of berries.
Others are cloves, dandelions, alfalfa, maple leaves among others.
Before we can get to know what groundhogs eat, maybe we can have a brief understanding of what groundhogs really are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Groundhogs are basically rodents that belong to a family of squirrels known as marmots. They are also referred to as woodchucks or whistle pigs because of the whistling sound they make trying to warn the rest of incoming danger.</li>
<li>Groundhogs are found in the eastern and the central part of the United States. They like to live in woodlands and transitional areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cultivated-crops"><strong>2. Cultivated Crops</strong></h3>
<p>Groundhogs can also prove to be disastrous on cultivated crops like lettuce, corn, legumes, soybeans, broccoli, peas, and others
It is mostly these cultivated crops that will capture a farmers interest in eradicating the groundhogs. This is because of the damage they do to the crops and also to the garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>But even so, they spent most of their time underground burrowing and looking for food. Their tunnels can go as deep as 6 ft. under and can stretch up to 25 ft. but with multiple entrances. These burrows are where they call home and even reproduce from these places.
Though groundhogs are omnivorous, they tend to feed more vegetables and fruits, especially from our gardens. They will cause damage as they burrow through the garden leaving all your plants dead and weathering.
Apart from the vegetable, groundhogs will also destroy your carrots and other cultivated crops. For a better understanding of the groundhogs, we can break down their diet into different categories.

<h3 id="3-animals-insects-and-pests-">**3. Animals, Insects, and Pests **</h3>
<p>It is rare to find groundhogs feeding other animals and pests but when available, they dont hesitate to eat them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some of the delicacies that groundhogs eat. Crickets, snails, bugs, grasshoppers, bird eggs, juvenile birds among smaller animals.
However, the groundhog&rsquo;s diet is also greatly affected by seasons and daily weather. This is because weather directly affects the food that is available for the rodents.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-groundhogs-diet-during-seasons">A Groundhogs Diet during Seasons</h2>
<h3 id="1-spring-and-summer-">**1. Spring and summer **</h3>
<p>These two seasons there is plenty of food and groundhogs have the opportunity to enjoy whatever they want. They feed on their favorite vegetables, fruits, and cultivated crops.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also feed on grasshopper snails and also other insects that are available.
During this season, they feed either in the morning or the evening hour and spend the rest of the daytime hours hiding underground.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-autumn-">**2. Autumn **</h3>
<p>In this season, things start changing and food start becoming scarce and groundhogs turn to insects and other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to their limited options, they also eat tree backs and leaves and a supplementary.</li>
<li>Additionally, it is this season that the groundhogs get an opportunity to eat lots of protein from the animals and insects too.
This is the reason they start storing food on the burrows as they prepare for the winter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-winter-">**3. Winter **</h3>
<p>This is an inactive stage for the groundhogs and they are not so much involved in food hunts.
They live in the tunnels and feed on the food in the store. In this period they fed less as compared to other seasons to save on energy and food.

<h2 id="how-to-protect-your-garden-from-groundhog">How to Protect Your Garden from Groundhog</h2>
<p>Groundhogs love to live where there is woodland and at the edges of forested areas. They will occasionally come out of the tunnels into our gardens to look for a look. As I said, they like feeding on cultivated crops.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can really be a nuisance on your farm but there is always a way to tame them.</li>
<li>Timely harvesting. If you want to avoid losses and damages done by groundhogs, ensure your crop is harvested on time.</li>
<li>Groundhogs also love eating the legume and cloves when they are natured but timely and proper harvesting will have them lose the most of reaping where they have not planted.
Using peppermint on the crops. Pepper and groundhogs are like water and paraffin, they dont mix. Therefore if you use it on the crop or pour around the border, this will be a nice way of keeping them off. Afterward, you can wash off the pepper, if you are not a fan.
Erecting a wall around your garden. This will help secure their entry into your garden to cause destruction. To be on the safer side, you need at least a wall of 3-4 ft. high where the groundhogs cannot hump.
Using repellents. There are available in most retailers. You can use the electronic pest repellent or a normal groundhog repellent.
Removing logs within your garden will stop attracting them. Like earlier mentioned, they like to live around woody areas and this will serve the same purpose.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>What do groundhogs eat? They are omnivorous but have a high preference for vegetables, fruits and plants as compared to animals, insects and pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of their nature to burrow and live underground, and fear for human beings, they like to come out and feed either in the evening or in the morning.</li>
<li>Their feeding pattern and diet is also greatly affected by weather patterns and will hide food in the tunnels for the winter season.
That said done, they are a great threat to our farming activities and measures should be applied to ensure their damage is controlled.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raccoons are nocturnal, thus it&rsquo;s difficult to spot them easily during the day. But,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/parasites/baylisascaris/resources/raccoonlatrines.pdf">raccoon poops and urine</a>
smell are key indicators in case of invasion.
**So, what does raccoon <a href="/posts/what-does-lizard-poop-look-like/">poop</a> look like? Well, raccoon poop is brown in color (dark to light brown) and appears like an elongated pinky finger on the ground. **</p>
<ul>
<li>**The poop&rsquo;s size is about 3 to 6 inches long. Raccoon droppings can be piled in a cluster form or slightly scattered within the area. **
<strong>Raccoon poop (fresh) has a strong odor that can be detected from a couple of feet away. Raccoon poop is very contagious as it houses roundworms and bacteria that transmit diseases such as hantavirus and histoplasmosis.�</strong>

</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-does-raccoon-poop-look-like">Details: What Does Raccoon Poop Look Like?</h2>
<h3 id="1-color">1. Color</h3>
<p>Raccoon poop is usually brown in color (this may vary from light to dark brown, depending on the climatic conditions).</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the poop color is slightly altered by the type of food which the raccoon had eaten previously.
At times, you will notice a black spot on the raccoon droppings or darker brown outer part than the interior. Nevertheless, the poop should never be black or yellow whatsoever.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-smell">2. Smell</h3>
<p>Unlike cat or rat poop, fresh raccoon droppings release a strong unpleasant smell, which can spread over 100 meters away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, the scent increases with freshness and fades as the poop dries out.
You will also note the smell of urine (for fresh raccoon poop) though this may not be as sharp as that of fresh droppings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-shapesize">3. Shape/Size</h3>
<p>Raccoon poop is tubular/cylindrical in shape (like a solid pipe). It appears like an elongated pinky finger on the ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>The diameter size of the rod-like poop ranges between a half to one inch depending on the age of the raccoon (baby or adult raccoon).
Raccoon poop length ranges between 3 to 6 inches - this measurement may change slightly depending on the raccoon age as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-quantity">4. Quantity</h3>
<p>The weight of raccoon poop is a variable, which is estimated between a quarter to one kilogram.</p>
<ul>
<li>The baby raccoon droppings could weigh as low as 5 grams, while the adult raccoon poop could measure far beyond one kilogram.
The variation in the number of raccoon droppings is determined by the availability of food, the health condition of the raccoon (sick raccoon droppings are less in weight), or gender (female raccoon poop weighs more than that of male counterpart).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-distribution">5. Distribution</h3>
<p>Unlike other wild animals like squirrels, raccoon poop is piled/clustered in a specific area within its habitat.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are areas designated by raccoons for excretion purposes only and are treated as latrines where all other members of that raccoon family are expected to release bowels.
Further, raccoon poop breaks at a given length (about 3 to 6 inches) during excretion - it&rsquo;s not a continuous one like in the case of the opossum.</li>
<li>Indeed, you will find that the poop is piled up on top of each broken part.
Nevertheless, in arid areas, raccoon droppings may break/disintegrate (due to heat) and spread out though this may not go beyond a hundred-meter radius.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-locationplace">6. Location/place</h3>
<p>Often, you will find raccoon poop hidden in tall grass, shrubs, untrimmed bushes, lawns, tall flower beds, garbage bins, underground holes in open fields, riversides, or even ponds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The choice of &ldquo;raccoon latrine&rdquo; depends on the climatic condition of the area and the availability of food sources.
NB: When identifying raccoon poop, always have personal protective gears on for your safety.

<h2 id="which-risks-are-caused-by-raccoon-poop">Which Risks are Caused by Raccoon Poop?</h2>
<p>Raccoon poop is associated with various risks as highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-houses-leptospirosis">1. Houses Leptospirosis</h3>
<p>Leptospirosis is a common bacteria found in raccoon urine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon contact with cut body parts or wounds, the bacteria penetrate the body and cause a fatal kidney infection.
In extreme cases, Leptospirosis causes meningitis, which leads to lethal body somatic cells failure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-causes-giardiasis">2. Causes Giardiasis</h3>
<p>Giardiasis is a severe intestinal infection, which is caused by direct contact with raccoon droppings.
Upon detection, Giardiasis should be treated instantly in order to avoid traces of microorganisms that denature specialized body cells.</p>
<h3 id="3-bear-roundworms">3. Bear Roundworms</h3>
<p>Baylisascaris procyonis (round worms) are borne in raccoon poop and transmitted through direct contact with fecal matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ascariasis is easily transferred through their eggs (inhale), which later find their way to various body organs (intestine).
Usually, roundworms affect eyes, brains, or lungs and cause major damages to the vital organ system leading to death eventually.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-carry-salmonella">4. Carry Salmonella</h3>
<p>Salmonella is a bacteria borne in raccoon droppings, which causes salmonellosis disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you touch raccoon poop, the salmonella bacteria get into your body through wounds or any other openings.
Normally, salmonellosis affects the food ingestion process, which may lead to seizure if not attended to in time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-raccoon-poop">How to Clean Raccoon Poop</h2>
<p>Raccoon poop cleaning/removal process is critical and should be undertaken professionally as highlighted below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always wear protective gear (gloves, respirator, safety shoes, overall, and head cover) before you begin the raccoon fecal removal process.</li>
<li>Carefully, use a shovel or an inverted plastic bag when scooping.</li>
<li>Seal the poop bag tight before transporting it to the disposal area</li>
<li>Bury the droppings in a deep hole and cover the top with a sufficient amount of soil</li>
<li>Treat the scooped area with raccoon poop disinfectant chemical - twice of thrice</li>
<li>Wash shovels and gloves (used in the scooping process) thoroughly - to prevent any infection.</li>
<li>For indoor cases, clean the surface with soapy detergents</li>
<li>Clean all protective gears in high-temperature soapy detergents - helps kill any salmonella bacteria in the attire.</li>
<li>Finally, take a warm bath after the entire process

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don&rsquo;t want raccoons digging up your yard or tearing apart your house or garbage can, but you also don&rsquo;t like the idea of killing them.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of repellents that claim they will<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-raccoons/">keep away raccoons</a>, but what smells do Raccoons hate? What do animals respond to most strongly?
**Answer: In brief, raccoons hate irritating smells like those from Epsom salt, peppermint oil, garlic, onion, and hot pepper. **
**Also, real or synthetic scents of predator urine will repel raccoons. **
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Raccoons Repellents&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-problems-will-raccoons-bring-to-your-property">What Problems Will Raccoons Bring to Your Property?</h2>
<p>Raccoons are hardy and adaptable mammals that thrive around homes where they have great access to shelter and food - they&rsquo;ll also transmit diseases like
<a href="https://www.addl.purdue.edu/newsletters/1997/fall/%5Braccoon%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-raccoons/).shtml">Leptospirosis</a>
.</p>
<p>The sense of smell is the most important sense that raccoons have. Also, their hands are small, but they&rsquo;re strong enough to rummage your garbage bins.</p>
<p>So, if you dont get rid of the raccoons quickly, a couple more problems arise:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Female raccoons may enter your house, attic, or chimney to give birth</strong>(fast reproduction), and they will leave feces in every nook.</li>
<li>**They will leave feces on the floors **of your house, attic, yard, or swimming pool - these are smells and problems we&rsquo;d want to avoid - just as we dowith geese.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;ll rummage the garbage cans to find food, and they&rsquo;ll also tear down garden shrubs for berries, birdseed, and pet food -<strong>leaving a huge mess</strong></li>
<li><strong>Raccoons will prey on your pets</strong>such as chickens, fish, as well as your birds and ducks.
Other problems that you may be experiencing with raccoons include loud barking and howling in the evening hours, invading your home for food, and leaving fecal droppings on the ground or your structures.
*With that said: *
*Some scents are documented to be great as turning off raccoons from different spaces such as your home. *</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>*But these *<em>scents and smells may not be reliable over the long term since they need to be applied regularly and remain at a strong level in the area where it is desired that raccoons do not go.</em>
**If the raccoon problem has gotten out of hand, and your property, humans, and pets - you can **
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pest-control-near-me/"><strong>check for pest exterminators near you</strong></a>
** and you&rsquo;ll be assisted. **</li>

<h2 id="what-smells-do-raccoons-hate---the-7-scents-that-repel-raccoons">What Smells Do Raccoons Hate - The 7 Scents That Repel Raccoons</h2>
<h3 id="scent-1-sprinkle-hot-pepper">Scent 1: Sprinkle Hot Pepper</h3>
<p>Raccoons rely on their sense of smell to find food. One of the most common scents that are used as a repellant for raccoons is hot peppers.</p>
<p>Although they don&rsquo;t actually have to be fresh - many people will dry and grind their own peppers at home, which you can then sprinkle around your garden or other areas that would deter these animals from coming in contact with them.</p>
<p>In addition, a lot of these are mixed with other scents such as garlic or red pepper flakes in order to make the smell even stronger and more effective.</p>
<p>But if this sounds like too much work, there are also products available on sites such as Amazon, which helps make it easy enough to buy what you need without having to prepare it on your own.</p>
<p>I recommend the Cayenne Pepper Powder that has 90,000 heat units to repel the raccoons.</p>
<ul>
<li>I bought this to get rid of raccoons, opossums, and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-gopher-traps/">gophers</a>that were getting into my yard. It worked in repelling the raccoons and it is safe.
The only downside is that hot pepper irritates the raccoons&rsquo; and such animals&rsquo; sense of smell, but the scent will diminish after a while.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying hot pepper in the places where raccoons are most likely to find food will keep them away for a few days - so you must re-apply the hot pepper.</p>
<h3 id="scent-2-use-pepper--onion">Scent 2: Use Pepper + Onion</h3>
<p>You can make your own mixture by combining pepper and onion. It is important to use fresh ingredients, as old spices will not be potent enough for the raccoons to notice it.</p>
<p>Hot peppers are often an effective repellent for raccoons, but perhaps theyre not tough enough to keep those pesky intruders out of your yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>To make sure youre really making the most of their scent-based deterrents, combine onion and hot peppers in a 50:50 ratio. Simmer them together over boiling water and sprinkle around.
This mixture of ingredients makes for a nasty concoction that will anger raccoons&rsquo; sense of smell while releasing an awful odor that may ward them off.</li>
<li>But it also requires a re-application a minimum of twice a week as the pepper-onion smell will fade within days.
So, the pepper + onion smell will repel the raccoons and other pests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scent-3-peppermint-oil">Scent 3: Peppermint Oil</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an affordable option to keep raccoons out of your garden this is our favorite spray made with peppermint essential oil that smells like Christmas!</p>
<p>The peppermint essential oil is unique because it has a natural repellent property besides being used in different industries.</p>

<li>It also comes in an all-natural liquid form, which can be diluted with water for use as a spray or mixed into another medium such as cooking oils to create your own homemade pest deterrent!
I recommend you purchase Rodent Sheriff Peppermint as it&rsquo;ll repel raccoons and other bugs such as roaches and mice. You can spray it on trash cans, sheds, attics, kitchens, basements, and Garages.</li>
<li>I got my package on Saturday and just finished spraying down my car. Rats ate along the side of it, so I wanted to keep them away before they could do more damage.</li>
<li>Stink stuff like this was supposed to work but it never has before. Well, guess what? This time around, rats never bothered me!</li>
<li>I sprayed a lot of Rodent Sheriff Peppermint because there must have been quite a few rodents living in that old car, but not anymore!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scent-4-use-epsom-salt">Scent 4: Use Epsom Salt</h3>
<p>Epsom salt is a useful solution for creating an environment that raccoons will choose to avoid - besides being a great fertilizer for yards and gardens.</p>
<p>Sprinkle the Epsom salt over a surface where raccoons frequently come to forage.</p>
<p>Epsom salts are inexpensive and can be purchased at most grocery stores or pharmacies.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is often used as an ingredient in fertilizer and bath salts, so if you would like more information about how much Epsom salt to use or other methods on how best to apply this solution check your local resources!
Here&rsquo;s the secret to keeping raccoons out of your garden: scatter the Epsom salts around and they will stop raccoons in their tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent these critters from sniffing out rubbish bins and food left outside in your yard, sprinkle Epsom salt around the edges so they will have to find their next meal elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="scent-5-eviction-fluid">Scent 5: Eviction Fluid</h3>
<p>To evict a female raccoon,
<a href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/icwdm_wdmconfproc/173/">scientists discovered</a>
that the smell of male urine, or what we call Eviction Fluid (EF), is the solution.</p>
<p>Eliminating nursing raccoons from an area can be difficult if they have found a good spot to raise their young ones and establish their territory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EF gives off a strong scent and lasts for weeks after application on hard surfaces like concrete, asphalt, wood, plastic decking, etc., so female raccoons will not return once displaced with this product!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eviction fluid is a human safe, humane and effective way to repel Raccoons from your property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once applied it will create a noxious odor for raccoons which they find intolerable so as soon as they detect this smell, theyll be gone!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply that Eviction fluid in the attic and chimney as these are the areas that the nursing raccoon will hide their babies. Thus, the female raccoon will escape the strong &ldquo;male raccoon&rdquo; scent.</p>
<h3 id="scent-6-use-predator-urine">Scent 6: Use Predator Urine</h3>
<p>Raccoons have a great sense of smell and can detect prey from far away.</p>
<p>Predator urine is designed to mimic the natural &ldquo;scents&rdquo; found in nature such as fox, coyote, or wolf urine.</p>
<p>These scents are built into their DNA that they find attractive because it signals an area where food might be obtained nearby.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best news about using predator urine for your garden - you don&rsquo;t need to put up with pesky raccoons!
One of the most popular ways to keep raccoons away is by using a scent that smells like another predator who has already claimed this area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raccoons have a notoriously bad habit of getting comfortable in peoples yards. Once they realize youve arrived and their natural predators are no longer around, theyll stick around as long as theres food to eat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the urine of predators to frighten raccoons in your home into another location.
Predator animals mark their territory by urinating around the area to stake a claim. The best solution is to deter them with a little bit of predator pee such as PredatorPee Combo.</li>
<li>I live in an area with many raccoons cats, and they often roam freely. Although these furry friends never intentionally come into my yard, their fur on the back patio everywhere is very difficult to clean up.
Finding that cats were littering my yard with their urine was a nightmare, but thanks to PredatorPee Combo, you can take back your territory.</li>
<li>One of the reasons why it does work is that Predator Urine contains the appropriate amount of hormones and pheromones in order for raccoons to be repelled.
Raccoons have been on my property for the better part of a year. I can&rsquo;t do much about them because they live in my yard.</li>
<li>But what I wanted was to keep them out of my yard and away from the furniture by my patio. After trying other solutions to no avail, there&rsquo;s finally one that works: PredatorPee Combo.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on the question &ldquo;what smells do Raccoons hate?&rdquo; the answer has been found.</p>
<p>Here are a few smells that Raccoons hate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>citronella, Hot Pepper, Onions, lavender, predator urine, peppermint essential oils, and Eviction fluid.

<h2 id="details-what-sound-does-a-raccoon-make">Details: What Sound Does a Raccoon Make</h2>
<p>These raccoon sounds are made mainly when communicating with each other, searching for shelter &amp; food, defending the baby raccoon, or fighting over a family colony.</p>
<h3 id="1-churringpurring">1. Churring/Purring</h3>
<p>Churring/purring is exclusive sound made by the baby raccoons in their den.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult female raccoon licks, holds, or nibbles young ones as a sign of care - in return, the cub reciprocate by purring.
The baby raccoons will continue to purr as long as the mother is touching them. For adult raccoons, they purr as a sign of happiness or affection to each other.
If you pay keen attention, you will identify raccoon sounds easily since raccoons make sounds as they move along, unlike other wild animals. Importantly, raccoons are more active at night than day time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-barking">2. Barking</h3>
<p>Barking is a vocalization sound made by raccoons when suffering or when stressed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raccoon stresses are caused by situation such as hunger and continuous attacks in their colony.
Further, raccoon barks when stuck (in a wall or hole) or in such a case where they cant find their baby raccoons.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-chittering">3. Chittering</h3>
<p>Chittering is a sound made by raccoons in context such as; when female calls the baby cubs, when communicating to other raccoons, or when baby raccoons come to meet their mother.
In addition, raccoon chitters when searching for food, in case they want to move about, or when they are playing happily in their resting place.
Since raccoons are very vocal during breeding times, you will hear chittering sound when they are mating or when calling their mate partners.</p>
<h3 id="4-hissing--growling">4. Hissing &amp; Growling</h3>
<p>Hissing and growling sound is made by raccoons only when they feel threatened, cornered, or trapped - it&rsquo;s usually a way of scaring the enemy.</p>
<ul>
<li>When hissing, raccoons tends to show their crawls and teeth as way of displaying their braveness.</li>
<li>Female mother raccoon can also growl or hiss when protecting her cubs/babies.
NB: Don&rsquo;t try to catch growling raccoon as it may attack you dangerously in revenge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-squealingscreamingscreechingsnarling">5. Squealing/Screaming/Screeching/Snarling</h3>
<p>Screeching, screaming, snarling, and squealing are violent sound made by raccoons when fighting.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="6-mewingcryingwhining">6. Mewing/Crying/Whining</h3>
<p>Mewing is common sound produced by baby raccoons in search for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, the cubs may cry when scared as well.
Whining sound is made by both baby and adult raccoons in as soothing mode or when they notice a new raccoon family encroaching into their territory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-sound-is-made-by-raccoon-movement">Which Sound is Made by Raccoon Movement?</h2>
<p>Raccoon movement may make either of the sound highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-dragging">1. Dragging</h3>
<p>Heavyweight raccoons (10-15 pounds) move slowly as they drag their feet along, especially on the rooftops.
The extra weight causes drag sound impacts on the floor or fixtures when a raccoon makes slight movement. Moreover, you will notice similar sound on the wall or inside a chimney as well.
In case you hear heavy thumping or loud sounds (footprint sound), especially in the beginning of the year when breeding is pronounced, it could be raccoons mating or looking for breeding ground in your home - most raccoon babies are born in summer (January to March).
However, such heavy mating sounds are usually accompanied by vocalizations and chittering.</p>
<h3 id="2-rustling">2. Rustling</h3>
<p>Rustling is a common sound made by raccoon when searching for food in garbage pits or bins while using their feet or mouthpart- raccoons push waste in the bins (using front feet/mouth) in order to get clearer view of available meal within, thus making rustling sound more audible in the process.
In addition, raccoons make rustling sound when tearing up wooden structures or brushing up their bodies against beams/walls in your attic.
When raccoon access book store (especially one with nylon papers), they make louder rustling sound.</p>
<h3 id="3-scratching">3. Scratching</h3>
<p>Scratch is a sharp sound made by raccoons with their craws when climbing walls, rooftops, chimney, or sliding on furniture.
Usually, the grip of the raccoon foot fails to hold onto the surface gently thus engaging the craws (to prevent fall), which cause scratching sound in the process.
Be keen when you detect similar sound in your cabinet, wardrobe, wall unit, or granary - that&rsquo;s a sign of raccoon invasion.
NB: Engage professional if you are new to raccoons in order to avoid any danger that may arise.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-raccoons-make-sounds">Why Do Raccoons Make Sounds?</h2>
<p>Usually, raccoons may make sound due to some of the reasons stated below:</p>
<h3 id="1-in-case-of-danger">1. In case of Danger</h3>
<p>When raccoons detect danger in the vicinity, they make deep loud scaring sound.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sound is meant to scare any oncoming enemy or mark their territory.
At times, raccoon may scream when
attacked while alone due to excess fear
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-when-communicating">2. When Communicating</h3>
<p>Raccoons make soft rhythmical sound when communicating with each other. It could be asking for food, or planning to team for battle, as well as organizing for their mating season.
You will notice intermittent sound pattern in the midst of darkness, when you pay keen attention - these are in most cases raccoons communication signals.</p>
<h3 id="3-when-fighting">3. When Fighting</h3>
<p>During war or battle, adult raccoon screech as a defensive mechanism or way of expressing pain.
On the other hand, baby raccoon will cry in case the battle breaks up in their family territory to alert other raccoons in the neighborhood.</p>
<h3 id="4-when-hungry---in-search-of-food">4. When Hungry - in search of food</h3>
<p>Raccoon snarl, squeals, or cry, especially baby raccoon, when hungry.</p>
<ul>
<li>The hunger sound is pronounced with extent to which the raccoon has stayed without food.
Though most adult raccoons are able to contend hunger sound on their own, baby raccoons will keep crying or squealing the whole night - perhaps hopping for a savior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-scare-other-raccoons">5. Scare other Raccoons</h3>
<p>Since raccoon live in family colonies, each raccoon family wants to protect its territory from other raccoon family in all manner.
In this case, they make scaring sound any time they detect invasion from other raccoon family in their habitation.</p>
<h3 id="6-when-stressed-or-suffering">6. When Stressed or Suffering</h3>
<p>When Stressed up or suffering, raccoons tend to bark more and in a continuous way.
Raccoon stresses could result from lack of food, continuous attack by enemies, or when they can&rsquo;t find their babies.</p>
<h3 id="7-when-playing">7. When Playing</h3>
<p>Playing is common with raccoon, especially after meals - they run after each other on the
rooftops or open fields
.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will hear quick sound steps or rolling sound at night when raccoons are playing.
For baby raccoons, the playing sound is accompanied by other vocalizations and screaming or chittering.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-alternative-ways-of-detecting-raccoons">What are Alternative Ways of Detecting Raccoons?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to consider alternative ways (apart from raccoon sounds) of detecting sounds highlighted below in order to attain full certainty.</p>
<h3 id="1-using-poop-or-droppings">1. Using Poop or Droppings</h3>
<p>Raccoon poop or droppings are usually elongated cylindrical solid substances that are piled up in one area (not scattered). The size of each fecal matter is about 3 to 6 inches long.
Raccoon droppings are pinky brown in color that rangers from light to dark brown. Moreover, fresh raccoon poop has strong unpleasant smell which can be detected a couple of feet away.
Usually, the fresh raccoon droppings are accompanied by urine (wet ground), which has slight smell. It&rsquo;s easier to locate raccoon poop since they have specific area in which they excrete - treat such places as &ldquo;family latrine&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-using-tracks---footprint-and-handprints">2. Using Tracks - Footprint and Handprints</h3>
<p>Raccoon tracks are found on surfaces along areas they use while searching food or breeding grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such surfaces could be soft sand, muddy ground, wet items, floors, or rooftops.
Usually, the raccoon footprints and handprints are left on surfaces along their path - you will notice paw marks, especially the fresh laid prints.
Also, you can identify raccoons by scratch marks on the wall surface, chimney interior, or roof surface - though such marks may be similar to that of cat, the depth is extra, while the width is extended.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-nocturnal-behavior-pattern">3. Nocturnal Behavior Pattern</h3>
<p>Unlike most wild animals, raccoons are more active at night than daytime.
You will find raccoon feeding at night or searching for food at such times. Further, raccoons mate in dark and nurse their babies similar times.
In case you notice such continuous activities at night in your home, there is high possibilities of having raccoon invasion.
