<p>Next, on the list is this JBL Live 100. The JBL Live 100 aluminum earbuds has the natural sound quality, an excellent build quality (fabric cable - tangle-free ), comfortable fit, and the one-button mic or remote - all for under $50.</p>
<p>JBL Live 100&rsquo;s natural sound is adequately balanced between treble and mid-range sound (balancing low &amp; high notes) to create some treble sound effects. While you have 3 varied silicone tips, they all have 8 mm drivers to give you enhanced and deep bass.
With the one-button mic or remote, you readily access the voice assistant, phone calls, and control your music - and hence you can go hands-free. Finally, the earbud comes with flat cables that do not experience tangling.
With its deep bass, this earbud will be great for listening to hip-hop, rock, and pop music.
I also loved its lightweight design and the overall aluminum housing - which is aesthetically amazing.
I noted that the earbuds fat low end made the rock music choruses to be highly meaty and lush. However, this JBL Live 100 lacks volume control, but for its price range, I love it.

<h3 id="heading-6"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EZYMF4/?tag=p-policy-20">**9. **<strong>Sennheiser Earphones - CX 300-II</strong></a></h3>
<p>If youre looking for a basshead earphone, then CX 300 II from Sennheiser will be a good choice. Its popularly known for its enhanced bass and excellent noise isolation capability.
Some earbuds wont give you the bass sound you want with some music genres. But CX 300 II performs greatly with all music genres.
The highs also tend to be very pleasant, allowing you to listen to the vocals without getting fatigued quickly. Thus, no matter how long you listen to music using these earbuds, you won&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable.
CX 300 II features silicon ear tips, which enhance the quality of sound and ensure your comfort. The package comes with three different-sized ear tips so that you can choose one that fits into your ear perfectly.
Sennheiser sticks to the asymmetrical cable which for some reason doesnt impress much. You might have to wrap it over your neck to keep the earcups from being pulled down.
In addition, the material and design of the cable make it vulnerable to twisting under certain conditions. But its long enough to use comfortably in any position.
Both new and popular brands are innovating each day to edge one another in the earphones industry. This puts users in a dilemma when searching for the best cheap earbuds.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bass-enhanced</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Ability to isolate noise</li>
<li>Great sound quality</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>

<li>No microphone</li>
<li>Cable tangles easily</li>

When you browse the internet for the best earbuds, youll be surprised by the myriad of products the market has to offer.
Perhaps sound quality is the most crucial factor to consider when searching for the best earbud. All audios and instruments should be heard clearly and in detail. The design of the earbud should also be able to eliminate any distortion before the sound reaches your ears.
You don&rsquo;t want to be inconvenienced by earbuds that keep coming out and allow sound interference. Ensure they come with different-sized ear tips so that you choose the one that fits comfortably in your ear canal. Not only does this eliminate constant adjustment, but it also isolates noise from the surrounding.</p>
<h3 id="2-microphone-and-easy-to-use">**2. Microphone and **<strong>Easy to Use</strong></h3>
<p>Most people listen to music from their smartphones. If you&rsquo;re using earbuds, then it&rsquo;ll be great if the device allows you to make calls hands-free.
Your earbuds should be easy to pair with your audio devices, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones. Ensure the Bluetooth connectivity it comes with allows quick and stable connections.
You might also consider earbuds that allow multiple pairing where you pair with more than one audio device simultaneously. The beauty of this is that you can shift from one device to another with less hassle.</p>
<h3 id="3-durability-and-water-resistant">**3. Durability and **<strong>Water-Resistant</strong></h3>
<p>Some people love working out or running while listening to music on their earbuds. Such earbuds are prone to damage. So, it&rsquo;s advisable to buy durable earbuds which won&rsquo;t break down quickly.
Earbuds can be damaged by water or sweat if they are not water-resistant. Therefore, ensure to get water-resistant earbuds so that they don&rsquo;t get damaged by sweat or by the sea in case you get caught up in the rain.
Battery Life -
Most people use their earbuds when outdoors, such as in the gym, walking, jogging, or in the library. So, it can be very inconvenient if your Bluetooth earbuds run out of power. However, you can avoid such inconveniences by getting an earbud that comes with a long-lasting battery.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Getting a quality best earbuds under 50 isn&rsquo;t an easy task. Without proper research, you might end up getting a low-quality product that does not give value for your money. A right earbud should have the right balance in performance, quality, and durability.
Most of the products I have reviewed are popular brands that have been tested for years and have proven to be the best. Maybe you need in-ear headphones to fight the solitude at home, work, subway, or gym.</p>

<p>Flanged Earplugs -
These flanged earplugs (high-fidelity earplugs) come with rims or lips in their cone shape to help build a strong sound seal in your ears canal.

They are essential for any audio monitoring - whether you&rsquo;re a hard-core sound technician, music producer, or mixer. In this post, I&rsquo;ve reviewed the best headphones for music production.</p>
<p>Summary: If you need a quick answer, I recommend either this

<h3 id="1-sennheiser-hd-650-open-back-headphone---1-pick">[1. Sennheiser HD 650 Open Back <a href="/posts/best-headphones-for-guitar-amps/">Headphone</a> - #1 Pick](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00018MSNI/?tag=p-policy-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00018MSNI/?tag=p-policy-20</a>)</h3>
<p>Sennheiser HD 650 has earned top fame for good reasons  it has premium neodymium magnets and acoustic silk (allows ultra-fine damping), relatively high clamping force (but comfortable).</p>
<p>Thus, HD 650 takes the top spot for Best Headphones for Music Production.�Considering the design, the Sennheiser HD 650 won&rsquo;t win a beauty contest.
However, it has a solidly built design that speaks to Sennheiser&rsquo;s excellent sense of material engineering. Most importantly, most of its parts are user-serviceable - thus, you can take them apart, clean, or replace them.
First, I like the Sennheiser HD 650&rsquo;s rich, powerful sound that has a great sense of authority  particularly in the bass. Also, the treble is smooth, but it&rsquo;s textured  but it&rsquo;s still well extended. This pair is great for intermediate to pro audio engineers. I feel that the HD 650 is even better for having a tighter sound and warmer tone - thus, the soundstage will come out a little more intimate and compressed.
Some music producers claim that the HD 650 is veiled or slow - but, I don&rsquo;t agree with this. It&rsquo;ll not scratch the inner of your eardrum with trebles like the AKG or Bayer dynamic DT 880.
Though, considering resolution and tightness, the HD 650 ranks up there with other premium headphones. It&rsquo;s apparent direct detail and resolution is lower since the treble seems to take a backseat in the sound mix. But, the HD 650 has superior technical capability.

<h3 id="2-beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-80-ohm-headphone---2-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016MNAAI/?tag=p-policy-20">2. Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO 80 Ohm Headphone - #2 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 80 has a legacy that spans over several decades. It&rsquo;s loved for use in recording studios by sound engineers and music producers.</p>
<p>Most audio engineers believe that the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 80 is superior to the ATH-M50x  and still have a lower price.
On sound quality, the DT 770 pro has excellent speed and widest soundstage  may be close to Sennheiser HD 598. On acceleration, the DT 770 pro has a quick frequency decay, fast attack, and fantastic detail rendering.
If you don&rsquo;t mind the low-end frequencies, you&rsquo;ll find the boosted bass great for electronic music production - with warm sound and an adequate boost to the low end.
I score these headphones highly for comfort  with its pillow and soft velour pads, which will have minimal pressure around your head and thus will work great for extended hours of music production. Despite not being highly portable, compared to smoothing like the ATH-M50x, the DT 770 Pro has a rugged aesthetic look.
It has a precise, extended and punchy Bass (I believe they are bass-light), but also profoundly relaxed. Its bass response is more on the frequencies of the sub-bass and not mid-bass.
Maybe you already know that the regular headphones require some mid-bass hump to produce acceptable bass  but the DT 770 Pro doesn&rsquo;t. To create a neutral and amazing studio-style sound w with its detailed highs, full sound stage, and deep natural bass.

<h3 id="3-audio-technica-ath-m50x-studio-headphones"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HVLUR86/?tag=p-policy-20">3. Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Studio Headphones</a></h3>
<p>Next up is the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (arguably the most popular studio headphone) theyre versatile, great for music production, traveling, and reference audio while filming.</p>
<p>It trails the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO for recording, audio monitoring, video editing, and traveling. Why so? They offer a tremendous balanced, rich sound with rich deep lows, balanced mids, and detailed highs.
Audio-Technica ATH-M50x has the &ldquo;V-shaped&rdquo; sound signature with some slightly accentuated the lows &amp; highs. Also, you&rsquo;ll not require an amp for the ATH-M50x (they even sound great on the phone), are profoundly portable (they flex and bend without cracking).
On the downside (well not literally), some producers claim that the headphones have a tight sound space  well, which I think is common in all closed back monitors. Luckily, they&rsquo;ll achieve excellent sound isolation when there are ambient sounds in the studio. It&rsquo;s over the ear type - and thus will fit around your ear and therefore cancels most of the background noise.
They rotate well. They&rsquo;re highly flexible and will lay amazingly flat  and thus, they&rsquo;ll go right into your bag as you move to your studio or traveling. Also, it&rsquo;s possible to rotate the headphone all the way around.
Thus, it&rsquo;s possible to hold a single cup and listen to anything, just like how the DJs do. Thus you can choose a card that matches your studio recording environment  may be at home, on the stereo, or when sitting on your chair.
I love Audio-Technica ATH-M50x&rsquo;s audio quality  they are not just loud, but its sound quality is crystal clear  eve compared to the wireless Sennheiser. It has a proprietary detachable cable  comes with three types of wires (short, coiled, and a long straight cord).

<h3 id="1-plantronics-backbeat-pro-2-wireless-headphones---1-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY4P9EZ/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2 Wireless Headphones - #1 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2 tops on sound quality (ambient noise isolation) at a slightly lower price compared to premium noise-canceling headphones such as the Bose QuietComfort 35.
With active noise canceling, the <a href="/posts/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-under-100/">headphone</a> will reduce ambient sounds to the lowest possible.
<a href="//www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY4P9EZ/?tag=p-policy-20"></a></p>
<p>Ergonomically, the headphones have ear cups that can fold flat for additional comfort. If youll be using Bluetooth devices (such as PC, tablet, smartphone) for connection, the Plantronics Pro 2 has 100 meters of wireless ranges.
Further, the headphone supports the low latency aptX-LL, and thus, with an appropriate transmitter dongle, you can seamlessly do gaming and watch movies.
It has to balance for mid-tones in its powerful speakers. Further, it has a protective case to ensure its durability even with falls or slight mishandling  including normal wear and tear.
The wireless freedom makes them proper for travelers, working-class people, and high-school students. Unique features, in addition to the relatively superior noise, are bass-rich sound, ergonomic controls, and excellent battery life that will guarantee clarity of vocals and instruments. It has a lighter design that will be easy to carry around.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful speakers</li>
<li>Bluetooth connectivity</li>
<li>Active noise canceling, light (compact and classic) design</li>

<p>The Cowin E8 Headphone is a classic headphone with easy controls, comfortable pads, and great build quality. I noted that its design-build felt a bit premium (with thicker and larger ear-cups) and durable, but its slightly tight and bulky, which makes it overhang from ones head.</p>
<p><a href="//www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY4P9EZ/?tag=p-policy-20"></a></p>
<p>Equally, like the Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC, this headphone has a quality microphone that will enable you to make the required calls - with the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-under-50/">cheap noise-canceling headphones</a>

Its mid-tones are excellent to create high voice clarity for watching podcasts, making phone calls, and listening to different audiobooks. Further, it has more significant drivers that produce more accurate and deeper bass tones.
Its aperture drivers (45mm) will give you a quiet and equally powerful sound. The headphone can attain a high of 100dB - they are great for bass-heavy and bass music.
It has magnetic absorption and a light cushion to improve your listening comfort and sound quality. Equally, the Bluetooth function allows you to receive or make calls wirelessly with buttons to lower or raise call volume.
Cowin E8 has all the required functions: noise cancellation button (on or off) volume controls, track-skipping, call, or music that are great for wireless noise-canceling.
Interestingly, they are usable with an audio cable but would equally function without. But its ear-cups will leave your ears warmers since theyre not suitably breathable compared to Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC that also has a closed-back design.
I would recommend Cowin E8 for office use and commuting. I consider that they are great for travel and commute. Further, they are comfortable for office use and will cancel most office ambient chatter.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wireless Bluetooth connectivity</li>
<li>Excellent soundstage</li>
<li>Lightweight and soft ear cushions</li>
<li>Built-in microphone</li>
<li>Active noise cancellation (ANC) offers excellent sound isolation.</li>

<a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010438.full">research showed</a>
that there was a reduced risk (in mice) of getting urinary bladder cancer after taking alkaline water.

<h2 id="alkaline-water-vs-plain-water">Alkaline Water vs. Plain Water</h2>
<p>Many people consider that plain water more suitable for their health as compared to drinking alkaline water. This is mainly because of fear that alkaline water would neutralize their&rsquo;s blood acid.
However, as noted above, moderate drinking of alkaline water will reduce the chances of getting heart disease, high blood pressure, or even cancer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s safe to drink alkaline water eat and every day as it has different health benefits, including reduces chances of getting high blood pressure, cancer, or diabetes.
