<p>Shallows burrows acts as refuge/quick hideouts during the day when they are attacked while in food hunting mission.</p>
<p>Deep burrows, which may be more complex, are used for nesting, hibernation and food store. These burrows may go to a depth of 3 feet and extend 30 feet horizontally. The underground housing is also dug with several escape routes.</p>
<p>Chipmunks use these underground homes as refuge during winter too. During this cold season, they feed on food stored in summer time. Chipmunks can also hibernate during winter  they do not do it for the entire time.</p>
<p>Some of the underground compartments are reinforced with grass or leaves to create warmth to both the parents and young ones during cold weather.</p>

<p>The Specific shelter for a given species of Chipmunk is determined by the environment in which they are located and proximity to the food source. You will find that Alpine Chipmunks dwell in forest and bushes while Hopi Chipmunk live in burrows dug in open field.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-chipmunks-live-in-a-burrow"><strong>How Many Chipmunks Live In A Burrow?</strong></h2>
<p>In a given underground shelter, you will find 1 to 50 Chipmunk or more. They breed and multiply thus increasing their population.</p>

<p>There are side pockets/hoards that may extend up to 2 feet. These are used to store food, collect empty shells or as a breeding ground. These are located slightly above the floor of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Two or more narrow channels are dug down way to help drain flooding water. Escape routes (two or more) are then extended further from the central chamber to exit Chipmunks in case of danger.</p>
<p>Chipmunks mainly dig burrows on the hard ground/soil (such as below the tree trunks, buildings/structures) to prevent them from collapsing or water leakage. In addition, they close most of escape routes and inlets to boost its internal security.</p>
