. The two ingredients are readily available and will have a bubbling reaction.
<em>Summary: It&rsquo;s a thumbs down for the�vinegar and baking soda in unclogging blocked drains and de-scaling pipes. A�recent experiment proves that the bubbling (Sodium Acetate + Water) can&rsquo;t de-clog your drain or remove the clogging gunk deep down the drain. So, I&rsquo;ll stick to�reliable drain cleaners.�</em>

<dt>When you add vinegar to Baking soda, youll create a bubbling mix. However, the bubbling is just producing Sodium Acetate + Water, which will not do a reliable deep cleaning.</dt>

<dt><strong>So, whats the best method</strong></dt>
<dd>Instead of using the mix of the two greening ingredients, use the
baking soda
like your scouring agent in cleaning bathrooms or the sinks. On the other hand, use vinegar for neutralizing any odor or like a scum busting.</dd>

<h2 id="avoid-vinegar-plus-baking-soda">Avoid Vinegar plus Baking Soda</h2>
<p>When used separately,
vinegar and baking soda are excellent home
cleaning agents. For example, vinegar acts to remove odor and disinfectant, while baking soda has great scrubbing power.
As noted above, even though e reaction will not get to the bottom of the drain clog, it cant clear it. I know that most DIY experts recommend the mixture but leave it at just that.
The effervescence will be lovely, and the resulting bubbles will run down the
drain pipes
.
I know most of you may believe the bubbles (from the white vinegar plus baking soda) will break down the clogs (hair, oils,
shampoo
, and grease), but all this does not get to the clogging gunk deep in the drain.
<strong>Alternatives  Boiled water, Dish Soap, Salt, Drain Snake�</strong>
However, if you still dont fancy using the recommended
drain cleaners
, you can use boiled water and mix it with some dish soap (it works in the drain with oil or grease buildup, such as kitchen sinks). Further, you can add salt to boiled

.
I recently covered how to

, just like its covered in this guide showing�why these alternative methods are effective.
However, youll need to remove the hair, oil, and grease clog balls by

for shower or bathtub clog.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The vinegar/ baking soda technique will not solve the grease buildups in your showers or kitchen sinks.
Notably, melting away the oil and grease would require both a surfactant and heat, which would allow the oil to flow out with the water.</p>
