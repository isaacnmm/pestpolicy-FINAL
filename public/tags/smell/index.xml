<p>These secretions have a long-lasting offensive effect and are what we are calling roach smells. The smell is distinguishable from any other scent.

<h2 id="where-does-this-smell-come-from"><strong>Where does this smell come from?�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-secretions"><strong>1. Secretions</strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever caught a roach and placed it on your hand? Did it have a smell? A single roach usually has no scent. Roaches produce odors when in large numbers.
Some species are notorious for causing smells even with one roach. For example, a single German cockroach can produce a stench strong enough to offend a person.
This stench is produced deliberately by these roaches as part of their daily routines. It is the smell you smell when your place has an infestation. Even after dealing with menace, the smell stays on for a little longer.</p>
<h3 id="2-stench-of-death"><strong>2. Stench of death�</strong></h3>
<p>This is the stench produced by the decomposing bodies of dead cockroaches. Study shows that insects have a stench upon death. This stench is due to Oleic acid, which is produced by dead bodies.
Also, when roaches find a comfortable place for living and breeding, they release a pheromone. Pheromones are communication devices between roaches. They are normal secretions by roaches from their glands.
These pheromones are used to let other cockroaches know of the new habitat. The disgusting smell you notice is actually communication with other roaches.</p>
<h3 id="4-predators-and-sexy-scent"><strong>4. Predators and Sexy Scent</strong></h3>
<p>Male roaches produce odors from their stink glands that help in keeping predators away. This way, they can avoid any impending danger.
During the mating season, female roaches produce smells. Those smells are to attract swarms of male cockroaches for mating.</p>
<h3 id="5-roach-waste"><strong>5. Roach waste</strong></h3>
<p>Due to the nature of roaches nests (dark and wet), their feces quickly accumulate and, in turn, produce a smell. The waste attracts moisture, and you will be subjected to decomposing feces.
So the smell you might be smelling most probably is some roach waste. The above are the reasons why roaches smell in that disgusting, unpleasant odor.</p>
