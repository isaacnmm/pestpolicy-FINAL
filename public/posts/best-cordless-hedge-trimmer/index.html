You need to go for an on a fixed pole or a telescopic hedge trimmer to assist you with high hedges with you going for a ladder. You fix hedge trimmers on an adjustable pole, making it easy for you to reach the highest point.
<strong>4. Choosing the gap between the teeth</strong>
The blades come in different sizes and differences between teeth. The gap between the teeth determines the diameter of the twig size you will cut. Below are different teeth setting for different plants sizes:</li>
<li>12-16 mm for young plants</li>
<li>20-25 mm for normal plats</li>
<li>26-36 mm overgrown weed
Now you can estimate the size of trimmer that will work well with your large twigs. You will require a trimmer that can get adjusted to fit overgrown weeds.
<strong>5. Grip and weight</strong>
During the trimming process, you hold the trimmer in two hands. One hand gets placed on the trigger handle and the other on the shield handle.
The shield handle prevents personal accident during the trimming process. For comfort and efficiency, go for a hedge trimmer with a wraparound handle. Most wraparound handles are very comfortable to use due to their rotation.
<strong>6. Blade tip protector</strong>
Your trimmer&rsquo;s blade needs to have a protector. The protector keeps you safe from personal accidents like the trimmer falling on your toes.
The protector also offers protection from adverse weather conditions that can cause rust. The trimmer protector ensures the trimmer is in perfect condition while being stored.
It&rsquo;s always crucial for you to adequately research the availability of spares in case some parts needed replacement. The good thing is that modern trimmers&rsquo; parts are readily available online in sites like amazon.</li>
