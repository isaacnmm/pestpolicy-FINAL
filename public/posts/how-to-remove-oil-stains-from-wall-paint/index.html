<p><em>Here&rsquo;s how to remove oil stains from wall paint; use Baking Soda, White vinegar, Ammonia, WD 40, or TSP (Trisodium Phosphate) (these products won&rsquo;t bleach or damage the painted surfaces).�</em>
*These compounds feature a unique chemical formula that breaks down the oil stains molecules (wet or dry paint) into a thick viscous fluid that is easier to clean. *
<em>You will be able to eliminate oil stains from various surfaces/fabrics in a couple of minutes provided the right procedure, and precautions are taken into considerations.�</em>

<p><em>Notably, you need to identify the type of wall paint applied at the background to better select stain remover. However, if you experience conflictive challenges, carry out a drop test experiment to ascertain a particular oil stain remover.</em></p>
<h3 id="a-baking-soda">a. Baking Soda<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-baking-soda">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prepare four tablespoons of baking soda and mix with 2 cups of warm water. Stir appropriately and rub the solution over the oil stains gently using a piece of clean cloth or sponge.
The compound reacts with oil stain breaking it into a thin fluid that dissolves in water. The baking soda solution wont affect the wall paint during application. However, you must be keen not to apply an excess abrasive force that may affect the primary paint layer during oil stain removal.

<h3 id="b-white-vinegar">b. White vinegar<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#b-white-vinegar">¶</a></h3>
<p>White vinegar
is composed of acetic acid (3% to 5%) and water (90% to 99%) plus other additives that improve flavor. The acidity part of white vinegar breaks down the oil stain to form a thin viscous fluid on the surface.
White vinegar wont affect the wall paint since the active agents arent strong to penetrate the paint molecular bonds. Besides, the water component is excited to help in the quick oil stain removal process.
You will need to add three tablespoons of white vinegar in 3 liters of warm water (to dilute the solvent). Then, use the sponge to wipe off the oil stain on the wall pain.
Remember, you should allow a few minutes (after application) for the white vinegar to act if the oil stain is dried or thick.</p>
<h3 id="c-ammonia">c. Ammonia<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#c-ammonia">¶</a></h3>
<p>Select/purchase general-purpose ammonia (not highly concentrated) for oil stains removal. Mix one cup with 3 cups of warm water (1:3 ratio). Stir evenly for one minute.
Using a piece of cloth, soak it in the solution and gently wipe the oil stains. Dried oil stains should be allowed to quench for 2 minutes before you wipe off. The ammonium solution decomposes the oil stains leaving behind a clean surface.
NB: Wear hand gloves (hand protection) and nose mask (smelly) during application.</p>
<h3 id="d-wd-40"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071QZCJF5/?tag=p-policy-20">d. WD 40</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#d-wd-40">¶</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-wd-40-remove-paint/">WD 40</a>
is a commercially made oil stain removal that features strong, active agents, which decomposes oil stains (dry or wet) in a couple of seconds upon application. The solvent features an organic-based structure specially formulated to break down oil stain molecular bonds without affecting the wall paint layer.
The classic trigger and point design that comes with WD 40 allows optional delivery and point application, thus minimizing spillage (wastage). Moreover, WD is portable and fast drying.
The solvent integrates biodegradable properties and natural additives that are safe for human use  wont cause skin irritation/burn.
Importantly,

can also be used on other types of stains such as vegetable stains, coffee stains, ink stains, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e-tsp-trisodium-phosphate">e. TSP (Trisodium Phosphate)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#e-tsp-trisodium-phosphate">¶</a></h3>
<p>Trisodium Phosphate is a reliable oil stain cleaner that works by disintegrating the oil stain molecular bonds to form a thick viscous liquid (stick-free) on the painted surface without affecting the wall paint.
The concentration should be low if used on wooden surfaces to prevent bleaching of primary material when left for a long time before cleaning.
Add  cup of Trisodium Phosphate into 4 cups of water and stir evenly for one minute. Scrub the solution over the oil-stained area using a sponge gently.
Consider wearing gloves to avoid skin irritation associated with Trisodium Phosphate. See Also:

<li>Wear hand gloves when applying ammonium solution, Trisodium Phosphate, baking soda, and white vinegar  these oil stain remover irritates the skin on contact or causes a burning sensation. Though the effect may be mild, prolonged usage burns the melanin.</li>
<li>Store these products away from pets and children. When swallowed, they cause stomach upset, vomiting, burn, and may lead to death if not attended in 24 hours.</li>
<li>Dispose remained solution after cleaning oil stains  you can drain them in a sink or waste pit.
The procedure of each of the above oil stain removers may vary slightly. However, there are basic steps that must be followed, �and which apply to either of them. These include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Blow dirt over the stained area to improve oil stain removers action time  avoid touching the stain or pre-wiping the stained area before application. Such actions lead to the spread of oil stains in other areas instead.</li>
<li>Carry out the stained areas drop experiment to ascertain whether the compound you are about to use with work effectively without affecting the wall paint coating or primary surface material.</li>
<li>Consider applying a large amount over dry stain than wet oil stain during application  allow quenching time too.</li>
<li>Soak the sponge/piece of cloth evenly in stain removal solvent (for liquid oil stain removers) and rinse gently. You can squeeze the sponge over the stained area to cover the stained area entirely before wiping.</li>
<li>Scrub/rub the cured oil stain with wet sponge/piece of cloth gently  avoid excess abrasive force as it may affect the wall paint grain and primary surface material.</li>
<li>Finally, clean the stained oil area with soapy detergent (eliminates remains of oil stain remover). Wipe the area with a clean cloth to dry the surface.
You can use this procedure even when cleaning oil stains with commercial stain removers too. See Also:
