      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below I answer this question - do geckos eat bed bugs or what can you use to exterminate the bugs. So, will lizards help exterminate the bed bugs?
<em>In summary, do lizards eat bed bugs? Yes, lizards (particularly geckos or house lizards) will kill bed bugs - but won&rsquo;t be an effective pest control remedy.�</em>
<em>However, Bed bugs are fast reproducers and hence lizards won&rsquo;t keep up to feed on the bugs with their quick multiplication just�like with other house pests.�</em>

<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs">Details: Do Geckos Eat Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Some Lizards like the <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-roaches/">Gecko</a> will <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> bugs including bed bugs - great bed bugs extermination. The pest extermination methods to use on bed bugs will reduce the sucking of human blood.
Bed bugs (Cimex hemipterus or Cimex lectularius) will invade your clothing and mattresses - these will cause bites. You may result in skin-related issues, blisters, and rashes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs have an average body length of about 1 to 7 mm - and hence they&rsquo;re visible - they&rsquo;ll also jump onto household items, pets, and clothing.</li>
<li>If there bed bugs (pests) around your house - maintain great hygiene - including in the urban area.
But can multiple lizards exterminate the bed bugs? Well, yes, lizards and geckos will feed on lizards but may also leave mess and droppings.

<h2 id="any-dangers-feeding-bed-bugs-to-geckos">Any Dangers Feeding Bed Bugs to Geckos?</h2>
<p>For any lizards that are allowed to fend for themselves around your house, as a pest control measure, you won&rsquo;t experience any problems - but not when
adopted as a pet
.
Therefore, feeding the lizards with bed bugs (that are brought from elsewhere) may not be a great idea since bed bugs are known to hold organisms causing bacterial infections.</p>
<h2 id="issues-with-using-geckos-to-control-bed-bugs">Issues with Using Geckos to Control Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>So, if any homeowner considers employing geckos of house lizards to eat bed bugs, they must be prepared to control different issues related to that.</p>
<h3 id="1-gecko-feces">1. Gecko Feces</h3>
<p>Involving house geckos to control bed bugs will lead to different issues with undesirable effects including leaving feces on different surfaces.
The lizard droppings will be concealed in hard-to-find or dark places - near or around the kitchen cupboard that won&rsquo;t be moved regularly.
The feces may be hidden in areas that are hard to notice - and you&rsquo;ll notice this issue when you see flies swarming in some specific dark or partially hidden places.</p>
<h3 id="2-damaging-household-devices">2. Damaging household devices</h3>
<p>Further, the geckos may equally cause damage to your household devices including electronics.
This may cause losses in terms of malfunctioning devices - due to electrocuted lizards.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-pests-to-feed-to-your-geckos">Alternative Pests To feed to your Geckos?</h2>
<p>Some homeowners believe that any uninvited insect must be exterminated using chemical methods - but to control the
intruder
, you can use different creepy-crawlies.</p>
<h3 id="1-mosquitoes">1. Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>There are alternative pests that you may feed to your lizards - house lizards won&rsquo;t only feed on bed bugs but will also attack the small pests running around your house and
yard
.
Lizards are largely diurnal, and they won&rsquo;t eat numerous mosquitoes, but will opportunist capturing of the pests. But toads and frogs crepuscular &amp; nocturnal) eat more mosquitoes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLBtiyLAgAU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLBtiyLAgAU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
Lizards love mosquito diets - they&rsquo;ll simply stick out their sticky tongue and feed on the bugs. But lizards may not be welcome in homes that have small rodents,
cats
, and dogs.
Therefore, for houses that have pets, you&rsquo;ll require to acquire the services of some expert exterminators for the
control of the mosquitos
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, lizards (many amphibians) tend to be very creepy particularly in the house basement. Lizards may also bring diseases - they love damp and warm environments.
Therefore, to help control mosquitoes, you may avoid killing the lizards you notice around your home, pantry, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-mice-and-rats">2. Mice and Rats</h3>
<p>Mice and rats will create a great food source for geckos in your spaces - even in the rented spaces - but they&rsquo;ll mainly eat the young ones and rat litter.
Geckos will efficiently predate on mice and rats - geckos mainly hide in dark areas - and they&rsquo;ll feed on the pinkies - young rats particularly while their mother rat is away.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqMRsTMiwI&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqMRsTMiwI&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
You&rsquo;ll find the lizards hanging around dark places - locations where you also get mice and rats and their younglings. Thus lizards get to snack on the pests and their�pinkies.</p>
<h3 id="2cockroaches">2.�Cockroaches</h3>
<p>So, will geckos feed on cockroaches? Well, yes geckos and house lizards will also eat roaches and their larva. But they occupy different places - roaches love places near the ground.
On the other hand, geckos occupy spaces that are higher above the ground - they love dark, damp, and equally cool places. But house lizards will occupy dark places - also loved by cockroaches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-cockroaches/">Animals that Eat Cockroaches</a>
Centipedes will feed on house lizards - the bug&rsquo;s wriggly motion will attract lizards that snatch them fast. You&rsquo;ll get the centipedes around the house on wood beams and other wooden fixtures.
Lizards will also feed on termite swarmers that move in colonies - they have wings and hence will fly as swarmers.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="will-housegeckos-eat-bed-bugs-in-captivity">Will House<strong>Geckos Eat Bed Bugs in captivity?�</strong></h2>
<p>So, will house geckos feed on bed bugs while they&rsquo;re in captivity? Well, yes, geckos (even when in captivity) will munch different pests including bed bugs, cockroaches, silkworms, or waxworms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, while the geckos are in captivity you&rsquo;ll need to provide additional food and meal supplementation like vitamins.</li>
<li>But ensure to check the size of the pests and insects you&rsquo;re giving to the geckos to avoid choking - they must measure a maximum of the distance between the gecko&rsquo;s eyes.
In addition, live crickets must not be allowed into the
gecko&rsquo;s enclosure space
since they actually nibble and bite on your humble pests.
On gecko thirst for water, mist water in the pest&rsquo;s enclosure. So, don&rsquo;t pour water simply into some dish since the geckos will quench from water droplets on leaves and tree branches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question &ldquo;do geckos eat bed bugs&rdquo;, Yes, geckos will feed on bed bugs but they may also bring salmonella and also leave damaged devices and drop feces.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reptiles such as Geckos could even be more sensitive when it comes to appropriate feed matching. Should you give your <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs/">gecko</a> meat, insects, or vegetables? Which food is healthy for geckos?</p>
<ul>
<li>**Well, do Geckos <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-roaches/">eat</a> cockroaches? Yes! Geckos are naturally insectivorous pets and would feed on cockroaches as much as they can. I****t would not be advisable to feed your geckos with cockroaches that are fetched directly from the field as they may be contaminated, poisonous, or venomous. **</li>
<li><strong>Usually, you should be able to identify the right cockroach species, especially ones recommended by the vet, when feeding your geckos.</strong>
Alternatively, you can buy commercial roaches from the nearest center or breed some at your home place. Geckos have no feeding limit, they can overheat if not controlled.

<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-cockroaches">Details: Do Geckos Eat Cockroaches?</h2>
<p>Geckos are typically insectivorous, they feed on insects for food. Cockroaches are common insects that are mainly proteinous in nature and guarantee nutritious/whole meals for your geckos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike human beings, gecko hunt captures and swallows the cockroach without chewing.</li>
<li>However, for baby geckos, they usually feed on small cockroaches (between 1 to 4 inch long).
Contrary, adult geckos can eat large cockroaches without any challenges. Cockroaches contain protein, fat, fluid, and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, copper, and potassium.
Upon feeding, your geckos acquire dense protein nutrients necessary for bodybuilding - building up body tissues, muscles, and replacing worn-out cells. Further, minerals such as calcium and iron will strengthen your pets&rsquo; bones - enabling them to carry their body weight.</li>
<li>Cockroach fat is a great source of energy for your geckos. However, too much of it may lead to obesity if the feeding is not monitored.</li>
<li>The cockroach wings have a strong network that acts as roughages, thus when eaten would prevent your geckos from constipation.
Commonly, geckos can be used as a biological insects control in your home place. However, this would not be good practice and geckos should not be fed on directly caught cockroaches for these reasons:</li>
<li>Open field cockroaches may have germs</li>
<li>Cockroaches may be contaminated or poisonous (consult your vet for the right cockroach species)</li>
<li>The cockroach may have pesticides, which are dangerous to your geckos</li>
<li>Roaches may have poisonous bacteria or virus
It&rsquo;s therefore always necessary to pre-treat your cockroaches (those caught from open fields) before feeding them to your geckos.
In addition, you need to supplement cockroaches with enough water when feeding to avoid choking or constipation, which is very common - this can kill your geckos very fast.
Commercially purchased cockroaches (from a vet or certified outlets) are highly recommended since they are less prone to health problems - they have no or limited health risk to your geckos.
Alternatively, you can breed cockroaches at your home place for geckos - this limits chances of contamination.

<h2 id="what-is-alternative-food-for-geckos">What is Alternative Food for Geckos?</h2>
<p>Apart from cockroaches, you can feed your geckos with the following meals;</p>
<h3 id="1-mealworms">1. Mealworms</h3>
<p>Live mealworms are known to provide a great source of fat (13%), protein (20.4%), moisture (62%), and fiber, which is about 2%.
When dried, mealworms offer 53% protein, 6% fiber, and 28% fat for your geckos. When feeding your geckos with dried mealworms, it&rsquo;s advisable to supplement them with water to avoid choking.
Though slightly expensive, mealworms provide a great source of energy for your geckos.
However, too many mealworms (daily feeding) will cause obesity (to your geckos) if not monitored. Breeding mealworms in your home is highly recommendable in order to lower the overall feeding cost.</p>
<h3 id="2-crickets">2. Crickets</h3>
<p>Crickets are a major source of meals for geckos in most places as they offer a great source of fat, necessary for energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, crickets have minerals such as zinc, potassium, copper, iron, magnesium, biotin, folate, and pantothenic acid.
Also, crickets are preferentially loved by geckos due to their taste and guarantee unmatched satisfaction to your pets - no health complications.
Further, crickets are rich in vitamins such as vitamin A, B, C, K, D, and E for geckos&rsquo; protection against diseases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-flies">3. Flies</h3>
<p>Geckos hunt for house flies largely in the house to substitute other insects such as mosquitoes - house flies are a great source of protein and fat, especially at the larva stage</p>
<ul>
<li>Flies such as fruit flies are highly recommended due to their superior nutritional value in iron, magnesium, and calcium.
Moreover, fruit flies can also be purchased locally or bred at your home easily - just leave decomposition fruits hanging in your geckos&rsquo; house for a week or so (fruit flies will just come and multiply).

</ul>
<h3 id="4-superworms-and-waxworms">4. Superworms and Waxworms</h3>
<p>Superworms are rich in vitamin c (191mg/kg) and riboflavin. More so, super worms have dense protein nutrients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Waxworms are best known for moisture addition (58%), fat, and proteinous nutrients.</li>
<li>Furthermore, waxworms have great calcium(243mg/kg) and phosphorus (1960mg/kg) mineral contents.
NB: When feeding your geckos with any of these meals, it&rsquo;s advisable to control feeds in order to avoid challenges associated with overeating - obesity, inactivity, intestinal problems, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-much-do-geckos-eat">How Much do Geckos Eat?</h2>
<p>Generally, we may not ascertain exactly how much you feed your geckos due to varying sizes and climatic conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, we can always come to a common ground that your geckos should feed until their bellies/stomachs become flat.</li>
<li>Otherwise, beyond that point, your geckos will be overfeeding, which is risky for their health.
When feeding your geckos, it&rsquo;s at this point you monitor how much they have eaten before their tummy/stomach got flat and then settle for that quantity as a control point.
Basically, we usually recommended that you give your geckos feeds for 10 to 15 minutes on average for two to three times a day at most. Ensure water is always available at geckos&rsquo; house.
Baby geckos should be fed regularly than adult geckos since their metabolism is high due to cell division</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-overfeed-your-geckos">What Happens When You Overfeed your Geckos?</h2>
<p>Overfed geckos have the following problems:</p>
<h3 id="a-overweightobsess">a. Overweight/Obsess</h3>
<p>Geckos continuously gain weight, especially if fed with fatty food like mealworms often. The extra weight makes it impossible for geckos to move about.</p>
<h3 id="b-intestinal-problems">b. Intestinal Problems</h3>
<p>Your geckos will not be able to carry out normal digestion due to blockage of the alimentary canal.
This will affect the process of opening bowels as well. Further, you will notice that your geckos are either having diarrhea or constipation.</p>
<h3 id="c-inactivity">c. Inactivity</h3>
<p>Your geckos become inactive when they overeat- they fail to walk about like others or exercise.
This condition is attributed to the fact that the extra weight becomes a burden to your gecko - it avoids dragging along.

<h3 id="d-death">d. Death</h3>
<p>Overfeeding may result in the death of your geckos due to long-term inactivity.
If the obesity is not attended to in time, your geckos will suffer from skeleton/bones deformation, and destruction of internal tissues, which lead to death eventually.</p>
<h2 id="what-shouldnt-you-feed-your-geckos">What Shouldn&rsquo;t you Feed Your Geckos?</h2>
<p>The following food should never be fed to your geckos:</p>
<h3 id="1-vegetables">1. Vegetables</h3>
<p>As highlighted earlier in this article, geckos are insectivorous reptiles and should therefore be fed on nutritious insects only.
Vegetables are not a meal for geckos - in fact, geckos won&rsquo;t even eat vegetables whatsoever - unless mixed with insects, which is not the right thing to do.</p>
<h3 id="2-fireflies-or-lightning-bugs">2. Fireflies or Lightning Bugs</h3>
<p>Fireflies or Lightning Bugs are dangerous and poisonous insects that lead to death in a couple of minutes when swallowed (by geckos).
Actually, the toxic chemical in fireflies (lucibufagins) paralyzes geckos before death occurs.</p>
<h3 id="3-fruits">3. Fruits</h3>
<p>Avoid feeding your geckos with any type of fruits whatsoever.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though some geckos may attempt to feed on fruits such as berries, grapes, and melons, most geckos won&rsquo;t eat them at all.
Fruits such ad starfruit, rhubarb, and avocado are dangerous for your geckos and may cause serious health conditions.

</ul>
<h2 id="why-are-my-geckos-not-eating">Why are My Geckos not Eating?</h2>
<p>Your geckos may fail to eat due to either of the following reasons:</p>
<h3 id="a-sickness">a. Sickness</h3>
<p>When sick, geckos lose appetite for food, thus refusing to eat. In such a case, you will need to contact your vet to assess the matter immediately.</p>
<h3 id="b-cold-weatherenvironment">b. Cold Weather/Environment</h3>
<p>Geckos are cold-blooded animals/reptiles - their body temperature is not able to vary with changes in the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>When placed in a very cold place, geckos tend to be very inactive and won&rsquo;t even eat as well.</li>
<li>Most geckos seem to be hibernating during cold weather and thus fail to eat in the process.
Consider relocating your geckos to a warmer place and observing eating trends.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-too-much-fecal-matter">c. Too Much Fecal Matter</h3>
<p>If you place a meal on feces, be sure that your geckos won&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<ul>
<li>The smell irritates geckos, thus making them hate the meal eventually.</li>
<li>Soiled beddings should be cleared and dried regularly before any meal is given.
Further, you should geckos&rsquo; feed in a basin and not pour food directly onto the floor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-vision-impairment">d. Vision Impairment</h3>
<p>If you place food and your geckos are not eating, there is a high possibility of Vision Impairment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try changing the food location and assess if geckos would locate the meal.
Your geckos may have eye problems such as retrobulbar or corneal - consult a veterinarian for treatment soonest if you notice such a problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e-injuries">e. Injuries</h3>
<p>Any injury on your gecko instills severe pain, which may make it lose appetite.
Actually, bleeding sores and open wounds need to be dressed as soon as they are noticed in order to avoid further damages to their skin.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on the question, do Geckos eat cockroaches? The simple answer is yes. Geckos are insectivorous reptiles, which acquire nutrition from insects such as roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike human beings, geckos swallow entire cockroaches upon hunting.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that geckos have no feeding limit.
Therefore, they can overheat (as long as the food is available), which may cause problems such as obesity with time. A controlled feeding program should be followed in order to avoid such health challenges.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been disturbed by colonies of roaches in your place and wonder which animal can eliminate them naturally? You may even be compelled to find out if some of your pets can eat cockroaches.</p>
<p>Do you own a pet <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs/">Gecko</a> (house lizard) or have you spotted one in your house, yard or zoo? Well, in this article, we shall delve into close predation of gecko on roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>**So, Do Geckos <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a> Roaches? The direct answer is YES. Geckos hunt and eat roaches in your home, yard, or zoo. **</li>
<li><strong>But, it&rsquo;s not advisable to feed your Geckos on cockroaches from your house or caught outside in the fields since these roaches contain bacterial infections, parasites, and germs, which may affect their health adversely.</strong>
<strong>�Geckos will eat any species of roaches (unselective) though they prefer eating Dubia roaches. They also hunt and eat mosquitoes, ants, rats/mice, swarmers, crickets, locusts, and centipedes in your place.</strong>
Lets get into the details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-roaches">Details: Do Geckos Eat Roaches?</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-do-geckos-eat-roaches">1.� How do Geckos Eat Roaches?</h3>
<p>Geckos hunt and eat roaches as one of their main meals. When hunting, Gecko approaches the roach or a colony of roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, it focuses on a specific cockroach after which it shoots its head and captures it with the mouth (its rear legs give it ample momentum to reach its prey on time).</li>
<li>A Gecko would slowly turn the captured roach with its mouth to ensure that the roachs head is inside the mouth fully  this helps in fasten suffocation process, which is one of the ways Gecko uses to kill the roach.
The Gecko will then try to push the roach further (using its tongue) into its mouth. It will take 1 to 3 minutes for Gecko to swallow whole one roach.</li>
<li>Alternatively, some species of Gecko such as Leopard Gecko prefer to cut (using its teeth) the roachs head first and feed on the body later.</li>
<li>When eating roaches, Gecko does not use its legs to hold on roach for better grip like cats do  gecko uses its mouth entirely for grasping and holding roach into place.
Once Gecko eats a roach, it pauses for 1 to 3 minutes before eating another one  this helps it recover hunting energy and breathe enough air, which it uses to suck in roach when swallowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Geckos will rarely eat a roach from the abdomen  they always eat it from the head. In addition, Geckos eat every part of a roach including the wings.</p>
<h3 id="2-species-of-roaches-that-geckos-eat">2. Species of Roaches That Geckos Eat.</h3>
<p>Geckos do not select when hunting roaches for food. However, research shows that, in a colony of roach species, Geckos tend to feed on Dubia roaches more and often than other species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study has revealed that Dubia roaches have tasty components and a higher level of calcium than other roaches  something that attracts Geckos to prey on them preferentially.</li>
<li>Also, Dubia roaches lack wings (female Dubia roaches) thus making it easier for Gecko to swallow them whole.
Though American roaches, German roaches, and Oriental roaches are the most common at-home are highly likely to be preyed on by Geckos, they post-feeding challenges to them.</li>
<li>They have scary legs and long wings that make swallowing problematic.
Moreover, these roaches cause health problems to Geckos when eaten thus becoming less popular and prioritized food species.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-how-many-roaches-can-gecko-eat">3. How Many Roaches Can Gecko Eat?</h3>
<p>An adult Gecko can eat 2 to 6 (maximum) roaches in a given meal. Some Geckos will feed on two roaches at a time and eat a total of seven roaches in a given day.</p>
<p>However, the number of roaches eaten by Gecko per day may change slightly according to the size of the roach being eaten  Geckos eat smaller roaches than bigger ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Young/baby Gecko can/will eat 2 to 4 roaches in a meal on a given day. Normally, most Geckos feed for 10 to 17 minutes  this time is enough for them to have eaten to their satisfaction.</li>
<li>If you have a pet gecko, it is important to feed it just enough (overfeeding will make your gecko inactive).
Baby geckos should eat a few roaches 2 to 3 times in a given day. (It is not advisable to feed your pet geckos daily  alternate or skip some days).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-are-roaches-bad-to-gecko-when-eaten">4. Are Roaches bad to Gecko when Eaten?</h3>
<p>Though most geckos feed on any roaches around your place (unselective), most roaches found in homes (e.g. American roaches, German roaches, and Oriental roaches) cause health problems to geckos when eaten.</p>
<ul>
<li>They carry parasites, germs, and bacteria in them that cause infections and sickness to your Geckos.</li>
<li>The Salmonella bacteria found on/under the wings of these roaches cause scary and infectious skin on your Geckos.
Parasites such as Trichuris (11.97%), Eimeria (2.73%), Capillaria (6.16%), Toxocara (4.86%), Hook Worm (4.86%), and Ascaris (33.76%) were found both on external and internal parts of roaches after close lab examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Germs from pesticides or control chemicals that may be sprayed in your house or out in fields easily stick on the wings and body of roaches  this will find their way into the gecko digestive tract when eaten thus affecting its health.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-can-your-house-gecko-eat">What Else Can Your House Gecko Eat?</h2>
<p>A Gecko eats mosquitoes in your house or yard by extending its tongue out for the mosquitoes to land and get stuck. A Gecko can also shoot out its tongue out to catch a flying mosquito.</p>
<h3 id="1-ratsmice"><strong>1. Rats/mice.</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from roaches, geckos also hunt and eat rats and mice in your house or compound.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gecko may not kill big rats or mice; however, it feeds on baby rats/mice at their nest.
Geckos help a lot in controlling these organisms. However, the feeding rate is low  you need another alternative control method too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-crickets-and-locusts"><strong>2. Crickets and locusts.</strong></h3>
<p>Field geckos hunt crickets and locusts more than the roaches. Study shows that crickets have a high nutrition value (protein).</p>
<p>The Geckos hunts crickets in their hideouts (holes) by use of their mouth or sticky tongue.</p>
<p>Geckos catch centipedes along the wooden structures in your house or yard using their mouth and swallow them whole.</p>
<p>Swarmer produced by termite colonies in your house or fields is often eaten by geckos. Gecko uses its tongue to stick swarmers and swallow them whole.
<strong>3. Worm substrates e.g. mealworms</strong>
.</p>
<p>You can feed your pet gecko with some of the locally bred organisms such as hornworms, mealworms, silkworms, and super worms.</p>
<ul>
<li>These organisms have a high level of fat that is dangerous for geckos in excess (causes geckos to fatten faster thus leading to walking problems).
Such meals should be fed in fewer quantities and be supplemented often with vet-approved roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-you-avoid-giving-your-gecko">What Should You Avoid Giving Your Gecko?</h2>
<p><strong>1. Vegetables and Fruits</strong>
.</p>
<p>Geckos are insectivorous reptiles. They should not be fed on fruits, vegetables, or any plant extracts/substances.</p>
<p>This causes stomach upset in them though most of the geckos wont feed on such substrates.
<strong>2. High-level fatty insects (Mealworms).</strong>
It is risky to feed your pet Geckos on large quantities of mealworms, hornworms, silkworms, or any high-level fatty insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat from these organisms is stored (not digested) in the adipose tissues (skin layer/beneath the skin) at the tail and stomach regions.</li>
<li>The fattened Gecko becomes docile/inactive and unable to walk normally  this may lead to death with time.
Highly fatty feeds should be fed to your pet gecko once or twice a week and also in less quantity. Supplement insects such as roaches and crickets should accompany the highly fatty gecko feeds.
<strong>3. Ants and Mosquitoes</strong>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid feeding your pet gecko with ants or mosquitoes. Although geckos eat them, these insects cause though and stomach irritation, which may even call for veterinary attention.
<strong>4. Scorpions and termites.</strong>
Scorpions, termites, and safari ants are risky meals for your pet gecko since they attack, bite and instill injuries on its mouth and skin.</p>
<p>Though at times Geckos are able to overcome and eat them, it is advisable not to offer them as food to geckos.
<strong>5. Light insects.</strong>
No insects that produce light (fireflies) should be fed to geckos. They contain toxic chemicals that will harm your pet Gecko.</p>
<p>It is highly recommendable to seek your vet advisory for various types of commercial gecko feeds available to ensure that you always offer the right diet and quantity to your pet geckos at the right time (proper feeding time).</p>
<p>You can also visit gecko feed retailers at the local center/distributors around you.</p>
<p>NB:
<em>Ensure that all your gecko commercial feeds are vet-approved.</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The gecko is an insectivorous reptile that feeds on roaches as one of its meals.</p>
<ul>
<li>They hunt and capture these insects with their mouth before swallowing them whole or slicing them into pieces and then swallowing.</li>
<li>It is not advisable to feed your gecko with roaches in your house or caught from the fields since they usually have germs, bacteria, and harbor infectious parasites.
Gecko can also feed on crickets, ants, locusts, rats, swarmers, and centipedes.</li>

<h2 id="details-is-wall-gecko-poisonous-if-eaten">Details: Is Wall Gecko Poisonous If Eaten?</h2>
<p>The Wall Gecko is safe and edible reptile that does not cause any harm to human beings when eaten. Their meat does not have toxins and can also be eaten by other carnivores without causing any food poisoning.</p>
<p>However, the mouth-part and skin of wall Gecko house the salmonella bacteria and pathogens that may cause food poisoning when eaten.</p>
<h3 id="1-what-to-eat-in-wall-gecko">1. What to eat in wall Gecko</h3>
<p>The Wall Gecko can be eaten by humans, your pets such as cats and dogs as well as other carnivores. However, not all parts of Wall Gecko can be eaten. You will need to be cautious when killing the Wall Gecko as it can bite (mild bite) and instill pain. The following are some of the parts that are preferably eaten.</p>
<ol>
<li>**The body meat.**Once you kill your Wall Lizard, peel of the skin (this can be used to make drum as in Thailand) and dissect it to get body meat. The body meat (somatic) it best to feed on since its soft and tender. This meat does not contain any toxins that may cause food poisoning. The Meat from the Wall Gecko may not be that big, like goat or cow, so, you will need to be precise while slicing. Take care of bones as they should be separated from steak meat.</li>
<li>**The Internal organs.**The internal organs such as lungs, heart, kidneys and intestines. Organs like heart and kidneys are very small and may not be substantial to eat. Intestines need to be cleaned thoroughly before boiling them to kill any bacteria that may be in the digestive track. Care should be put into place when handling the liver not to damage the gall bladder (it contains the bile juice, which may poison the meat).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>**The Bones.**Bones can be boiled to form marrowbone soup which when added some spices becomes very delicious. Before boiling, the bone skin (limb bones) must be removed as well as cleaning thoroughly the toe-webbed skin  the skin houses a lot of bacteria and pathogens which lead to food poisoning. You can pass the limbs over the fire (grill) to dry the skin fully before boiling.
Nevertheless, you should not eat any of these parts of Wall Gecko:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>**The skin.**Ensure to dissect the Wall Geckos skin perfectly well to detach it with body meat completely. This prevents the meat from being contaminated with the pathogens and bacteria that may be housed in the skin. Never eat the Wall Geckos skin since the salmonella bacteria found in it will be transfer with the meat to your digestive track causing food poisoning. Moreover, the bacteria and pathogens on the skin multiply very fast.</li>
<li>**The mouthpart.**The mouth of Wall Gecko is known to house variety of pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella. These bacteria hide in the teeth gaps, under the tongues, in the air sack region, on the palate and even along the throat. Normally, these bacteria cause infections when lizards bite you. When killing the Wall Gecko, it is advisable to get rid of the mouthpart completely or heat-treat it with high temperature (above 110 degree centigrade) to eliminate any living bacteria or pathogens.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>**The Toes.**The toes of Wall Gecko are partially webbed. The tip of the toes have crawls that provides a suitable hideout of bacteria and pathogens. It is difficult to remove these bacteria due to the coiling of the crawls. It is therefore necessary to cut of these sections. In case you must feed on them, carry out thorough cleaning and heat treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-how-to-cook-wall-gecko">2. How to cook Wall gecko.</h2>
<p>Before you cook meat from a Wall Gecko, ensure that you clean it with warm water thoroughly to remove any contamination that may come from the skin. The body meat should be slice into sizable piece that can be handled using a fork.</p>
<p>You can roast, boil or fry the body meat from the Wall Gecko. Do not overcook when boiling (5 to15 minutes are enough) since the meat breaks easily into watery soup.</p>
<p>The Wall Gecko body meat is best when fried or roasted at a lower temperature (lesser than boiling temperature).</p>
<p>Before boiling the Wall Gecko bones for soup, it is important to preheat them (steam or fry slightly) to kill any bacteria or pathogens that may get into soup. Ensure that you spice your soup to make it more delicious.</p>
<h3 id="3-poisonous-parts-of-wall-gecko">3. Poisonous parts of wall gecko</h3>
<p>The skin and the mouthpart of the Wall Gecko are poisonous. They house pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which multiply rapidly and cause food poisoning when eaten. The Skin contain scales that offers options for bacteria hideouts.</p>
<p>The mouth provides optimal environment for growth and multiplication of bacteria such as salmonella and other pathogens. These microorganisms hide under the tongue, in the teeth gaps, on the palate and throat too. They cause food poisoning and infection in case you are bitten.</p>
<p>The toes of Wall Gecko have short curved crawls at the tip. These parts house and incubate the disease causing pathogens and bacteria.</p>
<h3 id="4-precautions-when-eating-gecko">4. Precautions when eating Gecko**.**</h3>
<p>In case you would like to eat your Walk Gecko, it is necessary to observe the following precaution as a way of preventing food poisoning that may occur.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your Wall Gecko thoroughly with hot water after killing it (to remove and kill bacteria and pathogens). You can crap off the scale using a knife or any sharp object.</li>
<li>Clean the body meat thoroughly after slaughtering your Wall Gecko to remove any trace of germs or bacteria.</li>
<li>When slaughtering your Wall Gecko, check keenly on the gall bladder to prevent it from rapturing/damage (the bile juice will poison the meat making it unsuitable for human consumption).</li>
<li>Remove webbed toes of the Wall Gecko carefully and throw them away.</li>
<li>Never eat the mouthpart of the Wall Gecko  it contains pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which cause food poisoning. Throw away the mouthpart.</li>
<li>You can involve the veterinary to check the health status of the Wall Gecko before eating.</li>
<li>Burry the leftovers of the Wall Gecko meat or grind them into soft powder. It is not good to give your dog or cats plan bones from the Wall Lizards. The bones are sharp and when swallowed affect their digestive track.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-do-you-keep-wall-gecko-as-pet"><strong>How Do You Keep Wall Gecko As Pet?�</strong></h2>
<p>Wall Gecko are cold-blooded (ectotherms) reptiles and thus need special care. As a Pet, Wall Gecko needs a cage that is well aerated and spacious. Access to water and food without strain is important. You can use bowls and shall water cans which the Wall Gecko cannot tend to swim in.</p>

<p>Apart from human beings who hunt them from meat, Wall Gecko are eaten carnivores such as cats, dogs, crocodiles, snakes and large lizards such as Komodo dragons and Breaded lizards as flesh.</p>
<p>These carnivores swallow the Wall Gecko alive while others may slice it before feeding. Wall Gecko does not poison the carnivores. There is no case that has been reported of an animal that died after feeing on Wall Gecko.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wall Geckos are safe and harmless reptiles whose meat does not poison either human beings or carnivores. The meat do not contain toxins that may lead to food poisoning.</p>
<p>However, the skin and mouthpart of Wall Gecko contain pathogens and harmful bacteria, which may cause food poisoning and therefore should not be eaten. Proper care and precautions should be taken when preparing a Wall Gecko meat for a meal.</p>

<p>Leopard Gecko is a small and attractive insectivorous reptile that is easier to take care of. Improper food administration may adversely affect their health.
<strong>In summary, Leopard Gecko mainly eats insects such as cockroaches, super worms (such as Zilla Reptile Food), mealworms, or crickets. Leopard Geckos can also feed on silkworms, tomato hornworms, waxworms, beetles, sowbugs, and butter worms. Leopard Gecko does not feed on any vegetables or plant extracts.�</strong>

<h2 id="what-does-leopard-gecko-eat">What Does Leopard Gecko Eat?</h2>
<p>Leopard Gecko is an insectivorous animal (reptile) that mainly feeds on insects such as mealworms, crickets, cockroaches, super worms, or beetle. These insects provide strong nutrients that help the Leopard Gecko in bodybuilding and energy provision  they are rich in proteins and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Most of these insects are readily available in various climatic conditions (regions) and can be acquired commercially too. Normally, Leopard Gecko does not feed on vegetables or plant extracts. Below is detailed information on the best feed you can use for Leopard Gecko:</p>
<h3 id="1-mealworms"><strong>1. Mealworms</strong></h3>
<p>These are the primary source of food for Leopard Gecko that has a very high content of fat. They have a low or poor calcium-to-phosphorous ratio.
Mealworms are easier to raise at home since they multiply rapidly. Never feed your Leopard Gecko with mealworm beetle. They have shells that cause impaction due to indigestion problems.
<strong>Review of the�Zilla-Reptile Mealworm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nutritious food forLeopard Geckos, large Birds or Tropical Fish,hermit crabs, fence lizard,and Bearded Dragons</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t requireRefrigeration</li>
<li>Resealable and Convenient Packaging</li>
<li>Has High Protein and Dehydrated Ingredient
First,
mealworms must be just a small portion of the
Leopard Geckos&rsquo; diet - most info sheets recommend that you feed the reptiles mainly with live food. Give the leopard geckos, occasionally, just about a bowl of the mealworm food above.
My red-slider turtle munched on the
Zilla-Reptile Mealworm around its outdoor pond. For the leopard gecko, I made mustard greens salad and added the Mealworms for excellent nutrition. This has made the reptiles become muscular, healthy, and happy.
The
Zilla-Reptile Mealworm has a great taste and smell - and offers its additional protein to the reptiles as well as being great for chickens and peafowl. Also, it&rsquo;s suitable nutrition for sick geckos plus it won&rsquo;t spill since its plastic is strong enough allowing excellent sealing.
The mealworms are dehydrated to offer the right nutrients and protein that&rsquo;ll help maintain the health of your leopard dragons. The 100-percent natural worms and thus your geckos will achieve the same nutrition like they&rsquo;re feeding on whole insects.
Pros</li>
<li>Nutritious food forLeopard Geckos just like whole mealworms</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t requireRefrigeration</li>
<li>100-percent natural</li>
<li>Resealable and Convenient Packaging</li>
<li>Has High Protein and Dehydrated Ingredients

</ul>
<h3 id="2-cockroaches---do-leopard-geckos-eat-cockroaches">2. Cockroaches - Do leopard geckos eat cockroaches?</h3>
<p>Yes, Leopard geckos will many worms and bugs including Dubia Roaches (a great staple food), crickets, locusts, silkworms, hornworms, super-worms, and mealworms.</p>
<p>But are Dubia roaches too big for leopard geckos? Well, for leopard geckos that are in the juvenile stage, only feed them with 1/4-inch Dubia roaches. But for adult geckos, feed them with Dubai roaches that are medium-sized - this is a maximum of 1.5 inches in length.</p>
<p>The cockroaches will offer great nutrition to your
leopard gecko as they have high protein that&rsquo;ll keep your geckos healthy and active. Also, you should feed the gecko with whole-grain cereals, fruits, and fresh veggies too.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1ASWBJFoY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1ASWBJFoY</a></p>
<p>Tropical Cockroaches are the best tropical insects to use when feeding your Leopard Gecko within the tropics. The best cockroach species is Dubia roaches.</p>
<p>These are easier to raise  they multiply very fast as long as proper hideouts and temperature are provided. Moreover, it has excellent nutrients necessary for your Leopard Gecko.</p>
<p>Dubai roaches and Turkestan cockroaches move slowly and are unable to climb walls  this makes it easier to collect them as food when needed.</p>
<p>Do not feed your Leopard Gecko with cockroaches found in your shower/bathroom or damp areas  these are usually non-nutritious and poisonous.</p>
<h3 id="3-crickets">3. Crickets</h3>
<p>Crickets are known to have a relatively good amount of proteins for your Leopard Geckos growth, unlike the mealworms and roaches.</p>
<p>They have low-fat content and can easily be dusted with other artificial food supplements when feeding your Leopard Gecko.</p>
<p>Crickets are popular since their movement, behavior, and biting give Leopard Gecko a chance to acquire hunting skills.</p>
<h3 id="4-waxworms">4. Waxworms</h3>
<p>These worms are suitable for the sick Leopard Gecko and young ones since they contain a lot of proteins and fat.</p>
<p>They should be fed to adult Leopard Gecko once after every two or three weeks to prevent them from being obese. Waxworms can really be addictive to your Leopard Gecko.
<strong>5. Silk Worm�</strong>
This is a very nutritious feed that will heal wounds and boost the immunity of your Leopard Gecko. They multiply very fast provided proper/optimum temperature is maintained. However, Silkworms only live a few weeks (you will need to order a few frequently).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Crickets may be cumbersome to rare. They keep jumping out of the nest and often make a lot of noise. However, you can make a good breed if you instill proper care on crickets.</p>
<p>When collecting these insects from the fields, ensure that you do not pick them from places that are sprayed by any pesticide. It is also necessary that you may collect species that are recommended by the vet.
<strong>6. Alternatively</strong>
,</p>
<p>You can also feed your Leopard Gecko on artificially made food. This acts as a decoy to Leopard Gecko that has less appetite for live insects.</p>
<p>In addition, they contain necessary vitamins (vitamin D3 supplement) and calcium that are vital for the growth of your Leopard Gecko.</p>

<p>However, this may not be the only fixed time since a change in climate may affect the feeding habit of your Leopard Gecko. Therefore, you will need to have a flexible routine for your Leopard Geckos feeding Schedule that may accommodate such changes.</p>
<p>Do not overfeed your Leopard Gecko. This may lead to weight accumulation at its tail section and stomach adipose tissues. The Leopard Gecko uses this fatty storage during its hibernation time.</p>
<p>An overfed Leopard Gecko has a broader tail than its body and a large protruding stomach. It is sometimes unable to move normally.</p>
<p>In case you note that your Leopard Gecko is gaining weight abnormally, cut off the diet with fatty insects until it acquires the appropriate size.</p>
<p>When feeding the Leopard Gecko, place the insects in a shallow bowl or dish and push it as close as possible to Leopard Gecko. Place 2 or 3 insects at a time.</p>
<p>Once the Leopard Gecko is fully fed, it will stop feeding. However, some tend to continue to feed through at a slower pace  stop feeding it if you note such signs. A mature healthy Leopard Gecko would be full if fed for 5 to 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Feed young and sick Leopard Gecko 2 to 4 times a day while healthy adults should be fed once or twice per day. Avoid leaving live insects such as cricket in the feeding bowl  they can crawl on the Leopard Gecko and bite it.</p>
<h2 id="which-size-of-food-should-be-fed-to-leopard-gecko">Which Size of Food Should be Fed to Leopard Gecko?</h2>
<p>Do not feed Leopard Gecko with very large insects. It will have difficulties while digesting them. For young Leopard Gecko, select the smallest insects available (around 3/8 inches).</p>
<p>Those Juvenile Leopard Geckos to be fed with medium size insects (1/4 inch) while the mature Leopard Gecko eats sizable adult insects.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-do-leopard-gecko-feed">How Often Do Leopard Gecko Feed?</h2>
<p>Though Leopard Gecko has a great appetite for insects, it does not eat every hour like most animals. Young Leopard Gecko needs a lot of energy for growth and movement.</p>
<p>It should be fed 2 to 4 times per day. Two to seven small insects are enough to satisfy young Leopard Gecko in a single meal.</p>
<p>The sick Leopard Gecko should be fed according to instructions given by the vet. However, in normal cases, sick Leopard Gecko should be fed 2 to 6 times a day to improve its health status. The food can be mixed with the medicine being administered. Give them approximately 18 insects per day.</p>
<p>For adult Leopard Gecko, feed it one time per day or thrice per week is enough. Adult Leopard Gecko can be satisfied when fed with 4 to 7 sizable insects.</p>
<p>Just in case Leopard Gecko has a Problem with feeding habits, you can try to leave some of the harmless insects in a bowl (deep enough that insects cant crawl out) for Leopard Gecko to feed on during its free time.
<em>NB: Do not feed your, Leopard, with insects that is larger/longer than the space between its eyes (thumb rule).�</em>
