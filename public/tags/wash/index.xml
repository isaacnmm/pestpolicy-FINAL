<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-car-wash-soap"><strong>How to Choose the Best Car Wash Soap</strong></h2>
<p>Cleaning is part of car maintenance in addition to other routines like changing oil, replacing filters, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>But in order to get the best car cleaning results, you need to have the right kind of car wash soap.</li>
<li>Dish soaps are not recommended for a car wash because they tend to strip off the wax finish and paint on your car.
Below, Ive provided you with a guide for choosing the best car wash soap.
<strong>Foaming</strong>
Plenty of suds or foams help in lifting dirt to separate it from the car surface. It also lubricates the dirt and surface, making it possible to flow away from the rinsing surface.</li>
<li>This is an important consideration because it reduces or eliminates the need for scrubbing, which may leave your paint surface with scratches.
However, some stains like bird droppings tend to stick on the surfaces and may not be removed without scrubbing.
<strong>PH Level</strong>
The sealants and paint finish on your car cannot withstand
<a href="https://www.lenosgarage.com/blogs/auto-detailing/4-things-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-car-wash-soap">high PH levels</a>
.</li>
<li>High PH soap solutions tend to strip the layer of paint and wax finish making your car lose its original shiny appearance.</li>
<li>Luckily, therere products with a balanced or neutral PH that will not strip the finish coat in your car.
The high PH in most dish soaps makes them unsuitable for cleaning cars.
They are associated with stripping the protective coat and decreasing the durability of the paint.
Also, your skin might be affected by high PH in some car soaps. Therefore, its advisable to get a product with a balanced or neutral PH.
<strong>Finish</strong>
You want your car to retain its original shiny appearance or even become better.</li>
<li>Some car wash soaps are formulated with ingredients that enhance the paint finish after washing.</li>
<li>Shun any product that will make your car look dull than before.
Apart from cleaning, a good product should also leave the paint finish on your car free from streaks or water spots.
<strong>Value For Money</strong>
This will be determined by the concentration rather than the quantity of the product.</li>
<li>The higher the concentration, the little the amount you need per wash.
Thus, a highly concentrated car wash soap will give you several washes before buying another one.
<strong>Safety</strong>
Your product of choice should not contain harsh ingredients that might affect you or damage your car&rsquo;s paint.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-use-a-plunger/">Follow how to use a plunger</a>
.�Also, an environmentally friendly product will go a long way to protect the surrounding environment from pollution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Not all soaps or shampoos are good for cleaning cars. Some of them will leave your car with a dull appearance and expose the paint finish to corrosion.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the best car wash soap will give your car a brilliant and lasting surface finish.</li>
<li>Any one of the above products is designed for cleaning cars, and it wont interfere with the paint finish or wax coating.
Get yourself a quality product with a big reputation and a long history of good performance.</li>
