<p>A tactical knife will be an excellent self-defense weapon for you at the home, office, or outdoors.
First, according to a Police-Policy Council
<a href="http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Tueller/How.Close.htm">Study</a>
, a tactical knife will be highly helpful than a gun when your target is within 20 feet from you.</p>
<p>In the current time, when most have adopted a more minimalistic life, I am sure youll love a weapon (the tactical knife) that serves more than one purpose in your outdoor activities.</p>
<p>So what should you consider in a tactical knife?�Well, like any other weapon, your tactical knife must be strong and have an appropriate length.</p>
<p>This will prevent the tactical knife from breaking while in use, which could expose you to danger from the attacker at the most critical time.</p>
<p>Also, the tactical knife should have the appropriate size to allow easy concealing as you move around in the outdoor or indoor space.</p>
<p>For example, using a knife would require that you get close to your attacker. But, sometimes, you might want to attack from a distance to minimize the possibility of the attacker getting close and personal to you.</p>
<p>In such cases, a reciprocating saw, pepper spray, batons, or sword walking sticks can help you protect yourself in case of a home invasion.</p>

<p>The C in the Taser X26C stands for the CIVILIAN version of the police or law enforcement equivalent device.
The key difference between the two Tasers is that with the law enforcement device, one can only pull its trigger once and goes for about 5 seconds.</p>
<p>However, with the civilian version of the Taser, one can pull the trigger thrice and can go for about 30 seconds, and thus you can take a more extended tease on your attacker.</p>
<p>The Taser is a long-range self-defense device that is used for long-range, about 12 feet, protection.</p>
<p>Due to the distance, it allows you from your attacker; the Taser is considered a highly effective self-defense mechanism.</p>
<p>It works by firing two darts that are attached to the 15 feet wiring propelled from its cartridge, and that affixes itself to the attackers skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>It sends a 30-second energy surge that affects the assailants nervous system and disrupts the brain muscle coordination.</li>
<li>The attacker will fall, but if this fails, you can still use the Taser as a stun gun until you hit your attacker appropriately.
Also, the tool uses a digital power magazine with a screen that shows the energy usage and will compute the remaining power life for the loaded magazine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Taser also has a timer that will alert you when to fire, mainly when its cartridge is present.</p>
<p>Further, you can purchase an extended battery that will enhance more grip and allow you to store an extra cartridge at the bottom that will be easily accessible while dealing with your attacker.</p>

<p>The SABRE 3-IN-1 Pepper Spray has been designed, used from 1975 to date, to make your attacker lose consciousness.
We highly recommend pepper spray as it is used by many police departments.</p>
<p>With a 4-year shelf life, the SABRE 3-IN-1 Pepper Spray will provide you with the highest benefit over its valid lifetime. You should note that other pepper sprays only have about 2-years shelf life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be assured of the canisters hardiness as it is strength and fire tested and approved.</li>
<li>The spray is easier to use compared to other pepper sprays as it does not require shaking.
SABRE 3-IN-1 Pepper Spray has a 10-feet range, allows thirty-five 1-second spray bursts, and holds 5-times more spray and thus will.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the spray will enable you to fight and immobilize multiple attackers, which is not possible with other pepper spray brands.</p>

<h2 id="considerations-for-the-best-self-propelled-lawnmowers-under-300">Considerations for the Best Self-Propelled Lawnmowers under 300</h2>
<h3 id="1-forward-or-rear-wheel-drive-system">1. Forward or rear-wheel drive system</h3>
<p>Rear-wheel mounted mowers offer more manoeuvrability as compared to forward wheel drive system because the lawnmower is propelled from behind where the machines weight is concentrated.
On the other hand, the front-wheel-drive system is not ideal for manoeuvrability but it barely poses any challenges when mowing the lawn.</p>
<h3 id="2-size-of-the-lawn">2. Size of the lawn</h3>
<p>If you own a large lawn, self-propelled mowers are not ideal. Accordingly, self-propelled lawn mowers are considered to be more ideal for small and medium-sized lawns.
The terrain -
Depending on how rocky or hilly the lawn terrain is, you might want to go for a gas-powered lawn mower because it has more torque than electric-powered models. In addition, a self-propelled mower with different speed settings is considered more ideal for tough terrains.</p>
<h3 id="3-size-of-the-wheel">3. Size of the wheel</h3>
<p>This is an important consideration in the sense that larger wheels allow you to manoeuvre corners more easily as compared to smaller wheels.
At the same time, a large wheel size offers enough ground clearance to allow you to mow through tough terrains. In addition, users should go heavy-duty wheels rather than plastic wheels to avoid damage.</p>
<h3 id="4-adjustable-handlebars">4. Adjustable handlebars</h3>
<p>No matter the height of the user, most self-propelled mowers feature adjustable handlebars which ease storage and portability.
Blade override system -
This feature saves the user the stress of having to restart the equipment all the time. One can get stones and other obstacles out of the way by taking their hand off the lever.</p>
<h3 id="5-reliability">5. Reliability</h3>
<p>As compared to push mowers, self-propelled mowers are more likely to break down because they contain many moving parts.
Different models have different reliability issues. Whereas Honda is deemed as the most reliable brand whereas Snapper mowers have a poor reputation for breaking down.
Power - The power of the self-propelled mower is an important consideration depending on how hilly the terrain is or the thickness of the grass.
A 160cc engine capacity is considered ideal for such conditions. At the same time, powerful engines tend to be less economical if you are dealing with a small budget.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After searching through the available self-propelled models, my ideal choice is the Troy-Bilt TB37O 163cc 21 RWD self-propelled mower.
This units 8 by 8 wheels are heavy duty and designed for tackling the toughest terrains. A four-speed setting offers optimal performance in the toughest conditions.</p>
