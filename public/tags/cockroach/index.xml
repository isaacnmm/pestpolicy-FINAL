      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German <a href="/posts/how-to-kill-cockroach-eggs/">cockroaches</a> are smaller but more common in the house than the American cockroaches in the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li>One female German <a href="/posts/cockroach-vs-palmetto-bug/">cockroach</a> produces about 30,000 eggs (that mature into baby roaches) annually - this is a larger offspring than other roach species.
The emergence of many cockroach eggs ensures that the pests&rsquo; birth cycle is ongoing to create a massive infestation -
but they don</li>
</ul>
<p>t fly
.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the female German cockroach survives and continues reproducing over its lifespan (30 weeks), it can produce two roach generations.
Even with low egg production, the female German roaches (as a colony) can generate about 10,000 baby cockroaches.

<h2 id="how-do-cockroach-eggs-look">How do Cockroach Eggs Look?</h2>
<p>When you find
cockroach eggs in your house or apartment
, realize that there are adult watches that are multiplying and breeding - which must be a sad discovery.</p>
<ul>
<li>So after finding the cockroach eggs in your space, you must inspect the area to determine the seriousness of the pest problem.</li>
<li>Next, you are required to create a treatment and prevention plan for the cockroaches if there&rsquo;s an active infestation.
NB: Female cockroaches lay their eggs grouped into an ootheca (a sack or an egg case) and not individual eggs.</li>
<li>The cockroach ootheca is formed from a leathery material and it holds about 40 eggs.
The leather casing is hard and will thus protect the cockroach eggs from insects and predators.
American cockroach
The ootheca of the American cockroach measures about 8 mm and is dark brown.
The females of the species will produce about 6 - 90 ootheca over their lifetime.</li>
<li>These females will carry the egg ootheca for a number of days before dropping it in a hidden and safe place.
German Cockroaches
The female Furies species of the German cockroach will lay their eggs in warm and humid conditions of your house including the bathroom and kitchen.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/signs-of-a-cockroach-infestation/">egg ootheca or capsule</a>for the German cockroaches will contain roughly 40 years - and the capsule measures about a quarter inch in length and is light brown.
When the conditions are favorable for the female, cockroaches will create a new capsule of eggs within a few weeks.</li>
<li>After it is produced, a female roach will carry the egg capsule until sometime (one day or 2) before the eggs hatch.
The egg case of the cockroaches will be enclosed by a protein that will harden to form a protective and strong casing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4F-vQesm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4F-vQesm0</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="locations-to-find-cockroach-eggs">Locations to Find Cockroach Eggs</h2>
<p>It is common to find cockroaches in areas like the kitchens and bathrooms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The locations have adequate water and food and thus act like nurseries for the young coaches and the cockroach eggs.
Now let&rsquo;s another the cockroach&rsquo;s best riding areas;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-pantries-cupboards-and-drawers">1. Pantries, Cupboards, and Drawers</h3>
<p>The panties, cupboards, and drawers are excellent hiding areas for cockroaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>These locations are dark and cool and have water and food access - this makes such places great habitats for cockroaches.
You can
use diatomaceous earth
to control the cockroaches in such places. But you may also hire an
expert pest exterminator
near you.</li>
<li>First, empty your pantry removing items that have signs of roach infestation such as holes on the cardboard or cereal boxes.</li>
<li>Next, thoroughly clean the pantry (on the inside) using a sponge plus soapy water. Use clean water to rinse the pantry and dry the surfaces using a cloth.</li>
<li>Cleaning the inside of your pantry will help remove food particles and crumbs that act as food sources for the roaches.</li>
<li>Inspect the pantry (both outside and inside) for signs of holes and cracks used by cockroaches. Also, inspect the corners and baseboards for spaces that roaches can use to get into the pantry - seal these with caulk.</li>
<li>Change the storage containers to ones made of airtight metal or plastic. This way the roaches will not reach the pasta, cereal, sugar, flours, and starches - like when we use cardboard storage containers.</li>
<li>Return the foods into the pantry and crush a few bay leaves. The smell will help repel the roaches - but also replace the leaves once weekly.
Finally, mix generous amounts of flour and diatomaceous Earth and spring on it around the outside of your pantry.
Requirements to undertake this roach control mission include;</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Boric acid or diatomaceous Earth</li>
<li>Small bowls</li>
<li>Bay leaves</li>
<li>Glass, metal, or plastic containers</li>
<li>Caulk</li>
<li>Cloth</li>
<li>Sponge</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Soap</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-in-appliances">2. In Appliances</h3>
<p>Cockroach eggs and adult cockroaches can also be found inside the appliances such as kitchen appliances like the dryers and washers.</p>
<ul>
<li>To remove the cockroach eggs from the appliances you require to clean the device thoroughly.</li>
<li>Also, I recommend that you use some cockroach traps or non-toxic poison</li>
<li>Prevent a re-invasion of the cockroaches by sealing all the crevices and cracks leading into the inner side of their appliances
Cockroaches will mainly be searching for warmth and food around your house (including in appliances) and the kitchen.</li>
<li>Roach species that will mainly invade your appliances are the German cockroaches.
Roaches get into the appliances once they reach the kitchen from behind the stove or refrigerator and
through the drain or sink
.
The brown and flat insects are described as being knocked on and so they will be finding food and shelter during the day.</li>
<li>When the conditions are correct for the roaches, the insects will read very fast causing an infestation.
Notably, cockroaches are excellent at hiding and so most homeowners will not notice the problem until they see dead roaches.</li>
<li>So, seeing a single Roach on your premises might be a sign of the presence of a large infestation and this could grow even further if not resolved well.
I would recommend you use glue traps or sticky traps to help you in monitoring whether there are cockroaches on your premises.
Further cockroaches will squeeze their birthdays inside small crevices and so it is important to sell such cracks to stop the movement into your appliances.</li>
<li>Notable areas that you should check for the cockroaches include behind peelable wallpapers, under rubber mats and carpets, or inside cabinets.
Cockroaches will eat human and pet food plus other substances such as paper, soaps, glue, and grease.</li>
<li>So you should know andidentify cockroach droppings, exoskeletons, and their egg cases.
But will cockroaches really damage my appliances? Well, largely cockroaches won&rsquo;t damage your answers but they will contaminate them.
For example, cockroaches will walk and touch the inside of your appliances and may transfer organisms such as salmonella and E. coli.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-baseboards-and-bathtubs-drains">3. Baseboards and Bathtubs Drains</h3>
<p>Cockroaches will hide around and in baseboards, we have even been out of sight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore it will be helpful if you inspect the basement for signs of cockroaches.</li>
<li>If there are such signs, undertake appropriate roach treatment on the baseboards and around the area.
The other area that the cockroaches will hide includes the bathtub drains and floors.
Check the water heater closet and plumbing cabinets since these areas are moist and warm - the conditions that roaches love.
Further, inspect the areas that are always damp such as the bathrooms and the laundry rooms since these will attract roaches.
The next areas include the food eating and storage places (even those for pets) since the roaches will be attracted by the cramps.
Inspect the recycling bins and trash cans because cockroaches won&rsquo;t be picking and these locations will make a great habitat.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-roach-eggs-take-to-hatch">How Long Do Roach Eggs Take to Hatch?</h2>
<p>Young cockroaches tend to come out from their ootheca about 3 to 9 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="1-brown-banded-roaches-eggs">1. Brown-banded Roaches Eggs</h3>
<p>The ootheca of the brown-banded roaches will be about 5 mm and also reddish-brown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the egg cases produced by a brown-banded roach will hatch up to 18 embryos - and one of these females will create about 20 of these cases.
You can identify the nymphs of a Brown-banded roach with their upper abdomen having two yellow bands.</li>
<li>Further, the names of these roaches will grow into adults in a period of six months.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-oriental-cockroach-eggs">2. Oriental Cockroach Eggs</h3>
<p>The ootheca of the oriental cockroaches will measure about 10 mm and they are also reddish-brown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of these cases will have about 16 eggs and they will look somehow inflated.
The females of the Oriental cockroaches will create up to 18 eggs capsules in their lifetime and they will hide them in safe places.
The news of the Oriental cockroaches will emerge as adults within 600 days - especially when the environmental conditions are right.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-german-cockroach-eggs">3. German Cockroach Eggs</h3>
<p>The ootheca of the German cockroaches will measure about 9 mm and it will be brown.</p>
<ul>
<li>The females of these roaches will carry the egg case (ootheca) until a time when the eggs will be almost hatching.
Their ootheca will have about 50 eggs and they will develop into adults in roughly 100 days.
Notably, the German cockroaches are the most common roach species that you will find in your house.</li>
<li>This is also contributed by the fact that the German cockroaches lay many eggs, so they will experience rapid population growth.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I found coach eggs, what next? Youll require to vacuum the spaces to kill the adult roaches, their babies, and eggs capsules.</p>
<ul>
<li>American and German cockroaches will hide around areas that have fresh water and a food source.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cockroach Vs. Palmetto Bug - when people say the word cockroach, they are ordinarily using a familiar name to refer to two types of insects from the same family.
The American Cockroach, or Palmetto Bug, or German Cockroach, is your basic, run-of-the-mill cockroach. So what&rsquo;s the difference between the two?
In the ongoing battle between the cockroach vs. the palmetto bug, it&rsquo;s often disappointing for people to learn that there is no difference between the two bugs - try these

<h2 id="cockroach-vs-palmetto-bug-whatre-the-difference">Cockroach Vs. Palmetto Bug: What&rsquo;re the Difference?</h2>
<p>While there are over 4,500 various <a href="/posts/cockroach-eggs/">cockroaches</a> species, these two provide a constant source of confusion for people. Yet, there are some notable differences.
So let&rsquo;s put on our boxing gloves, step in the ring, get behind our favorite <a href="/posts/how-to-kill-cockroach-eggs/">cockroach</a>, and see what they are. Read Also:
What do roaches smell like?
Well, the most straightforward answer is a cockroach. &ldquo;Palmetto bug&rdquo; is a common term heard most often in the Southeastern United States, especially in Florida.
The name can encompass a whole group of large cockroaches. It is usually connected to the Florida woods cockroach, Australian cockroach, the American cockroach, smoky brown cockroach, brown and the death&rsquo;s head cockroach.
Palmetto bugs are so-named because they like to hang out among the leaves of palm trees in the Southeast. Read also:

**How Can You Identify a Palmetto Bug? **
For one thing, in the cockroach vs. palmetto bug wars, at around 1.5 inches long, palmetto bugs are among the giant cockroaches and often make themselves unwelcome guests in people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<ul>
<li>These reddish-brown bugs develop two spots behind their head as they age and have wings, but are not excellent fliers, so instead, they will sail along in the air from the surface to surface.</li>
<li>It can be quite comical when people assume they are being attacked by palmetto bugs because when you open your house door, they sail right is headed for the light.
While they are not the most sanitary creatures and admittedly can come off as a bit frightening, palmetto bugs aren&rsquo;t hazardous.
They seldom
bite humans
, and their bites are nothing to worry about as they show up as tiny, red marks but are not poisonous or painful.
It might seem that the worst these pests can do is cause disruption in your home, but beware!
Due to their love of hiding in dirty, unsanitary locations, they can infect your food with bacteria like salmonella. Furthermore, they can set off asthma and allergies.�Read Also:

<h2 id="where-do-they-make-their-home-">**Where Do They Make Their Home? **</h2>
<p>When it comes down to the cockroach vs. the palmetto bug, both are very versatile. They don&rsquo;t perish quickly.
In the case of the palmetto bug, if the weather takes a sudden turn for the worse, maybe turning suddenly cold or becoming too hot or wet, they will head indoors to find refuge in your home.
The tropical climate of Florida is a paradise for palmetto bugs. As a homeowner, you need to be vigilant because if a house is left empty for too long, or you have an outside infestation, pretty soon they will find their way indoors.
What you have to do is a thorough check of your property. Look for palmetto bugs in these places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under palm leaves, inside hollow trees, throughout woodpiles and shrubs</li>
<li>Lurking in sprinkler systems</li>
<li>Sink and tub drains</li>
<li>Beneath your roof shingles.</li>
<li>The foundation of your home</li>
<li>Inside basements and crawlspaces, mainly if it is damp</li>
<li>Hidden in baskets of dirty laundry
Any damp, warm, dark place is a fair game for these insects, and they like to collect in large groups in one spot. This doesn&rsquo;t mean ten or so but groups containing hundreds, even thousands.
Since palmetto bugs will happily dine on any organic matter that they can get to, they will eat garbage, decaying bodies of animals, paper, hair, and even glue!

<li>They emit an unmistakable musty scent</li>
<li>They shed their skins and leave droppings similar to pepper flakes in crevices and cracks</li>
<li>How to Get Rid of Palmetto Bugs
The best and most effective way and the quickest is to call an exterminator to
spray your home&rsquo;s interior and exterior
. This is highly recommended. But there are also other available methods:</li>
<li>Buy some traps</li>
<li>Spray them with a bottle of oil and water or plain soap and water</li>

<ul>
<li>The best way to deal with cockroach egg sacks or<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">baby roaches</a>is by using an insect growth regulator (IGR).</li>
<li>IGRs are generally used to prevent hatchlings from reaching adulthood and thus stopping further reproduction.</li>
<li>However, IGRs are also very useful when it comes to killing the cockroach eggs. It can be obtained in liquid form, and when sprayed on the eggs, it causes them to become sterile. When theeggs are killed, you are guaranteedthey wont be another generation of cockroaches.
Kitchen trolleys, the underside of stove burners, bookcases, and cupboards are the favorite places of cockroaches when it comes to laying eggs.
Also, roaches lay eggs near food items that arent safely stored in air-tight containers and too near leftovers that arent correctly disposed of. Read Also:

<p>Now that youve identified
<a href="https://extension.umn.edu/insects-infest-homes/cockroaches">cockroach types</a>
, it is time to destroy the eggs. The best strategy is eradicating them so that there wont be future generations to deal with. Below are the effective
methods of destroying
cockroach eggs.</p>
<h3 id="1-crush-the-eggs">1. Crush the Eggs</h3>
<p>Yes, you can crush them with your shoes or use a heavy object. However, this can be a bit messy, so make sure to clean up the destroyed egg cases afterward, or they might serve as food for any lurking cockroaches.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MKa65xtnJc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MKa65xtnJc</a></p>
<h3 id="2-burn-them">2. Burn Them</h3>
<p>You can try burning them, but kindly do this outside and be very cautious that you dont set anything else on fire by mistake. Sure, this method may be somewhat satisfying, but it is not very practical. Also, you wont enjoy the smell of burning cockroach eggs.</p>
<h3 id="3-pour-boric-acid-over-the-eggs">3. Pour Boric Acid over the Eggs</h3>
<p>Boric acid
is a proven method of eradicating roaches of all sizes and ages, including the eggs. To eliminate the eggs, you are required to pour enough acid into them.
They will instantly die due to coming in contact with the boric acid even if they were almost to hatch - or use
roach bait for babies or adults
.</p>
<h3 id="4-spray-them-with-pesticides">4. Spray Them with Pesticides</h3>
<p>Effective commercial-grade cockroach pesticides are commonly used to spray and kill adult cockroaches, eggs, and even hatch-lings.
Remember, this will work only when the egg sac is sprayed with a powerful and effective pesticide. Also, you can use
roach bombs
.</p>
<h3 id="5-vacuuming">5. Vacuuming</h3>
<p>Although you wont kill them, vacuuming up the eggs can be another great option. However, the cockroach eggs might end up with hatching inside of your vacuum cleaner.
So, if you decide to use this method, ensure you empty your vacuum
cleaner in a safer place
and then dispose of the eggs so that they do not hatch.

<h2 id="what-do-cockroach-eggs-look-like">What Do Cockroach Eggs Look Like?</h2>
<p>There are four main types of cockroaches, which commonly appear in living areas and domestic homes. They all lay eggs in sacs known as oothecae.
The egg sacs, which are elongated and look similar to a pill, contains multiple eggs. Since all the egg sacs are basically the same shape, identifying them can help you determine what type of cockroaches you are dealing with in your residence.
The differences are in the
size and color
depending on the cockroach species. The
differences between the four types of roach egg
sacs are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brown-banded cockroach - Light brown with some red. Approximately 5 mm</li>
<li>Oriental cockroach - Medium to dark reddish-brown. Approximately 8 to 10 mm.</li>
<li>German cockroach - usually shades of brown. Approximately 6 to 9 mm.</li>
<li>American cockroach - Dark brown. Approximately 8 mm long.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you spot a <a href="/posts/cockroach-eggs/">cockroach</a> in your house, the first thing that might come to your mind is whether you might have a roach infestation.�Well, roaches bring a host of negative effects to our homes and may cost hundreds of dollars to eradicate.</p>
<p>So, I understand the cause of panic when homeowners spot a single cockroach in their house.�But should you be worried about the one roach you have spotted?
<strong>A short answer is NO</strong>
. The sight of one roach is not a single indicator that you have a roach infestation to deal with. These pesky creatures are attracted to our homes as they search for water, food, shelter and warmth. So, the one roach that you spot, could have just moved in search of conditions to survive. However, you should treat this one roach seriously to ensure that it doesnt develop into an infestation.</p>
<p>You need to know that cockroaches have evolved with humans for many years and have developed many survival tactics which have made them survive numerous mass extinction. They stay out of sight during the day, only coming out during the night to terrorise your house.</p>
<p>That means, unless you have an infestation, you will rarely see cockroaches. But there are a few signs that may indicate a possible roach infestation.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-cockroach-infestation"><strong>Signs Of Cockroach Infestation</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-seeing-roaches-during-the-day">**1.��� **<strong>Seeing Roaches During The Day</strong></h3>
<p>The sight a cockroach is obviously the surest sign of a roach problem. And while the best time to spot these nocturnal insects is during the night, sometimes it possible to see them during the day. If you spot a roach during the day, there is a high chance that you might be dealing with a horde of them.</p>
<p>Although roaches tend to hide during the day, overcrowding and competition for food and water may cause them to spill out during the day in order to survive. So, if you find roaches during the day, its probably the right time to start a treatment plan or seek help from pest control professionals</p>
<h3 id="2-dead-roaches-lying-around">**2.��� **<strong>Dead Roaches Lying Around</strong></h3>
<p>Basically, life and death is part of a roach infestation. Thus, it is common to find carcasses of cockroaches in the places they hide. Signs of dead roaches mean that roaches are already in your house but not necessarily an infestation.</p>
<h3 id="3-roach-droppings">**3.��� **<strong>Roach Droppings</strong></h3>
<p>Another possible indicator of roach infestation, is the presence of fecal matter around your house. These creatures have a high metabolism rate, meaning they can excrete a substantial amount of fecal matter. The droppings differ in appearance, depending on the species and sizes of cockroaches.</p>
<p>Adult roaches will defecate cylindrical pellets-like feces while droppings from small roaches resemble ground coffee. The location and the quantity of roach feces can give you a hint of the extent of the infestation.</p>
<p>Check the areas most frequented by roaches such as behind the sink and food storage areas for roach droppings. If theres a substantial amount of feces, this could be a clear indicator of a high roach traffic.</p>
<h3 id="4-presence-of-roach-eggs">**4.��� **<strong>Presence Of Roach Eggs</strong></h3>
<p>Roaches breed and multiply rapidly in just a few days. So, the sight of oothecae (egg casings) left after hatching is a clear sign of infestation. Oothecae are the brown casings that are discarded after hatching. Most roach species produce an ootheca with 10 to 20 eggs but the stubborn German roach will have up to 50 eggs in a single ootheca.</p>
<p>Normally, most roach species attach their ootheca in secure places where pesticides and enemies like humans have a difficulty reaching.</p>
<p>However, the German roach carries with it the ootheca until the eggs hatch, making it hard to spot. If you have an infestation, you will spot egg castings inside closets, cabinets, around appliances such as refrigerators, ovens, stoves etc.</p>
<h3 id="5-unusual-smells">**5.��� **<strong>Unusual Smells</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, roaches have a characteristic oily odour which tends to become pungent as the infestation gets worse. The oily smell is possible with a large number of cockroaches, but can also result from oleic acid produced by decomposition of dead roaches. German roaches produce quite an intense smell than other roaches. The smell of cockroaches remains in the air and can even interfere with the taste of food.</p>
<h2 id="what-attracts-roaches-">**What Attracts Roaches? **</h2>
<h3 id="1-food-or-something-to-eat">**1.��� **<strong>Food Or Something To Eat</strong></h3>
<p>Exposed food is one the most common attractant for roaches. Roaches will crawl and remain in your house as long as they have something to eat. They are not selective at all. From food crumbs on surfaces to left overs on utensils, roaches will eat almost anything they come across.</p>
<p>But armed with simple housekeeping measures, you can minimise these avenues for roach proliferation. For example you can clean the house thoroughly and disinfect the surfaces. In addition keep all food substances in sealed vessels.</p>
<p>However, remember that roaches do not entirely rely on foodstuffs like us. Some cockroach species will feed on non-food substances like wood, cardboard, glue, paper etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-presence-of-damp-dark-and-hidden-places">**2.��� **<strong>Presence Of Damp, Dark And Hidden Places</strong></h3>
<p>Even if roaches are deprived of foodstuffs, these creatures are known to be sturdy enough to survive up to a month without feeding. During this time, roaches tend to cling to any dark, hidden and wet places in the house. Hence, you might find them around garbage points, garage and bathroom and behind the sink.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, these creatures will hide in place where theres seldom disturbances and away from human predators.</p>
<h3 id="3-exposed-trash">**3.��� **<strong>Exposed Trash</strong></h3>
<p>Just like foodstuffs, exposed trash will attract roaches like magnet. They will not only find something to eat but also a quiet haven to hide and breed.</p>
<p>If you want to get roaches out of trash areas, be sure to empty the garbage collection bins and clean them thoroughly.</p>
<h3 id="4-water">**4.��� **<strong>Water</strong></h3>
<p>Roaches can survive up to a month without food but not without water. They dehydrate quickly and will barely survive a month or two without water. Thats why roaches are attracted to wet places like under the sink, leaking pipes, around pets water and any other wet surface.</p>
<p>However keeping your house as dry as possible can reduce the persistence of roaches in your house.</p>
<h3 id="5-overgrown-vegetation">**5.��� **<strong>Overgrown Vegetation</strong></h3>
<p>Overgrowing grass and weed around the house and along pathways leading to the doors may be good breeding areas for roaches. In addition natural mulch and overstayed mown grass (i.e. before disposal), may harbour roaches because of the moist and warm conditions underneath.</p>
<p>However such roach threats can be minimised by maintaining a clean and tidy garden through clearing and damping overgrown vegetation.</p>
<h3 id="6-things-you-bring-home">**6.��� **<strong>Things You Bring Home</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike bed bugs, roaches do not hitch a ride home on things like clothes and furniture. Roaches like hiding in electrical appliances and cardboard boxes. They love the warm and quiet conditions inside appliances, so be keen not to bring them home.</p>
<p>You risk bring them home if you buy second hand appliances that come from a roach infested place. If you are not sure whether such appliances harbour roaches, you can cast the doubts by wrapping the items in airtight plastic bags together with Nuvan strips and leave them for a week or so.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-roach-do-i-have"><strong>What Type Of Roach Do I Have?</strong></h2>
<p>Of the 4600 known species of roaches, only 30 species have evolved and adapted to live with humans. Out of these, there are 5 main types of roaches that you are likely to find near households. These include:</p>
<h3 id="1-german-cockroach">**1.��� **<strong>German Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Blattella germanica. It is the type of roach you will commonly find in warmer climates. Though it is small in size, merely about  in, this is one roach you dont want to have anywhere near your house. They harbor numerous disease-causing bacteria and may cause allergy relation reactions. German roaches are also known for their resistance against common pesticides. Their color ranges from dark brown to tan and they dont fly.</p>
<h3 id="2-american-cockroach">**2.��� **<strong>American Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Periplaneta Americana. This is the largest type of roach that you will see in your house. Its reddish brown, readily flies and about 1 in. Although its the most abundant, this roach is not very dangerous. Its however associated with a lot of nasty diseases to humans.</p>
<h3 id="3-oriental-cockroach">**3.��� **<strong>Oriental Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Blatta orientalis Linnaeus. Its commonly known as the water bug due to its tendency to inhabit damp areas such as the basements. Its color ranges from dark brown to black but the wings are non-functional.</p>
<h3 id="4-brown-banded-roach">**4.��� **<strong>Brown Banded Roach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Supella longipalpa. This roach resembles the German roach but can be distinguished by the brown bands on their body. In addition, just like the German roach, this roach skin castings and excretions are associated with allergic reactions.</p>
<h3 id="5-smoky-brown-roach">**5.��� **<strong>Smoky Brown Roach</strong></h3>
<p>Last but not the least is the &ldquo;Smoky Brown Roach&rdquo;. The scientific name for this roach is Periplaneta fuliginosa. The name of this roach comes from its characteristic mahogany color. They commonly inhabit areas around the garage and woodpiles.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>The sight of one roach should not cause you a lot of panic. This should rather get you ready for a roach control plan. Since roaches breed very rapidly, one female roach can quickly cause a roach infestation in your home.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you embark on appropriate roach prevention plans such as eliminating conducive environments. In addition, you can seek advice from a professional pest exterminator.</p>

? One thing you need to know is that roaches are nocturnal pests and are very active during the night.
They are very tactical, as they will also hide in crevices and cracks which complicate things.
<strong>In summary, the signs of a <a href="/posts/cockroach-vs-palmetto-bug/">cockroach</a> infestation are roach droppings, live or dead cockroaches, smear marks, shredded roach skin, strong odor, roach egg capsules, plus furniture and property damage.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Killer for Cockroaches&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
What is annoying is that they will feed on anything in your home from food, clothes, papers, plastics and anything around then hide only for you to find damages.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-a-cockroach-infestation---7-notable-signs-">**Signs of a Cockroach Infestation - 7 Notable Signs **</h2>
<p>There are different signs that you can use to tell if you have an infestation in your home. This is because roaches are hard to spot during the day and they will only come out when the lights are off.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the day, they hide in crevices and cracks and other dark spots where its hard to spot them.</li>
<li>With over 4000 species of cockroaches in the world, there is 2 major type of cockroaches found in the USA. These are the American and the German species.
American cockroaches will mostly be found outdoors and in garbage bins, while German cockroaches are mostly found indoors -
use chemicals such as Harris
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-dropping-">**1. ****Dropping **</h3>
<p>Cockroach droppings are a first and a sure way of telling that the roaches are in the house. When they come out in the night to feed, they will eat anything left in the open and uncovered.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also drop their feces, all over countertops, floors, shelves, and pantry among other areas.</li>
<li>In case you do not know the dropping look like, you will see some things that look specks of black pepper or coffee grounds.
The amount of droppings and how scattered is also a better way to tell on the levels of infestation of the roaches in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-live-or-dead-cockroaches">**2. **<strong>Live or Dead Cockroaches</strong></h3>
<p>Once in a while when you are likely to spot roaches roaming around the house as they move into their hiding places. If you turn off the light for a few minutes and then turn it on, you will see the roaches running back into their hideouts.</p>
<ul>
<li>In some extreme cases where there is an over-infestation, you will even see the cockroaches during the day as they try to get something to eat.
Also, you may also spot them when they are dead due to many factors. These dead roaches mostly appear where there are dropping or eggs around them.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-smear-marks-">**3. ****Smear marks **</h3>
<p>Cockroaches have a tendency to leave dark smear trails on the walls as they crawl along.
These marks are visible where the area is humid and moist. They are also the marks that roaches make to and fro as they get to the source of their food.</p>
<h3 id="4-shredded-skin-">**4. Shredded ****skin **</h3>
<p>Roaches molt their skin 8-13 times in their life cycle as they transition from one life stage into another.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look out for these skins as a sign of an infestation of roaches into your home.</li>
<li>The shredded skin varies in size and shape as they are molted at different stages of a cockroachs life.
If you see them in your house,
its a red alert
to take action against the roaches in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-strong-odor-">**5. ****Strong odor **</h3>
<p>If your house is having a strong odor, chances are that you have a cockroach infestation. This stench increases as the number of roaches in your house increases. The stench could be as a result of the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cockroach dropping</li>
<li>Dropping pheromone</li>
<li>Dead roaches
The odor from the dropping pheromone is even more likely to attract more roaches into the house if you do not take immediate action.
The German cockroaches who like staying indoors are the number one stench producers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-egg-capsules-">**6. ****Egg capsules **</h3>
<p>Cockroaches lay eggs in a capsule that is also called oothecae. One ootheca can contain up to 30 eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though different species have different oothecae, the most common in our houses is the German cockroaches that have 18 segments while American roaches dont have a defined segment.</li>
<li>Some roaches carry the oothecae until before it hatches while others will drop it soon after they land into a new environment.
These oothecae are brown in color and translucent in nature and are normally left behind after the eggs hatch into nymphs.</li>
<li>These capsules can be seen in hidden places like under the furniture, in cabinets, and in other hidden dark places - you can use<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/when-to-use-a-cockroach-bomb/">cockroach Bomb</a>.
When you spot the capsules, its not time to sit down and relax because cockroaches have already settled in your room.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-furniture-and-property-damage-">**7. ****Furniture and Property Damage **</h3>
<p>Cockroaches will feed on anything that they find in the surroundings including, food, fabrics, plastic, and furniture among others.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you make a keen observation within your house and find such damage, the uninvited guests are already in your house.
They destroy food packaging as they look for food for survival. Do not wait any further if you have seen these signs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-i-do-if-i-see-cockroaches-in-my-house"><strong>What do I do if I see cockroaches in my house?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches come to our houses because of many reasons but most importantly to look for food and somewhere to reproduce.
After the notable signs, you should also try to navigate their possible handouts to understand the level of their infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I were you, the best option I would take is to call a pest control expert immediately. The good thing with pest control experts is that they have the necessary experience and expertise to handle any kind of infestation.</li>
<li>Secondly, if you are a DIYer, you can get a pest control product from trusted stores and follow the given instructions to eliminate these stubborn roaches. Cockroaches are stubborn and these may not be as effective as hiring an expert.
Thirdly, observing high standards of cleanliness is also a better way of
keeping the roaches away
.
Cleaning their hideouts, their droppings, eggs, and any other dirt in your house leaves the roaches with nothing to feed or attract them into your house.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roaches will invade your building or home through various routes and then multiply rapidly. There are many
methods you can use to control roaches</p>
<ul>
<li>like roach bombs.
<strong>So, on the question - when to use a cockroach bomb? Use roach bombs when other DIY control methods don&rsquo;t work and when the infestation is massive and has proven stubborn.�</strong>
The nocturnal roaches can be noted with the oily (strong-scented) scent, empty egg casings, or droppings.
Check too:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/signs-of-a-cockroach-infestation/">Roach Infestation Signs</a>
. Check out the top roach bombs below&hellip;
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Cockroach Bomb&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="effective---when-to-use-a-cockroach-bomb">Effective? - When to Use a Cockroach Bomb?</h2>
<p>Cockroach bombs
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef643">will exterminate the bugs</a>
when you apply the chemical insecticide in the confined or enclosed space - as
explained by entomologists
.</p>
<ul>
<li>The roach-killing insecticide will be hung around the air shortly before they drop on the ground - this allows them to cover the surfaces and poison the <a href="/posts/cockroach-eggs/">cockroaches</a>.
Mainly, roach bombs and foggers will work best when positioned at the center of the spaces or room and on top of the table or chair.
The fogger contents will jump upwards - the chemical droplets to get suspended in the air for some time before slowly settling on surfaces like countertops and floors.</li>
<li>The roach bomb allows the insecticide to readily penetrate into the hidden locations, voids and cracks tokill the silverfish, ants, and cockroaches.
Carefully read the bomb instructions and adhere to their usage instructions - note that it&rsquo;s
flammable due to the petroleum distillate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="likely-issues-with-roach-bombs">Likely Issues with Roach Bombs</h2>
<p>The EPA works effectively in regulating pesticides plus those of roach bombs - this ensures the safety of the house, humans, and pets too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Key considerations include the number of roach foggers to apply in a given space or area.</li>
<li>Further, humans and pets included must vacate the space under roach treatment using the bombs.</li>
<li>Finally, the EPA recommends a thorough vacuuming, cleaning, and airing of the treated space.
Notably, if you breathe the insecticide mist, you may cause poisoning to the pets in closed doors and various areas against pets and humans.</li>
<li>Therefore, I advise you to keep off the roach-treated spaces for between 2-4 hours - and thus you&rsquo;ll avert possible poisoning or illness.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZgRbQt9JCA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZgRbQt9JCA</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-use-a-roach-bomb">Should I use a Roach bomb?</h2>
<p>But first,
total release aerosols,
roach bombs,
foggers will offer an effective and quick remedy for the bugs as they release toxic pesticides.
But also remove water and food souses to discourage cockroaches - but also seal various roach entrances and equally install
<a href="https://www.terminix.com/pest-control/cockroaches/removal/traps/">bait traps</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roach bombs are an excellent DIY, cheap, and quick bug solution if you&rsquo;re disturbed by those massive infestations.
However, using roach foggers can have some drawbacks - these may include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Roach bombs may prove toxic due to the chemical pesticides - the foggerresidue will coat the home surfaces that mayharm smaller pets like bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Foggers are equally flammable when the petroleum particles explode when there is a fire ignition such as a stove or water heater.
Further, roach bombs may be blocked by house walls - and thus the chemicals might not hit all the cockroaches that are hiding -
you&rsquo;d better use roach sprays
.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Besides roach foggers or bombs won&rsquo;t treat the roach source - it&rsquo;ll exterminate just some of the roaches in your house.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require to adequately treat yourself properly against roaches to prevent or reducing their entry into the house from outside.
But should you use�store-bought roach bombs? Are they effective? Well, don&rsquo;t pick foggers from your store as they have a bad coat and odor, plus they&rsquo;ll leave a mess.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="safety-precautions-while-using-roch-foggers">Safety Precautions while using Roch Foggers</h2>
<p>The precautions to consider in using roach bombs especially around kids, plants, and pets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that the chemicals used in those roach foggers may be toxic - thus you&rsquo;ll require to follow the usage directions - so you don&rsquo;t harm the pets and family.
Further, take care of the food containers and items - ensure they&rsquo;re covered tightly and also store the uncovered food in areas that foggers particles won&rsquo;t settle.
Note that the fogger particles may penetrate some plastics, fabric, cardboard, and paper - since some of these are porous - do, you&rsquo;ll need to cover food using non-porous materials.
Besides, you&rsquo;ll require to turn off electronics and ignition sources such as�pilot lights prior to setting off your roach bomb - as a fire may start.
Make sure the house and the premises are adequately ventilated once you&rsquo;ve completed roach bombing. Remain (plus the pets) outsides as instructed on label instructions.
Check label instructions on how to ventilate the house once you get back to the space - such as opening the windows. You may need to consult the landlord before the treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-hire-an-exterminator">Should I Hire an Exterminator?</h2>
<p>Roches will invade the home or office spaces and notoriously get challenging to control - they&rsquo;ll hide easily and are equally�resilient to pesticides.
Therefore, first try DIY roach-treatment methods such as sealing wall gaps,
boric acid
, and removing water plus food sources - but if this doesn&rsquo;t work, you&rsquo;ll need a roach expert.
So, consult some pest management expert to find the bugs plus their sources and finally treat them. So, consult that expert bug professional to help.
Roaches do pose a significant public health problem for many homeowners - they&rsquo;ll help identify the harborage points where roaches may hide.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on the question - when to use a <a href="/posts/cockroach-vs-palmetto-bug/">cockroach</a> bomb? Use roach bombs when other DIY control methods don&rsquo;t work and when the infestation is massive and has proven stubborn.</p>
