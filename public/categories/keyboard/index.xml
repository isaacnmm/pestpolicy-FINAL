LED which will give you a clear visual clue of the gain reduction in your instrument. Most compressor pedals lack this feature, hence, making the MXR M87 stand out among others.
The M87 comes loaded with an instruction manual that is extremely helpful as it gives clear guidelines on how to set up your instrument quickly. Thus, making it the best bass compressor pedals for beginners.
Many musicians including live performers and those on recording studio praise the M87 because of its transparent nature. I love the fact that it doesnt alter the tone, hence you get to hear and feel your sound more clearly.

<p>Just like Ampeg Opto Comp, the Boss LMB-3 Bass is a great choice for those on a budget. This compressor pedal is inexpensive, yet extremely reliable.</p>
<p>Dont get turned off by the limiter label, a limiter is a compressor with a high ratio. Meaning its threshold is quite high, thus only the higher peaks get affected.
However, its good to know that you can easily adjust your LMB-3 ratio from 1:1, 2:1, 8:1 up to 1 which is considered a hard peak limit.
So in essence, the LMB-3 covers a wide variety of dynamic response compared to most compressor pedals</p>

<p>The Bassist Compressor employs a special IC chip (THAT Corporation 4320). This IC chipsets this compressor apart because of its powerful integrated circuit which you can only find in studio-grade compressors.</p>
<p>Youll appreciate the few controls that this Bassist compressor has to offer. It features an on/off button, compression, threshold, and gain. As such, its unbelievably easy to use.
This compressor is powered using a 9v power supply or a 9v battery. You can set your compression from 1:1 to 1: infinity. You can easily set the threshold control with your eyes or ears. If you want your compression at a lower level, just turn your threshold button counterclockwise.
To know if you have reached compression the indicator LED will change from green to red. Youll use the gain knob to modify the output level. You can also use the gain knob as a booster when turned up higher or it can compensate for a reduction in compression.
If you want a
*simple yet effective pedal compressor *
*to choose the *
Bassist. This pedal is ideal for conventional use and will give you an array of sounds from snappy to smooth. The good thing is that its very transparent, hence, blocks unwanted color, sustain, or tone to your performance.</p>
<h3 id="5-markbass-tube-bass-compressore"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003066QPO?tag=p-policy-20">5. Markbass Tube Bass Compressore</a></h3>
