      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does WD 40 work like a paint cleaner, a lubricant, or a degreaser? How effective is WD 40 when used in automobile service or with
sprayer for latex paint
?</p>
<p><em>So, does WD 40 remove paint? The direct answer is YES. WD 40 is a powerful organic compound with a complex hydrocarbon that&rsquo;ll break the paint molecular bonds instantly, thus allow easier stripping.�</em>
<em>WD 40 works effectively on surfaces such as metal, plastic (but not clear polystyrene and polycarbonate), sealed wood, ceramics, leather fabrics, glass, Automotive parts, rubber, laminated paper and painted walls without any problems.�</em>

<p><em>It should also not be applied on surfaces such as naked stones/not sealed, suede, unfinished wood, non-laminated papers, electronics casing, cushioned material, and unpainted walls.�</em>
<em>WD 40 is not suitable for large surface area (due to economic reasons). Notably, the right application of WD 40 leads to excellent paint removal without causing surface destruction or distortion.�</em>

<h3 id="a-active-ingredients-in-wd-40">a. Active ingredients in WD 40</h3>
<p>WD 40 is a hydrocarbon compound whose main ingredients entail petroleum-based paraffin, aliphatic hydrocarbon (which is similar to kerosene), carbon Dioxide, and aliphatic hydrocarbons.
These Ingredients are specially formulated (some may be omitted according to the intended use of a particular WD 40 product) and combine chemically for effective action upon application.
Indeed,� WD 40 comes with super active agents, which breaks the molecular bonds in the paint (within 3 to 5 minutes), thus forming a thick viscous compound that is easier to strip. Moreover, the solvent features a high penetrative property that works effectively on the dense paint coating.
WD 40 is a less flammable, highly impressive and anti-leak product which integrates hygroscopic characteristic that eliminates the moisture on the surface instantly.
However, the excess application causes humid accumulation from the surrounding, leading to rusting in some surfaces like chain drives.�For effective paint removal, WD 40 works best for a small area.

<h3 id="b-types-of-paint-removed">b. Types of paint Removed</h3>
<p>WD 40 will clean both latex and water-based paint. The solvent shows the best performance when used on wet paint than a dry one. However, WD 40 cures dry paint perfectly, thus allowing smooth stripping without much hassle.
Old paint on surfaces such as car bodies, metal coating, and composites may take longer to quench. Therefore, you should use alternative paint removers/thinner (highlighted in this article).
Oil-based paint shows longer stripping time as compared to water-based paint. The cure time varies with nature and base-components in which the particular type of paint is manufactured.
In this regard, the drop test experiment is vital in establishing the efficiency of WD 40 on a particular surface.

<h3 id="c-application-surfacesarea-of-use">c. Application Surfaces/Area of Use</h3>
<p>For the paint removal process, you can use WD 40 on surfaces such metal (stainless steel, aluminum, chrome, etc.), plastic (but not clear polystyrene and polycarbonate), sealed wood, leather fabrics, ceramics, glass, Automotive parts, laminated paper, rubber and painted walls without affecting the quality of the original surface of the material.
The named surfaces should be polished or cleaned before application to achieve the best results. You should use a large amount of WD 40 for effective action, and multiple layer sections should be covered well to avoid unnecessary removal from the surrounding.</p>
<h3 id="d-surfaces-not-to-use-wd-40">d. Surfaces Not to Use WD 40</h3>
<p>Never use WD 40 on firearms. This product is hygroscopic (attracts water); thus, it will accumulate moisture on the surface leading to rust or explosion.
Surfaces like chain drives are not recommended since WD 40 is not a lubricant -� it also accelerates the wear and tears on the moving part (not a lubricant).
Further, you should avoid using WD 40 over a large surface area (due to economic reasons) and areas such as non-laminated papers, naked stones/not sealed, suede, unfinished wood, cushioned material, electronics casing, and unpainted  WD 40 may stain the surfaces, corrode or ever damage the upper layer during the paint removal process.
A necessary precaution to consider is the drop test experiment that helps in confirmation of paint removal efficiency.

<ol>
<li>Clean the surface you intend to remove paint - use paintbrush</li>
<li>Administer drop test to ascertain the quality and efficiency of WD 40 on the surface</li>
<li>Spray the painted surface sufficiently and leave it for 3 to 6 minutes to quench  forms a thick viscous fluid</li>
<li>Using the scrapper, strip the broken paint and wipe using the paintbrush</li>
<li>Soak the sponge in the detergent and clean the surface  it helps remove the trace of WD 40 left during paint removal</li>
<li>Wet the piece of cloth and wipe the surface to dryness.</li>
<li>Repeat this procedure on other surfaces too.
In case WD 40 does not remove the paint entirely on the surface, I recommend that you choose other substitutes discussed in this article.
However, it would help if you considered the concentration aspect of WD 40 in relation to the thickness of paint before application. Otherwise, you may end up being frustrated by shoddy results.</li>
