However, the soundbar&rsquo;s overhead effect will require a reflective and flat ceiling surface at up to 12 feet above your speakers. Thus, this soundbar won&rsquo;t work well with non-reflective, drop ceilings, and angled ceilings - particularly when they&rsquo;re above the recommended height.
Further, the speakers have Dolby Atmos and hence with the right conditions in your room, a 20-degree angle will allow the sound to readily bounce off your ceiling to your position. But you&rsquo;ll get both high value and high-tech soundbar in this VIZIO SB36512-F6.
