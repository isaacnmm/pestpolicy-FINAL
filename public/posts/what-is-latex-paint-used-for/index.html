  <div class="post-content"><p>Various types of paints are manufactured in certain forms and concentrations in order to serve a given purpose. Perhaps you have come across <a href="/posts/how-to-remove-latex-paint-from-concrete/">latex</a> in your place and wonder where its best used for. Can latex <a href="/posts/how-to-remove-latex-paint-from-metal/">paint</a> be applied to concrete or furniture?</p>
<p><em>So, what is latex paint used for? Latex paint can be used on surfaces such as concrete slabs, drywall, concrete blocks, prepped furniture/wood, interior finish, fiberglass surfaces, metallic surfaces, aluminum siding, masonry, art, and craft.�</em>
<em>However, the right concentration and proper procedure should be followed when applying latex paint to achieve the best final finish. Otherwise, you may end up experiencing some of the problems associated with latex paint, as highlighted in this article.</em></p>
<h2 id="details-what-is-latex-paint-used-for">Details: What is Latex Paint Used For?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#details-what-is-latex-paint-used-for">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="a-concrete-slabs-and-concrete-blocks">a. Concrete slabs and concrete blocks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-concrete-slabs-and-concrete-blocks">¶</a></h3>
<p>Concrete slabs and blocks can be painted using latex paint without any stickiness problem. The paint molecules act instantly upon contact and cure in a couple of minutes. Besides, latex paint penetrates deeper into the wet concrete surface without affecting the structural formulation.
During the application process, you will need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the slab/block surface with a paintbrush  to remove the debris and inclusions</li>
<li>Prepare the primer and latex paint in the right concentration as instructed by the manufacturer</li>
<li>Apply the acrylic latex primer and leave it to cure for 1 hour</li>
<li>Finish with latex coat
NB: You may need to apply 2 or 3 coats according to the primary concrete textures nature. Moreover, sanding is needed when carrying out paint restoration.

</ol>
<h3 id="b-drywall">b. Drywall<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#b-drywall">¶</a></h3>
<p>Drywall mainly includes stonewall, wooden wall, metallic wall, concrete wall, or composite wall. Either of these walls can be painted using latex paint as long as the initial condition is dried thoroughly. Wetness affects the stickiness of the latex paint upon a given primary material and weakens flow-ability during application.
Direct application can be carried out on a metallic wall, wooden wall, or composite without prepping. However, the stonewall requires initial polishing or cleaning to improve paint stickiness during application.
Follow the procedure below during allocation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-clean the wall to be painted with a paintbrush. You can sand where necessary to remove debris.</li>
<li>Dilute latex primer (where necessary) and latex paint as per the manufacturers instruction</li>
<li>Apply the primer (for the stonewall)</li>
<li>Finally, paint the wall evenly with latex paint
Do not sand the painted surface whatsoever  this may affect the finish appearance or dislodge the primary material.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="c-prepped-furniturewood">c. Prepped furniture/wood<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#c-prepped-furniturewood">¶</a></h3>
<p>Latex paint is best for unfinished wood, prepped furniture, or dry surface wood composite. The paint molecules stick on the primary surface sufficiently and dry in a couple of minutes.
Peeling action is limited if proper procedure is followed while the edge chipping wont occur for fine cut wooden blocks. Besides, latex paint has minimal dripping when applying on a wooden surface that concrete wall.
Follow the steps h8ighlighted below when painting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sand the wooden surface/furniture to eliminate roughness or dirt particle  blow of dust</li>
<li>Dilute the latex paint to the right concentration</li>
<li>Apply the paint evenly over the surface and leave it to cure for 3 hours</li>
<li>You can apply 2 or 3 coats over a given surface according to material finish demands.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="d-interior-finish">d. Interior finish<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#d-interior-finish">¶</a></h3>
<p>Use of latex paint best finishes Interior work. This could either be concrete wall finish, wooden partitioning, metallic lining, or flooring. Latex paint is a water-based compound; thus, its easier to remove/clean during surface paint restoration or color change.
Besides, latex paint is less/non-flammable  reduces the spread of fire in case of such accidents. You will need to access the interior surface you intend to paint and match the best latex paint as per the manufacturers directives.
Latex paint is ideal when used as an undercoat for interior walls or furniture. Primer or prepping is need for material such as composites and ceramics to achieve the best stickiness strength.
Follow the steps below during application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fine clean interior surface to eliminate dust and debris</li>
<li>Dilute latex paint appropriately  use manufacturers guide</li>
<li>Apply gently over the surface and leave it to cure</li>
<li>Repeat the procedure for subsequent coatings</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="e-fiberglass-surfaces">e. Fiberglass surfaces<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#e-fiberglass-surfaces">¶</a></h3>
<p>Latex paint is entirely soaked and drained into the fiberglass material without any reaction. The paint molecules form a tough surface coating/layer that is further embedded in the fiberglass material  the latex paint formulation instantly sticks on the fiberglass upon application.
However, latex paint is easily washed out if exposed to wet or humid conditions. The peeling action of latex paint coating is minimal on fiberglass as compared to concrete and wooden surfaces.
Follow the steps highlighted below during application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sand and dust the fiberglass surface perfectly with sandpaper  smoothens the surface to improve stickiness action</li>
<li>Prepare latex paint and prep where necessary (especially when restoring the surface)</li>
<li>Using a paintbrush, apply latex paint gently  froth and back horizontally, then up and down
NB: Never sand the fiberglass surface after painting  sanding affects primary surface microstructure and latex paint finish appearance.

</ol>
<h3 id="f-metallic-surfaces-and-aluminum-siding">f. Metallic surfaces and Aluminum siding<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#f-metallic-surfaces-and-aluminum-siding">¶</a></h3>
<p>Latex paint sticks excellently on the metallic surface of material such as cast iron, mild steel, chrome, aluminum, and copper. However, high gloss metallic surface/high polished surfaces require prepping to improve stickiness ability when painting.
You can use latex paint for aluminum siding too. The latex paint coats the aluminum surface nicely and prevents it from fading or cracking, resulting in other oil-based paint.
Follow the procedure below during latex paint application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the metal surface to remove debris, dust, or roughness  you can polish with sandpaper where appropriate</li>
<li>Prepare latex paint in the right concentration</li>
<li>Apply the paint gently over the metal surface to achieve a uniform coat</li>
<li>Repeat step 3 for the next layer if necessary
NB: Do not sand metal after painting.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="g-art-and-craft">g. Art and Craft<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#g-art-and-craft">¶</a></h3>
<p>Latex paint is manufactured in various colors that work incredibly for art and craft activities. Latex paint maintains natural texture and quality design, which dries quickly. Moreover, latex paint sticks instantly on artistic surfaces such as wood, canvas, metal, composites, and stone carvings.
Usually, you will need to prepare the surface ready for artwork appropriately and mix latex paint in the right concentration to achieve the best outlook design.
NB: Avoid excess dilution or thick coating as it may peel off when abrasive force is directly applied.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-major-problems-associated-with-latex-paint">What are Major Problems Associated with Latex Paint?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-major-problems-associated-with-latex-paint">¶</a></h2>
<p>Latex paint is not only coupled with numerous advantages; it also has some problems that crop up here and there during preparation, application, or final result.�Some of the main problems of latex paint include:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Less durable.**Latex paint defaces (when exposed to direct sun) faster than oil-based paints. Therefore, it requires repetitive painting after a given period to maintain its original stunning outlook.</li>
<li>**Its are packed in large quantities.**Latex paint is manufactured and packed in large quantities, unlike oil-based paint that comes in small containers. The structural formula has less concentration strength, and thus minimal dilution is carried out before painting. Therefore, a large quantity of latex paint is needed to cover a surface area.</li>
<li>**Less elastic or low expansion.**The chemical formula used in the manufacture of latex paint is static and doesnt allow elongation. Therefore, the application is a little bit tedious than oil-based paints.</li>
<li><strong>Dripping/drains</strong>. Latex paint drips when painting due to its inelastic bond properties. Latex drains form an uneven layer on the surface being painted if an excess amount is applied.</li>
<li>**The Peeling off/**<strong>Alligatoring</strong>. Latex paints peel off often from most surfaces if left for a long time before restoration. On the other hand, the paint can peel off due to high humid conditions or wetness, unlike oil-based paint.</li>
<li>**Blistering/bubbling.**This condition occurs on the old latex painted surface where the air bubbles are concealed within the painted layer before peeling off. Naturally, blistering accelerates multiple paint peel or and chipping.</li>
</ol>
