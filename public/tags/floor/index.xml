<h3 id="step-1--preparation-and-greatventilation">Step #1 -Preparation and GreatVentilation</h3>
<p>Its important to get prepared and organized to effeycively conduct the garage painting project. Assemble the material and tools - near the floors to reduce stains and unccessry movement.
Thoroughly repair and clean the concrete floor in your garage prio
r to painting. This removes grease and oil stains that may affect the bonding of paint and bleed on the paint finish.</p>
<p>Check the temperature and surface preparation plus paint usage instructions. Ensure the garage floor is not too high or too long
(with the right humidity) - and it must also be correctly prepared.</p>
<h3 id="step-2---provide-adequate-ventilation">Step #2 - Provide Adequate Ventilation</h3>
<p>Maintain great air outflow and inflow - and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/sanding-walls-before-painting/">sand walls before painting</a>
. This is because there will be toxic paint fumes that may lead to breathing complications and other health issues.
Further, take adequate precautions to reduce the chances of dangerous exposure to different harmful fumes to yourself, humans, pets, and the home environment.
Conduct cross ventilation in your garage by having enough windows or installing a running fan for effective ventilation - blowing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highly_toxic_gases">toxic fumes</a>
to the outside.</p>
<h3 id="step-2---floor-preparation">Step #2 - Floor Preparation</h3>
<p>The next step will involve cleaning your garage floor. You&rsquo;ll use a wet-dry vacuum or a broom to effectively remove the debris stuck on the floor.
Also, use a stiff brush or degreaser to remove all the grease stuck on the floor surface. Next, thoroughly rinse your degreaser and give it time to dry - you can use a
pressure washer
to remove tough stains.
Using the scraper, keenly scrape off the hard dirt and then apply your degreaser. The dirt particles could otherwise bar the paint from effectively bonding with the garage floor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll use a detergent-like<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001GOGQW/?tag=p-policy-20">Savogran Trisodium Phosphate</a>to effectively wash your garage.</li>
<li>Ensure to apply the detergent on the notable stains - leave for 10-20 minutes depending on toughness.</li>
<li>Use the garden hose (with a high-pressure nozzle) to flush down standing liquids and lather.
Clean out the excess water (don&rsquo;t over-wetting the surface) and allow the concrete to dry.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-3---cover-theconcretecracks">Step #3 - Cover theï¿½Concreteï¿½Cracks</h3>
<p>After inspecting the concrete floor, you&rsquo;ll need to fill up the clear floor cracks. The concrete cracks may cause cracks on the floor finish - so you&rsquo;ll need to repair the flaws.</p>
<p>You can use a repair compound for the small cracks on the concrete floor - this helps fill up the patches. But get the concrete patch to repair deeper and wider cracks - leave layers to dry for some time.</p>
<p>I recommend you get some wet rag that&rsquo;ll help you remove the excess concrete patch and thus leave you with a much smoother floor. Allow the surface to dry.</p>
<h3 id="step-4---time-foretch-concrete">Step #4 - Time forï¿½Etch Concrete</h3>
<p>It is now time to etch treat the concrete floor (
maybe muriatic acid
) that&rsquo;ll open the pores a and hence it&rsquo;ll get a rough feel and look - like sandpaper. So, it&rsquo;ll be easier for the paint to adhere to the surface.
Che
ck and adhere to the label instructions. Otherwise, you can use a sander to get the same surface aspect. But ensure to finally clean the
<a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/health/case_studies/airborne_dust_p.html">dust</a>
and sand from the concrete.</p>
<h3 id="step-4--prime-the-surface-and-paint-the-concrete">Step #4 -ï¿½Prime the Surface and Paint the Concrete</h3>
<p>Finally, coming to the last step s - it is now time to apply a suitable primer - but ensure the surface is dry enough. A roller helps spread the prime over the floor edges - for better bonding and adhesion.
Next, its painting time - spread the 1st concrete floor paint but ensure it is keenly mixed for better adhesion onto the garage floor concrete.
I would recommend you get some nylon brush for 1st paint coat application. Gently apply the first coat and leave it to dry (air-drying) for about 24 hours.
Next, it is time for the second paint coat - make the second coat slightly thicker - you&rsquo;ll need to use a
roller
this time around. Also, ensure to clean the tools using water plus detergent.
Also, leave the fans running for faster drying and also remove any fumes sticking around in the room. Allow the paint to dry for roughly 24 to 48 hours to avoid paint smudging.
