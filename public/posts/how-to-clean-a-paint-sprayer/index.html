<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-prep-a-room-for-paint/">painting service</a>
doesnt come without the challenges of cleaning a paint sprayer.</p>
<p>Worst of it all occurs when you choose to store a paint sprayer before cleaning is done. Indeed, that may be the end of quality performance for your spray painter. Could you be experiencing such problems?
<em>Well, in this article, we shall be discussing how to clean a paint sprayer. To begin with, you need to select required items, release air pressure, flush the remaining paint, clean up the pump system, and rinse the spray gun with thinner before scrubbing to remove stuck paint.�</em>
<em>Besides, you will have to detach the nozzle/tip and clean it thoroughly, clean various filters independently, rinse the hosepipe, and wipe the prayers surface to remove any paint traces before leaving it to dry. Importantly, you must consider the type of paint used by that particular sprayer (whether water-based or oil-based paint) for efficient thinning action.�</em></p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-problems-of-using-uncleaned-paint-sprayer">What are the Problems of Using Uncleaned Paint Sprayer?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-the-problems-of-using-uncleaned-paint-sprayer">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using an uncleaned paint sprayer is not recommended as it may lead to some of the problems highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-blockage">1. Blockage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-blockage">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the paint is left within the channels of a paint sprayer, it dries and blocks the pathway.
The subsequent spray action is hampered and the efficiency lowered. Usually, the spray gun is highly affected than the piping network.
The filters pores get blocked (limiting suction and sieve ability), while the nozzle and the tip lose effectiveness in the paint removal action. Internal paint blockage is common in most paint sprayers and narrows the pathway.
When the paint dries internally, the cleaning process may even be more cumbersome, especially in the case of oil-based paints.</p>
<h3 id="2-poor-paint-finish-quality">2. Poor Paint Finish Quality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-poor-paint-finish-quality">¶</a></h3>
<p>Clean paint sprayer delivers excellent paint coat finish. However, an uncleaned paint sprayer creates a low-quality paint finish, which may have surface drains or runs.
The insufficient pressure within the system network creates a low impact force, which leads to lesser adhesive contact during paint application.
Besides, the paint solvent is not well atomized and hence leads to incomplete contact strength.
Air may be sucked through the system (instead of paint) due to suction filter failure leading to an insufficiently painted surface finish.</p>

<h3 id="3-channel-clogging">3. Channel Clogging<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-channel-clogging">¶</a></h3>
<p>The paint sprayers channel clogs due to the continuous use of the paint sprayer without subsequent cleaning.
This problem is pronounced when the paint sprayer is used to handle different paints (oil-based paint or water-based paint)
Metallic paint sprayers are highly affected by clogging problems as compared to plastic counterparts.
Usually, the paint particles cling to the inner parts of the channel and accumulate with time. Upon drying, the paint layer forms a tough lining, which is more cumbersome to remove.</p>
<h3 id="4-extra-running-cost">4. Extra running Cost<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-extra-running-cost">¶</a></h3>
<p>Clogged or blocked paint sprayer parts may be more cumbersome to clean. Therefore, such parts are best when replaced. This calls for an extra cost.
Repairing blocked or damaged pump/filters are quite expensive. Such maintenance costs can be cut down by practicing better cleaning procedures as highlighted in this article.
Often, the nozzle and paint gun get fatigued due to internal strain resulting from paint clog. Such parts may require subsequent replacement  there are very few paint nozzles that can be repaired.</p>

<h3 id="5-frequent-breakdown-and-repair">5. Frequent Breakdown and Repair<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-frequent-breakdown-and-repair">¶</a></h3>
<p>Continuous straining of the paint sprayer leads to an entire breakdown due to internal blockage and clogging within the sprayers channels.
The compressor or the motor gets fatigued as it tries to overcome internal resistance due to paint clog, leading to failure eventually.
Moreover, the paint gun may block or fail to function (atomize) leading to total or partial failure. Repair of failed parts of a paint sprayer is carried out often if the paint sprayer is not cleaned after use.</p>
<h3 id="6-incomplete-atomization">6. Incomplete Atomization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-incomplete-atomization">¶</a></h3>
<p>Incomplete atomization is a situation that happens due to interior blockage, clogging or parts malfunction.
The paint molecules fail to be converted into particle form (atomization), which is need to form a paint coat layer upon contact with the surface under paint application.
Incomplete paint atomization leads to a low-quality paint coat layer and uneven paint finish.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance-tips-for-a-paint-sprayer">Maintenance Tips for a Paint Sprayer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#maintenance-tips-for-a-paint-sprayer">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to improve service life and lower running costs of your paint sprayer, proper use and maintenance tips highlighted below should be followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always follow the manufacturers instructions when setting up your paint sprayer.</li>
<li>Often, carry out check-up and diagnosis for your paint sprayer to assess any part failure.</li>
<li>Clean your paint sprayer immediately after finishing your painting activity to prevent internal clogging or blocking.</li>
<li>Failed nozzle and nozzle tip should be replaced with a similar model to prevent paint efficiency loss.</li>
<li>Motors and sprayer pumps should be prioritized during a check-up, while any internal shock should be attended to immediately before system failure.</li>
<li>Use a paint sprayer as per the directives given by the manufacturer  an oil-based paint sprayer should be used with oil-based paints and vice versa.</li>
<li>Replace old parts of the paint sprayer with new ones (of the same model) in order to improve its efficiency and paint coat quality.</li>
<li>When repairing filters, consider the type of filter and match the model where possible always.</li>
<li>The piston pump should be greased regularly (as advised) to improve functionality.</li>
</ol>

<p>By choosing to read this article on how to clean a paint sprayer, I believe you gained a deeper insight on how to improve your cleaning techniques and boost the sprayers service life.
The cleaning process requires you to select the right cleaning items, release air pressure in the system, flush the remaining paint, clean up the pump system, and rinse the spray gun with thinner before scrubbing to remove stuck paint.
Moreover, you will have to detach the nozzle/tip and clean it thoroughly, clean various filters independently, rinse the hosepipe, and wipe the prayers surface to remove any paint traces before leaving it to dry.
Importantly, you must consider the type of paint used by that particular sprayer (whether water-based or oil-based paint) for efficient thinning action.
It&rsquo;s advisable to follow the manufacturers manual/instruction and precautions highlighted in this article when cleaning your paint sprayer. Dont forget to wear protective gear when cleaning for safety purposes.</p>
