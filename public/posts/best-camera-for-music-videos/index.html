<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video">music videos</a>
never come easy. It depends on the quality of the cameras you use to shoot the videos like the
one-shot music video
.
A quality video is what builds your reputation as a great filmmaker - maybe a
Mac for music production
. These cameras will perform great for wildlife, sports, or landscape photography.</p>
<h2 id="1-canon-eos-full-frame-5d-mark-iv-digital-slr-camera--1-pick">1. Canon EOS Full-Frame 5D Mark IV Digital SLR <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CN2G19Z/?tag=p-policy-20">Camera -#1 Pick</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-canon-eos-full-frame-5d-mark-iv-digital-slr-camera--1-pick">¶</a></h2>
<p>This 5D Mark IV is a mainstream pro-SLR, LCD screen (high resolution), 30MP sensor, and 7 frames_per_second shooting. It has great autofocus and can shoot your 4K music videos internally - for videographers and photographers.</p>
<p>On design and controls, the full-frame body 5D Mark IV weighs 1.8 pounds plus it&rsquo;s moderately sized (4.6 * 5.9 * 3.0 inches). It has no vertical shooting grip such as that in Nikon D5 but you can add a battery grip (BG-E20).

</ul>
<p>Other features I love are the Dual Pixel RAW with
phase-detection points
(fine-tuning shots
maximum sharpness
) and 30.4 MP. This 4K DSLR camera is significantly priced and 60 grams lighter compared to its predecessor.
It has mic and headphone jacks, which allows better audio control. You can also record in 1080/50,60p  an excellent feature for slow-motion and broadcasting. I love that the camera has a superior (AF) Autofocus system and can film 4K videos (DCI 4K - 40962160 ) internally even in harshly lighted places.
It has both the DIGIC 6+ &amp; the DIGIC 6 processors (that allow continuous shooting - about 7.0 fps)  where the later doing metering and the following do all other tasks such as the AF system (61-point) - for greater focus accuracy.
With the AF systems sensitive being downed to -3EV (and being -4EV for Live View), youll have no problem getting focus with poor light. It has innovative sensor technology thats also used in 80D and has ISO100-32000 native sensitivity.

</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives large 4K videos</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="considerations-in-choosing-the-best-camera-for-music-videos-">**Considerations in Choosing the Best Camera for Music Videos **<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#considerations-in-choosing-the-best-camera-for-music-videos-">¶</a></h2>
<p>**1. Camera Sensor and **
<strong>Autofocus</strong>
The performance of a camera will highly depend on the type and size of the sensor. Of course, higher pixels combined with the large-sized sensor results in better resolution. Thats because they can capture more details in an instance compared to those with low resolution.
The advantage of high resolution is that it allows you to crop your images without diminishing their quality. So, you should consider the camera sensor configuration depending on your desired level of resolution.
Autofocus, usually written as the AF system, is a technology that is gaining a lot of popularity in camera making technologies. AF system enables you to focus on the targeted scene with better accuracy.
**2. Viewfinder and **
<strong>Image Stabilization</strong>
Sometimes, its common to concentrate on the cameras pixels and forget the viewfinder. A viewfinder allows you to select and capture the intended details only. In this, you choose the subject using a frame.
An adequate viewfinder will capture only the selected features and block everything outside the frame. So, when choosing your camera to ensure it comes with a viewfinder sufficient to ensure you get the desired results.
This is a technology built into a mirrorless camera or lens to help reduce blurs that occur due to camera motion. It works by automatically adjusting the position of the camera lens to compensate for the tilt and pan induced by a shaky camera. Thus, you can shoot videos while holding the camera with your hands and still get high-quality images.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
