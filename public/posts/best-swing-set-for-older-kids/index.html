<h2 id="considerations-in-best-swing-set-for-older-kids">Considerations in Best Swing Set for Older Kids<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#considerations-in-best-swing-set-for-older-kids">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-size-of-your-backyard">1. Size of Your Backyard<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-size-of-your-backyard">¶</a></h3>
<p>When buying a playset take into consideration how the set is configured. It is vital to remember that enough space is needed to install a complete play structure.
You are probably overwhelmed about what features to look out for when buying the best playset for your kids.�Well, weve done all the groundwork and put together important aspects you should consider before buying a swing set.
Most manufacturers give the dimensions for each swing set. Check to see that these sizes match your backyard space before making a purchase. You should also consider the appropriate safety space needed while installing the swing set.
Industry-standard for safe residential playground equipment recommends leaving a space of 6-foot on all the four sides around the perimeter. So, when measuring your yard space, add 12-feet extra to the dimension given.</p>
<h3 id="2-safety">2. Safety<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-safety">¶</a></h3>
<p>Safety for your family should be the first thing you look out for when purchasing a swing set.�Ensure that you select a playset that has durable and soft materials.
But first;�Are you looking for a swing set that your kids will use even in the future? Or one that theyll use only as kids? Are you planning to have more kids? Do you often entertain your friends and their children?
A swing set that is safe has its edges rounded or covered. Thus, kids are protected from injuries.�Also, select playsets that have plastic caps that cover edges to ensure safety.
Rubber grips are another safety option that you should consider. Rubber grips are placed on the swing chains to prevent injuries to fingers. Thus, enable the kids to swing without getting injured.</p>
<h3 id="3-future-use">3. Future Use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-future-use">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a parent, you may want to make a swing set investment that is viable even as the child grows. You should, therefore, look out for playset features that can be changed as the child gets bigger.
Well, all the above questions are important to determine the kind of playset or swing set you might want to consider. You and Your kids deserve a swing set that you will regularly enjoy for years.
Hence, it important to choose a playset that is built to last and safe for your family. You should also consider a set that can be used by multiple children if you intend to have a large family.�Therefore, buying a set that children will use as they grow up saves money and time.</p>
<h3 id="4-materials-used">4. Materials Used<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-materials-used">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many swing set manufacturers use wood, metal, or plastic as ground materials.
Plastic models are considered safe and inexpensive, while wood is easy to repair as well as environmentally friendly. Other popular materials that manufacturers use include;
Yellow cedar, northern white cedar, and red cedar- these woods are durable and are rot-resistant. However, they lack density, and parents may need to have tools in handy to fasten bolts or screws.
Redwood- this wood is durable, thus perfect for swing sets. It does not rot or decay quickly. When buying a playset check out one that is made of quality redwood if considering a playset made of wood.
Pinewood swing sets are also another option to consider. Pinewood is durable and weather resistant. However, you might need to paint it to bring out its beauty. Look for a playset that is made of Pressure-treated pine wood because it guarantees durability.</p>
<h3 id="5-weight-limit">5. Weight Limit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-weight-limit">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you wish to join your kids while in their outdoor activities, you might want to consider a playset that can accommodate more weight.
When buying a swing set, always consider the weight capacity of the structure. This way, youll also get to have fun with your kids.
Plastic is a great material to consider, especially if you are worried about constant maintenance, wasps, or splinters. An awesome fact with the plastic swing set is that they are low-priced and safe.
Stainless steel- this product is mainly used to make metal swing sets. Swing sets made of stainless less steel are long-lasting and durable compared to plastic or wood.
When buying a metal swing set, purchase one that is made of stainless steel. Stainless steel products guarantee durability, great design, and ease of customization. They are also easy to assemble and maintain.</p>
<h3 id="6-budget">6. Budget<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-budget">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your budget will determine the kind of swing set youll get. The good thing is that swing sets are many, and there must be one that fits your budget.
Youll only need to carefully plan and check this guide for directions. Swing sets range from $100-5,000; the options are endless.
Since you are now aware of what materials and features you need to consider, you should not be overwhelmed about finding a safe set that meets your budget.
However, I must inform you that finding a swing set under $1000 that will withstand the test of time will be a challenge. A quality swing set might be approximately $1,500.
You should also leave adequate space that will allow your kids to jump or drop off from the swings, and enough space for sliding off from the slides. Other than leaving adequate space, ensure that your yard is clear of things that might bring injuries like rocks, trees, or fences.
You may also want to think about the future when buying a swing set. Will you construct a pool or any other outdoor structure in the coming years? Will you leave space for your pet? Will you need a garden?</p>
