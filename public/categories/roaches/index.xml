The liquid baits are contained in small semitransparent plastic sacks called bait stations. To be able to use the bait station, you have to simply activate it by breaking off the cap piece and keeping it near the fire ants.

<h3 id="7-invicta-gold-cockroach-gel"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049I6CT2/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>7. Invicta Gold Cockroach Gel</strong></a></h3>
<p>Invicta gold cockroach gel is the ultimate pesticide for getting rid of the tough German roaches out of your house.</p>
<p>This ready to use cockroach gel comes in a pack of 4 35 grams tubes and a plunger. Its active ingredient is Imidacloprid, a very potent insecticide for exterminating the tough German cockroaches.
The limitation of this gel to German roaches may seem like a downside. But again, it makes sense, owing to the persistence and averseness of German roaches to pesticides.
Professional pest exterminators recommend using Invicta gold roach bait together with another bait to kill all roach species in your house.
In addition to its active ingredient, Invicta contains 11 different types of attractants, which make irresistible to German cockroaches.
The gel can be used to get rid of roaches even in small cracks and other unreachable areas. In addition, Invict roach gel lasts up to 3 months.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kills German roaches</li>
<li>Highly potent attractants</li>
<li>Non-disgusting odour</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works only on German roaches</li>

<h2 id="factors-to-consider-for-best-roach-killer"><strong>Factors To Consider for Best Roach Killer�</strong></h2>
<p>I have already reviewed the best cockroach killers in the market. But theres one more thing! Lets look at some of the considerations you should bear in mind before you go shopping for cockroach pesticides.</p>
<h3 id="strength"><strong>Strength</strong></h3>
<p>Usually, the strength of cockroach killers depends on the form in which it takes.
While some pesticides last for a few weeks, others may last up to a year. Traps last longer than sprays, while sprays last longer than powders.</p>
<h3 id="targeted-pests-">**Targeted Pests **</h3>
<p>Not all pesticides are formulated for cockroaches. So when buying pest killers, choose the ones that are meant to attract and kill cockroaches.
Even better, choose pesticides that are formulated to eliminate other pests in addition to cockroaches.</p>
<h3 id="usage-">**Usage **</h3>
<p>Normally, most cockroach pesticides are formulated for both indoors and outdoors. If your pesticides are targeted in areas that serve food, a lot of care should be taken not to poison the foot.
Where possible, buy pesticides whose ingredients are food-grade. Besides, follow the directions carefully.</p>
<h3 id="count"><strong>Count</strong></h3>
<p>Just as cockroach infestations come in different extents, so do pesticide quantities. The counts are other depending on the nature of the product.
Typically pesticides are available in tubes, liters, dozens, etc. So, depending on the extent of your roach infestation, you need to know how much you require.
For example, you may talk of 3 tubes of gel, two dozen bait traps, 5 liters of spray, etc.</p>
<h3 id="pets-and-kids-safe"><strong>Pets and kids Safe</strong></h3>
<p>Kids and pets will be curious whenever they see something new in the house. Therefore cockroach killers can be very dangerous when not used properly.
Its however, advisable to buy roach killers that do not pose a lot of danger to kids and pets. Follow the directions of any pesticide carefully to ascertain the threats.</p>
<h3 id="dimensions-">**Dimensions **</h3>
<p>When dealing with cockroach traps, the size of the trap matters a lot.�Small-sized traps are better because they dont look clumsy around the area or along walking paths. For gels and sprays, size does not matter.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>You dont have to live with cockroaches anymore! Its not the right time to call a professional exterminator, either. With the right kind of pesticide, you can say goodbye to roaches and other small pests in your house.
The products in this review are all best-selling remedies for cockroach infestation. Among these products, Bengal Gold Roach Spray turns out to be the best. Its handy and affordable.</p>

<p>Natural/biological pest control remedies like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-eats-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/)/">Bed Bug Predators</a>
have now become popular. So, do roaches <a href="/posts/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">eat</a> bed bugs?
**Simple answer, YES  Cockroaches are known predators of bed bugs, which wreak havoc in millions of homes. However, only some species of cockroaches eat bed bugs. **
<strong>Particularly the American and the German cockroaches are very fond of feasting on bed bugs. Others cockroaches that eat bed bugs include the oriental and the brown-banded cockroaches.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-cockroaches-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>Details: Do Cockroaches Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>It is very uncomfortable to have bed bugs inhabit your home. They hide in furniture, pillows, clothing and luggage near their human host. Bed bug bites cause unbearable irritations and allergic reactions to human bodies.</p>
<p>However, cockroaches can save you from these bites by feasting on these nocturnal insects. Both insects emerge at night after you switch off the lights. In their four hours of actively scavenging for food, cockroaches will feast on bed bugs before they even get a chance to feast on human blood.</p>
<p>To roaches, bed bugs seem like a nice snack. You might wonder how roaches are able to locate bed bugs. They have acute sensory and survival instincts that enable them to easily locate and feed on bed bugs.</p>

<h2 id="which-cockroach-species-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>Which Cockroach Species Eat Bed Bugs?�</strong></h2>
<p>Several species of cockroaches are very fond of eating bed bugs. The most common bed bug-eating cockroaches include the German and the American cockroaches. Others in the list are the oriental and the brown-banded cockroach.</p>
<h3 id="1-american-cockroach-waterbug"><strong>1. American cockroach (waterbug)</strong></h3>
<p>Its the largest household roach in America. They are fond of fermenting material, but will feed on almost any kind food. When indoors, they feed on crumbs that scatter on the floor, under appliances, behind kitchen cabinets and insects such as bed bugs.</p>
<p>Their typical outdoor diet may include, small insects, decaying leaves, fungi, algae, etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-german-cockroach"><strong>2. German cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>German roaches are almost the size as American ones. They will eat anything that has nutritional value including other pests like bed bugs. They easily find their way into new houses by getting a ride in cartons, bags and second-hand appliances
<strong>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="do-cockroaches-hunt-bed-bugs"><strong>Do Cockroaches Hunt Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Just like bed bugs, cockroaches come out to search for food during the night. So, theyre likely to hunt and feed on bed bugs as they search for something to eat. The two insects have adapted to feed at night as a way of avoiding predators and enemies like us.</p>
<p>At night, when everyone is asleep, therere fewer disturbances and these insect know its their time to eat. If they were to feed during the day, you would of course be their greatest threat. But, at night, these creatures will feed uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Cockroaches will harbour in your mattress and furniture, making them very close to the bed bugs that are waiting for you to sleep in order to feed on your blood. Usually, cockroaches will hunt on these bed bugs as they emerge from their hideouts.</p>
<p>Since they will have to cross walls from their hideouts to get to their human host, they became easy targets from the active cockroaches.</p>
<h2 id="are-cockroaches-a-sign-of-bed-bugs">Are Cockroaches a Sign of Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Once cockroaches get into your house, they will stick there as long as there is something for them to eat or until you exterminate them. You probably know that roaches can eat anything that they come across. They scavenge for anything from food to things like paper, wood and glue.</p>
<p>If theres nothing for them to eat, including bed bugs, roaches will quickly leave your house and go hunting for food. That means, if roaches have nothing else to eat and you have bed bugs, it possible that they will stick around.</p>
<p>However, you cant have a scenario where cockroaches have nothing to eat at all. And since they dont depend on bed bugs as their main diet, roaches will stick in your house whether you have bed bugs or not.</p>
<h2 id="cockroaches-vs-bed-bugs--which-is-easier-to-control"><strong>Cockroaches Vs. Bed Bugs  Which is easier to Control?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches are simpler to kill because of their tendency to eat any food or even non-food substances. So, if you lay poison baits or traps having food, it is possible to kill cockroaches. A good example of a cockroach trap is bait traps with glucose. Since they love to eat sweet things, glucose will easily lure them into your poison baits or traps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bed bugs only feed on blood from warm blooded animals. So you wont expect them to be lured into baits and traps meant for cockroaches. However there are traps and lures for bed bugs.</p>
<p>One of the best method to kill roaches and bed bugs, is to use heat treatment.</p>
<p>In heat treatment, your house is heated to temperatures above 120C, so that no bed bug or cockroach can survive. The bugs are exterminated quicker with increase in temperatures. It requires professional equipment and expertise to heat the room to the required temperatures.</p>
<p>Not only will you effectively kill bed bugs and cockroaches. If other pests including ants, flies and termites reside in your house, they will also die during the heat treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the available pesticides can be used against roaches and bed bugs. A good example is permethrin.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-roaches-to-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Disadvantages of Roaches To Kill Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>While cockroaches can help you kill bed bugs in your home, they could escalate into a real problem. These creatures are known to be survivalist and can multiply rapidly in a very short period. Dont be tempted to depend on them to kill bed bugs in your house. Just like bed bugs, roaches are equally difficult to rid of.</p>
<p>Roaches are also associated with a lot of contamination in our houses. They are known to pass on germs that may cause diseases such as gastro-enteritis and dysentery in humans. Other diseases that may be transmitted through these creatures include, salmonella and stomach related illnesses.</p>
<p>These diseases become possible when roaches leave their pathogenic infected faeces or secretions on surfaces and food substances.</p>
<p>Cockroaches also cause asthmatic reactions among children and the elderly during their regular molting.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do cockroaches eat bed bugs? NO. The fact that cockroaches eat bed bugs does not make them a reliable pest control method. You have noticed that bed bugs dont constitute the main diet for cockroaches.</p>
<p>Cockroaches feed on almost anything they come across. That means, they dont go hunting for bed bugs wherever they are.�Obviously, you cant resolve to have enough cockroaches to feed on the bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>You would end up with a hoard of roaches, hence creating another problem. Furthermore, bed bugs reproduce very rapidly and will replenish their population in a matter of time.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, these natural predators will never make a difference to your bed bug infestation. The best solution is to adopt some of the well-known methods like pesticides, bait traps or the DIY bed bug controls.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been disturbed by colonies of roaches in your place and wonder which animal can eliminate them naturally? You may even be compelled to find out if some of your pets can eat cockroaches.</p>
<p>Do you own a pet <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs/">Gecko</a> (house lizard) or have you spotted one in your house, yard or zoo? Well, in this article, we shall delve into close predation of gecko on roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>**So, Do Geckos <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a> Roaches? The direct answer is YES. Geckos hunt and eat roaches in your home, yard, or zoo. **</li>
<li><strong>But, it&rsquo;s not advisable to feed your Geckos on cockroaches from your house or caught outside in the fields since these roaches contain bacterial infections, parasites, and germs, which may affect their health adversely.</strong>
<strong>�Geckos will eat any species of roaches (unselective) though they prefer eating Dubia roaches. They also hunt and eat mosquitoes, ants, rats/mice, swarmers, crickets, locusts, and centipedes in your place.</strong>
Lets get into the details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-roaches">Details: Do Geckos Eat Roaches?</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-do-geckos-eat-roaches">1.� How do Geckos Eat Roaches?</h3>
<p>Geckos hunt and eat roaches as one of their main meals. When hunting, Gecko approaches the roach or a colony of roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, it focuses on a specific cockroach after which it shoots its head and captures it with the mouth (its rear legs give it ample momentum to reach its prey on time).</li>
<li>A Gecko would slowly turn the captured roach with its mouth to ensure that the roachs head is inside the mouth fully  this helps in fasten suffocation process, which is one of the ways Gecko uses to kill the roach.
The Gecko will then try to push the roach further (using its tongue) into its mouth. It will take 1 to 3 minutes for Gecko to swallow whole one roach.</li>
<li>Alternatively, some species of Gecko such as Leopard Gecko prefer to cut (using its teeth) the roachs head first and feed on the body later.</li>
<li>When eating roaches, Gecko does not use its legs to hold on roach for better grip like cats do  gecko uses its mouth entirely for grasping and holding roach into place.
Once Gecko eats a roach, it pauses for 1 to 3 minutes before eating another one  this helps it recover hunting energy and breathe enough air, which it uses to suck in roach when swallowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Geckos will rarely eat a roach from the abdomen  they always eat it from the head. In addition, Geckos eat every part of a roach including the wings.</p>
<h3 id="2-species-of-roaches-that-geckos-eat">2. Species of Roaches That Geckos Eat.</h3>
<p>Geckos do not select when hunting roaches for food. However, research shows that, in a colony of roach species, Geckos tend to feed on Dubia roaches more and often than other species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study has revealed that Dubia roaches have tasty components and a higher level of calcium than other roaches  something that attracts Geckos to prey on them preferentially.</li>
<li>Also, Dubia roaches lack wings (female Dubia roaches) thus making it easier for Gecko to swallow them whole.
Though American roaches, German roaches, and Oriental roaches are the most common at-home are highly likely to be preyed on by Geckos, they post-feeding challenges to them.</li>
<li>They have scary legs and long wings that make swallowing problematic.
Moreover, these roaches cause health problems to Geckos when eaten thus becoming less popular and prioritized food species.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-how-many-roaches-can-gecko-eat">3. How Many Roaches Can Gecko Eat?</h3>
<p>An adult Gecko can eat 2 to 6 (maximum) roaches in a given meal. Some Geckos will feed on two roaches at a time and eat a total of seven roaches in a given day.</p>
<p>However, the number of roaches eaten by Gecko per day may change slightly according to the size of the roach being eaten  Geckos eat smaller roaches than bigger ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Young/baby Gecko can/will eat 2 to 4 roaches in a meal on a given day. Normally, most Geckos feed for 10 to 17 minutes  this time is enough for them to have eaten to their satisfaction.</li>
<li>If you have a pet gecko, it is important to feed it just enough (overfeeding will make your gecko inactive).
Baby geckos should eat a few roaches 2 to 3 times in a given day. (It is not advisable to feed your pet geckos daily  alternate or skip some days).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-are-roaches-bad-to-gecko-when-eaten">4. Are Roaches bad to Gecko when Eaten?</h3>
<p>Though most geckos feed on any roaches around your place (unselective), most roaches found in homes (e.g. American roaches, German roaches, and Oriental roaches) cause health problems to geckos when eaten.</p>
<ul>
<li>They carry parasites, germs, and bacteria in them that cause infections and sickness to your Geckos.</li>
<li>The Salmonella bacteria found on/under the wings of these roaches cause scary and infectious skin on your Geckos.
Parasites such as Trichuris (11.97%), Eimeria (2.73%), Capillaria (6.16%), Toxocara (4.86%), Hook Worm (4.86%), and Ascaris (33.76%) were found both on external and internal parts of roaches after close lab examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Germs from pesticides or control chemicals that may be sprayed in your house or out in fields easily stick on the wings and body of roaches  this will find their way into the gecko digestive tract when eaten thus affecting its health.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-can-your-house-gecko-eat">What Else Can Your House Gecko Eat?</h2>
<p>A Gecko eats mosquitoes in your house or yard by extending its tongue out for the mosquitoes to land and get stuck. A Gecko can also shoot out its tongue out to catch a flying mosquito.</p>
<h3 id="1-ratsmice"><strong>1. Rats/mice.</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from roaches, geckos also hunt and eat rats and mice in your house or compound.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gecko may not kill big rats or mice; however, it feeds on baby rats/mice at their nest.
Geckos help a lot in controlling these organisms. However, the feeding rate is low  you need another alternative control method too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-crickets-and-locusts"><strong>2. Crickets and locusts.</strong></h3>
<p>Field geckos hunt crickets and locusts more than the roaches. Study shows that crickets have a high nutrition value (protein).</p>
<p>The Geckos hunts crickets in their hideouts (holes) by use of their mouth or sticky tongue.</p>
<p>Geckos catch centipedes along the wooden structures in your house or yard using their mouth and swallow them whole.</p>
<p>Swarmer produced by termite colonies in your house or fields is often eaten by geckos. Gecko uses its tongue to stick swarmers and swallow them whole.
<strong>3. Worm substrates e.g. mealworms</strong>
.</p>
<p>You can feed your pet gecko with some of the locally bred organisms such as hornworms, mealworms, silkworms, and super worms.</p>
<ul>
<li>These organisms have a high level of fat that is dangerous for geckos in excess (causes geckos to fatten faster thus leading to walking problems).
Such meals should be fed in fewer quantities and be supplemented often with vet-approved roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-you-avoid-giving-your-gecko">What Should You Avoid Giving Your Gecko?</h2>
<p><strong>1. Vegetables and Fruits</strong>
.</p>
<p>Geckos are insectivorous reptiles. They should not be fed on fruits, vegetables, or any plant extracts/substances.</p>
<p>This causes stomach upset in them though most of the geckos wont feed on such substrates.
<strong>2. High-level fatty insects (Mealworms).</strong>
It is risky to feed your pet Geckos on large quantities of mealworms, hornworms, silkworms, or any high-level fatty insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat from these organisms is stored (not digested) in the adipose tissues (skin layer/beneath the skin) at the tail and stomach regions.</li>
<li>The fattened Gecko becomes docile/inactive and unable to walk normally  this may lead to death with time.
Highly fatty feeds should be fed to your pet gecko once or twice a week and also in less quantity. Supplement insects such as roaches and crickets should accompany the highly fatty gecko feeds.
<strong>3. Ants and Mosquitoes</strong>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid feeding your pet gecko with ants or mosquitoes. Although geckos eat them, these insects cause though and stomach irritation, which may even call for veterinary attention.
<strong>4. Scorpions and termites.</strong>
Scorpions, termites, and safari ants are risky meals for your pet gecko since they attack, bite and instill injuries on its mouth and skin.</p>
<p>Though at times Geckos are able to overcome and eat them, it is advisable not to offer them as food to geckos.
<strong>5. Light insects.</strong>
No insects that produce light (fireflies) should be fed to geckos. They contain toxic chemicals that will harm your pet Gecko.</p>
<p>It is highly recommendable to seek your vet advisory for various types of commercial gecko feeds available to ensure that you always offer the right diet and quantity to your pet geckos at the right time (proper feeding time).</p>
<p>You can also visit gecko feed retailers at the local center/distributors around you.</p>
<p>NB:
<em>Ensure that all your gecko commercial feeds are vet-approved.</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The gecko is an insectivorous reptile that feeds on roaches as one of its meals.</p>
<ul>
<li>They hunt and capture these insects with their mouth before swallowing them whole or slicing them into pieces and then swallowing.</li>
<li>It is not advisable to feed your gecko with roaches in your house or caught from the fields since they usually have germs, bacteria, and harbor infectious parasites.
Gecko can also feed on crickets, ants, locusts, rats, swarmers, and centipedes.</li>
</ul>

      <description>Cockroaches</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach">Cockroaches</a>
are unwelcome visitors in our homes - these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-get-ear-mites-from-dogs/">ear mites will even attack humans</a>
. Majority of roaches hibernate during winter to maintain their warmth. But, some remain active and get into our homes.
<strong>But can I freeze roaches to death? Yes. While this may sound like a lame suggestion, its a low-risk control tactic that wont cost you a dime. Why? Cockroaches die when temperatures fall to a certain level.��</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-can-i-freeze-roaches-to-death"><strong>Details: Can I Freeze Roaches to Death?�</strong></h2>
<p>Roaches prefer temperatures between 25-30 degrees Celsius. When they fall below this level, the roaches will move to a warmer place. This explains why infestations are high in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Although roaches are cold-blooded, they cant make the transition from room temperature to an extremely cold environment in a matter of seconds. Also, you can consider the
best roach killer
.</p>
<p>Cockroaches often die when exposed to temperatures below 15 degrees F. If you move the roaches from room temperature into a sub-zero freezer, they will die within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Its worth mentioning that you can only kill the eggs after prolonged exposure to a cold environment. The best strategy is to put the roaches into a sealed container and then place them into a freezer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DGgnj3L6Jw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DGgnj3L6Jw</a></p>
<h2 id="can-cockroaches-survive-in-winter">Can Cockroaches Survive In Winter?</h2>
<p>Since roaches can adapt to low temperatures, they will adjust to the immediate temperatures and stay warm. There are plenty of ways to avoid that exposure. Maybe you&rsquo;ve just
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/i-saw-one-cockroach-should-i-be-worried/">seen just one cockroach</a></p>
<ul>
<li>its time to act.</li>
</ul>
<p>Youll often find them creeping to your home when it gets too cold outside. Another survival tactic is to decrease the rate of perspiration and go into a temporary coma.</p>
<p>When the temperatures rise in spring, the nymphs start breeding to continue with the life cycle. According to modern science, roaches adapt to winter in different ways.</p>
<h3 id="1-german-cockroach">1. German cockroach</h3>
<p>German roaches can survive in cold winter months as long as theres ample supply of food. They group to stay warm during winter.</p>
<h3 id="2-american-cockroach">2. American cockroach</h3>
<p>They hide in decaying woodpiles. As the temperature drops, they move indoors.</p>
<h3 id="3-brown-banded-cockroach">3. Brown-banded cockroach</h3>
<p>When temperatures fall below 15 degrees F, they move to apartment buildings and heated kitchens. These roaches are attracted to warmth emitted by electrical appliances and live in high places.</p>
<h3 id="4-oriental-cockroach">4. Oriental cockroach</h3>
<p>They hide in crawlspaces, floor drains, and basements where they can reproduce. Unlike the other species, oriental roaches can tolerate lower temperatures. They mate once a year, especially during cold winter months.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-roaches-survive-in-extremely-low-temperatures">How Long Roaches Survive In Extremely Low Temperatures?</h2>
<p>When the temperature falls below 7 degrees Celsius, a cockroach can die within 10 hours. But this may not be the case when temperatures drop gradually.</p>
<p>When temperatures fall below 0 degrees F, the roaches will die within half an hour. Of course, cockroaches will enter the hibernation-like stage to slow the metabolic rate. Also,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/why-do-cockroaches-come-out-at-night/">cockroaches come out at night?</a></p>
<h2 id="what-do-roaches-do-during-winter">What Do Roaches Do During Winter?</h2>
<p>You may see a few running under the carpets but most of them will move to the kitchen. Here, they can eat and mate just like in normal temperatures. When the temperature rises again, you can easily spot them.
<strong>Can Roaches infestation during winter season?�Yes. This happens when they get inside our homes and hide in a warm place. When its too cold, we use heaters to keep our homes warm.�</strong>
That way, we create a favorable environment where roaches can live. And because roaches are nocturnal, they hide in crevices and behind kitchen appliances.

<h2 id="best-palmetto-bug-killers">Best Palmetto Bug Killers</h2>
<p>If you want to get rid of palmetto bugs without further ado, make use of these effective bug killers to quickly eliminate the creepy crawlies in your house.</p>
<h3 id="1-boric-acid-killer">1. Boric Acid Killer</h3>
<p>Using boric acid is one of the most effective techniques to kill palmetto bugs. Its a natural mineral thats able to kill the palmetto bugs. The acid disrupts the digestive system and nervous system of the bugs causing death. The downside is that you wont see its effect right away. Patiently wait for a few days to notice the bugs disappear over time.</p>
<h3 id="2-non-toxic-roach-traps">2. Non-Toxic Roach Traps</h3>
<p>Using roach traps is a maintenance-free method to get rid of palmetto bugs. These are quite different from the conventional roach traps. These traps employ non-toxic ingredients to bait the roaches towards the sticky glue surface. These traps should be placed strategically in the kitchen, cupboards and garage.</p>
<h2 id="getting-rid-of-the-palmetto-bugs">Getting Rid of the Palmetto Bugs</h2>
<p>We know youre disgusted by them and dont want to go anywhere near them. Learn ways by which you can free your house of the palmetto bugs before you start seeing them everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="1-roach-glue-traps">1. Roach Glue Traps</h3>
<p>Get hold of sufficient amount of roach glue traps and set it in multiple positions all over the house. Its better and safer if you use non-toxic roach traps, especially if youve got toddlers or pets at home.</p>
<p>Some areas where you must place these traps are the kitchen, cupboards, wardrobes, bathroom, basement and garage. The higher the number of traps, the more effective they will turn out to be.</p>
<h3 id="2-homemade-boric-acid-roach-baits">2. Homemade Boric Acid Roach Baits</h3>
<p>This is definitely the most efficient and cost effective way to deal with palmetto bugs. Although you wont see on the spot results through this method, but we assure you that the palmetto bugs stand no chance against it once theyve consumed it or are exposed to the mineral.</p>
<p>There are two ways through which boric acid works on the palmetto bugs. One of it is through its consumption. In case the palmetto bug digests the boric acid, it would result in the disintegration of its digestive system. Over time, it can lead to even more disruption inside the nervous system of the bug.</p>
<p>The other way is through the abrasive property of the mineral. The boric acid creates an itchy sensation on the exoskeleton of the palmetto bug and it gradually dries out. As the bug is unable to maintain the internal fluid balance, it doesnt last for a long time.</p>
<p>Cover your hands with a pair of gloves and mix different ingredients to make bait for the palmetto bug. Use the boric acid and mix it with a small quantity of flour, sugar and Crisco. The mixture would end up with a sticky dough-like texture. Leave the mixture alongside familiar insect-entry points.</p>
<p>Although boric acid is a naturally occurring mineral, keep in mind that it has a mild level of toxicity. So in case youve got pets or little kids, its best to avoid this method, as accidental ingestion could be dangerous for their safety. There are other safer alternatives available that you can opt for in that case.</p>

<p>This is also an organically occurring white powder and is used to achieve the same result to boric acid. Similar to boric acid, it also comes with a naturally-abrasive property.</p>
<p>Diatomaceous earth has a painful effect on the bugs that come into contact with it. Its sharp microscopic edges feel like stepping on shards of broken glass for them.</p>
<p>Take hold of a sack of food-grade diatomaceous earth and cover the areas where you think palmetto bugs are likely to pass from with sufficient amounts.</p>
<p>Ensure that you dont accidentally get pool-grade powder instead, as its extremely poisonous. Food-grade diatomaceous earth is fairly safer, unless you somehow breathe in large quantities of powder.</p>
<h3 id="4-sealing-cracks-and-gaps">4. Sealing Cracks and Gaps</h3>
<p>Gaps, holes and cracks along the house walls provide an easy entrance point for these insects. Simply seal these entry points and youd notice the number of palmetto bugs decreasing overtime.</p>
<p>Although they are reasonably bigger in size, theyre still somehow able to slip though the little cracks and gaps, and sneak into your house.</p>
<p>Carry out a detailed inspection of your entire house. Check if all the openings are blocked with materials such as caulk. These bugs can even make way in your house via the electrical outlets.</p>
<h3 id="5-a-pet-cat">5. A Pet Cat</h3>
<p>As surprising as it may sound, a pet cat can be a lot of help against the palmetto bugs. So in case you were planning to bring a pet cat home, heres one more reason why you should.</p>
<p>If youve got friends who have cats at home, youd notice that youve never seen palmetto bugs roaming around their houses. Thats because cats do a killer job to get rid of them. Cats not only play with them, but also at times eat them.</p>
<p>We know it sounds disgusting as you can imagine those bugs crawling in unhygienic places. So you should train your cat to only catch the palmetto bugs and not consume them.</p>
<h2 id="what-draws-in-palmetto-bugs">What Draws in Palmetto Bugs?</h2>
<p>As the famous saying goes, prevention is better than the cure, and it fits perfectly for pest control.</p>
<p>Itll be easier for you to get rid of the palmetto bugs if youre aware about the things and conditions that attract them originally. These are a few things that you need to be careful about to keep the palmetto bugs at bay.</p>
<h3 id="1-wet-and-warm-environments">1. Wet and Warm Environments</h3>
<p>Warm and humid environments are an ideal hideout for the palmetto bugs. This is why youd notice that the number of palmetto bugs inside your house start to increase when the weather outside becomes cool and dry.</p>
<p>Create an environment inside your house that isnt preferred by them. You can make use of a dehumidifier as itll help to dry out the inside air.</p>
<p>Inspect your house and look for potential water leakages coming from the broken pipes, broken faucets and roofs. Anything that might cause some areas of the house to become wet; even blocked drains, should be fixed on an immediate basis.</p>
<h3 id="2-leftover-food-wastage">2. Leftover Food Wastage</h3>
<p>Make sure that all the food scraps in the kitchen is discarded in an enclosed trash bin. Always use airtight sealed containers to store food that isnt placed in the refrigerator, making sure that the palmetto bugs are unable to reach the food. You dont want them feeding on your food and surely wouldnt enjoy the sight of them as toppings on your food.</p>

<h3 id="1-chrysanthemums"><strong>1. Chrysanthemums</strong></h3>
<p>The flowering plant has a natural insecticide compound called pyrethrins. After the plant becomes mature, you can squash them and put it all over the house to repel the palmetto bugs. Its not advised for pet owners as it can turn out to be toxic for cats and dogs.</p>
<h3 id="2-catnip-plants"><strong>2. Catnip Plants</strong></h3>
<p>Professionals have found out that these plants have a certain chemical called

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you spot a <a href="/posts/cockroach-eggs/">cockroach</a> in your house, the first thing that might come to your mind is whether you might have a roach infestation.�Well, roaches bring a host of negative effects to our homes and may cost hundreds of dollars to eradicate.</p>
<p>So, I understand the cause of panic when homeowners spot a single cockroach in their house.�But should you be worried about the one roach you have spotted?
<strong>A short answer is NO</strong>
. The sight of one roach is not a single indicator that you have a roach infestation to deal with. These pesky creatures are attracted to our homes as they search for water, food, shelter and warmth. So, the one roach that you spot, could have just moved in search of conditions to survive. However, you should treat this one roach seriously to ensure that it doesnt develop into an infestation.</p>
<p>You need to know that cockroaches have evolved with humans for many years and have developed many survival tactics which have made them survive numerous mass extinction. They stay out of sight during the day, only coming out during the night to terrorise your house.</p>
<p>That means, unless you have an infestation, you will rarely see cockroaches. But there are a few signs that may indicate a possible roach infestation.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-cockroach-infestation"><strong>Signs Of Cockroach Infestation</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-seeing-roaches-during-the-day">**1.��� **<strong>Seeing Roaches During The Day</strong></h3>
<p>The sight a cockroach is obviously the surest sign of a roach problem. And while the best time to spot these nocturnal insects is during the night, sometimes it possible to see them during the day. If you spot a roach during the day, there is a high chance that you might be dealing with a horde of them.</p>
<p>Although roaches tend to hide during the day, overcrowding and competition for food and water may cause them to spill out during the day in order to survive. So, if you find roaches during the day, its probably the right time to start a treatment plan or seek help from pest control professionals</p>
<h3 id="2-dead-roaches-lying-around">**2.��� **<strong>Dead Roaches Lying Around</strong></h3>
<p>Basically, life and death is part of a roach infestation. Thus, it is common to find carcasses of cockroaches in the places they hide. Signs of dead roaches mean that roaches are already in your house but not necessarily an infestation.</p>
<h3 id="3-roach-droppings">**3.��� **<strong>Roach Droppings</strong></h3>
<p>Another possible indicator of roach infestation, is the presence of fecal matter around your house. These creatures have a high metabolism rate, meaning they can excrete a substantial amount of fecal matter. The droppings differ in appearance, depending on the species and sizes of cockroaches.</p>
<p>Adult roaches will defecate cylindrical pellets-like feces while droppings from small roaches resemble ground coffee. The location and the quantity of roach feces can give you a hint of the extent of the infestation.</p>
<p>Check the areas most frequented by roaches such as behind the sink and food storage areas for roach droppings. If theres a substantial amount of feces, this could be a clear indicator of a high roach traffic.</p>
<h3 id="4-presence-of-roach-eggs">**4.��� **<strong>Presence Of Roach Eggs</strong></h3>
<p>Roaches breed and multiply rapidly in just a few days. So, the sight of oothecae (egg casings) left after hatching is a clear sign of infestation. Oothecae are the brown casings that are discarded after hatching. Most roach species produce an ootheca with 10 to 20 eggs but the stubborn German roach will have up to 50 eggs in a single ootheca.</p>
<p>Normally, most roach species attach their ootheca in secure places where pesticides and enemies like humans have a difficulty reaching.</p>
<p>However, the German roach carries with it the ootheca until the eggs hatch, making it hard to spot. If you have an infestation, you will spot egg castings inside closets, cabinets, around appliances such as refrigerators, ovens, stoves etc.</p>
<h3 id="5-unusual-smells">**5.��� **<strong>Unusual Smells</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, roaches have a characteristic oily odour which tends to become pungent as the infestation gets worse. The oily smell is possible with a large number of cockroaches, but can also result from oleic acid produced by decomposition of dead roaches. German roaches produce quite an intense smell than other roaches. The smell of cockroaches remains in the air and can even interfere with the taste of food.</p>
<h2 id="what-attracts-roaches-">**What Attracts Roaches? **</h2>
<h3 id="1-food-or-something-to-eat">**1.��� **<strong>Food Or Something To Eat</strong></h3>
<p>Exposed food is one the most common attractant for roaches. Roaches will crawl and remain in your house as long as they have something to eat. They are not selective at all. From food crumbs on surfaces to left overs on utensils, roaches will eat almost anything they come across.</p>
<p>But armed with simple housekeeping measures, you can minimise these avenues for roach proliferation. For example you can clean the house thoroughly and disinfect the surfaces. In addition keep all food substances in sealed vessels.</p>
<p>However, remember that roaches do not entirely rely on foodstuffs like us. Some cockroach species will feed on non-food substances like wood, cardboard, glue, paper etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-presence-of-damp-dark-and-hidden-places">**2.��� **<strong>Presence Of Damp, Dark And Hidden Places</strong></h3>
<p>Even if roaches are deprived of foodstuffs, these creatures are known to be sturdy enough to survive up to a month without feeding. During this time, roaches tend to cling to any dark, hidden and wet places in the house. Hence, you might find them around garbage points, garage and bathroom and behind the sink.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, these creatures will hide in place where theres seldom disturbances and away from human predators.</p>
<h3 id="3-exposed-trash">**3.��� **<strong>Exposed Trash</strong></h3>
<p>Just like foodstuffs, exposed trash will attract roaches like magnet. They will not only find something to eat but also a quiet haven to hide and breed.</p>
<p>If you want to get roaches out of trash areas, be sure to empty the garbage collection bins and clean them thoroughly.</p>
<h3 id="4-water">**4.��� **<strong>Water</strong></h3>
<p>Roaches can survive up to a month without food but not without water. They dehydrate quickly and will barely survive a month or two without water. Thats why roaches are attracted to wet places like under the sink, leaking pipes, around pets water and any other wet surface.</p>
<p>However keeping your house as dry as possible can reduce the persistence of roaches in your house.</p>
<h3 id="5-overgrown-vegetation">**5.��� **<strong>Overgrown Vegetation</strong></h3>
<p>Overgrowing grass and weed around the house and along pathways leading to the doors may be good breeding areas for roaches. In addition natural mulch and overstayed mown grass (i.e. before disposal), may harbour roaches because of the moist and warm conditions underneath.</p>
<p>However such roach threats can be minimised by maintaining a clean and tidy garden through clearing and damping overgrown vegetation.</p>
<h3 id="6-things-you-bring-home">**6.��� **<strong>Things You Bring Home</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike bed bugs, roaches do not hitch a ride home on things like clothes and furniture. Roaches like hiding in electrical appliances and cardboard boxes. They love the warm and quiet conditions inside appliances, so be keen not to bring them home.</p>
<p>You risk bring them home if you buy second hand appliances that come from a roach infested place. If you are not sure whether such appliances harbour roaches, you can cast the doubts by wrapping the items in airtight plastic bags together with Nuvan strips and leave them for a week or so.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-roach-do-i-have"><strong>What Type Of Roach Do I Have?</strong></h2>
<p>Of the 4600 known species of roaches, only 30 species have evolved and adapted to live with humans. Out of these, there are 5 main types of roaches that you are likely to find near households. These include:</p>
<h3 id="1-german-cockroach">**1.��� **<strong>German Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Blattella germanica. It is the type of roach you will commonly find in warmer climates. Though it is small in size, merely about  in, this is one roach you dont want to have anywhere near your house. They harbor numerous disease-causing bacteria and may cause allergy relation reactions. German roaches are also known for their resistance against common pesticides. Their color ranges from dark brown to tan and they dont fly.</p>
<h3 id="2-american-cockroach">**2.��� **<strong>American Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Periplaneta Americana. This is the largest type of roach that you will see in your house. Its reddish brown, readily flies and about 1 in. Although its the most abundant, this roach is not very dangerous. Its however associated with a lot of nasty diseases to humans.</p>
<h3 id="3-oriental-cockroach">**3.��� **<strong>Oriental Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Blatta orientalis Linnaeus. Its commonly known as the water bug due to its tendency to inhabit damp areas such as the basements. Its color ranges from dark brown to black but the wings are non-functional.</p>
<h3 id="4-brown-banded-roach">**4.��� **<strong>Brown Banded Roach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Supella longipalpa. This roach resembles the German roach but can be distinguished by the brown bands on their body. In addition, just like the German roach, this roach skin castings and excretions are associated with allergic reactions.</p>
<h3 id="5-smoky-brown-roach">**5.��� **<strong>Smoky Brown Roach</strong></h3>
<p>Last but not the least is the &ldquo;Smoky Brown Roach&rdquo;. The scientific name for this roach is Periplaneta fuliginosa. The name of this roach comes from its characteristic mahogany color. They commonly inhabit areas around the garage and woodpiles.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>The sight of one roach should not cause you a lot of panic. This should rather get you ready for a roach control plan. Since roaches breed very rapidly, one female roach can quickly cause a roach infestation in your home.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you embark on appropriate roach prevention plans such as eliminating conducive environments. In addition, you can seek advice from a professional pest exterminator.</p>

      <description>So, what do roaches smell like?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, what do roaches smell like?
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/pest/roach.html">Roaches</a>
are one of the most annoying pests you can find in your house. However, sometimes you might be anxious about what type of pest is roaming your home at night. Maybe smell can help?
**What is even more annoying about these insects is the smell they cause in a place. The smell is unpleasant, and it poses a health risk to human beings. So, what do roaches smell like? **
<strong>The short answer is; roach smell is a pungent, oily, musty, and nasty odor. The scent can also be defined as healthy and stinky too. Many words can describe the smells, but we can all agree that the smell is terrible to have in your house.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Roach Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-do-roaches-smell-like---infestation-smell">What Do Roaches Smell Like? - Infestation Smell</h2>
<p>These secretions have a long-lasting offensive effect and are what we are calling roach smells. The smell is distinguishable from any other scent.
Roaches mostly
live in dark, moist places
where they stay in groups. You&rsquo;ll find roaches behind refrigerators, cupboards, sinks, and cookers, and you can control them using the
top�roach killers
.
<em>But, what actually causes roaches to smell?�</em>
<strong>1. Oleic acid - The decomposing bodies of dead cockroaches produce this</strong>
. The odor serves the following purposes.
<strong>2. Potential danger�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The smell helps roaches in locating the dangerous places hence avoiding them. The scent emanates from scenes of potential threats. By smelling the odor of the dead bodies, other roaches prevent danger.

<h2 id="where-does-this-smell-come-from"><strong>Where does this smell come from?�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-secretions"><strong>1. Secretions</strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever caught a roach and placed it on your hand? Did it have a smell? A single roach usually has no scent. Roaches produce odors when in large numbers.
Some species are notorious for causing smells even with one roach. For example, a single German cockroach can produce a stench strong enough to offend a person.
This stench is produced deliberately by these roaches as part of their daily routines. It is the smell you smell when your place has an infestation. Even after dealing with menace, the smell stays on for a little longer.</p>
<h3 id="2-stench-of-death"><strong>2. Stench of death�</strong></h3>
<p>This is the stench produced by the decomposing bodies of dead cockroaches. Study shows that insects have a stench upon death. This stench is due to Oleic acid, which is produced by dead bodies.
Also, when roaches find a comfortable place for living and breeding, they release a pheromone. Pheromones are communication devices between roaches. They are normal secretions by roaches from their glands.
These pheromones are used to let other cockroaches know of the new habitat. The disgusting smell you notice is actually communication with other roaches.</p>
<h3 id="4-predators-and-sexy-scent"><strong>4. Predators and Sexy Scent</strong></h3>
<p>Male roaches produce odors from their stink glands that help in keeping predators away. This way, they can avoid any impending danger.
During the mating season, female roaches produce smells. Those smells are to attract swarms of male cockroaches for mating.</p>
<h3 id="5-roach-waste"><strong>5. Roach waste</strong></h3>
<p>Due to the nature of roaches nests (dark and wet), their feces quickly accumulate and, in turn, produce a smell. The waste attracts moisture, and you will be subjected to decomposing feces.
So the smell you might be smelling most probably is some roach waste. The above are the reasons why roaches smell in that disgusting, unpleasant odor.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-ofroach-smell">**How to G****et Rid of�**<strong>roach Smell�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="step-1---identify-the-roach-source"><strong>Step 1 - Identify the Roach source�</strong></h3>
<p>It would help if you tried to find where the roaches are living and breeding. This means you will have to move the cupboards, stoves, and sinks, refrigerators to access those places.
Once you identify the smell in your house, you should know that your place has a roach infestation and a
roach bomb
. The scent of roaches poses a significant risk to the people living in that house.
Smells of roaches cause respiratory problems, amongst other illnesses. Here are some ways of getting
rid of roaches
and their pungent smells.</p>
<h3 id="step-2---deny-them-food-and-water"><strong>Step 2 - Deny them food and water.�</strong></h3>
<p>As you already know now, roaches thrive in an environment rich in warmth, moisture, food, and shelter. Ensuring your house is
free from cockroaches
involves the following practices.
Ensure you deprive them of water by ensuring there are no leaks in the house. Also, wipe any spillages immediately. Although roaches can
survive a few days without water
, they shall soon get eliminated after depriving them.</p>
<h3 id="step-3---create-an-unwelcoming-environment"><strong>Step 3 - Create an unwelcoming environment.</strong></h3>
<p>Clean your house thoroughly. Roaches thrive well in filthy environments. By maintaining a clean house you deny them a chance to thrive. Ensure that your kitchen is always clean and that you take your trash out regularly.
Also, ensure that doors to the cupboard and refrigerators are working and in good condition. This prevents small ones from getting inside.
Cover your food. Dishes should be washed soon after meals and not left to stay overnight.�Ensure that there are no food leftovers on your tables, Kitchen counters, and other places.</p>
<h3 id="step-4---repelling-roaches"><strong>Step 4 - Repelling roaches.</strong></h3>
<p>You can repel roaches using- coffee grounds, Cypress and peppermint oils, and bay leaves or even killing them using
boric acid
.
You can also make a homemade insecticide using
baking soda
and sugar. Mix them in equal portions, then sprinkle them in your house. Although this method does not entirely eradicate roaches, it kills the visible ones.
Sugar attracts the roaches then the
baking soda kills
them after they consume it. Ensure that you sweep the mixture and the dead roaches after a few days.
Even though the smell of roaches is unpleasant, there is no need to scream hysterically when you spot one. Once you follow the
tips shared
here, you will be able to get rid of that infestation.</p>
<h3 id="step-5---professional-assistance"><strong>Step 5 - Professional assistance�</strong></h3>
<p>I am pretty sure that you would have resorted to grabbing an insecticide and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/raid-ant-roach-killer-insecticide-spray-review/">spraying the roaches</a>
. This may not be effective. It may kill only the visible ones and spare the hiding ones.
You are advised to seek help from a professional
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flying-ants-vs-termites/">pest control</a>
officer. They usually have the right skills and tools to wipe out the infestation and the smell that comes with it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Roaches thrive in filthy places. Roaches disgorge portions of their
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-roach-poop-look-like/">partially digested food and feces</a>
at intervals.
They also discharge a nauseous secretion from their mouths and glands on their bodies.
Once the menace has been dealt with, ensuring you have removed any leftovers of the roaches from your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Waking up at the midnight hour for nature&rsquo;s call or a midnight craving and finding a big roach challenging your way with even bigger tentacles, could send chills down the spine!</p>
<p>Is this your every night story? Did you know that having roaches at home could pose a serious threat to your health? You need to get rid of them in no time. But! Why Do Cockroaches <a href="/posts/where-do-fleas-come-from/">Come</a> Out At Night?</p>
<p>If you are a bug hater and wonder why these night creepers are always awake to make you feel jelly in the knees, this article is where you fit right in.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-behind-the-night-creepers">The Story Behind the Night Creepers:</h2>
<p>While there is a wide variety of roaches, the majority of them are nocturnal. Science says that cockroaches have a circadian rhythm like all living creatures (organisms) on earth.</p>
<p>This rhythm is a sleep-wake cycle that keeps alternating between pause/activity periods of these nasty bugs and governing their conduct of different organisms.</p>
<p>In short, this rhythm is solely responsible for the night activity cycle of these insects.�In this activity cycle, cockroaches hunt for food and water in a low light environment and stay mostly inactive during the day.</p>
<p>Their immobility during the daylight hour is either to stay safe from predators or nature&rsquo;s extremities.</p>
<p>This means when the bedtime is approaching and the light goes off, a big welcome sign flag to your enemies.</p>
<p>And now they will cascade in bulk from under the kitchen shelves, store room cabinets, washroom holes, and the smallest crack and the crevices.�Stay SAFE!</p>
<h2 id="do-roaches-sleep-during-the-day">Do Roaches Sleep During the Day?</h2>
<p>Plenty of research has been conducted on the activity cycle of roaches and a few of them to find out whether they sleep during the day or not! And each one points to the aforementioned circadian rhythm responsible for a sustained bout of inactivity in these bugs.</p>
<p>In other words, studies indicate that cockroaches too have a resting session like other creatures on this planet.</p>
<p>Here, Professor Irene Tobler-Borbely best sums up the activity of the roaches inthree clear stages: locomotion, limb or antenna movement (no locomotion), and a period of immobility. And this period of hiatus is the same a human&rsquo;s &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; period.</p>
<p>So, if you are not finding traces of these little monsters during the daylight, probably they are taking a siesta&hellip; * LOL! *</p>
<h2 id="why-do-cockroaches-hate-light">Why Do Cockroaches Hate Light?</h2>
<p>A few studies indicate that cockroaches have a zero aversion to light. But, why do these annoying species run away from the lights then?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably because these tiny, wild beasts have evolved through all these years only to learn that flickering light is an indication of the arrival of their human predators!</p>
<p>A number of encounters have possibly taught them that human intervention means a mass killing. And so, whenever there is the light, they seem to scurry for their hideouts. Simple as that!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, a former body of research also emphasized the impact of artificial illumination on the roaches. It suggests that the artificial lighting, even with the lowest intensity could tamper with the circadian rhythms of these insects and obstructs their activity at night.</p>
<p>So, even a dim light in the kitchen area could reduce their appearance. Mind it!</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-they-scout-for-at-the-nights">So What Do They Scout For At the Nights?</h2>
<p>So, coming back to the question again, &ldquo;Why Do Cockroaches Come Out At Night&rdquo;, you should possibly look for an answer inside your house, more precisely the kitchen and the pantry.</p>
<p>Roaches are always out on forage for food and water during the darkest hours when you are crawling into the comfort of your bed.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-large-number-of-these-bugs-at-home">Have a large number of these bugs at home?</h2>
<p>You will surely discover hundreds of thousands of them wobbling and running for shelter when you suddenly turn on the lights after 4 hours of darkness interval.</p>
<p>And the reason is nothing but the leftover in the cooking and the dining space.�After the sundown, cockroaches are prone to emerge in a big group and hunt for foods.</p>
<p>In fact, roaches can feed on virtually anything, including the tiniest food scraps that you might have left uncleaned from the last supper.</p>
<p>It can be anything from the organic materials, soiled clothes, bookbinding to trash bin rubbishes, crumbs on the floor, sludges between the gas burner or pet bowl remains, no matter, fresh or rotten!</p>
<p>The best way to keep cockroaches at the bay is keeping these areas forever clean and free of every single residue.</p>
<p>Once you do that, you will soon find these roaches scavenging during the day.</p>
<p>And that means you have already managed a critical infestation of these seedy bugs and they are threatened with the scarcity of food. This is why they are forced to hunt foods when are they are not supposed to.</p>
