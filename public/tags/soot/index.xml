<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-remove-oil-stains-from-%5Bwall%5D(/posts/3d-wall-painting-for-your-bedroom/)-paint/">oil stains</a>
requires a professional approach and appropriate method.
*On how to remove soot from walls; whether concrete or wooden walls, use either trisodium phosphate, rubbing alcohol and melamine sponge, commercial soot remover, sandblasting, and detergent, vacuuming, or using a degreaser. *
<em>Alternatively, you opt to use homemade soot removers such as mineral spirit, baking soda, vinegar, or dish soap solution. During soot removal, prepare the solvent appropriately (follow manufacturers instruction) and avoid excess application - causes spread of soot to adjacent areas.</em></p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-remove-soot-from-walls">Details: How to Remove Soot from Walls</h2>
<h3 id="method-1-trisodium-phosphate-tsp">Method 1: Trisodium phosphate (TSP)</h3>
<p>Wear personal protective gear ( for safety purposes) and stick to precautions highlighted in this article to avert any hazard that may occur.
Trisodium phosphate features a complex chemical formulation, which breaks soot instantly upon application. The disintegrated soot is more comfortable to clean with soap and water.
<strong>Tools and Materials required</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trisodium phosphate (TSP)</li>
<li>Soapy detergent and warm water</li>
<li>Empty Bucket and cloth or rag</li>
<li>Waterpoint and Stirrer</li>
<li>Protective gear  goggles, Respirator, overall, gloves, and boots
<strong>Steps to Follow</strong></li>
<li>Wear protective gear  boots, dustcoat, goggles, respirator, and gloves</li>
<li>Cover the floor with a polyethylene bag</li>
<li>Prepare TSP in the bucket  follow manufacturers instructions</li>
<li>Dip a piece of cloth in TSP solution and start scrubbing over the soot-stained wall - gently</li>
<li>Repeat the previous steps until the soot is cleaned completely</li>
<li>Then, wash the wall with soapy detergent and warm water  to remove traces of TSP and soot remains</li>
<li>Rinse the surface with clean water and leave it to dry
NB: For very old soot stain, consider a scrubbing machine to aid in soot removal upon TSP application.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method-2-rubbing-alcohol-and-melamine-sponge">Method 2: Rubbing Alcohol and Melamine Sponge</h3>
<p>Rubbing alcohol is suitable for resenting soot stains as its action capability is mild. The active ingredients in alcohol break soot forming a thick fluid, which is easier to clean.
<strong>Tools and Materials required</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rubbing alcohol and warm water</li>
<li>Piece of cloth  two</li>
<li>Empty buckets  two</li>
<li>Melamine Sponge
<strong>Steps to Follow</strong></li>
<li>Dilute rubbing alcohol in a bucket  60% to 80% alcohol in the solvent</li>
<li>Dip melamine sponge into the alcohol solution and rub over the soot-stained wall gently</li>
<li>Repeat the previous steps until the soot is cleaned. Dont use a soot-stained sponge  wash it with soap and water before re-using</li>
<li>Clean the wall surface with Soapy detergent and leave it to dry naturally
Melamine sponge is commercially available  it helps in improving the soot removal process.

<li>Then, scrub the wall with a rug until the soot is completely removed</li>
<li>Mop the wall with soapy water and rinse it with clean water</li>
<li>Leave the surface to dry
NB: Dont smell commercial soot remover directly  the solvent contains components, which may irritate your nasal cavity if inhaled.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method-4-vacuuming-and-detergent">Method 4: Vacuuming and Detergent</h3>
<p>The vacuuming method is suitable for the removal of recent soot stains  the vacuum machine sucks the soot particles from the surface thus detaching them from the wall.
Detergent is used to loosen permanent soot stains (makes soot easier to remove). The tools and materials required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum machine and detergent</li>
<li>Waterpoint and empty bucket</li>
<li>A piece of cloth and sponge</li>
<li>Protective attire
<strong>Steps to Follow</strong></li>
<li>Plug the vacuum machine into the power source and switch on</li>
<li>Gently, pass the vacuum machine over the wall surface under soot staining  to suck soot</li>
<li>Repeat the movement  back and forth</li>
<li>Dilute the soapy detergent in a bucket and wash the wall surface  to clean any soot traces</li>
<li>Rinse the wall with clean water and leave it to dry to touch
NB: Dont vacuum wet soot  it may damage the vacuum machine. See Also:

<h3 id="method-5-degreaser-and-warm-water">Method 5: Degreaser and warm water</h3>
<p>Degreaser
contains a complex structural formulation that breaks soot into simple molecular fluid, which is more comfortable to remover.
Besides, the solvent kills adhesive forces between soot and wall surface thus enhancing the removal process. The tools and materials required are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Degreaser and container</li>
<li>Sponge or a piece of cloth</li>
<li>Waterpoint and soap
<strong>Steps to Follow</strong></li>
<li>Thin degreaser in a bucket accordingly  use manufacturers instructions</li>
<li>Using a sponge or a piece of cloth, apply degreaser over the soot-stained wall, gently</li>
<li>Leave the solvent to cure for 10 minutes</li>
<li>Scrub the wall with a piece of cloth until the soot is full cleaned</li>
<li>Then, wash the wall with soapy water  to remove traces of degreaser</li>
<li>Rinse the wall with clean water and leave it to dry naturally</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="common-problems-people-make-during-soot-removal">Common Problems People make During Soot Removal</h2>
<p>During the soot removal process, you may experience some of the following problems or challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failing to wear protective gear  you risk being choked.</li>
<li>Using wrong soot remover  causes poor quality finish and soot overspread.</li>
