      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*So, how do fleas move? Do fleas have wings?� *
Wondering if
<a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/ipm/uploads/files/Fleas.pdf">fleas</a>
have wings, can they fly like
gnats?
or do these clitters jump like frogs?</p>
<p>Fleas are tiny insects of the Siphonaptera order that&rsquo;ll feed off human or animal blood.
Fleas move quickly and it may seem like they fly. Most of their over 2,000 types, like human fleas or cat fleas have strong legs, flat bodies and a length of ~ 0.1 inches.
<strong>Well, the short answer is, No, fleas don&rsquo;t have wings. The suffix�&quot;</strong>
*aptera&quot; in *
**Siphonaptera **
*order *
**denote that fleas are **
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptera">wingless arthropods</a>
** - like most ectoparasites such as **
<strong>ticks</strong>
<strong>.�</strong>
<strong>Fleas use their powerful and tiny legs to jump (about 8 inches vertically) or move between hairs of host animal. Fleas, besides froghoppers, have the highest jump-body size ratio.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-fleas-have-wings-9-faqs-for-fleas">Details: Do Fleas Have Wings? 9 FAQs for Fleas</h2>
<p>So, fleas have no wings. The suffix aptera in the order Siphonaptera (a Greek word) denotes that fleas are wingless while siphon is interpreted as siphon.</p>
<p>Most ectoparasites attacking mammals and birds - lice, bedbugs, ticks, and fleas -
cant fly
and lack functional wings. They use legs to walk around but, to move quickly or further, fleas use the powerful but tiny legs to jump.
The over 2,000 <a href="/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/">flea</a> types including human fleas, cat fleas, oriental rat fleas, dog fleas lack wings and thus can&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<h2 id="how-fleas-lost-their-wings">How Fleas Lost their Wings</h2>
<p>Scientific evidence points that fleas had winged ancestors and they lost their wings along the evolution journey. Fleas &ldquo;originated&rdquo; from order Mecoptera. Boreidae insects like snow scorpion-flies are considered to have been the descendants of fleas.
Fleas were not originally parasites in mammals for ages - they were free-living. But when they moved into their parasitic tendencies they ended burrowed in their hosts&rsquo;s bodies - mainly mammals.
Therefore, flying capability and wings became useless in the fleas&rsquo; new life. In fact, wings would tend to hinder their parasitic life as they tried to burrow into their hosts&rsquo;s bodies. Thus, flea wings degenerated in the evolution process.</p>
<h2 id="adapations-in-fleas-for-movement-jumping">Adapations in Fleas for movement (Jumping)</h2>
<p>Fleas move from one place or host (animal) by
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/02/flea-jumping-mechanics/">jumping with their</a>
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/02/flea-jumping-mechanics/">spring-loaded feet</a>
(about 5 feet high) using their strong but tiny hind legs. Also, the fleas&rsquo;
<a href="http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio210/s2012/dorshors_jaco/adaptation.htm">flattened, small body</a>
allow the fleas to easily hide on the animal&rsquo;s hair.
Despite the fleas&rsquo; wings had degenerated, their flight structures were retained and modified to ease its jumping. Fleas have pleural arch that&rsquo;s akin to wing-hinge ligaments found in flying insects.
This
<a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-6-41">pleural arch has resilin</a>
which allow storage of energy required for fleas to make their
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-high-can-fleas-jump/">giant flea jumps - about 5.2 inches vertically</a>
. Also, fleas have flight muscles (basalars and subalars) plus tergo-trochanteral depressor - its starter muscle.
Fleas lack wings and thus won&rsquo;t fly. But fleas don&rsquo;t require the wings to move as they can jump easily with their powerful legs. Fleas will use their powerful legs for clinging on hosts like humans.
Fleas (especially adult fleas) will stick on the skin of their hosts such as pets and mammals while sucking blood. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll take their full feed and lay over
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/">100 flea eggs</a>
daily.
But fleas are toxic bugs that can spread dangerous diseases such as plague and typhus. As the flea jump from one pet or human to another, they&rsquo;ll ready spread the diseases such as Bubonic plague.</p>
<h2 id="what-looks-like-a-flea-but-has-wings">What Looks Like a Flea But Has Wings?</h2>
<p>Have you seen some bugs looking like fleas but can fly? Well, those are definitely not fleas since fleas can only jump but can&rsquo;t fly - these might be small
fruit flies
or
gnats
.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Fruit flies</em>- So, fruit flies are the most regular visitors around your house or yard that you may confuse with fleas. Fruit flies will mainly follow and land around rotten and smelly vegetables and fruits.</li>
<li><em>Fungus gnat</em>- Next up are the tiny fungus gnat that you&rsquo;ll see near windows or houseplants - thus these will definitely look like fleas, they&rsquo;l fly and feed on various houseplants.</li>
<li><em>Dog ticks, Springtails</em>etc. - These smaller bugs that also look like fleas but don&rsquo;t have wings include dog ticks, springtails, flour beetles, black carpet beetles, and springtails.</li>
<li>However, these ones -<a href="http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/stored/drugstore_beetle.htm">drugstore</a>and cigarette beetles have wings but also look like fleas.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-fleas-move-over-long-distances">How Fleas Move Over Long Distances?</h2>
<p>Do fleas have wings? Can they fly?
As noted above, fleas won&rsquo;t fly as they lack wings like other Siphonaptera insects. Thus, fleas rely on their jumping capability or attaching their-selves on humans or host animals to move over long distances.
Notably, fleas will hitchhike their hosts including rodents like mice and rats. In addition, the critters may attach on socks and shoes worn by humans as they move around the house or yard.</p>
<h2 id="do-baby-fleas-jump-orcrawl">Do Baby Fleas Jump or�Crawl?</h2>
<p>First, note that in reality &ldquo;baby flea&rdquo; don&rsquo;t exist. Definitely, flea eggs will hatch to become larvae but won&rsquo;t be adequately developed to be considered as baby fleas - they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;blobs&rdquo;.
The blind fleas will thus require additional time to grow. Therefore, the blobs create cocoons around their body and will thus continue developing to adulthood.
The fleas will attain their
adulthood while inside their cocoons - its
referred
to as &quot;
<a href="http://www.cvbd.org/en/flea-borne-diseases/about-fleas/development-cycle/preemerged-adult/">quiescent phase</a>
&quot; in the life-cycle of the fleas. During this time, the fleas will reduce their
metabolism and thus won&rsquo;t require feeding.
In addition, in the quiescent phase, the fleas will remain motionless in their cocoon as they wait to hatch - for even 5 months. Thus, in their &ldquo;baby&rdquo; stage, fleas don&rsquo;t move around but will be fixed in their cocoons.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, we&rsquo;ve outlined that fleas cannot fly since they&rsquo;re wingless insects. But these bugs have strong legs that help them in jumping from one place or host to another.
In addition, fleas will hitchhike humans, shoes, or clothes such as socks to move over long distances as the animals transit to different places.</p>

on long strands of silk  without wings!
<em><strong>Well, what about winged spiders? Do these exist? No, not really. There are no known species of <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> with fully developed wings capable of powered flight in any way comparable to that of insects or birds.�</strong></em>
<em><strong>However there is one genus (Palystes) whose females possess wing-like projections called apomoses which cover their reproductive organs and sometimes also extend beyond them. These structures serve only as protective covers and are not used for flight.�</strong></em>

<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-wings">Details: Do Spiders Have Wings?</h2>
<p>Most insects have wings, but spiders dont. There are winged species of jumping spider (Salticidae) but these do not have wings in any way comparable to that of insects or birds and so they can&rsquo;t fly either.
The jumping spiders&rsquo; wings are actually a very thin layer of chitin, which is the substance that covers their exoskeleton.
The spider&rsquo;s thorax and head comprise what would be called the cephalothorax in other arthropods (such as crustaceans) and thus wings can&rsquo;t be incorporated into the body plan
Some spiders, called &ldquo;ballooners,&rdquo; use the earth&rsquo;s electric field as it would a compass to lift their bodies into the air on long strands of silk - but they&rsquo;re often attracted by light sources which can cause them to fly into flower-like structures or be trapped in clothing!
The spider can then use this silk to trap particles in the surrounding atmosphere for it to float on. This is a form of transportation known as &ldquo;ballooning.&rdquo;

<h2 id="do-spiders-glide">Do spiders glide?</h2>
<p>Spiders like arboreal tarantulas are excellent jumping�- known to glide from tree to tree - and they might grow glider wings over million�of years.
Also,
<em>Selenops change their whole</em>
body into some airfoil and they&rsquo;ll glide for a long time.
Gliding is a great way for spiders (and other arthropods) to escape from predators, and it&rsquo;s also a good means of transportation if they need go long distances!
Some spiders can even use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">changes in wind currents</a>
or tree branches like stepping stones across gaps too wide for jumping.

<h3 id="how-spider-silk-help-in-flight">How Spider Silk help in flight?</h3>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s silk is the strongest known natural material. It&rsquo;s stronger in some ways than steel and Kevlar, yet it&rsquo;s light as a feather!
Spiders can make silk straight from liquid to solid by spinning out of their mouths or rear ends. The spider makes its own glue when needed, just like you might use Elmers glue from a jar.
Spider silk is made mostly of protein. The spider spins the silk using tiny spigots on its abdomen called spinnerets. Through ballooning, a spider will use the silk�to make voyage cross-ocean journeys!
A few spiders have been found that live in the snowy mountains of Alaska.
Its not surprising they are able to survive so far north, because some species balloon as high as 15 miles into the atmosphere with just their silk and then float back down on air currents.

<h3 id="why-wont-spiders-fly">Why Won&rsquo;t Spiders Fly?</h3>
<p>Spiders�show varied behaviors�and lifestyles compared to other insects. For example, while many insects can use their wings to fly and some spiders do ballooning behavior.
A spiders body is covered in tiny hairs called setae that are too small for the human eye to see. These setae help them sense when they touch something or even if a potential predator has touched or grabbed them!
Some spiders are active during the day and others at night. Some can live on trees, some in sand dunes, or even high up near mountain peaks where it is cold enough to snow!

<h3 id="what-if-spiders-had-wings">What If Spiders Had Wings?</h3>
<p>If spiders had wings, they could fly from one place to another. Unlike other insects that can only use their wings for limited periods of time, a spiders setae would allow it to stay in the air all day long!
If�the spiders could fly, they would be able to find mates much more easily. They could also escape from predators!
But humans would be able to find them much more easily around the house and spaces, so it would not be as safe (they&rsquo;d be nightmare bugs).
The spiders would feed on many pests - comparable to bats, but wouldn&rsquo;t be able to clean up the mess like bats.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do Spiders Have Wings? Well, they don&rsquo;t have wings, b
ut can spiders fly? Yes! Some spiders use the earth&rsquo;s electric field as it would a compass to lift their bodies into the air on long strands of silk - this is called ballooning.</p>
