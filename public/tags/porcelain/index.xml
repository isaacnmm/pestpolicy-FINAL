<h3 id="method-1-using-soapy-detergent-and-warm-water">Method 1: Using Soapy Detergent and Warm Water</h3>
<p>Soapy detergent can be used to clean water-based or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-latex-paint-used-for/">latex paint</a>
without experiencing any challenges since the chemical structure is self-activating and acts upon contact.
Though the detergent does clean wet oil-based paint, the finish quality is not excellent as compare to latex paint removal.
The components in the soapy detergent mix with wet or dried latex paint and breaks it into thick viscous fluid, which more comfortable to clean.
Materials and Tools Needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Soapy detergent and warm water</li>
<li>Empty container or bucket</li>
<li>A clean piece of cloth</li>
<li>Soft blister paintbrush
Steps to Follow</li>
<li>Wear protective gear  gloves, goggles, dustcoat, respirator, and boots</li>
<li>Pour soapy detergent into a container gently</li>
<li>Dilute slightly with warm water  the quantity of water added is a function of the viscosity of the detergent</li>
<li>Dip a clean piece of cloth in soapy detergent and soak it sufficiently</li>
<li>Squeeze and cut excess detergent</li>
<li>Rub the paint stain gently from the porcelain tub - wet paint should be removed immediately without any challenges.</li>
<li>For dried paint, leave the detergent to quench the paint stain for 10 minutes</li>
<li>Gently, scrub the cured paint stain with a soft blister paintbrush  to dislodge paint from the porcelain surface</li>
<li>Pour warm water on the paint and scrub further</li>
<li>Repeat the cleaning process until the entire paint is removed</li>
<li>Rinse the porcelain tub to dry
NB: You can opt to use cold water on soapy detergent. However, cold water requires excess detergent to attain an excellent finish as compared to warm water.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method-2using-turpentine">Method 2:ï¿½Using turpentine</h3>
<p>Turpentine removes both oil-based and water-based paint sufficiently. Upon application, the active agent in turpentine acts instantly upon contact with the paint molecules.
Whether wet or dried paint, turpentine has similar action effects and wont leave any paint traces on the surface.
However, turpentine emits fumes that may irritate your nasal cavity if inhale or may cause skin discomfort upon contact. More so, an excess concentration of turpentine may deface porcelain primary material.
Materials and Tools Needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Turpentine (or acetone alternatively) and empty container</li>
<li>Soft blister paintbrush</li>
<li>Warm water in a bucket</li>
<li>Protective gear and detergent
Steps to Follow</li>
<li>Put on protective gear</li>
<li>Pour turpentine into a container</li>
<li>Dilute slightly  30% to reduce the concentration</li>
<li>Soak a piece of cloth insolvent and squeeze excess  ensure you have gloves for contact protection</li>
<li>Rub the paint-stained section gently. In case of dried paint, leave the surface to cure for 5 minutes</li>
<li>Scrub the cured paint smoothly (with a soft blister paintbrush) until the paint is removed completely</li>
<li>Clean the surface with detergent and warm water to remove traces of turpentine and paint debris</li>
<li>Mop the surface and rinse the porcelain to dryness.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method-3-using-denatured-alcohol-and-damp-cloth">Method 3: Using Denatured Alcohol and Damp Cloth</h3>
<p>Denatured alcohol removes both wet and dried acrylic, epoxy, and latex paint effectively.
The chemical formulation found in denatured alcohol breaks and dissolves the paint molecules forming a viscous fluid that is more comfortable to clean.
Materials and Tools Needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Denatured Alcohol</li>
<li>Warm water in a bucket</li>
<li>Empty can and a piece of cloth</li>
<li>Soft blister paintbrush</li>
<li>Detergent and clean water
Steps to Follow</li>
<li>Wear protective gear - gloves, goggles, respirator, overall, and boots</li>
<li>Pour rubbing alcohol/denatured alcohol into a container</li>
<li>Dilute the rubbing alcohol slightly with warm water</li>
<li>Carry out a drop test experiment to access the removal capability</li>
<li>Apply the solvent over the paint stain and leave it to quench for 10 to 15 minutes</li>
<li>Using a soft blister paintbrush, rub the cured paint until the stain is completely removed</li>
<li>Wash the paint debris with warm water and a piece of cloth</li>
<li>Rinse and wipe the porcelain surface  leave it to dry naturally
NB: Excess concentration of denatured alcohol decolorizes the porcelains primary color.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method-4-using-cleanser-powder-and-sponge">Method 4: Using Cleanser Powder and Sponge</h3>
<p>Cleanser powder decomposes wet paint and kills the surface adhesive contact, thus making both oil-based and water-based paint more comfortable to remove.
For dried paint, cleanser powder needs quenching agents, which act as a staining medium sustainer.
Materials and Tools Needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanser powder</li>
<li>Warm water and a container</li>
<li>Long blister brush</li>
<li>Soap and sponge
Steps to Follow</li>
<li>Wear safety gear</li>
<li>Sprinkle some cleanser power over wet paint stain on a porcelain tub</li>
<li>Leave it for 3 to 5 minutes</li>
<li>Scrub the cured paint stain gently until you clean it completely</li>
<li>Wash the surface with warm water and rinse to dryness</li>
<li>For dried paint stain, dissolve the cleanser powder in a quenching agent before application</li>
<li>Leave the powder solvent to act for 6 minutes</li>
<li>Scrub the paint smoothly with a soft blister brush</li>
<li>Clean the paint debris with water (warm) and soapy detergent</li>
<li>Rinse and leave the porcelain tub to dry naturally</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method-5-using-paint-stripping-chemical">Method 5: Using paint Stripping Chemical</h3>
<p>Stripping chemicals can either be used on acrylic paint or latex paint provided the right chemical matching is undertaken when making your purchase.
The oil-based paint stains should be cleaned using oil-based stripping chemicals and vice versa.
Be careful when thinning stripping chemical since excess concentration may react with primary porcelain material.
Materials and Tools Needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Stripping chemical</li>
<li>Thinner and paintbrush</li>
<li>Detergent and water</li>
<li>Soft blister paintbrush and Clean of Cloth
Steps to Follow</li>
<li>Wear appropriate protective gear</li>
<li>Thin stripping chemical in a container, sufficiently</li>
<li>Apply the stripping chemical over the paint stain and leave it to cure</li>
<li>Scrub the paint gently using a soft blister paintbrush</li>
<li>Wash the paint debris with water and soap  to remove traces of paint stain and stripping chemical</li>
<li>Rinse the porcelain tub with water and leave it to dry naturally</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method-6-use-of-fabric-softener-and-scrubbing-material">Method 6: Use of fabric Softener and Scrubbing material</h3>
<p>Most fabric softeners contain active ingredients, which react and break down the paint chemical structure leaving a thick viscous fluid on the porcelain surface.
With the help of scrubbing material like a soft paint scrubber, you will remove quenched dried paint completely.
Materials and Tools Needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Fabric softener and Scrubbing material</li>
<li>Piece of cloth and water</li>
<li>Empty container and Paintbrush
Steps to Follow</li>
<li>Put on protective gear</li>

<h3 id="method-7-using-lubricating-spray-and-scraper">Method 7: Using lubricating Spray and Scraper</h3>
<p>Using a scraper should be the last option when cleaning paint stains from the porcelain surface since the scraper damages or tears the porcelains primary material.
Therefore, high precautions should be considered during the paint removal process.ï¿½The lubricating spray is needed to quench the paint stain for an easier scrapping process.
Materials and Tools Needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Lubricating spray and Paint scrapper</li>
<li>Rag or mop and Water and soap
Steps to Follow</li>
<li>Pray the lubricating spray over the paint stain until the surface is quenched</li>
<li>Leave the lubricant to cure for 10 minutes</li>
<li>Using a paint scraper, scoop the cured paint gently from the porcelain surface</li>
<li>Repeat the steps above until the entire paint is cleaned</li>
<li>Soak the rag in soap and clean the paint traces</li>
<li>Rinse the porcelain tub with water and leave it to dry</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problems-using-the-wrong-method-cleaning-paint-from-porcelain">Problems Using the Wrong Method Cleaning Paint from Porcelain</h2>
<p>The wrong approach when cleaning your porcelain tub may lead to some of the following problems:</p>
<h3 id="1-color-fading">1. Color fading</h3>
<p>The porcelain tubs primary material is highly affected by a high concentration of tripping chemical or detergent upon application. The concentrated chemical reacts with surface grains and causes color fading with time.
Besides, undiluted soapy detergent infiltrates through porcelain edges and creates a non-uniform color impression (not attractive).</p>

<h3 id="2-formation-of-surface-streaks">2. Formation of Surface Streaks</h3>
<p>The use of paint removal methods such as the use of scraper and scrubbers causes the formation of streaks, which are difficult to restore.
The excess abrasive force used during paint removal tears off the porcelains top layer and at times creates deep impressions that make the tub lose its initial outlook appearance.
Concentrated chemicals (stripping chemicals) if not cleaned immediately, form permanent streaks on the porcelain tub too.</p>
<h3 id="3-damage-of-primary-material">3. Damage of Primary material</h3>
<p>Paint scraper and scrubbing material may damage primary surface material by creating scratches and surface tear that are more cumbersome to restore.
In addition, concentrated stripping chemical reacts and cause peeling of the primary porcelain material- this disfigures and kills the initial tub beauty.</p>
<h3 id="4-breaking">4. Breaking</h3>
<p>The use of undiluted stripping chemicals may react with porcelain material, thus leading to abnormal cracking.
Moreover, the use of hot water when cleaning porcelain tub leads to anomalous expansion, which causes sudden cracking if suddenly sub-cooled with cold water.
Besides, continuous sudden abrasive knocks and strokes (over porcelain tub during paint removal) may cause breakage to the brittle nature of the base material.</p>

<h2 id="precautions-when-removing-paint-from-porcelain">Precautions When Removing Paint from Porcelain</h2>
<p>The following safety measures and precautions should be adhered to when removing paint from porcelain tub:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always match the stripping chemical to the type of paint under removal  water-based paint should be removed by using a water-based stripping chemical</li>
<li>Avoid using hot water when cleaning porcelain tub  sudden expansion and cooling lead to cracking.</li>
<li>Thin tripping chemical or turpentine sufficiently before applying over paint stain to prevent defacing of porcelains primary color</li>
<li>Carry out a drop test experiment before the actual paint removal process is done in order to ascertain the level of the paint removal action.</li>
<li>Follow the manufacturers instructions when using commercial paint removers over your porcelain tub.</li>
<li>Never smell turpentine and other paint-stripping chemicals  the solvents may contain poisonous fumes that may irritate your nasal cavity when inhaled.</li>
<li>Always wear appropriate protective gear (gloves, overalls, boots, goggles, and respirator) when removing paint from the porcelain tub.</li>
<li>Upon cleaning oil-based paint, mop the surface with soap and water to get rid of the paint stain and traces of tripping chemical.
In case you come into contact with tripping chemicals, wash the section with plenty of water and soap. See Also:
