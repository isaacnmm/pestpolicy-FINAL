Heavy items like furniture and luggage needs block support which will allow heat ventilation around clothing and other small items. Note its important for air to move freely through the items you are to heat.</li>
<li>Switch on the heater plug into included digital timer. Then plug digital timer into electrical outlet. Select 6hours on digital timer and switch on the heater.</li>
<li>Put the items for treatment inside the heater on support blocks. Make sure the items will not touch the ceiling or the walls of the heater. Place a wireless thermometer inside the things treated and zip the top cover. Ensure the temperature reaches 120 degrees.</li>

<h4 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Entotherm uses a movable system that delivers heat to any selected, infested area.2.</li>
<li>A movable institution supplies heated liquid through insulated pipes to heat devices that produce hot air at the fleas infested treatment location. 3.</li>
<li>The fabric of a house and the items in it are well monitored by the high temperatures between 140 degrees to 150 degrees.</li>
<li>The heat destroys the fleas protein in their bodies and damages the waxy layers on the upper side of a flea hence causing water reduction in its body.</li>
<li>You will note after some few minutes all fleas will be absolutely destroyed by the high temperatures without any damage to your house items.</li>
<li>To ensure heat is well distributed, to measure and record the whole procedure, some heat sensors are assigned.</li>
<li>After the fleas treatment, a report is given to show heat exposure at the correct temperatures for the correct time.</li>
<li>In some situations, a low toxicity pesticide may be used as to safe guard against fleas attack again in your home.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Most people find it hard on how to make their home fleas free. Although there are so many home remedies to get rid of these parasites, they dont completely kill fleas, eggs and larvae.
