<h3 id="2how-to-repel-sweat-bees-using-your-best-sweat-bee-repellent">2.�How to Repel Sweat Bees using your Best Sweat Bee Repellent</h3>
<p>A humane way to eliminate sweat bees is to repel them. However, not all repellents are made equal, which is why you need to go for a product whose ingredients have been registered with the EPA.</p>
<p>Talk to a doctor if any member of your household is negatively affected by the type of repellant you are using. Exterminators can also recommend a host of superior quality options for the same purpose.</p>

<p>A sure way to keep sweat bees away from your home and property is to locate the areas in which they like to build their nests. Once you find the potential nesting ground, you need to make it unconducive for sweat bee habitation.</p>
<p>Sweat bees like to colonize dry and thin soil and will mostly show up in humid weather. As they love to burrow under the ground, adding layers of mulch is sure to dissuade them from colonizing the area any further. It makes the soil much harder to penetrate.</p>
<h3 id="5-hire-a-professional-exterminator">5. Hire a professional exterminator</h3>
<p>In most instances, it is wise to leave the job to exterminators as they have the training and experience to deal with dangerous insects and pesticides.</p>
<p>Exterminators will take all precautionary measures, including wearing protective clothing. Make a shortlist of reputable exterminators who know how to wipe out sweat bees in your pool, yard, or garden.</p>
<p>Do your groundwork before hiring an exterminator and ask if you need to do anything to prepare for the extermination.
