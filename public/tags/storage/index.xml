<h3 id="2use-trampoline-weather-cover-">2.**Use Trampoline Weather Cover **</h3>
<p>Trampoline covers are designed to help extend the lifespan of the trampoline by maintaining its original shape and keeping it clean. When you use these covers, the trampoline springs and padding will also get protected from the winter, and they will remain in good condition together with the trampoline.
Choosing a high-quality cover will prevent your trampoline from getting damaged during winter. It will also help to stop water from destroying the pads.
When buying your cover, ensure that the drainage hole is present. The drainage hole prevents water from amassing on the bed. The weight of the water may prompt massive damage to your trampoline.
Another tip to look out for when buying your trampoline cover is the quality of the straps. Quality straps will attach firmly on to the frame of the trampoline giving your whole structure protection.
Most trampoline manufacturers recommend buying a PVC trampoline cover as it offers excellent protection to trampoline all year round. Read Also:

<p>You may also choose to leave the frame of the trampoline standing outside. But, first, you should remove the pads and bed of the trampoline. If do not have sufficient space to store it, you can use a trampoline cover to minimize damage.
Trampoline pads and bed are likely to get ruined by heavy snow or harsh weather; hence, its good to put them away, but be cautious of rodents. Trampoline frames are made from durable and rust-resistant material, therefore, can withstand harsh weather conditions.
Cleaning will help to remove dirt or any pests and their larvae which might have taken refuge on the trampoline. Also, after cleaning, let the structure dry up thoroughly to prevent it from getting mildew. Read Also:
