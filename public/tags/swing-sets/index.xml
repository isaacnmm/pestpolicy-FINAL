<h2 id="considerations-for-best-stain-for-cedar-swing-set">Considerations for Best Stain For Cedar Swing Set</h2>
<p>As a parent or owner of a swing set, you need to take some time to maintain your cedar playset. It is important that you and your kids have years of fun.
Resurfacers are denser coatings to lock down splinters and fill cracks in any wood displaying signs of aging. Resurfacer enhances the appearance of weathered or worn out concrete and wood.</p>
<h3 id="1-opaque-finish-options">1. Opaque Finish Options</h3>
<p>Most people who own cedar wood products like cedar swing sets are likely to protect or seal their wood structure using a clear finish that would reveal the real characteristics of the wood.
However, it is important to note that semi-opaque and opaque finishes are great at concealing wood appearance issues on older swing sets.
In addition, these finishes can endure weathering properly compared to clear finishes, meaning, they can last long. Examples of opaque finish options include latex and acrylic stain, or outdoor paint.</p>
<h3 id="2-water-repellents">2. Water-Repellents</h3>
<p>If you are one of those people that wish to go all-natural, then water-repellents preservatives might be ideal for you. Water-repellents stains should be applied to cedar wood that is above the ground. Adding fungicide will help reduce the decay of wood as well as the growth of mildew.
In addition, the fungi will enable the wood to remain durable and strong all year long. The water-repellents stains also help to lower water absorption, but in the short-term.
To control wood discoloration that is triggered by depletion of water-soluble elements, a water-repellent that is rich in low-wax may be applied as a single layer on newly manufactured cedarwood. This may act as a pre-treatment process before you embark on painting. This process will greatly help reduce wood discoloration.</p>
<h3 id="3-exterior-polyurethane">3. Exterior Polyurethane</h3>
<p>Using Polyurethane on your exterior cedar swing set can help to give it a great finish look as well as the ability to endure for years. However, all this will depend on the kind of weathering and friction the swing set is subjected to.
To get a more even finish on your cedar, and the cedar using sandpaper. Then apply either oil-based or water polyurethane in 2-3 layers in a span of few days.
However, if your swing set is always under the full sun, polyurethane might not be a very good choice. This is because under the full sun polyurethane is likely to wear out fast and may need to be removed frequently and reapplied to retain the color of cedar. This process might be expensive to those on budgets and time-consuming.</p>
<h3 id="4-clear-sealer">4. Clear Sealer</h3>
<p>If you want to retain that natural feel or the original color of your cedar swing set, Clear sealers may be the best choice for you. These penetrating sealers are perfect at bringing out the fascinating color of cedar of your wooden swing set.
To make the clear sealers even more appealing, they come in two different shades; the tinted and the clear shade. You get to choose what fits you the most.
Some of these sealers have protective UV absorbers or blockers, which can help in slowing the fading of wood caused by exposure to excess sun.
To maintain the color and appearance of your cedar swing set, you are required to reapply the clear sealers at least once per year. This habit will also greatly help to enhance the water-shedding capabilities of the wood.</p>
<h3 id="5-semi-transparent-stains">5. Semi-Transparent Stains</h3>
<p>This type of stain can either be oil-based or latex. The stain can help to protect the wood grain of all outdoor wood structures. We recommend applying this Semi-Transparent stain to outdoor wood that is permanently located outside.
Structures that are located outside are more prone to algae and mold. Staining them with this semi-transparent mixture will help fight these elements as the stain contains an anti-fungal element, which is known to be effective at fighting mold, algae, or any other naturally occurring element.
Normally, these stains penetrate deeply into the wood and create a strong bond with the wood fibers, forming a great protective stain that fights all these unwanted elements. If you intend to maintain the natural appearance and basic texture of your swing set, you should consider using a semi-transparent stain.</p>
<h3 id="6-spar-urethane-or-spar-varnish">6. Spar Urethane or Spar Varnish</h3>
<p>Spar Urethane or Spar Varnish is a highly recommended wood finish that is ideal for outdoor wood projects. The spar varnish gives wood surfaces a malleable and clear protective coat that safeguards it against splitting into layers when exposed to the sun.
The good thing with the spar varnish is that it deteriorates slowly, giving you value for your time and money for years. To use the spar vanish, just sand the surface of the wood lightly, removing mildew and dirt that might have accumulated over time.
After, apply a layer of spar varnish on to the wood. Spar Urethane is also an ideal option for your outdoor wood needs. It offers UV stability to wood, making them more durable and long-lasting. This wood vanish has similar properties as Spar Urethane.</p>
<h3 id="7-solid-stains-and-resurfacer">7. Solid Stains and Resurfacer</h3>
<p>Resurfacers and Solid color stains are opaque wood finishes that help to conceal the grain while allowing the texture of the wood to show. Solid color stains have two properties; it acts as a sealant and a stain. It helps to protect the wood from sun damage and moisture, allowing it to obtain a rich, opaque color.
Solid color stains do not penetrate wood; they rest on top of the wood as opposed to bonding with it, this can make the wood to flake or chip. Furthermore, solid color stains dont have anti-fungal properties, therefore, may not shield your wooden structures from water properly as compared to the penetrative stains.
However, solid stains are more like paint. A single layer of this stain can be enough on new wood. To get the best performance from the stain, the wood should be primed, then two coats of the stain should be applied. The best solid color stain is one that is 100% acrylic latex and should be applied in two layers to get superior results.
The solid color stain has numerous advantages on wood. They contain an acrylic formulation which offers great bond and durability. This stain is also fortified with urethane helping it to resist peeling and cracking. It also offers resistance against mildew. Finally, it contains a strong UV absorber that protects the wood against UV damage and fading.</p>
<h3 id="8-leaving-cedar-untreated">8. Leaving Cedar Untreated</h3>
<p>If you are on a budget, the color or texture of your cedar swing set should not bother you. Cedarwood can perform fairly well without any finish. When the cedar wood ages it becomes silver-gray with a rustic feel making the appearance different.
However, As opposed to applying a finish, just sand your swings set and wash it annually. Ensure you wash your set with a mild detergent solution using a brush. If you notice any mildew, ensure you treat it using a bleach solution or a mildew wash.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In addition, it offers mold, algae, and mildew resistant finish. They are also good water repellent stains that help to fill cracks in the woods. Therefore, ensure you do annual maintenance and staining on your playsets.
You can relax knowing that your kids are playing on a safe swing set, one that has no risks of splinters, sharp edges, or breakage to bring harm to you or your children.</p>

<h3 id="2-safety">2. Safety</h3>
<p>Safety for your family should be the first thing you look out for when purchasing a swing set.�Ensure that you select a playset that has durable and soft materials.
But first;�Are you looking for a swing set that your kids will use even in the future? Or one that theyll use only as kids? Are you planning to have more kids? Do you often entertain your friends and their children?
A swing set that is safe has its edges rounded or covered. Thus, kids are protected from injuries.�Also, select playsets that have plastic caps that cover edges to ensure safety.
Rubber grips are another safety option that you should consider. Rubber grips are placed on the swing chains to prevent injuries to fingers. Thus, enable the kids to swing without getting injured.</p>
<h3 id="3-future-use">3. Future Use</h3>
<p>As a parent, you may want to make a swing set investment that is viable even as the child grows. You should, therefore, look out for playset features that can be changed as the child gets bigger.
Well, all the above questions are important to determine the kind of playset or swing set you might want to consider. You and Your kids deserve a swing set that you will regularly enjoy for years.
Hence, it important to choose a playset that is built to last and safe for your family. You should also consider a set that can be used by multiple children if you intend to have a large family.�Therefore, buying a set that children will use as they grow up saves money and time.</p>
<h3 id="4-materials-used">4. Materials Used</h3>
<p>Many swing set manufacturers use wood, metal, or plastic as ground materials.
Plastic models are considered safe and inexpensive, while wood is easy to repair as well as environmentally friendly. Other popular materials that manufacturers use include;
Yellow cedar, northern white cedar, and red cedar- these woods are durable and are rot-resistant. However, they lack density, and parents may need to have tools in handy to fasten bolts or screws.
Redwood- this wood is durable, thus perfect for swing sets. It does not rot or decay quickly. When buying a playset check out one that is made of quality redwood if considering a playset made of wood.
Pinewood swing sets are also another option to consider. Pinewood is durable and weather resistant. However, you might need to paint it to bring out its beauty. Look for a playset that is made of Pressure-treated pine wood because it guarantees durability.</p>
<h3 id="5-weight-limit">5. Weight Limit</h3>
<p>If you wish to join your kids while in their outdoor activities, you might want to consider a playset that can accommodate more weight.
When buying a swing set, always consider the weight capacity of the structure. This way, youll also get to have fun with your kids.
Plastic is a great material to consider, especially if you are worried about constant maintenance, wasps, or splinters. An awesome fact with the plastic swing set is that they are low-priced and safe.
Stainless steel- this product is mainly used to make metal swing sets. Swing sets made of stainless less steel are long-lasting and durable compared to plastic or wood.
When buying a metal swing set, purchase one that is made of stainless steel. Stainless steel products guarantee durability, great design, and ease of customization. They are also easy to assemble and maintain.</p>
<h3 id="6-budget">6. Budget</h3>
<p>Your budget will determine the kind of swing set youll get. The good thing is that swing sets are many, and there must be one that fits your budget.
Youll only need to carefully plan and check this guide for directions. Swing sets range from $100-5,000; the options are endless.
Since you are now aware of what materials and features you need to consider, you should not be overwhelmed about finding a safe set that meets your budget.
However, I must inform you that finding a swing set under $1000 that will withstand the test of time will be a challenge. A quality swing set might be approximately $1,500.
You should also leave adequate space that will allow your kids to jump or drop off from the swings, and enough space for sliding off from the slides. Other than leaving adequate space, ensure that your yard is clear of things that might bring injuries like rocks, trees, or fences.
You may also want to think about the future when buying a swing set. Will you construct a pool or any other outdoor structure in the coming years? Will you leave space for your pet? Will you need a garden?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There you have it!! This guide has simplified the process of getting a swing set for your older kids. Hopefully, you have learned a few things about different swing sets and what to look out for. Always remember safety for your family comes first.
With this guide, finding a perfect swing set for your older kids is no longer an issue for you. The guide has covered some of the best swing sets to enable you to select one that you like and can easily afford.</p>

<h2 id="guide---best-swing-sets-for-small-yards">Guide - Best Swing Sets for Small Yards</h2>
<h3 id="1-yard-size-and-capacity">1. Yard Size and capacity</h3>
<p>Yard size must be your first consideration when selecting your best swing set. There are swing sets for different yard sizes. Therefore, determine the size of the area you plan to install the swing set and know if you require a small or larger set.
Make a measurement of your yard, considering the patio furniture, pools, and concrete areas. Consider the possibility of making future adjustments or other facilities in the yard, such as barbecue areas.
The above consideration will enable you to match your needs with the size of the swing set that is available in the market, and thus make the right decision.
Also, you should consider the number of kids that you will need to use the swing set concurrently. Also, determine the type and quantity of activities that you require the kids to undertake on the swing set, such as swinging, climbing, and seesawing.</p>
<h3 id="2-materials-used">2. Materials used</h3>
<p>Most swing set parts are made from cedar wood, steel or poly plastic. Therefore, determine the material you will require depending on your environmental conditions and your requirements.
For example, does the galvanized steel construction have a coating of polyethylene plastic that is UV-protected? Further, you can have swing sets, such as the Swing N Slide set, created from cedar and coated using UV-stabilized plastic.
Plastic material will incur lower maintenance costs that could be caused by insects such as wasps. Also, cedarwood is more robust and highly resistant to any rotting.
However, whichever material you choose for your swing set, it should be sturdy to withstand different varying forces applied to it by the kids playing, be weather resistant, and have right looking colors to blend with your yard quickly.</p>
<h3 id="3design">3.<em>Design</em></h3>
<p>So, how will the swing set be installed in the backyard? You&rsquo;ll need to consider the size and design of every swing set and how it would sit in the garden. Read Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-swing-sets-under-500/">Swing Sets under 500</a>
.
For example, the Monkey Bar Swing set will come with a broader free-standing design and therefore, will require more ground space. However, the Flexible Flyer set is more compact, with its A-frame design, and thus will take less space in the backyard.
Further, you must determine the amount of space that you should leave around the swing set for ease of play by the kids. Further, if your available areas are concreted, you&rsquo;ll need to purchase a rubber yard mulch to makes your kid&rsquo;s landing softer.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years back, I bought a Backyard Discovery Wooden Swing Set for my kids. I spent like 2 days putting it together in our backyard. It was a task on its own.</p>
<p>Recently I noticed wasps around the playset and I think they are getting out of hand. I can call it a Wasps infestation of some sort. The wasps have made my childrens swing set their home.</p>
<p>Our kids are scared to death to play on the playset. So, how do we keep Wasps Away from the swingset?</p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-wasps-away-from-playsets">How to Keep Wasps Away from Playsets</h2>
<ol>
<li>** Using Natural Insect Pest Control **</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Herbs<strong><strong>A mix of vinegar, salt &amp; sugar</strong></strong>Detergent, Tap Water, &amp; peppermint extract</strong></li>

<li>** Maintaining Cleanliness **</li>
<li>** Pesticides**</li>
<li><strong>Calling an exterminator</strong>
*Note: wasps prefer to build their nests in *
<em>crevices</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>and in dark warm areas. On your kids&rsquo; playset, these areas may include inside the playhouse, climber*
**, **
<em>swings, slides, on the roof of the playhouse, among other areas. The wasps can literally attack any section of the playset and find a perfect resting point. This can be dangerous for you and your kids.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-how-do-you-keep"><strong>So, How Do You Keep <strong><strong>Wasps</strong></strong> off- Details</strong></h2>
<p>Well, I did some research online to find out what other people with wasp infestation are doing to end the menace. �I will discuss the methods I used plus those that other people have used and seen success.</p>
<h3 id="1-natural-insect-pest-control">1. Natural Insect Pest Control</h3>
<p>Use the following natural methods to repel wasp invasion.
<strong>a) Use Herbs</strong>
You may decide to plant herbal plants in your backyard, outdoor sitting area, or around the patio. Wasps dont like plants with aroma. Therefore, planting things like thyme, eucalyptus, citronella, among others can help in repelling wasps.
<strong>b) A mix of vinegar, salt &amp; sugar</strong>
A solution of vinegar, salt, and sugar will work wonders. This solution attracts wasps and they get stuck inside the solution for wasps-free playsets. �Youll need a cup of vinegar, 4 tablespoons of sugar, and 4 tablespoons of salt.
<strong>c) Detergent, Tap Water, &amp; Peppermint extract</strong>
Fill tap water in your regular spray bottle; add a cup of any liquid detergent, then add about 20 drops of peppermint extract. This solution is effective at eliminating wasps.</p>
<h3 id="2-fake-wasps-nest">2. Fake Wasps Nest</h3>
<p>After going through various reviews online about using Fake Wasps Nest, I decided to try the method. Well, I mounted two Fake Wasps Nests on the playset and another two in the backyard. I tried to plant them in such a way that my sons wont touch or play with them.</p>
<p>The beauty about these decoy wasp nests is that they fool the wasps into believing that the territory is already taken. Therefore, they move to some other place to build their nests.</p>
<p>These nests trick the wasps into believing that other wasps have already settled into that specific region. Since wasps are territorial in nature, they cant settle where other wasps are present. So they end up moving away.</p>
<p>I bought a ready-made wasp nest from Amazon. However, you can make one yourself. Its pretty simple. �Take brown paper and crumple it. Fill this brown bag with other papers to make it gain more volume. Hang it on your playset and wait for the results.</p>
<h3 id="3-use-wasp-and-hornet-spray">3. Use Wasp and Hornet Spray</h3>
<p>Wasp and Hornet Spray are effective at eliminating wasps. I at one time used the wasp spray on my wooden deck. The wasps had built nests and you could see them flying around. I sprayed the nests thoroughly and killed the wasp population on my deck.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-of-chemicals">4. Use of chemicals</h3>
<p>Some people online claim to have used Break fluid, WD40, and Gasoline to eliminate wasps infestation. Most reported positive results. Nevertheless, I cant verify the truthiness of these claims. I havent used the chemicals yet.</p>
<p>However, if youre going to use either of these chemicals on your kids playset ensure that they dont come into contact with them.</p>
<h3 id="5-pesticides">5. Pesticides</h3>
<p>The use of pesticides to control wasps is another effective method you may consider using for eliminating wasps. Most people love the efficiency and effectiveness of pesticides to kill wasps.</p>
<p>However, some pesticides are extremely dangerous to the environment. Pesticides can also be hazardous to children, pets, and the person applying them.</p>
<p>Therefore, before using pesticides consider using natural wasp control methods that dont have any negative effect on the environment.</p>
<h3 id="6-call-an-exterminator">6. Call an Exterminator</h3>
<p>I remember one of my colleagues had a serious wasp infestation in his backyard. He sought the services of an exterminator who charged him 32$. So, every time he sees wasps he just calls the exterminator.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you feel overwhelmed, you can contact your local pest exterminator to do the work for you. The good part is that most exterminators eradicate everything including bees, rats, wasps, etc.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-wasps-from-invading-your-space">How to Prevent Wasps from Invading Your Space</h2>
<p>So how do you prevent the wasps from building their nests on the playsets or any other place in your backyard? Prevention is better than cure, thus, do the following.</p>
<h3 id="maintain-cleanliness">Maintain Cleanliness</h3>
<p>Ensure that you do regular cleaning around your backyard to prevent wasp invasion. Pick up fallen leaves, twigs, and dead branches and dispose of them properly.</p>
<p>Empty your garbage cans regularly and ensure they remain clean by washing them after each garbage disposal. Put the lid on at all times to keep off insects and wasps.</p>
<h3 id="remove-food-sources">Remove Food Sources</h3>
<p>Food and water attract wasps. Therefore, train your children to thoroughly clean after they are through with playing. They should not leave foods, juices, or even fruits in the playset.</p>
<p>Ensure that the backyard has no leftover foods maybe from picnic scraps; pet food, etc. also, cover the garbage cans properly.</p>
<h3 id="seal-entry-points">Seal Entry Points</h3>
<p>If you start noticing wasps in your backyard, playset, or any other place in the compound, its possible that wasps have built a dwelling. I recommend that you take action immediately. Seal off all their entry points.</p>
<p>You can do this by carefully observing the wasps activity plus the paths they use. This way youll know their exit and entry point. Start sealing off their flight path, all cracks on the frames of windows or doors.</p>
<p>You can even put some of the natural solutions for wasp control weve discussed above to get rid of them completely.</p>
<h3 id="replace-the-playset-roof-with-a-lightweight-mesh-canvas">Replace the Playset Roof with A Lightweight Mesh Canvas</h3>
<p>Wasps flourish well in warm and dark places. The roofing of the playhouse in most playsets is usually thick vinyl roof canvas. You can replace the roofing of the playhouse with roofing that allows light inside the playhouse.</p>
<p>I replaced the solid vinyl roof canvas that the playset had come with with a heavy-duty vinyl mesh canvas. This new roofing allows natural light and air into the set.</p>
<h2 id="diy-wasp-traps-for-backyard-playsets">DIY Wasp Traps for Backyard Playsets</h2>
<p>You can also make your own wasps trap using readily available material. These materials wont cost anything. Read on for easy DIYs on homemade wasp trap</p>
<h3 id="paper-wasp-trap">Paper Wasp Trap</h3>
<p>The idea behind this DIY Paper Wasp Trap is to come up with fake wasp nests using paper bags. Its pretty simple, I will also include a video to make the process much easier for you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you need a brown paper bag, scrunch it, add some paper bags inside to add more volume, tie the top part with a string and hang wasp traps in places where wasps like to frequent.</p>
<p>Apparently, wasps are territorial in nature, so they dont invade places already occupied by another wasps population. With this fake wasps trap, these annoying creatures will move to another place to build their nests.</p>
<h3 id="soda-bottle-wasp-trap">Soda Bottle Wasp Trap</h3>
<p>Another effective DIY method that you can easily make at the convenience of your house is the Soda Bottle Wasp Trap. This wasp trap requires a 2 liters soda water bottle or any other clear bottle you can find.</p>
<p>Cut off the top of the bottle. Try to approximate a quarter from the top and cut the bottle to create a funnel-like shape.</p>
<p>Insert the funnel upside down. The mouth of the funnel should be inside the body of the bottle. Secure the sides properly and seal off any gaps.</p>
<p>Pour any sweetener inside the bottle; you could add honey, wine, or other sugary substance that you can find. Sugary foods attract wasps and theyll be drawn to the bottle by the sweet scent. Once they climb inside, theyll be trapped inside the bottle.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now know How to keep wasps away from playsets. Ensure that you try the natural methods first before reaching out to chemicals or pesticides. As much as we are trying to keep off wasps, we should conserve our environment and make it safe for not only ourselves but also our kids, pets, and other people.</p>

</ol>
<p>Ensure that you stain your playset during the sunny days so that it dries up quickly. This allows your children to embark on their play without much disruption.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-stain-a-playset--details">How to Stain a Playset  Details</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-ensure-the-weather-is-sunny">Step 1: Ensure the Weather is Sunny</h3>
<p>Before you embark on your staining project check the weather and ensure its sunny. Avoid staining your playset during the rainy season.</p>
<p>We recommend doing the staining during sunny days. The sun aids in the quick drying of the playset after youve cleaned up with water.</p>
<p>After applying the stain, you also need to let it dry. Once the stain has dried you might want to add a sealant which is optional. Therefore, warm weather is crucial for a successful staining project.</p>
<p>Tip: staining on damp wood will not bring you the desired results. Damp wood doesnt absorb the stain properly.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-remove-everything-except-the-wood">Step 2: Remove Everything except the Wood</h3>
<p>Playsets usually feature various plastic accessories that provide additional play activities for the kids for a fun-filled playing experience. These accessories may include swings, slides, telescopes, and steering wheels among others.</p>
<p>You should remove all these accessories. You can also remove the canopy roof.� Just eliminate Anything that is not wood from the playset.</p>
<p>Removing all these things from the playset will make staining less difficult. Youll also know what needs to be repaired or replaced. In addition, you protect them from being messed up with the stain.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-clean-the-playset">Step 3: Clean the Playset</h3>
<p>Once you have removed all the plastic accessories, clean them up and store them properly. Start cleaning the playset to remove bacteria, dirt, and mold.</p>
<p>Never stain your playset before cleaning it up. Cleaning the playset provides you a perfect opportunity to inspect it closely.</p>
<p>Thus, you get to understand whether you need just normal cleaning with soap and detergent or power wash.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-clean-the-playset">How to Clean the Playset</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mix bleach and water (half-and-half)</li>
<li>Pour the solution into a pump sprayer</li>
<li>Attach the sprayer into the hose</li>
<li>Clean the playset thoroughly to remove all the dirt, mildew, or bacteria. Use a large sponge or just a rag to scrub the surface of the swing set.
However, if youve got a garden thats close by and youre afraid of the bleach effects on the plants get an environmentally friendly cleaner for your swing set. I recommend Genesis Natural, Non-Toxic, Enzyme Solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-allow-24-hours-for-the-playset-to-dry">Step 4: Allow 24 Hours for the Playset to Dry</h3>
<p>After youre through with the washing allow the playset to dry. Its important that the playset dries up well. So when the 24 hours lapses and its not well dried let it sit for a few more days.</p>
<p>Allowing the swing set to dry up will help to yield the desired results during and after staining. Dried wood absorbs stain better.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-inspect-the-playset-carefully-and-fill-up-any-cracks">Step 5: Inspect the Playset Carefully and Fill Up Any Cracks</h3>
<p>Once youve confirmed that your playset has dried up completely. Its time to inspect it closely. Check for any holes, cracks, or damaged areas.</p>
<p>If there are, any cracks or holes fill them up with wood putty. Putty will blend well with your wooden playset.</p>
<p>In addition, a careful review of the playset will enhance the overall safety of the structure for your children. Youll be able to notice any rough or pointed edges and take appropriate action.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-sand-where-necessary">Step 6: Sand Where Necessary</h3>
<p>Using sandpaper, work on all those rough and pointed edges.</p>
<p>If youre covering a bigger area consider using an electric sander to speed up your project. I recommend
