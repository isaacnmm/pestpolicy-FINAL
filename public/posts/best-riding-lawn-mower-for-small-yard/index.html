<h3 id="1-the-riding-lawn-mower-technology">1. The Riding Lawn Mower Technology<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-the-riding-lawn-mower-technology">¶</a></h3>
<p>What we now call riding lawn mowers were previously known as lawn tractors  a name that makes it look like miniature tractors.
They have a wide deck and very powerful engines thatll easily cut grass in your small or large yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would recommend that you get a zero-turn riding mower since they have engines fixed over the mowers rear wheel.</li>
<li>In addition, as weve noted for the case of small yards, these types of mowers are an excellent choice.
In addition, the riding lawn mowers will allow you to use different accessories or attachments for side discharge, bagging, and mulching.
These are great when you need to navigate tight corners  these are what we call low radius.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-size-of-the-yard-or-lawn">2. Size of the Yard or Lawn<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-size-of-the-yard-or-lawn">¶</a></h3>
<p>The size of the lawn will determine how big a mower youll require. For example, a large lawn will need a mower that can withstand the heating, and power demands to run the whole day.
Riding mowers will be efficient if youll be mowing a lawn thats over 1 acre.
However, the push mowers are highly versatile and efficient for mowing different yards.
Therefore, despite that you require a mower for a smaller yard, youll need to pick one that has a relatively big deck to reduce the number of passes youll need to make.</p>
<h3 id="3-available-transmission">3. Available Transmission<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-available-transmission">¶</a></h3>
<p>Go for the automatic lawn mowers particularly for the small yards. Riding mowers are both in automatic and manual transmissions.
However, for manual transmission, youll require to shift down and up considering the Revolutions per Minute (RPMs).
So, automatic lawn mowers are better because the installed compute will help you shift down and up automatically when the rider steps on the machine&rsquo;s pedal.
However, newer models now use hydraulic transmission because they dont require regular replacement.</p>
<h2 id="best-brands-for-riding-lawn-mower">Best Brands for Riding Lawn Mower<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#best-brands-for-riding-lawn-mower">¶</a></h2>
<p>Definitely, lawnmowers come in different brands, and thus youll require to decide between the available options.
Here is the consideration when deciding between the various mower brands.</p>
<h3 id="1-john-deere-mowers">1. John Deere Mowers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-john-deere-mowers">¶</a></h3>
<p>The riding mowers by John Deere are manufactured in Greeneville, TN  both the 100 &amp; 200 series.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are intelligently designed and tough precision riding lawn tractors and mowers.</li>
<li>John Deere was started in 1837 as the manufacturing company for outdoor building equipment, with quality being their main selling point.
The company sells to both large- and small-scale land and lawn or yard owners. Their unique definition is in yellow and green that characterize the quality of the lawnmowers and tractors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-husqvarna-mowers">2. Husqvarna Mowers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-husqvarna-mowers">¶</a></h3>
<p>Husqvarna Mowers are manufactured in McRae, South Carolina, and Orangeburg  the company is owned by KTM AG (Austrian).</p>
<ul>
<li>The company also makes very high-quality Husqvarna outdoor tractors and mowers.</li>
<li>Husqvarna is known to manufacture mowers that work excellently on both dry and wet grounds and lawns.
However, the riding mowers wont perform well with wet or slippery grounds or grass.
Notably, riding lawn mowers may top over more often compared to push mowers.
However, you can choose the riding mower with rear wheels that are large to enhance its stability and traction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>We noted unique features in riding mowers: (1) wide cutting decks to cut the mowing time, (2) dual-blade cutting to ease mulching (3) battery-powered motors as powerfully as gasoline mowers.
But for most yard owners, it&rsquo;s a big challenge to decide on the best mower between riding mowers, electric mowers, gas mowers, or push mowers.</p>
