<h3 id="1-care-and-maintenance">1. Care and maintenance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-care-and-maintenance">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most modern mini-tillers are electric or battery-powered. This is considered the best alternative because it eliminates the hassle of an oil change, noisy operations, and adds to the carbon footprint.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might want to go for an electric over gas-powered model because there are fewer maintenance requirements.</li>
<li>Gasoline engines are cheaper to buy but are unsuitable for beginners who do not have sufficient knowledge of changing spark plugs and engine oil.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-soil-type-and-ease-of-starting-the-engine">2. Soil type and ease of starting the engine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-soil-type-and-ease-of-starting-the-engine">¶</a></h3>
<p>The type of soil in your garden determines how challenging the tilling exercise is likely to get.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your mini-garden has fertile loamy organic soil, a less powerful tiller is considered ideal and vice-versa.
Since you are dealing with light gardening tasks, you might want to go for a model that starts on the go at the push of a button.
This feature is popular with corded and battery-powered tillers. A smooth start engine is ideal for the all-weather season since it does not require a warm-up period.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-adjustable-handle-and-versatility">3. Adjustable handle and Versatility<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-adjustable-handle-and-versatility">¶</a></h3>
<p>The light-duty nature of the gardening tasks performed by mini-tillers necessitates ease of maneuverability at the slightest turn to allow you to navigate the garden with relative ease.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some tillers feature multiple attachments as compared to others.</li>
<li>This is an essential point of consideration if you are seeking to buy a mini-tiller that serves numerous purposes. However, the same selection criteria apply to all tillers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-warranty">4. Warranty<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-warranty">¶</a></h3>
<p>With this unit, you want to go for a long-term purchase that guarantees a few years of the warranty period. Your choice of manufacturer is an essential consideration in determining the quality of the tiller.
Since gardening activities are bound to be confronted by various unforeseen challenges such as buried debris, large rocks, and other obstacles that are bound to strain the tines and engine, it is prudent to go for a model that offers you a warranty.
This will not only save you unforeseen maintenance costs but also guarantees peace of mind during usage.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>You need the right and reliable miniature version of a garden tiller that powers through sod with minimal effort.
Earthwise TC70025 stands out in our featured list due to its durable and reliable motor engine which features a quick start option.
