<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaners</a>
. I aim to see what the cleaner can do about a severe clog in my kitchen sink.
<em>Summary: Drano Max Gel will liquefy even the most challenging drain clogs in your plumbing or septic systems. This powerful drain cleaner will clean soap scum, hair, shampoo oil, organic matter, paper, &amp; grease. Its ultra-thick to move through standing water, and it&rsquo;s a 100% biodegradable product.�</em>
So, Ill go ahead. The label instruction recommends that I pour about a fifth of cleaner in this container and allow it to sit in there for 15-30 minutes. It&rsquo;s excellent for drains in the kitchen, laundry sinks, bathroom, lavatory, garbage disposals. Luckily, its also odorless, and not corrosive, and wont leave any waste.
<strong>See top drain cleaners.</strong>
I&rsquo;d tried to use boiling water, plungers,
vinegar, and baking soda, but they didn&rsquo;t remove the drain clog
.</p>
<h3 id="whats-this-drano-max-gel">What&rsquo;s this, Drano Max Gel?</h3>
<p>This Drano Max Gel is a powerful enzymatic
drain cleaner
that will clean most of your tough drain clogs. The cleanser is produced by S. C. Johnson &amp; Son  an American company that stands for quality and ethical manufacturing.
But the Drano Max Gel cleaner was first produced in 1923. So, you can guess that it has undergone numerous iterative improvements in safety and quality. �However, the company also has other products such as Drano snake and Drano Aerosol Plunger.
What makes Drano Max Gel unique among all the drain cleaners include-:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its produced to protect your pipes (both PVC and metal pipes) from corrosive action. Also, you can leave it overnight,working on your clogged drain.</li>
<li>It has quick action time  about 15 to 30 minutes before you flush out the debris using warm water.</li>
<li>You can pour into the sink with water, and itll cut through it and get to the drain clog fast with its natural enzyme formula.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="drain-test---time-it-takes-bottle-of-water-to-drain">Drain Test - Time it takes Bottle of water to drain</h2>
<p>To test this Drano
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner&rsquo;s</a>
effectiveness, well time how long it takes to drain a pre-measured bottle of water before and after using the drain cleaner. So, lets get started. I now pour the water (filled to the top line) while setting off the timer to check on time.
So, I am done pouring the water, and it has gone down the drain in 7.74 seconds (
<em>as shown in our timer below</em>
).</p>
<h2 id="now-pour-a-5th-of-the-drano-in-the-clogged-drain">Now, pour a 5th of the Drano in the clogged drain.</h2>
<p>As noted above, it took 7.74 seconds to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">drain the clean water</a>
. We&rsquo;ll come back to this time at the end of the experiment. But first, now we pour the Drano Max Gel.
Therefore, I thoroughly rinsed out this sink. Next, I pour about a fifth of the Drano Max Gel into the drain. Next, I set my timer and allow 20 minutes before we come back for the next process. Finally, the 20 minutes ended.</p>
<h2 id="flash-drain-with-warm-water">Flash Drain with Warm Water</h2>
<p>So, we continue following the label instructions. Next up, we now use warm water to flush the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/sink-not-draining-but-pipes-clear/">drain hoping that Drano has now cleared</a>
the clog. So, we do that right away  flush the water for about a minute, as fast as the faucet can run from the tap.
Luckily, I can already tell that the water is draining much faster than before using the Drano MAX Gel cleaner. When my wife brushed her teeth this morning, the water was backing up and getting to about three-quarters of the sink.
However, to verify my claims, well repeat the drain test  with clean water and a timer.</p>
<h2 id="second-drain-test---draining-clean-water-timer">Second Drain Test - Draining clean water (Timer)</h2>
<p>Now, we go back to the bottle filled with clean water and have our timer running. So, let&rsquo;s get right to the test. So, the water runs down the drain in about 4.36 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, this test shows we achieved faster water draining - but about 3.38 seconds. So, definitely, this Drano Max Gel Clog Remover works, and I would recommend that you trust it for your clogged drains and garbage disposal pipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage-results--">Usage Results: -</h3>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drano Max Gel Clog Remover is made to be a thick formula that&rsquo;ll dissolve even the toughest of the drain clogs. Further, being denser than water, the cleaner will move through standing water and work on the challenging clogs - including hair, soap scum, oils, and grease.
It has no phosphorus and will work great for septic systems, garbage disposals in addition to metal, PVC, and plastic pipes.</p>
