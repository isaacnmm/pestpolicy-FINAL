      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A vibrant, healthy <a href="/posts/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/">lawn</a> is more than just a beautiful aesthetic for your home; it&rsquo;s a living ecosystem that contributes to your property&rsquo;s value and your enjoyment of outdoor space. While regular mowing and watering are crucial, achieving and maintaining truly lush turf often requires a strategic approach to <strong>lawn treatments</strong>. These specialized applications provide essential nutrients, combat weeds and pests, and improve soil conditions, all vital for a thriving green carpet.</p>
<p>Understanding the various types of lawn treatments, when and why to apply them, and common pitfalls to avoid can empower you to transform your yard. This guide will walk you through the essential treatments, help you identify your lawn&rsquo;s specific needs, highlight common mistakes, and ultimately help you decide whether a DIY approach or a professional service is right for you.</p>
<h2 id="essential-lawn-treatments-for-healthy-lawns">Essential Lawn Treatments for Healthy Lawns</h2>
<p>A comprehensive lawn care regimen typically involves several key treatments that work in harmony to promote vigor and resilience:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> This is the cornerstone of healthy lawn growth. Fertilizers supply essential nutrients, primarily Nitrogen (N) for green growth, Phosphorus (P) for root development, and Potassium (K) for overall plant health and stress resistance. Regular feeding replenishes nutrients depleted from the soil, fueling thick, vibrant grass.</li>
<li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Weeds compete with grass for water, nutrients, and sunlight.
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-emergent herbicides</strong> are applied in early spring or fall to prevent weed seeds from germinating (e.g., for crabgrass).</li>
<li><strong>Post-emergent herbicides</strong> target existing weeds, killing them without harming the surrounding grass (selective herbicides) or killing all vegetation (non-selective herbicides for spot <a href="/posts/best-flea-treatment-for-dogs/">treatment</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Various insects can damage lawns, from surface feeders like chinch bugs and sod webworms to subsurface pests like grubs. Insecticides are applied to control these populations and prevent widespread damage.</li>
<li><strong>Disease Control (Fungicides):</strong> Fungal diseases (e.g., brown patch, dollar spot, red thread) can appear as discolored patches and weaken grass. Fungicides can be applied preventatively or curatively to manage these issues.</li>
<li><strong>Aeration:</strong> Over time, soil becomes compacted from foot traffic, mowing, and even rain. Aeration involves creating small holes in the lawn to alleviate compaction, allowing air, water, and nutrients to penetrate deeper into the root zone.</li>
<li><strong>Dethatching (Power Raking):</strong> Thatch is a layer of living and dead organic material (stems, roots) that accumulates between the grass blades and the soil surface. A thin layer is beneficial, but excessive thatch (over 1/2 inch) can prevent water and nutrients from reaching the roots and harbor pests/diseases. Dethatching removes this excess.</li>
<li><strong>Overseeding:</strong> Spreading new grass seed over an existing lawn helps to thicken turf, fill in bare spots, and introduce newer, more resilient grass varieties. It&rsquo;s often done after aeration or dethatching to improve seed-to-soil contact.</li>
<li><strong>Soil Amendments:</strong> Beyond N-P-K, soil pH and composition are critical. Amendments like lime (to raise pH in acidic soils) or sulfur (to lower pH in alkaline soils) can optimize nutrient availability. Organic matter (compost) improves soil structure.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-treatments-your-lawn-needs">What Treatments Your Lawn Needs</h2>
<p>Determining your lawn&rsquo;s specific treatment needs is crucial. A &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; approach often leads to wasted effort, money, or even harm.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conduct a Soil Test:</strong> This is the most important step. A professional soil test (available through your local university extension office or private labs) provides a detailed analysis of your soil&rsquo;s pH, nutrient levels (N-P-K), and organic matter content. This information is invaluable for tailoring a fertilization plan and identifying specific deficiencies or imbalances.</li>
<li><strong>Observe Your Lawn:</strong> Be a keen observer.
<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Is it dull, yellow, or patchy? (Suggests nutrient deficiency, disease, or watering issues).</li>
<li><strong>Density:</strong> Are there bare spots, or is it thin? (Indicates need for seeding, improved soil health, or pest control).</li>
<li><strong>Weeds:</strong> What types of weeds are present? (Helps determine appropriate weed control).</li>
<li><strong>Pests:</strong> Look for signs of insect activity (chewed blades, wilting, tunneling).</li>
<li><strong>Water Penetration:</strong> Does water puddle on the surface, or does it soak in quickly? (Indicates compaction, suggesting aeration).</li>
<li><strong>Feel the Soil:</strong> Is it hard and compacted or loose and crumbly?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consider Your Grass Type and Climate:</strong> Different grass types (cool-season vs. warm-season) have different active growth periods and nutrient needs. Local climate (rainfall, temperature extremes) also influences watering and treatment timing.</li>
<li><strong>Assess Thatch Layer:</strong> Push your finger into the turf. If the spongy layer of dead grass and roots above the soil is thicker than half an inch, dethatching might be needed.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="8-common-mistakes-in-lawn-treatment">8 Common Mistakes in Lawn Treatment</h2>
<p>Even with good intentions, homeowners often make mistakes that hinder their lawn&rsquo;s health:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mowing Too Short:</strong> &ldquo;Scalping&rdquo; the lawn weakens grass, promotes shallow roots, and makes it more susceptible to weeds, disease, and drought stress. Follow the &ldquo;one-third rule&rdquo;: never remove more than one-third of the blade height at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Improper Watering:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too Shallow/Frequent:</strong> Encourages shallow root growth, making grass vulnerable to drought.</li>
<li><strong>Too Much/Infrequent:</strong> Can lead to fungal diseases and root rot.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Water deeply (1-1.5 inches per week, including rainfall) and infrequently, encouraging deep root systems. Water in the early morning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring a Soil Test:</strong> Guessing fertilizer needs can lead to over or under-application of specific nutrients, creating imbalances or environmental runoff.</li>
<li><strong>Applying Fertilizer at the Wrong Time:</strong> Fertilizing cool-season grass heavily in summer or warm-season grass in winter can stress the lawn. Timing is crucial for nutrient uptake and growth cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Using Dull Mower Blades:</strong> Dull blades tear and fray grass blades, leaving them vulnerable to disease and giving the lawn a ragged, brownish appearance. Sharpen blades regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Neglecting Aeration:</strong> Compacted soil chokes roots and prevents essential air, water, and nutrients from reaching them. Regular aeration is vital, especially for high-traffic lawns.</li>
<li><strong>Over-Applying Products:</strong> More is not always better. Excessive fertilizer can burn the lawn, and too much herbicide can damage grass or runoff into waterways. Always follow label instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Not Addressing Weeds/Pests Early:</strong> A small weed problem can quickly become an infestation. Ignoring early signs of pests can lead to significant lawn damage. Proactive and timely intervention is key.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="benefits-of-a-professional-service">Benefits of a Professional Service</h2>
<p>While DIY lawn care offers control and cost savings, professional lawn treatment services provide distinct advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expertise and Diagnosis:</strong> Professionals are trained in turf science, allowing them to accurately identify specific grass types, soil conditions, diseases, and pests. They can tailor a precise treatment plan.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial-Grade Products and Equipment:</strong> Professionals have access to higher-quality, more effective products and specialized equipment (e.g., commercial-grade aerators, precision spreaders) that are not readily available to the average homeowner.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Saving and Convenience:</strong> Outsourcing lawn treatments frees up your valuable time, eliminates the need for product storage, and removes the physical effort involved in application.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Results:</strong> Scheduled, expert applications ensure your lawn receives the right treatments at the optimal times, leading to more consistent and superior results.</li>
<li><strong>Guarantees:</strong> Many professional services offer guarantees, meaning they will re-treat your lawn if you&rsquo;re not satisfied, providing peace of mind.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> Professionals are trained in the safe handling and application of chemicals, minimizing risks to you, your family, and pets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lawn-treatment-diy-or-hire">Lawn Treatment: DIY or Hire?</h2>
<p>The decision between DIY lawn treatments and hiring a professional service hinges on several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> DIY generally has lower <em>upfront</em> costs for products, but you must factor in equipment purchases/rentals and the potential cost of mistakes. Professional services have a higher <em>annual</em> cost but include labor, expertise, and often better results.</li>
<li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> DIY requires significant time for research, shopping, application, and troubleshooting. Professional services offer significant time savings.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge and Effort:</strong> DIY demands a willingness to learn about lawn care science, diagnose issues, and physically apply treatments. Professionals handle all of this.</li>
<li><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> If you seek a consistently pristine, golf-course-quality lawn with minimal personal effort, professional services are often the better path. If you enjoy the process, learn quickly, and are satisfied with good results, DIY can be fulfilling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, DIY is suitable for those who enjoy the process, have the time, and are willing to learn. Professional services are ideal for busy homeowners, those with persistent lawn problems, or anyone desiring top-tier results without the personal effort.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soil <a href="/posts/subterranean-termites-treatment/">treatment</a> for termites involves using some contact insecticides around your house and yard to create barriers. The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">subterranean termite control</a>
process is divided into pre-construction plus the post-construction treatment.
Soil treatment for termites applies some termite insecticide like
<a href="https://iaspub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=CHEMICALSEARCH:3:::NO:1,3,31,7,12,25:P3_XCHEMICAL_ID:2377">fipronil</a>
or

on the structures like the house or wall foundations and wood.
However, you may termite-proof wood through pressure-treating using chemical insecticides or spraying. Also, you may place termites baits at appropriate locations in the yard.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Termites Control&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrEcTs2tJI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrEcTs2tJI</a>
However, for Drywood, Dampwood, or Formosan termites, I recommend undertaking
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7440.html">fumigation</a>
or use one of the
approved termite killers
. Below I&rsquo;ve discussed how you can treat the soil for termites.</p>
<h2 id="a-pre-construction-or-pre-treat-termite-treatment">A. Pre-Construction (or Pre-Treat) Termite Treatment</h2>
<p>Termites will cause significant damage to your home
, and sadly this isn&rsquo;t covered in the homeowner&rsquo;s insurance. These damaging insects will hide in furniture and walls until they&rsquo;re mature.
Here&rsquo;s how you should do the pre-construction (or Pre-Treat) termite soil treatment to protect your structure at the initial construction phase.</p>
<h3 id="1-borate-pre-treat-on-exposed-wood"><em>1. Borate Pre-Treat on exposed wood</em></h3>
<p>Pre-treat all the exposed wood studs on your house and nearby structures. Use a wood preservative or insecticide like Boracare as the
termite prevention
ability will last the treated wood&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig a 6 inches (deep) by 6 inches (wide) trench in the soil around the house or structure to be pre-treated for termites.</li>
<li>Next, use the insecticide to soak the soil in the house foundation&rsquo;s hole as directed in the product instructions. But I would recommend using a bucket (5 gallons) as opposed to a sprayer bottle.</li>
<li>Mix up the soil in the termite treatment trench using a suitable shovel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-pre-treat-foundational-walls">2. Pre-Treat Foundational walls</h3>
<p>For this, you&rsquo;ll need to use a termiticide such as Termidor SC to pre-treat the foundation walls at their soil level for termites. But pre-treat the soil before pouring the slab - for new construction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Termidor SC to pre-treat the concrete slabs, and this would work better if you apply the insecticide under the selected concrete slab - this is before pouring.</li>
<li>But for a slab that&rsquo;s already installed - you&rsquo;ll have to inject the chemical termite killer via a drill hole. Therefore, the insecticide will still pre-treat the soil underneath.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuVj457vDFg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuVj457vDFg</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-termi-mesh-barrier-and-sentricon-baiting-">**3. Termi-mesh Barrier and **Sentricon Baiting ****</h3>
<p>The Terms-mesh termite barrier that homeowners can apply on their piping penetrations before pouring the concrete to lay the slab.
Terms-mesh is a closely-knit mesh (made from stainless steel) that lasts for a long time, and hence the termites won&rsquo;t easily penetrate it to eat your house and nearby structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, Termi-mesh is mainly offered as an additionaltermite controlservice instead of a stand-alone offer by the exterminator companies.</li>
<li>Next, install the sentricon baiting around your structure&rsquo;s perimeter. This will be done only after you&rsquo;ve completed all the landscaping. Also, ensure to continually (yearly) monitor the baiting system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b-post-construction-or-post-treat-termite-treatment">B. Post-Construction (or Post-Treat) Termite Treatment</h2>
<p>You may apply the termiticides on the wood or soil after the construction process is complete. The soil treatment insecticides can come in the form of
baits
or liquids.</p>
<h3 id="1wall-foundations-or-pipes">1.�Wall Foundations or Pipes</h3>
<p>The process may also involve rodding or trenching the soil around the wall foundations or pipes and piers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig narrow trenches outside &amp; inside the structure&rsquo;s (chimney or piers) foundation before injecting your termiticides into the soil.</li>
<li>Conduct a termite inspection (both outside and inside areas) on the house and other structures. You may engage a termite inspection company (but consider<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-inspection-cost/">termite inspection cost</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-crawl-spaces">2. Crawl spaces</h3>
<ul>
<li>For crawl spaces, treat the soil with Termidor SC through the dug holes or trenches. For this, you&rsquo;ll also need to dig 6 inches (deep) by 6 inches (wide) trenches around wall footing, foundations, trench, piers. Pour and mix up the insecticides with the soil.</li>
<li>To treat the basements for termites, drill some equally spaced holes on the floor and inject the termiticide insecticide into the underlying soil.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-vertical-barrier">3. Vertical Barrier</h3>
<p>You can establish a vertical termite barrier by applying insecticide in the hole (6 inches deep) via rodding, trenching, and trenching along with the foundation elements like pillars, pilasters, and chimney bases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid applying the insecticide into your drainage system if there is a danger of reaching the foundation drainage, french drains, or drain tile.</li>
<li>If the structure footing is exposed, you&rsquo;ll need to be applied next to (not under) the footing. Also, ensure you termite treat the soil around strictures like all the conduits and sewer pipes.</li>
<li>Caution, concrete slabs may provide other entry points for termites such as plumbing outlets and bath traps - which may render your previous termite treatment ineffective. Therefore, conduct good drilling as this will readily.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4wood-treatment">4.<strong>Wood treatment�</strong></h3>
<p>This requires you to apply the termiticides on your wood, preventing or controlling a termite infestation. Some of the methods for a termite treatment on wood include pressure-treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-treating the wood and the soil around it makes your structures to be termite andcarpenter antsresistant.</li>
<li>The treatment involves the application of a chemical preservative through the use of high pressure.</li>
<li>Also, wood spraying using an effective termiticide allows the wood to be protected on its surface, but this chemical won&rsquo;t get deep into its pores.
<strong>5. Foundation Termite Treatment�</strong>
Treating the foundation for termites will also involve applying the termiticides on the house or wall foundations and elements.
It helps build a barrier via positioning the termiticides in the brick walls or concrete block - between the walls where you find a space.
Treating and drilling the house foundations enables the termiticides to penetrate the concrete footings that could have crevices and cracks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Soil treatment for termites with different termiticides, including liquid termite to create a termite barrier plus you may use other termite killers and termite baits.
Termiticides have active ingredients such as 7.9% bifenthrin that&rsquo;ll both repel and kill termites - both instantly and have a more prolonged residue effect killing both fleas (
check flea foggers
), ticks, and ants.</p>

The insects will chew or gnaw wood and house items like filtration systems, swimming pool liners, insulation, books, and paper. Also, termites can cause emotional strain on homeowners.
In summary: Subterranean termites treatment begins with the wood cure to strengthen the wood and prevent the insects from eating it. Spaying the wood (spot treatment) with the
best termite killers
such as termiticide hinders the termites from chewing your structures.</p>

<p>Equally,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-inspection-cost/">termite inspection costs</a>
might be relatively high - also, termite fumigation is equally pricey. So, below I&rsquo;ve discussed the best subterranean termites treatment available for your taking.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="1-apply-liquid-termiticide">1. Apply Liquid Termiticide</h3>
<p>Apply the liquid termiticide underneath and around the wooden or various structures - particularly on portions that termites may attack.
In case you&rsquo;re dealing with new construction, I advise you termite-treat the foundation walls plus the graded soil before pouring your concrete slab. The termite &ldquo;swarmers&rdquo; shed its wings, drop off on the ground and get mates ready to create new colonies.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll have to drill and trench their foundation for the already build structures to treat them with the termiticide. The process creates a barrier between the structure and the termites hiding in the soil.</li>
<li>Further, the termite barrier will also hinder the building&rsquo;s termites from getting back to the soil. Therefore, they will eventually die from dehydration.
Subterranean termite infestations are mainly discovered during spring - they&rsquo;re triggered by rainfall and warm temperatures as they disperse and begin new colonies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-apply-repellent-termiticides">2. Apply Repellent Termiticides</h3>
<p>The pyrethroid termiticide repellents will work just as well as the liquid termiticides to
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef604">repel and kill the termites</a>
attacking your wooden structures. You&rsquo;ll apply it to structures and features, including landscaping, plumbing lines.</p>
<ul>
<li>These repellents with Pyrethroids will quickly poison the termite&rsquo;s nerve but are less toxic to the mammals. The repellents are like Prelude, Demon, Talstar, Cynoff, and Dragnet FT.</li>
<li>The repellent Termiticides will work against the termites that&rsquo;ll work on the termites foraging in areas such as beneath the soil. This also creates a barrier against these foraging and gnawing insects.
Further, pyrethroids are equally cheap to be used as a termite barrier. But the insecticide may sometimes detect the termiticides and hence won&rsquo;t touch the termite barrier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-apply-non-repellent-termiticides">3. Apply Non-Repellent Termiticides</h3>
<p>The non-repellent termiticides will also work against the termites attacking your structures. Luckily, unlike the repellents, termites won&rsquo;t easily detect the presence of the non-repellent termiticides.</p>
<ul>
<li>The termites will easily contact the non-repellent termiticides as they forage in the soil thus are exterminated. Some include Premise by Bayer - with small Imidocloprid doses and kill through contact.</li>
<li>The premise is pricey compared to the pyrethroids. However, Premise can be applied either as spot treatments or also as aerosol or spray form.</li>
<li>Phantom by BASF, made from chlorfenapyr, which is a non-repellent termiticide. The chlorfenapyr will be toxic to the termites when the chemical is broken down through enzymatic action in their immune system.
The chlorfenapyr&rsquo;s metabolites are highly poisonous and will hence stop the termite from generating energy. But the termites won&rsquo;t die instantly and hence will continue transmitting the termiticide back to the nests.
Ask your realtor or the home seller for non-toxic sodium borate and termite barriers. If you are building your own home, you can ask your contractor for professional pre-treatments to be done, so ensure that your home remains free.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-termite-bait-stations">4. Termite Bait Stations</h3>
<p>Termite bait stations
are also the best termite killers. They are drilled into the soil in affected areas or probable entry points of termites. These contain germicidal nematodes that effectively bait subterranean termites.</p>
<ul>
<li>These baits are toxic and lethal parasites in the form of larvae. The termites ingest the nematodes, and once they mature, these parasites will kill their termite host and lay eggs for other termites in the colony to feast on. Eventually, they will spread and acts as a natural defense against termites.</li>
<li>Subterranean termite treatment needs to begin with prevention. Since these species thrive in moist areas and wooden structures that are in contact with the soil, the best way to prevent them from finding their way into your home is to treat the surrounding soil around your house.
Soil treatment involves the injection of short-lived toxins in the surrounding ground surface and foundation of your home. Mostly, these toxins will have a life span of 5 years. You may want to keep track of dates to keep you aware of how long your soil remains in a toxic state.
Fun Fact: Formosan subterranean termite (known as Super Termites) originated from southern China and Taiwan and are highly destructive. These ferocious pests can eat about 13 ounces of wood in a day and can total your home into a useless structure in 3 months. They attack a wide variety of structures that can include trees, buildings, and even boats.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-professional-termite-exterminators">5. Professional Termite Exterminators</h3>
<p>With severe subterranean termite infestations, it is most recommended for you to seek a professional pest control agency&rsquo;s services. Have them diagnose the extent of infestation and damage to your home and discuss the treatment approach.
Make sure you choose one that stands firm on choosing non-toxic and environmentally safe chemical solutions.�Getting on a head start whenever you buy or rent a
home is your best defense
against termites. Of course, whenever you purchase a home, it is always best to buy a home that has been recently built and certified with termite pre-treatments.
Although older homes may not be as stringent with termite pre-treatments upon selling, certain states require a complete and thorough termite inspection with a mandatory order for the owner to shoulder any termite treatments needed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The bad news about subterranean termite infestation is, once a colony has been established in your area, it could be almost futile to eradicate them. They will always keep trying to attack. Your best defense to keep from coming back is to check for vulnerable areas of your home and maintain treatments.</p>
