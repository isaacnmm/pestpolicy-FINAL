Well, the best pressure washer for paint removal would do the magic! So, remove rust and paint from concrete, metal, or wood - you&rsquo;d need a pressure washer with roughly 2000 - 4000 PSI (pounds per square inch).</p>
<p>The machine&rsquo;s minimum size should be around 1200 - 2000 PSI for simple cleaning different surfaces before doing the paint job.
The high-pressure DIY power washer will also be effective in cleaning the outer part of your house as it&rsquo;ll peel and
<a href="http://www2.ca.uky.edu/hes/fcs/factshts/HF-LRA.051.PDF">flake off the paint</a>
from both concrete and wood. However, control the pressure effectively to avoid damaging the wood under the paint coat.</p>

The pressure washer has five spray nozzles that measure 0; 15; 25; &amp; 40 to match various machine pressure as required for your paint removal job - it&rsquo;ll work the same for different levels of stains of grime and dirt.
