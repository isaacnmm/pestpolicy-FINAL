      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pests can be a major issue for restaurants, potentially leading to health code violations, reputation damage, and financial losses.</p>
<p>Implementing a proactive <a href="/posts/affordable-pest-llc-review/">pest</a> control strategy is essential to maintain a clean and safe environment for both customers and staff. Here are some key steps to prevent pest infestations in your restaurant:</p>
<h3 id="1-regular-inspections"><strong>1. Regular Inspections:</strong></h3>
<p>Regular inspections of your restaurant premises are crucial for detecting pests early. Schedule inspections on a regular basis, at least weekly, and more frequently in high-risk areas
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-are-small-brown-insects-in-my-kitchen/">such as the kitchen</a>
and storage areas.</p>
<p>Look for signs such as droppings, gnaw marks, nests, or unusual odors that may indicate the presence of pests. Pay attention to less obvious areas like behind equipment, under sinks, and in storage rooms.</p>
<h3 id="2-seal-entry-points"><strong>2. Seal Entry Points:</strong></h3>
<p>Pests can enter your restaurant through even the smallest gaps and cracks. Inspect and seal any gaps or cracks in walls, floors, and around pipes to prevent pests from entering your restaurant.</p>
<p>Use materials like silicone caulking or steel wool to seal these entry points effectively. Ensure that windows and doors close tightly, and consider installing screens on windows and doors that are frequently opened to maintain ventilation while keeping pests out.</p>
<h3 id="3-proper-food-storage"><strong>3. Proper Food Storage:</strong></h3>
<p>Proper food storage is critical to prevent pests from accessing and contaminating your food supplies. Store food in sealed containers made of glass, metal, or durable plastic.</p>
<p>This not only keeps pests out but also protects your food from spills and other contaminants. Keep all food off the floor and away from walls to reduce hiding places for pests and make it more difficult for them to access your food supplies.</p>
<h3 id="4-maintain-cleanliness"><strong>4. Maintain Cleanliness:</strong></h3>
<p>Maintaining a clean environment is one of the most effective ways to prevent pest infestations.</p>
<p>Clean up spills promptly and thoroughly to eliminate potential food sources for pests. Regularly empty and clean trash bins, ensuring they are tightly sealed to prevent pests from accessing food waste.</p>
<p>Consider using trash bins with lids that lock to further deter pests. Clean kitchen appliances, equipment, and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-cordless-stick-vacuums/">floors daily to remove food debris</a>
that can attract pests. Pay special attention to areas where food particles can accumulate, such as under appliances and behind equipment.
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
In addition to these primary measures, it&rsquo;s also important to monitor moisture levels, manage trash effectively, work with pest control professionals, educate employees, maintain outdoor areas, monitor external deliveries, document pest control efforts, and stay informed about local regulations.</p>
<p>Implementing these comprehensive strategies will help you prevent pest infestations and maintain a safe environment in your restaurant.</p>

      <description>When you get signs of pests in or around the house, it&amp;#39;s critical that you hire a reliable and efficient pest exterminator.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you get signs of pests in or around the house, it&rsquo;s critical that you hire a reliable and efficient pest exterminator.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pest-control-near-me/">Top bug control services</a>
such as
Terminix
and
Orkin
will inspect the house and undertake some appropriate treatment to control the pests.
Below, I have reviewed American Pest for its effectiveness considering factors such as customer ratings, treatment effectiveness, availability, and costs.
Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="details-american-pest-control-service">Details: American Pest Control Service</h2>
<p>American Pest is a Washington-based and family-owned bug control company that has been in existence for 90 + years.
Over those years, the company has received a number of excellence awards including from the EPA (for less environmental release of pesticides) and the Department of States in the United States.
They will also prevent and control ants and ticks in your backyard.
The various pests included in their bug control plans include stink bugs, stinging insects, ringtails spiders, silverfish, rodents, rats, pavement ants, oriental cockroaches, house ants, mosquitoes, millipedes, mice, lone star ticks l, ladybird beetles, meal moths, flies, flies, fleas, drugstore beetles, crickets, cockroaches, clover mites, cigarette beetles, centipedes, carpet beetles carpenter ants brown dog ticks box elder bugs black-legged ticks bed bugs, ants, American dog ticks, and American cockroaches.

.
The effective viral disinfectant is an additional and attractive service that the company offers (among other extra services) that sets it apart from other <a href="/posts/pest-control-near-me/">exterminators</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this service, American Pest uses materials such as DSV which have been documented to remove SARS-CoV-2 - as approved by EPA.
The additional services have been documented to release tension in the community or households attacked by organisms including SARS-CoV-2.</li>
<li>The wipe-down and disinfecting remedy will help <a href="/posts/southern-pest-control-review/">control</a> or prevent contamination with coronavirus on various services.
Luckily, including these wipe-down and disinfecting services into your vacuuming and deep cleaning plans will help protect large areas with minimal effort.
I would recommend these additional services for areas such as busy households, workplaces, and large buildings.</li>
<li>For the first termite control on your premises, American Pest offers a $125 promotional discount.</li>
<li>Also, you will get free estimates and around $50 on the first bug control
Some customers give positive feedback on the &ldquo;free estimates&rdquo; because the company sends technicians to undertake &ldquo;inspection&rdquo; for just $100.
However, inspections are only recommended for clients that don&rsquo;t understand their pest problem or when the exterminators want to estimate the cost.
I noted that the company is classified as being Green Pro Certified which means they are active in pursuing environmental safety both in the use of products and procedures.</li>
<li>For example, American Pest has a clear plan on how to undertake pest control (while protecting the environment) on premises that have kids or pets.

</ul>
<h2 id="upsides-and-downsides-of-american-pest-control">Upsides and Downsides of American Pest Control</h2>
<p>Upsides</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer protection from different wildlife and bug species</li>
<li>Its pest prevention and management are environmentally friendly</li>
<li>The website has online chat for clients</li>
<li>Qualified entomologists are the ones who create and oversee the bug management programs</li>
<li>Offers the Powerful Virus Disinfectant as an extra service
Downsides</li>
<li>Frequent errors or issues with free estimates</li>
<li>Billing issues for some clients</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pests-covered-and-plans-offered">Pests Covered and Plans Offered</h2>
<p>American Pest Control provides bug and wildlife control for commercial and residential spaces or premises in the Illinois area.
The companys exterminators and bug technicians use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for the control of various pests including;</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildlife</li>
<li>Moles</li>
<li>Wasps</li>
<li>Birds</li>
<li>Spiders</li>
<li>Bees</li>
<li>Mosquitoes</li>
<li>Flies</li>
<li>Rodents</li>
<li>Bed bugs</li>
<li>Roaches</li>
<li>Ants</li>
<li>Termites
The IPM method of controlling pests involves a toned-down technique for applying chemical pesticides but only using whats critically necessary for your current bug issue.</li>
<li>The aim is to maintain a mindful effect (positive or negative) on the surrounding environment.</li>
<li>For example, the company will use preventative techniques on your house such as removing warm water and food (their access to pests) and sealing bug entry points.
The initial visit by the company to your premises will include the technicians inspecting the home for best and outlining a plan to eliminate and prevent their reoccurrence.
Next, the American Pest technicians will create a bug control plan customized to the needs of your home.</li>
<li>The custom pest control plan will depend on the local climate and the changing seasons since they affect the pest&rsquo;s activity.
Below is an outline of what the American Pest technicians will do for the unique seasons.</li>
<li>Winter - technicians will undertake preventative pest services against wildlife to keep them off the home.</li>
<li>Fall - The strategy will involve prevention methods against rodents and pests - stopping them from getting into the home.</li>
<li>Summer - during summer, the pest technicians focus their pest control on the outdoors aiming to reduce flies, ants, mosquitoes, andfleas in the yard.</li>
<li>Spring - During spring, the American Pest technician will inspect for signs of a growing pest infestation while also treating for regular spring pests.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-locations">Service Locations</h2>
<p>American Pest offers its services to both commercial and residential properties including for birds such as mosquitoes, ticks, ants, termites, and bed bugs in a number of locations including;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sterling</li>
<li>Peoria</li>
<li>Pekin</li>
<li>Lincoln</li>
<li>Greenville</li>
<li>Galesburg</li>
<li>Champaign</li>
<li>Canton</li>
<li>Bloomington
The appropriate way to determine whether American Pest offers its services in your locality would be to call the client service line.</li>
<li>Representatives will check if the company offers their services in that zip code and also assist you to get a quote.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall American pest comes out as a positively reviewed exterminator service that has qualified technicians to handle different pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the company&rsquo;s services are not widespread enough last day and their website does not have enough details on the Pest Management processes.
Other recommendations that I would rate higher than this company include
Rentokil pest control
.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Armored Pest Svc is an Idaho-based bug control company. Other cities it operates include Oklahoma, Columbus, Kansas City, Arizona, Phoenix, and Englewood.</p>
<ul>
<li>The company does not have a storefront but offers door-to-door sales, website booking, and phone appointments.
Armored Pest Svc undertakes preventive and routine treatment for pests like silverfish cockroaches wasps, ants mice, and
spiders
The company does not notably offer specialized control of serious bugs such as that for termites.

</ul>
<h2 id="details-armored-pest-svc-review">Details: Armored Pest SVC Review</h2>
<p>Armored Pest Svc, however, provides their pest control to residential clients only.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can book routine pest control or annual plans for the prevention of pests.
The company claims that its pest control only utilizes non-toxic insecticides or pesticides.
Also, they will use a suitable enclosure when handling household infestations.</li>
<li>For example, Armored Pest Svc uses BLUEguard in its pest prevention mission.
The company does not use traditional marketing but hires contract marketers who use a door-to-door sales strategy.
I noticed that the company&rsquo;s contracts were highly advantageous to most homeowners as they comprehensively cover most common pests.
For example, the technicians offered to remove spider webs and wasp nests that they found in the house during the preventative treatment.</li>
<li>I can report that the preventative treatment (specifically the annual plan) is cheaper compared to using reactive pest treatment.

</ul>
<h2 id="negative-vs-positive-reviews-of-armored-pest-svc">Negative vs Positive Reviews of Armored Pest SVC</h2>
<p>I sought to examine if the claims by armor pest defense matched up to the reviews given by the customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>My conclusion is that there was a negative correlation - where customers reported the Pest Control services as being of poor quality.
However, the positive client reviews were notably many compared to the negative customer feedback.
Celebrity client reviews reported harmful and concerning company operations and practices.
For example, some of the customers reported the other companies&rsquo; door-to-door salespersons used overly aggressive strategies.</li>
<li>Some of the salespersons over-promised on the service quality, they underrepresented the contract&rsquo;s financial obligations, lied about the pest problems, and some even refused to leave customer premises.
Besides, other clients reported the company building services that one under-delivered or even where the <a href="/posts/affordable-pest-llc-review/">exterminators</a> never showed up.
Further, other clients reported that the definitions exterminators sent to their premises were under-trained and thus showed ignorance and negligence leading to property damage.
So it is clear that the salesperson from the company tends to over-promise him by making the client sign the contract documents even when they can&rsquo;t deliver appropriately.
Besides, even the clients that had positive reviews about a company noted that one has to be overly specific on the <a href="/posts/american-pest-review/">pest</a> control tasks to be accomplished under the procedure.
Unlike
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pest-control-near-me/">other exterminators near you</a>
, Armor Pest Defense shrinks the money-back guarantee with the annual plan in the fine print with exceptions and exclusions.</li>
<li>So overall my view is that Armor pest defense has very many negative reviews.
However, the company&rsquo;s annual pest prevention contract may be suitable for households that have ongoing bugs problems including mice ants, and spiders.</li>
<li>But as noted above you need to be overly specific with your requirements and direct exterminators on what must be done.</li>
<li>Also, be sure to carefully read the pest control contract prior to the official signing.
Upsides</li>
<li>Includes reliable cleaning services</li>
<li>Offers a suitable annual contract</li>
<li>Uses pesticides and insecticides that are non-toxic
Downsides</li>
<li>Many negative reviews</li>
<li>Performance and quality are unreliable</li>
<li>Overaggressive marketing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pests-controlled-by-armored-pest-svc">Pests Controlled by Armored Pest SVC</h2>
<p>The pests covered in the annual bug control by armor pest defense include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cockroaches</li>
<li>Crickets</li>
<li>Spiders</li>
<li>Rats</li>
<li>Mice</li>
<li>Ants
A positive Ant Inspection that was done by Armor Pest Defense</li>
<li>Richard from Armored Pest Services was extremely meticulous, and he took the time to explain every detail of his inspection. I would definitely recommend them for a thorough and enlightening Ant inspection.
My aunt refinanced her house using a loan and a requirement for us to undertake an inspection to determine the level of wood destruction.</li>
<li>Armor Pest Defense undertook the anticipation in a professional and satisfactory way producing the required report that satisfies the lender and my aunt (the homeowner).
Another client with a positive review reported that Armor Pest Defense was excellent in exterminating mice and cockroaches at a great price.
The customer noted that the company would send timely postcards with the dates of the next pest control visit.</li>
<li>Also, the exterminator is ready to adjust the date if it is not appropriate or convenient for the homeowner.
The pest control technicians that were dispatched to my home were professional and they discharged quality services.</li>
<li>The technicians are also effective and prompt - such that they will respond to client calls largely within minutes.
Homeowners love the annual bug control contacts that cover a number of their properties.

Terminix Review</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Armored Pest Services comes among the top 10 best exterminators around but also has its own shortcomings.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the company will help you exterminate various pests that are in a household including ants, flies, fleas, and bed bugs.

<h2 id="flying-ants-vs-termites---in-depth-pest-control">Flying Ants vs. Termites - In-Depth Pest Control</h2>
<p>To effectively eradicate flying ants and termites, its essential to know which of the insects youre dealing with. In this guide, youll get to know the differences between the two insects.</p>
<h3 id="1-appearance">1. Appearance</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Flying ants and termites appear to look alike from an outward perspective. But a closer look will portray some notable differences in their physical appearance.</dt>
<dt>A microscope or a magnifying glass can be used to give a better view. Three of the most important</dt>
<dt><a href="https://u.osu.edu/biomuseum/2017/01/30/mites-as-parasitoids-of-invasive-ants/">distinguishing features include</a></dt>
<dt>:</dt>
<dt><strong>Body</strong></dt>
<dt><strong>Flying ants</strong></dt>
<dd>Flying ants have a broad body with a thin waist. Thus, you can differentiate between the abdomen and thorax. The color of the body ranges from reddish-brown, brown to black.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites have a straight body and a broad waist. That means you cant distinguish between the abdomen and thorax. Their body can either be dark brown or black.
<strong>Wings</strong>
<strong>Flying ants:</strong>
They have two pairs of
wings
one in front and the other at the back. Notably, the front wings are longer than the back wings.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites also have two pairs of wings. However, both pairs of wings are of equal length.
<strong>Antennae</strong>
<strong>Flying ants:</strong>
Flying ants have elbowed antennae.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites have straight antennae.

<h3 id="2-behavior">2. Behavior</h3>
<p><strong>Flying ants:</strong>
Flying ants live amongst other members of a colony and play the role of finding and creating new colonies. They are often known as swarmers because of their ability to fly, unlike other colony members.
They swarm during the summer to create new colonies. Once a new colony is set up, flying ants will pluck off their wings since they arent needed anymore. They usually leave their wings on windowsills. After mating, male ants will die, leaving the females to lay eggs and increase the colony.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites also live in colonies consisting of reproductive termites, workers, and soldiers. Mating occurs during spring. However, unlike ants, male termites do not die after mating. Both the males and females lose their wings and continue expanding the new colony.
The discarded wings can be seen scattered on surfaces, especially the floor.</p>
<h3 id="3-diet">3. Diet</h3>
<p><strong>Flying Ants:</strong>
Flying ants are omnivorous insects, and their diet mainly consists of food debris and nectar. They also feed on other small insects. The worker ants do the work of bringing food for the rest of the colony.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
A termites diet mainly consists of cellulose, obtained from wood and dead plants. Food is brought to the colony by the worker termites. Thus, these are some of the insects that do a lot of damage to your property.

<h3 id="4-life-cycle">4. Life Cycle</h3>
<p><strong>Flying ants:</strong>
Ants undergo a complete metamorphosis. The queen <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-federal-way/">ant</a> lays
eggs that undergo the larvae
, pupae, and adult stage. The queen lives for many years, while the workers and soldiers die after a few months.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites undergo the egg, larvae or nymph, and adult lifecycle. The queen and reproductive females can live up to 25 years. However, the soldiers and workers live for 10 to 14 months.</p>
<h3 id="5-habitat">5. Habitat</h3>
<p><strong>Flying ant killer:</strong>
Flying ants are outdoor insects usually thriving in warm and wet conditions. Youre likely to see them flying around your garden and near sources of light, such as near the door and window. They only come indoors in search of food, such as food debris.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites usually venture in indoor spaces, especially in hidden cavities in the house foundations and wooden materials, among other places. So if you see damages on your wooden materials, this could be the
work of termites
.</p>
<h3 id="5-threatdamage">5. Threat/Damage</h3>
<p><strong>Flying ants:</strong>
Since their diet mainly entails food debris and nectar, flying ants will not damage your plants, flowers, or wooden surfaces. Their only problem is that they mess your home with their wings and dead bodies. Plus, some species can sting when provoked.
<strong>Termites:</strong>
Termites pose the biggest threat to your property, especially wooden materials. They dig holes into wooden materials as they extract cellulose for their food.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-flying-ants"><strong>How to Get Rid of Flying Ants</strong></h2>
<p>Although flying ants do not destroy your property, theyre often very annoying and scary to have around your home. They not only come into the house but also make your home very untidy.
Luckily, you can effectively eradicate flying ants using both commercial and do-it-yourself
home remedies, even for fleas
.� Below is a brief outline of some practical methods for eliminating and preventing flying ants.</p>
<h3 id="1-house-tidiness">1. House Tidiness</h3>
<p>Cleaning your house and getting
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">rid of food debris deprives flying ants</a>
of something to eat. Ensure that all leftovers are thrown away and all food is kept in closed containers.</p>
<h3 id="2-use-insecticides">2. Use Insecticides</h3>
<p>Commercial insecticides such as aerosols and poison
baits can be used to kill
flying ants. In aerosols, get a product that kills ants instantly and continues to kill ants that come into contact with the treated surfaces.
Use slow-acting poison baits so that ants can take back the poison to the rest of the colony. This gives you the possibility of eradicating an entire ant colony.</p>
<h3 id="3diatomaceous-earthde">3.Diatomaceous Earth(DE)</h3>
<p>DE can provide an effective remedy for flying ants if used around common sources of food. DE kills works by breaking through the insects exoskeleton and dehydrating it to death.
Sprinkle a thin layer of DE around common entry points and feeding locations. As the insects contact DE, the sharp microscopic granules will pierce through their
hard outer shell
and cause dehydration.</p>
<h3 id="4-homemade-solutions">4. Homemade Solutions</h3>
<p>If you dont want to use chemicals in your home, you can embark on one or more homemade solutions. Make a solution using peppermint
essential oil for bed bugs,
dish soap, and water.
Use a
spray bottle to apply the solution to the flying ants
. This solution works by suffocation and dehydration.�This method works effectively when you spray directly on the insects.</p>
<h3 id="5-bug-zappers">5. Bug zappers</h3>
<p>Bug zappers can be placed inside the house and around the compound. Ants will be attracted to the light and obviously be killed by the electric shock.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-termites"><strong>How to Get Rid of Termites</strong></h2>
<p>Termites are worse than flying ants. When
termites raid your home
, they can create the worst damage you can imagine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their appetite for cellulose results in unimaginable damage to wooden materials, including furniture, roofing frames, attics, ceiling boards, and so on.
Measures for eradicating
termites should entail both prevention and treatment
procedures to avoid damages to your property. Below are some important treatment and
prevention interventions for termites
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-home-maintenance">1. Home Maintenance</h3>
<p>Before using any chemical or homemade products to kill termites, ensure your home is completely unattractive to them. This can be done by clearing any clutter that may allow them to build foraging or mud tubes.
Wood, timber, or paper piles near the houses foundation provide good avenues for termites to build colonies and access your house. Logs, wood, and timber should be kept in designated areas away from house foundations. Plus, stumps in the garden should be uprooted.</p>
<h3 id="2-chemical-treatments">2. Chemical Treatments</h3>
<p>Chemical treatments such as termite sprays will give you the best solution for your termite menace. These include some of the most
effective termite killers
.
They contain powerful active ingredients that kill termites instantly and continue to kill termites that come back to the treated area.</p>
<h3 id="3-termite-baits">3. Termite Baits</h3>
<p>Termite baits
are chunks of food materials that lure termites into eating poison. They are meant to kill slowly to allow the worker termites to take the poisoned bait back to the colony.
Poisoned baits, therefore, provide an
effective way of eradicating a whole termite
colony.</p>
<h3 id="4-nematodes">4. Nematodes</h3>
<p>Deploying beneficial nematodes around a termite colony will effectively get rid of these insects.
Nematodes work by releasing toxic bacteria inside the insects digestive system, thus killing them. Termites are hard to spot whenever they invade our homes.
A single treatment wont be
useful since termites
create new colonies in a short time. Therefore, it is essential to have a scheduled termite inspection routine to detect and dismantle any termite development - through
fumigation
.</p>
<h3 id="5diatomaceous-earth">5.Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>DE contains microscopic particles that can break through a termites body. The desiccating effect from DE kills the insect through dehydration - this is one of the
natural termite control methods
.
Spread a thin layer of a food-grade DE on areas most frequented by termites, such as house foundation, woodpiles, and other wooden materials.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Both flying ants and termites are quite unwelcome in our houses. Flying ants will mess your home without causing any significant damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, termites are dreadful because of their ability to destroy wooden materials.</li>
<li>If youre unsure which type of pest youre dealing with, its important to make proper identification to avoid using the wrong pest eradication method.
With this guide, it will be relatively easy to differentiate a flying ant from a termite.</li>
