<p>For cockroaches, such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/">German Roaches</a>
, to survive, they must have a consistent supply of food and water. Therefore, the key to getting rid of them is cutting off any food and water source in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by cleaning food crumbs, washing dishes before retiring to bed, putting food away after meals, and cleaning up spills. Also, avoid leaving uncovered food for extended periods and keep all food containers sealed.</li>
<li>Cockroaches love hiding in the fridge and munching on food crumbs back there. Clean the refrigerator as well, and always keep it locked. While at it, dont forget to wipe the range tops as cockroaches are attracted to grease as well.</li>
<li>Take out the trash regularly while ensuring the garbage bins are well sealed.</li>
<li>Any water leaks must also be fixed. Cockroaches can live for a month without food but no more than one week without water.
Roaches also prefer dark and damp where they hide and breed. These include under the sink, behind refrigerators, underfloor drains, in cracks/crevices, inside significant appliances, and others.
Target these areas when doing a thorough cockroach clean up. Also, seal cracks and crevices on the walls with caulk. All openings around the pipes in the kitchen and bathroom must also be filled. This will prevent the
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/faq/roach.html">roaches from entering your home</a>
.

<p>The triple-action of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-bait/">cockroach baits</a>
, sprays, and Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) will kill and prevent cockroaches from reproducing.
As the name suggests, cockroach baits help draw these pests out of
their hiding places
. The baits contain a high-consumption bait matrix with killer ingredients like fipronil and hydramethylnon.
Upon consuming the bait, the ingredients disrupt their nervous system, leading to their ultimate death in a matter of minutes. You may also consider
top roach bombs
.
Pesticide sprays contain active ingredients like Pyrethrin, which produce a knockdown effect on bugs like cockroaches - killing roaches even back in the
roach nest
. Basically, the sprays interfere with the bugs nervous system, which results in major paralysis and speedy death.
How to Use Baits, Sprays, and IGRs for Cockroaches</p>
<ul>
<li>If using the combination, spray a small amount in targeted areas like cracks, crevices, behind and beneath the sinks, behind and under refrigerators aroundpipes and drains, etc.</li>
<li>Ensure the spray penetrates well to ensure the pests are quickly eliminated
IGRs, on the other hand, cause sterility in adult roaches, making reproduction impossible.�When used together, the three treatment methods can quickly eliminate any roaches lurking in your home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boric acid
is one of the best natural remedies for eliminating roaches. When ingested,
boric acid
kills cockroaches in just a matter of minutes.�Although highly toxic in cockroaches, boric acid is completely
safe for humans and pets
.
The powder is best applied in areas where cockroaches are likely to walk through. Upon contact, the powder sticks on the cockroach and is absorbed into its body. Once inside, the acid destroys its digestive and nervous system, causing death.
The cockroach may also die from ingesting the powder.�Boric acid is a suitable natural
cockroach treatment if pesticide sprays
and baits are not an option.
How to Use Boric Acid for Cockroaches</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean all targeted areas, including cabinets, countertops, sinks, drawers, behind and under the refrigerator, and others</li>
<li>Lightly dust boric acid powder all over these areas. If dealing with a severe infestation, a heavy application may be necessary</li>
<li>Vacuum the remaining powder in the morning</li>

<p>Its not unlikely to find a few roaches in a clean home. As long as there are cracks on the walls and perfect hiding places, youll still deal with a few of them crawling around
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-cockroaches-fly/">since roaches don&rsquo;t fly</a>
.
However, a clean home is more unlikely to experience a severe
roach infestation
than a dirty and cluttered home.

home is key to keeping these bugs
at bay.
How to Get rid of Cockroaches Through Vacuuming/Cleaning</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly vacuum and clean the floor, kitchen countertops, drawers, cabinets, insider appliances, behind and under the refrigerator, ovens, and other areas.</li>
<li>Declutter your kitchen, sitting area, laundry room, closets, cupboards, drawers, and any other potential hiding place.</li>

<dt>We have discovered that German roaches thrive best where there are favorable conditions like good humidity, food, shelter, and water.</dt>
<dt>Unfortunately, your house offers all these favorable conditions.</dt>
<dt>To get rid of the German roaches in your house, keep all kitchen and bathroom surfaces and sinks clean and dry. Wash all your cabinets and appliances regularly. You should also pay close attention to your backyard by removing all unused items or woodpiles.</dt>
<dt>You can also install a dehumidifier in your home. �When your house is less humid, the German cockroaches will find it less attractive to settle in it.</dt>
<dt>Also, ensure you store food in airtight containers. Also, throw away your garbage regularly. Set aside time to do general cleaning in your house; you may mop, sweep, or vacuum regularly.</dt>
<dt><strong>Remember To</strong></dt>
<dd>(1)
Dry up all surfaces (1)
Keep the roaches hungry-put foods in tight containers and eliminate leftovers (1)
Do not offer them any shelter- seal all cracks and small holes in your house.
Besides cleaning, you can also seal all cracks and small holes in your home to block all pathways the bugs might be using to access your home.
If these measures are followed correctly, your house will be roach free. However, if the German cockroaches still find their way into your house, then its time to take more drastic measures to eliminate these annoying creatures!!
<strong>What are German cockroaches?�</strong>
The German cockroach has a unique ability of high reproduction compared to other cockroach species. The female German
cockroaches produce many eggs
per capsule; thus, they undergo a short time from hatching to sexual maturity, leading to quick population growth.
If not stopped in time, they can be difficult to control. These roaches are pretty smaller than other roaches species and can easily hide in numerous places inaccessible by humans. You can easily recognize this roach species as they are small in size (roughly  an inch) and contain two dark stripes on their back.
Like most cockroaches, German roaches prefer to settle in warm and dark places. Unfortunately, your home offers these favorable conditions, and they can easily create their habitat in your house. The availability
of food, water, and harborage increases the German roach&rsquo;s ability to develop populations and reduce growth quickly.
This disgusting creature loves to settle in an environment that is moist, warm, and dark. Hence, they are mostly found in bathrooms and kitchens where water and food leftovers are readily available. German roaches are scavengers that consume sweet foods, meat, grease, and garbage.
To eradicate these tiny creatures from your home, you should always keep kitchen surfaces clean,
use�drain cleaners
to keep all drainage and pipes clean, and repair leaking pipes. You can also fix all cracks and small holes where they are likely to hide.</dd>

is a natural and effective home remedy to kill German roaches. Sugar acts as an important bait for a German cockroach as it likes sweet products. On�the other hand, the baking soda acts as a poison that destroys the roaches digestive system.
Baking soda
works by creating huge amounts of gas, causing the stomach of roaches to burst, hence die instantly.
When using this mixture, ensure the cockroaches have access to little water. Water reacts with baking soda to give a bad solution that acts on
roaches to kill
them completely.
How Do You Prepare Sugar And Baking Soda Mixture To Kill Roaches?</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix equal amounts of sugar and baking soda in the shallow dish</li>
<li>Place another small dish container of water in a suitable location</li>
<li>Sprinkle the mixture containing sugar and baking soda in various locations infested with the roaches</li>
<li>Ensure you refill the water and sprinkle more mixture from time to time to kill all the roaches completely</li>
<li>Be patient and watch the roaches
When using sugar and baking soda bait, youll need to be patient as the process might take a lot of time before achieving the desired results. This mixture may not

<li>To make the boric acid even more useful, mix it with sugar and flour</li>
<li>Place a fine layer of the boric acid mixture near cracks or openings where roaches are dwelling or feeding</li>
<li>Replace the powder after every five days until you eliminate all roaches.</li>
<li>Ensure you put the boric acid in high places like on top of cabinets or rooftops if possible. Cockroaches prefer high places; therefore, placing boric acid at higher paces wont waste time.</li>
