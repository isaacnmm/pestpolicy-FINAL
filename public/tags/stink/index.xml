<h2 id="comparison-stink-bugs-vs-bed-bugs">Comparison: Stink Bugs Vs. Bed Bugs</h2>
<h3 id="1-feeding-mechanism">1. Feeding mechanism</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are blood-sucking in nature. Bed bugs feed on blood that makes them look round from their initial flat shape.
On the other hand, stink bugs like to feed on fruits, vegetables, and other insects. Stink bugs are often found in vegetable gardens and fruit trees. When found in a garden, stink
bugs can destroy a lot of items
and materials.</p>
<h3 id="2-appearance">2. Appearance</h3>
<p>Bed bugs are flat and round
in shape. The shield shape of stink
bugs makes them different
from their counterpart bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="3-wings---do-they-fly">3. Wings - Do they fly</h3>
<p>Stink bugs have well-designed wings that
<a href="https://www.terminix.com/pest-control/stink-bugs/behavior/do-stink-bugs-fly/">help them to fly</a>
. For
bed bugs, you will find no wings
in their makeup.
Bed bugs do not fly
because they have�dysfunctional wing pads - and not wings great for flying.</p>
<h3 id="4-color">4. Color</h3>
<p>Without any scintilla of doubt, stink bugs come in a gamut of colors. These bugs can either be green, red, purple, brown, and black. However, the easiest way to
notice a bed bug
is its reddish-brown or yellow color. But before they suck blood (this is particularly true for
baby bed bugs
), bed bugs will appear white or yellow and have a flat oval shape.</p>
<h3 id="5-body-odor">5. Body Odor</h3>
<p>Bed bugs may not
unleash any specific smell
when touched. Stink bugs are going to leave a foul odor on your hands when touched. One primary reason for calling these bugs to stink is that they often unleash a foul smell or odor when smashed.
When stink bugs touch anything, they often leave behind a distinctive lousy odor. These
bugs can fly because
they have well-crafted wings. It is essential to know that stink
bugs will also bite
or hurt you when disturbed in any way.</p>
<h3 id="6-living-environment">6. Living Environment</h3>
<p>Stink bugs like light and can be found in places like vegetable gardens and fruit trees. The different colors of these bugs make them adapt and remain comfortable in any environment. Bed bugs
like dark environments
. Since they suck, blood human beings are their final host.
In a living apartment, stink
bugs like hiding
beneath sidings and other hard-to-reach areas. When winter is over, you can
see these bugs
matching out in their multitude from your house. Due to their nature of loving clear lights, you can find stink bugs around your windows and doors.</p>
<h3 id="7-body-size">7. Body Size</h3>
<p>The adult of both bugs maintains around a one-quarter inch long. The babies of a beg bug can be smaller than their counterpart stink bugs.</p>
<h3 id="8-bite-differences">8. Bite differences</h3>
<p>When stink
bugs bite
, there is every possibility to experience an allergic reaction. Besides, the
bite from�stink bugs
can be painful at the same time. One fantastic feature of a stink bug is that it appears in a plethora of colors.
This feature makes it possible for stink bugs to blend and adapt to any environment they find themselves.
Bed bugs will leave red welts
that itch on your skin when they suck and bite.
Also, check this comparison between
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-ants/">Bed Bugs vs. Ants</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The bottom line is that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-do-bed-bugs-spread/">bed bugs are blood-sucking</a>
in nature and can spread fast like a wildfire. Stink bugs can be irritating, annoying, infuriating, and can make people uncomfortable.
Remember that both bugs can be dangerous to human health and being. Controlling these bugs at the early stage is the only way to prevent infestation.</p>
