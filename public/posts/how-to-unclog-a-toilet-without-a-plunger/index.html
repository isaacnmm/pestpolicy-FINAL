<h2 id="method-1-mixing-baking-soda-and-vinegar"><strong>Method 1: Mixing baking soda and vinegar�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#method-1-mixing-baking-soda-and-vinegar">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Requirements:�Baking soda, Vinegar, Small bucket, and Hot water  (not boiling water)</em>
This method is used for soft blockages.
Baking soda and vinegar/)
are used in many household activities. They are mostly used as cleaning chemicals.
You can find them at your local shops. When combined, they have a fizzing effect. That effect can be used in unblocking soft blockages.
<strong>Step 1 - Sprinkle baking soda directly into the toilet bowl.</strong>
Pour at least one cup and ensure that it is well spread in the toilet. Using more than one cup does not affect.
<strong>Step 2 - Slowly and gently pour one cup of vinegar into the toilet bowl.</strong>
Pouring the vinegar should have a fizzing effect. This is caused by the chemical reaction of the baking soda and vinegar. Pouring the vinegar quickly causes increased fizzing, which may mess up the place.
<strong>Step 3 - Allow the ingredients to stay for about 25 minutes.</strong>
This is done to allow the ingredients to work and react well. It also buys time to let the level of water to drop in the bowl.
Alternatively, you can allow the mixture to stay for longer, say 2 hours or even overnight. Allowing more time is essential in ensuring the reaction is an effective one.
<strong>Step 4 - Take the hot water and pour it into the toilet bowl.</strong>
Boiling water is not recommended because you do not want to crack your toilet. Boiling
water may also damage pipes down the drain
. After the 25 minutes have elapsed, pour the hot water. This hot water will wash down the baking soda, vinegar, and any soft blockages.
<strong>Step 5 - Test Flush</strong>
Flush water to ascertain that the blockage is cleared. If the water does not flush, you may consider repeating the process. You can try an alternative method. However, if the problem persists, you can contact your plumber for further assistance.

<h2 id="method-2using-dish-soap-and-hot-water">**Method 2:�**<strong>Using Dish soap and hot water�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#method-2using-dish-soap-and-hot-water">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Requirements:�Dish soap, Bucket, Hot water.�</em>
Another way of unclogging is by using dish soap and hot water. Remember not to use boiling water so that you cannot spoil the toilet bowl and pipes.
Dish
soap is used for many purposes, including washing
utensils (as it is called), shining jewelry, and surfaces. Other uses are unclogging a toilet, yes you read that right!
For your toilets soft blockages, this is the method that you should try since dish soap and hot water are easily available. Dish soap can be easily accessed from your nearest shop. It is found in different flavors, sizes, and brands.
Since dish soap is heavier than water, it sinks to the bottom of the bowl lubricates whatever is clogging the toilet. And after pouring water, it pushes the clog down.
<strong>Step 1 - Pour about half a cup of dish soap into the toilet bowl.</strong>
After pouring the dish soap into the bowl, it will sink because of its dense nature. Wait for about 25 minutes before making the next move. Dish soap is preferred to shampoos or bar soaps since they contain fats that could clog the toilet.
Remember to put a good amount of dish soap enough to unclog the toilet. The 25 minutes are for buying time to let the water level drop and let the dish soap act effectively.
<em>How does the dish soap work?�</em>
Dish soap lubricates whatever is causing the clog. It then pushes the material down the drain once the hot water is poured.
<strong>Step 2 - Pour the hot water into the bowl.</strong>
Pour the hot water directly into the bowl. You are advised not to use boiling water not to spoil the ceramic of the toilet bowl. Pouring boiling water leads to the sudden expansion of the ceramic hence cracking.
<strong>Step 3 - Test Flush</strong>
Flush your toilet to ascertain that the clog is cleared
If the operation was successful, the water should drain with ease. If the water does not drain, it means the operation was not successful. You can repeat the process. If the water still does not drain, you can try out other methods discussed here or call a plumber for further help.</p>
<h2 id="method-3breaking-up-the-clog-with-a-hanger">**Method 3:�**<strong>Breaking up the clog with a hanger�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#method-3breaking-up-the-clog-with-a-hanger">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Requirements:�Coat hanger, Pliers, Piece of rag/clothing, Duct tape, Gloves, Trash bin.�</em>
This is an
eco-friendly way of removing clogs
since no chemicals are involved. The use of chemicals poses a great risk to your drains and ceramic.
When you use chemicals, they are washed to the sewers to harm any form of life. Almost every house has hangers for hanging clothes. They come in handy when a plunger is missing, and your toilet needs some unclogging.
<strong>Step 1 - Undo the twisted part of the hanger.</strong>
Using the pliers unwinds the hanger apart from the hook. The hook is the part that actually hangs on the wall.
After you have unwounded it, straighten it, so you have a straight wire with a hooker on the other end. The hooked part will act as the handle.
<strong>Step 2 - Wrap the end of the wire with a rag.</strong>
The rag is tied on the end that does not have a hook. Use the duct tape to prevent the rag from falling off. Alternatively, you can tie a knot. It will still serve the same purpose. This prevents the damaging of the bowl by the sharp end.
<strong>Step 3 - Stick the wire directly into the toilet bowl.</strong>
Move the hanger in all directions to push the clog away or break it down. Ensure that you have gloves on to protect your hands from the dirty water in the bowl.
Hold it firmly as you push, twist, poke in attempts to break the clogs. These repeated movements will disintegrate the clog, and the water level will start dropping.
Once you are sure the blockage has been broken down, retrieve the wire hanger and put it in a safe place. You should place the retrieved clogging materials in the trash bin for disposal.
<strong>Step 4 - Test Flush</strong>
Once you remove your hanger, you can flush the toilet to ascertain that the clog is cleared. If the method was effective, the water should flush and drain quickly.
If not, you can repeat the process, and if the problem persists, you can try out any other method as described here before calling a plumber.</p>
<h2 id="method-4-"><strong>Method 4: **** Use a drain snake to breaking up the clog�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#method-4-">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Requirements:�Drain snake, Gloves, and Trash bin.�</em>
A
drain snake�(flexible
cleaning tool or an auger) will be an excellent solution to break up the hard drain clogs. It&rsquo;s an eco-friendly method since no chemicals are used.�A drain snake consists of a long wire screw that has a corkscrew on its tip.
The wire is flexible that you can easily move down the toilet to clear the clogs. It can maneuver the curves and go deep to as far as the length allows. However, you must select the
right type of drain snake
for the job.
The most suitable one is the closet auger, as it&rsquo;s uniquely designed for use in unclogging toilets. It is widely used because it does not damage the bowl&rsquo;s ceramic/porcelain and is also effective.
<strong>Step 1 - Assemble the required tools and materials required.</strong>
You will require hand gloves which will protect your hands:</p>
<ul>
<li>When turning the handle of the drain snake hence protecting you from injury.</li>
<li>From the dirty water that may be jumping up and down
<strong>Step 2 - Put one end of the snake into the drain.</strong>
Place it into the drain and push it down the drain. It would help if you pushed it until you experience some resistance. You can remove the wire and return it to make sure you had not hit an end.
Once the resistance you experience is spongy, know that you have reached the point of clogging, move the wire in a clockwise direction to push it down the pipes.
<strong>Step 3 - Move the handle in a counter-clockwise manner.</strong>
Once the auger is in position and the clog has been felt, turn the handle anticlockwise. The curved hook of the
drain snake will break the clogs in the pipes
. This helps in holding what has been caught and bringing it up to the surface.
You are always advised to try bringing what has been trapped up against the surface. Pushing the clogs down may cause blockages at other advanced parts of the pipes. Once you retrieve the snake, dispose of the caught materials in the bin. Remember to wash and sanitize the snake every time you use it.
<strong>Step 4 - Test Flush</strong>
To ascertain that the operation was successful, you should flush the toilet. If successful, the water will drain quickly. If not, you can repeat again and again until the clog clears. Else if, you can try other methods of unclogging a toilet before calling a plumber.</li>

<p><strong>1. Using a chemical drain drainer�</strong>
You are advised to avoid them at all costs and only use them as a last resort. They pose great harm to people, pets. They are also very corrosive to pipes.
Ensure that there is free circulation of air in your toilet when using them. Their fumes are usually very poisonous. Apply them according to the accorded instructions. Ensure that you have protective gear for your protection.
<strong>2. By use of a wet/dry vacuum�</strong>
Ensure that the bowl has no water. Put the end of the vacuum
cleaner in the drain
. Place it a few inches into the drain.
You can use a rag as a seal around the drain. Turn the vacuum cleaner machine on, and the chances are that the vacuum cleaner will suck out the clog.
<strong>�How to</strong>
<strong>Prevention of clogs�</strong>
A clogged toilet is not only embarrassing but also stressful. It causes inconveniences for a lot of people. Here are some tips on how to avoid future clogs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only flush human waste and tissue paper- Pipes used in the toilets are specifically designed to<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-toilet-paper-for-septic/">flush human waste and tissue paper</a>. Any other materials will cause clogging. Dispose of such wastes in a trash bin and not the toilet.</li>
<li>Any other materials you dispose of in the toilet should be water-soluble. Other materials such as sanitary towels, toothbrushes, and others should be disposed of in a trash bin.</li>
<li>Use the necessary amount of toilet paper- Stuffing of a lot of tissue paper, and trying to flush it causes clogging. Only use the amount you require.</li>
<li>Ensure your toilet is always clean- Using toilet washing chemicals periodically wash to your toilet will meltdown and wash away any forming clogs.
**Note - **
Always remember to clean any spilled water on the floor. You can even cover the floor around the toilet using towels and tissue paper. In case of any spillages on the floor, wash them using a disinfectant.
Remember always to wear gloves. Any exposure to germs from the toilet can lead to infections and illnesses. Once you are done, ensure you dispose of the used gloves and wash your hands with soap or a hand sanitizer.</li>
