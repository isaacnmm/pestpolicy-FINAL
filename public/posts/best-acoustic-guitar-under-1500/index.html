<p>Ovation Melissa is a beautiful colored acoustic guitar designed with extra tough material to improve its durability.</p>
<p>The product is manufactured with an AA solid spruce top and a mahogany neck that is reinforced with maple to improve its break resistance upon fall.
Actually, Ovation comes with self-hardened strings that are nicely secured by a tough bridge and classic saddle pick-up. In fact, the soundhole is perfectly aligned with uniquely spaced strings to enhance sound capture while the fretboard is fitted with tough frets and impressive color matching.
Moreover, this guitar has a shallow cutaway body that features a lyrachord mid-depth dowl specially designed to allow easier access of lower treble frets when strumming. Further, the guitar comes with a chromatic tuner and a 3-band EQ that enabled smooth sound control (has a mid-shift button).
Indeed, the black body hardware (back and sides) is extra-toughed by a shiny lamination that is waterproof and scratch-resistant. The fine lining is fitted nicely with mother of pearl binding while the pickguard is padded with tough solid reinforcement to improve its lifetime.
The excellent electronic sound resonance and impressive Melissa Etheridge Signature crowns the overall beauty of this musical instrument. Its beautiful color matching will not only impress you but also boost your confidence when playing among similar acoustic guitars.
