But first, what damage have moles caused you? Or have you tried other strategies to eradicate moles but with little results?</p>
<p>Well, these pesky creatures are never useful to anyone.
In this review, I&rsquo;ll show you why mole traps are the best remedies for eradicating moles. Let&rsquo;s get started!�Related:

<h3 id="1-tomcat-mole-trap-hands-free-effective-and-innovative">[1. Tomcat Mole <a href="/posts/best-fly-trap/">Trap</a>: hands-free, effective, and Innovative](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043FHXVM/?tag=p-policy-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043FHXVM/?tag=p-policy-20</a>)</h3>
<p>Tomcat is an out-of-the-ordinary mole trap with notable features that make it one of the most popular brands in the market today.</p>
<p>The most selling attribute inherent in this device is the hands-free setup option. It only requires you to step on the yellow lever to set up the device. Plus, once a mole is caught, you don&rsquo;t have to use your hands to release it.
To set the device, locate an active tunnel and press with your heel or hand to make a depression (about one inch deep). There&rsquo;s a depth gauge on the backside of the trap for checking the correct depth. Using a shovel, make two long slots where the jaws can fit and open up freely.
Place the trap on the slots and step down slowly. Press the trigger post down until the trap locks, then release the pedal. I usually recommend using a stick to press the trigger.
The trap is under tension, and the pedal could hit your hand if he traps don&rsquo;t lock when releasing the pedal.
Your trap is now ready for a catch! You will know that a mole has been trapped when the yellow lever springs up.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hands-free operation</li>
<li>No additional setting tools or tongs are required.</li>
<li>Safe and easy to use</li>
<li>Simple to set</li>
<li>Excellent design</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a plastic construction which could break</li>

<p>Easy set mole trap created with top-notch craftsmanship to give you an easy and reliable mole trapping experience. With this device, you&rsquo;ll no longer have to use chemicals and poison to eradicate moles.</p>
<p>Setting up this trap is very easy. Unlike other traps, this one requires no digging or setting up sharp prongs that could sometimes be dangerous to the user, children, and pets.
To set up the trap, locate an active mole tunnel and insert the closed jaws in the tunnel, with the base of the trap flushing with the ground.
Once you press down on the lever, the trap is now ready for the catch! Usually, moles have an instinct to reopen their tunnels whenever they collapse.
A will mole travels through the tunnel to find a blind end at the collapsed portion of the tunnel. When it pushes through the tunnel, the trigger is released, clamping the pest between the jaws.
What&rsquo;s more, this is a safe, effective, and environmentally friendly way to eradicate moles. It&rsquo;s ideal for use in nurseries, ranches, and organic farms.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective mole trap</li>
<li>Durable galvanized metal</li>
<li>Easy to set: no digging required</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>

<p>It is designed for use along the tunnels used by moles with the trigger pan blocking part of the tunnel. Usually, moles have an instinct to reopen their tunnels whenever they are blocked. When a mole tries to reopen the tunnel, the trigger is pushed, releasing the trap.
Victor Plunger mole trap stands up to be a strong and reliable device for getting rid of moles. Designed with steel and a sensitive mechanism, this trap snaps with a powerful blow killing the mole instantly.
Besides, the device is reasonably easy to use. Once you have identified an active tunnel, push down the grass with your hands or heel. Push down the trap until the spears touch the bottom.
Activate the spring by pulling up the handle spring and holding it in place using the small lever. The flat piece is placed on the ground, just enough to keep the trigger arm.
That way, a slight push by the mole releases the trigger, and the plunger pushes down the metal spears. There is a safety pin to ensure you are safe from accidental triggers.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ready to use the device</li>
<li>Durable</li>

<h2 id="considerations-for-best-mole-traps"><strong>Considerations for Best Mole Traps</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-ease-of-use"><strong>1. Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone buying a mole trap will go for one that is simple to use. A good mole trap is easy to set up and simple to use. It does not require you to assemble parts as you relocate the trap from one tunnel to another.
On the other hand, complicated traps waste a lot of your time because of the settings involved.�Also
, the device should also be easy to clean. Not only does cleaning prolong the device&rsquo;s lifespan, but also because moles tend to avoid dirty traps.</p>
<h3 id="2-efficiency"><strong>2. Efficiency</strong></h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to waste your time and money on a trap that misses the target now and then. Always go for a dependable trap to avoid frustrations. Remember that the effectiveness of certain traps may depend on the type of soil they are used in.
Some traps tend to work effectively on certain types of soil. Therefore it is always advisable to know the type traps used by people around.</p>
<h3 id="3-trapping-method"><strong>3. Trapping method</strong></h3>
<p>Normally, different people will buy mole traps depending on the trapping mechanism. Some gardeners prefer to use exposed traps because these traps are easy to clean with pressurized water. Others opt to buy traps that will hide the mole insight.
While some gardeners prefer traps that kill moles, others wouldn&rsquo;t even come close to a dead mole. If you prefer traps that kill moles, be sure to check your trap regularly to avoid bad smell that comes from overstayed carcasses.
Once you have identified the type of trapping device, read the instructional manuals to help you set up the tools properly. Plus, you can take time to learn the basics of the device.</p>
<h3 id="4-safety"><strong>4. Safety</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the devices I have discussed are spring-loaded and bare sharp clasping jaws/edges. Thus, safety is of great importance when using them to kill moles. A good trap will kill moles without inflicting injuries to you, your kids, guests, and pets.
Most of these traps come with safety pins/clips to protect you from accidental triggers. Learn the mechanism of the traps to know how the safety clips work. Also, beware of the exposed pointed corners of the trap.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Moles are destructive creatures but can be effectively eradicated using the best mole traps in the market. Do not allow these creatures to disturb your peace anymore!
Get yourself one of these mole traps and won&rsquo;t regret it. For me, Wire Tek 1001 EasySet Mole Eliminator Trap turns out to be the most effective.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From an outward look, moles appear not to have eyes! But how do they manage to dig tunnels and destroy our gardens?</p>
<p>Moles will do anything that is done by animals that have eyes. They dig tunnels, move around, look for food, mate and also evade enemies. But do they have eyes?
<strong>Short answer is YES  Moles have eyes which are covered by a fur and a thin membrane. These eyes cant see things but can differentiate light and dark. Their eyes help them in knowing time periods and seasons of the year.�</strong></p>
<p>Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-mole-traps/">Best Mole Traps</a></p>
<h2 id="details-do-moles-have-eyescan-moles-see">**Details: Do Moles Have Eyes?�**Can Moles See?</h2>
<p>Moles have eyes which are permanently covered by skin and fur. However, the fact that they shy away from bright light means that their eyes are capable detecting light.</p>
<p>Even without eyes, moles continue to wreak havoc in our beautiful lawns and gardens. Lets see how they manage to do that!</p>
<p>When you dig out their tunnels, you expose moles to bright light. In response to this, moles will always seal the exposed tunnels to block light rays.</p>
<p>Notably, moles follow a regular routine from morning to evening. That means they know the time of the day. They wake early in the morning, rest at midday and get back to work at dusk before going to bed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVQrtnb8xn8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVQrtnb8xn8</a></p>
<p>Researchers say that such a controlled routine is made possible by their eyes.�Furthermore, their eyes help in knowing the time of the year. Thats why they only come out during spring in search of mates.</p>
<p>A typical research done on Iberian moles shows that although their eyes are completely closed, they possess structures similar to those of diurnal animals. These structures connect factually to the brain and help moles in detecting and avoiding light.</p>
<p>Research on the nature of moles eyes also focuses on the possibility of degeneration due to disuse. Therere assumptions of gradual loss in eyesight for animals living in dark places due to evolution. However, moles eyes have retained their function and do not exhibit any signs of becoming dysfunctional due to evolution.</p>
<h2 id="can-moles-see"><strong>Can Moles See?</strong></h2>
<p>Moles arent completely blind. They have eyes which are covered by a thin skin and fur to shield them from dirt.</p>
<p>Their retinal cells are also fully developed to enable light recognition. They can also see movements and shadows. However, they cant see clearly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dRGvmLGa2I&amp;t=95s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dRGvmLGa2I&amp;t=95s</a></p>
<h2 id="how-do-moles-find-their-way"><strong>How Do Moles Find Their Way?</strong></h2>
<p>Although moles cant see images, they have adapted ways of finding their way inside their tunnels and when they come above the ground.</p>
<p>Perhaps their most important part for navigation is their nose. Their protruding noses possess touch receptors known as Eimer organs.</p>
<p>They find their way by touching the ground with their nose. These touch receptors have the ability to recognize objects and boundaries enabling moles to move in the dark.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-moles-communicate"><strong>How Do Moles Communicate?</strong></h2>
<p>Just like other animals moles are able to communicate especially during mating. How they do this without functional eyes isnt a mystery!</p>
<p>They are highly adapted to vibrations and sound. They can produce and hear high-pitched sounds.</p>
<p>Moles can also use their scents to communicate with mates and identify food. They release powerful scents which can be easily picked their mates. These odors are quite disgusting to humans especially during mating.</p>
<h2 id="do-moles-see-their-prey"><strong>Do Moles See Their Prey?</strong></h2>
<p>Moles dont use their eyes to locate their food. They use their nostrils to locate foods such as earthworms, snails, spiders, centipedes among other small insects.</p>
<p>Research has shown that moles are some of the few mammals that can smell in stereo.�Their nostrils can detect odors independently.</p>
<p>Different signals are sent to the brain, making it possible to discern the direction of the smell. Thus, they have the ability to differentiate food from other things by picking up the intensity of smell.</p>
<h2 id="do-moles-see-predators"><strong>Do Moles See Predators?</strong></h2>
<p>Although moles spend most of their time in their underground tunnels, they come out to look for mates especially during spring.</p>
<p>This makes them vulnerable to predators such as cats, dogs and birds of prey. However, they also have ways of evading predators.�Since they have a poor eyesight, they wont see predators.</p>
<p>However, their stereo sense of smell (both nostrils sniff independently) allows them to detect potential predators and retreat to their tunnels. With one sniff, a mole is able to tell there is a cat around. In fact, pouring soiled cat litter into holes made by moles can repel them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Moles have eyes but they are not used for seeing things. They are however able to differentiate light and dark as portrayed by their tendency to avoid light.</p>
<p>Lack of functional eyes doesnt prevent them from surviving in their environment.�They compensate for the poor eyesight with a powerful sense of touch on their nose.</p>
<p>In addition they have a powerful stereo sense of smell. These two qualities allow them to navigate in their tunnels, locate food, mate and evade predators.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that possums eat cats is largely a misconception. Possums, being opportunistic omnivores and scavengers, primarily feed on fruits, insects, and small animals like rodents.</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not actively hunt cats, and while they might scavenge the remains of a deceased cat, they do not pose a direct threat to living, healthy ones.
Possums are more likely to compete with cats for food than to attack them. This article explores <a href="/posts/do-possums-eat-chickens/">possum</a> behavior, their dietary preferences, and the nature of their interactions with domestic cats, offering reassurance to pet owners and tips to prevent unwanted encounters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possum-diet-what-do-they-eat">Possum Diet: What Do They <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a>?</h2>
<p>Possums are omnivores, which means they eat a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-opossums-eat/">variety of plant and animal matter</a>
. Their diet is highly opportunistic, often dictated by what is easily available in their environment. In the wild, possums typically consume:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fruits and berries</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insects and small invertebrates</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rodents and small birds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Carrion (dead animals)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vegetables and grains</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eggs but not chicken</strong></li>
<li><strong>Small reptiles and amphibians</strong>
In urban areas, possums may forage through garbage cans and eat pet food that is left outside. They are scavengers by nature, which means they are more likely to feed on what they can find rather than actively hunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to understanding their dietary habits is that possums are not hunters in the traditional sense. Instead, they forage and will eat whatever is most accessible and easy to catch or find, including plant material, insects, and small animals.</p>
<h2 id="possums-and-cats-understanding-the-interaction">Possums and Cats: Understanding the Interaction</h2>
<p>The idea that possums eat cats is largely a myth. Cats are much larger than most of the typical prey items that possums eat. In fact, adult cats are far too big and capable of defending themselves, making them an unlikely target for a possums diet.</p>
<p>While possums may be opportunistic eaters, they do not have the predatory skills or desire to hunt down a living, healthy cat.</p>
<dl>
<dt>There are, however, a few scenarios where a possum and a cat might interact:</dt>
<dt><strong>1. Competition for Food</strong></dt>
<dd>If a possum and a cat are both foraging in the same area, such as near an outdoor food dish, they may compete for resources. Possums may try to eat leftover cat food, but this does not indicate predation. The possum is simply scavenging what it can find.
<strong>2. Scavenging Behavior</strong></dd>
<dd>In very rare cases, a possum may be found eating a deceased cat. However, it is important to stress that this does not mean the possum killed the cat. As scavengers, possums will eat carrion, and if they come across a dead animal, including a cat, they may consume it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>This can lead to the misconception that possums hunt cats, but they are merely feeding on an already deceased animal.Possums live an average of 1 to 2 years but<a href="https://opossumsocietyus.org/general-opossum-information/">can do up to 4 years</a>, but don&rsquo;t kill them - mainly when you see their destructive habits.</li>
<li>This can lead to the misconception that possums hunt cats, but they are merely feeding on an already deceased animal.Possums live an average of 1 to 2 years but<a href="https://opossumsocietyus.org/general-opossum-information/">can do up to 4 years</a>, but don&rsquo;t kill them - mainly when you see their destructive habits.
<strong>3. Defensive Reactions</strong>
: If a cat and possum were to get into a confrontation, the possums instinct would not be to attack but to defend itself. Possums often employ a defense mechanism known as &ldquo;playing possum,&rdquo; where they feign death to avoid aggression from predators. In some cases, if a possum feels cornered, it may hiss, growl, or show its sharp teeth to scare off a potential threat, but it would not go on the offensive unless absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-possums-arent-a-threat-to-cats">Why Possums Aren&rsquo;t a Threat to Cats</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why possums dont pose a significant threat to cats:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Size and Strength</strong>: Adult cats are generally larger, faster, and stronger than possums. In a physical altercation, a healthy cat would likely come out on top, or at the very least, would be able to escape without serious injury.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Differences</strong>: Cats are predators by nature and tend to be territorial. On the other hand, possums are scavengers and generally prefer to avoid confrontation with larger animals. When faced with a cat, a possum is more likely to flee or try to scare the cat away rather than attack.</li>
<li><strong>Dietary Preferences</strong>: Possums have no real interest in hunting down and consuming large animals like cats. Their natural diet consists of smaller prey and scavenged food. While they may consume carrion if they find it, this is far different from actively seeking out and killing a cat for food.

</ol>
<h2 id="what-should-pet-owners-do">What Should Pet Owners Do?</h2>
<p>While possums dont pose a direct threat to cats, pet owners may still want to take precautions to minimize interactions between the two animals. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep Pet Food Indoors</strong>: Avoid leaving pet food outside, especially overnight, as it can attract possums and other wildlife.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Garbage Cans</strong>: Since possums are scavengers, they may try to get into unsecured garbage cans. Keeping lids tightly closed will discourage them from foraging in your yard.</li>
<li><strong>Supervise Pets Outdoors</strong>: While possums arent likely to harm your cat, its always a good idea to supervise your pets when theyre outdoors, especially at night when possums are most active.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Attractants</strong>: Possums are drawn to food sources, so removing things like fallen fruit, bird feeders, and compost piles can help prevent them from frequenting your property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the notion that possums eat cats is largely unfounded. While possums are opportunistic feeders and scavengers, their natural diet does not include live, healthy cats.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are more likely to forage for fruits, insects, and small animals or scavenge for dead animals. Interactions between possums and cats are usually driven by competition for food rather than predation.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe some chicken (plus chicks) and their eggs have recently disappeared from their coop. Recently, there have been some native opossums
*(Didelphis Virginiana) and dead chickens *
around - well, these are scavengers.
So, you&rsquo;re wondering really &lsquo;do possums eat chickens?&rsquo; Well, Yes, possums will scavenger and eat chickens (including fully-grown hens) and other easy food sources like chicks and eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The adult <a href="/posts/do-possums-eat-cats/">possum</a> weighs 4 to 15 lb and measures about 21 to 36 inches in length - about the size of your house-cat. They have 50 pointed and sharp teeth with a white mouth (&amp; face) with grey or white fur.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll also notice that they have a hairless tail, black eyes, and pink nose, and pointed faces.
To repel the possums, you may position ammonia-coaked rags near the chikcen coop or spray any of these rodent repellents&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="do-opossums-or-possums-eat-chickens">Do Opossums or Possums <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a> Chickens?</h2>
<p>As noted above, possums and opossums will attack and eat your chickens. So, YES, simply put, possums will eat chickens. Their strong teeth enable them to tear down prey&rsquo;s bones and flesh - including from dead animals and chickens.</p>
<ul>
<li>While uncommon, possumslike raccoons will eat mature hens(about 20 in a night since they are large &amp; intimidating) but may regularly prey on chicken eggs and their young chicks.
The omnivore animals largely eat and prey on small invertebrates - but if they are occupying the backyard gardens, the possums could hunt your chickens and eggs too -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-possums-eat-cats/">but the possums won&rsquo;t eat the cats</a>
or dogs.

</ul>
<h2 id="do-possums-steal-and-eat-chicken-eggs">Do Possums Steal and Eat Chicken Eggs?</h2>
<p>Ye
s, possums that will manage to sneak into the chicken coop will (or come across eggs) will eat the chicken eggs - but they&rsquo;ll also prey on adult chickens.</p>
<ul>
<li>My experience: One night I met a large possum in the chicken coop around the bird&rsquo;s nesting boxes.</li>
<li>We noted that the possum had returned and stolen eggs - we also found some of the eggs busted.
But will the possums eat raw eggs? Yes, they&rsquo;ll feed on raw eggs in addition to other foods like
protein dog kibble,
minced veggies,
calcium vegetables, chicken crockpot, and bones.
Also, what smells do the possum hate? Well, these animals won&rsquo;t love
ammonia - so I would recommend you pour some ammonia into that coffee container.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-stop-possums-from-killing-my-chicken">How to Stop Possums from Killing My Chicken?</h3>
<p><strong>1. Remove chicken or pet food�</strong>
Avoid leaving chicken or pet food lying around overnight. Such idle foods tend to attract the possums.</p>
<p>Put the chicken or pet food in some metallic (and air-tight ) containers - this will prevent the mother possum from nesting around and rearing their babies.</p>
<p>The possums and their younglings will eventually take over your spaces - and this will endanger you5r chicken as the adult possums will think that the food belongs to their babies.
<strong>2. Line the Chicken coop with 10-inch tin�</strong>
Line the chicken coop with some 10-inches tin to bar possums eating up the wood-� they won&rsquo;t attack the chicken easily.</p>
<p>So, lining up the chicken structures with tin inside and outside - this is because the possums won&rsquo;t chew on the tin.
<strong>3. Don&rsquo;t Leave Chicken Eggs overnight</strong>
Next, I caution against leaving the chicken eggs overnight in that coop.</p>
<p>This is because the scent of the egg
will attract predators including raccoon&rsquo;s
, skunks, and possums.
<strong>4. Place Mothballs and Ammonia�</strong>
Next, position some mothballs and ammonia (odour or stink) as these will help remove the possum from its hiding area.</p>
<p>So, pour the ammonia onto some coffee container and place a wick (towel or rag) that&rsquo;ll help disperse the stinking fumes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check locations that look like possum shelters and place the mothballs or ammonia
<strong>5. Pour Wolf or Fox Urine repel possums�</strong>
Skunks, raccoons, and possums won&rsquo;t get near that chicken coop or nearby hiding areas that have wolf or fox urine.</li>
<li>You may also use the fox-urine granules (Shake-Away) by the brand name as they&rsquo;ll repel and scare off the rodents and possums.
Besides, you may use human urine to repel the possums around the
garden or yard. Notably, the fresh urine will be bacteria-free and clean.
<strong>6. Set Possum Traps</strong>
Possum traps will also be a great addition to the feature in reducing chicken death and disappearance. Set up this device on areas you suspect possum frequent.</li>
<li>Some baits suitable for the possum trap includeapples, peanut butter, vegetables, berries, and fruit.
But remove these traps around the morning time to prevent catching other small pets or even your chickens.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcqgdEfsyQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcqgdEfsyQ</a>
<strong>7. Fencing�</strong>
Fencing around that yard or garden will also hinder possums from reaching your chicken.</li>
<li>Definitely, their strong teeth won&rsquo;t tear down that fence - but avoid chicken wires as they&rsquo;re too weak.
Further, don&rsquo;t allow drinkable water around your garden or yard as this will attract possums that may attack your chicken.</li>
<li>The chicken will be very vulnerable during the dark hours - while also the possums will also be active at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, do possums eat chickens? YES, possums will occasionally hunt and seat chickens in the backyard.</p>
<ul>
<li>But they&rsquo;ll more probably eat chicks, Bantams (small breeds), and eggs.</li>
</ul>

      <description>Maybe in your yard, you spotted a mouse or a rat, or its a mole but you can tell the difference. How can you tell if you have moles in your yard?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe in your yard, you spotted a mouse or a rat, or its a <a href="/posts/do-moles-have-eyes/">mole</a> but you can tell the difference. How can you tell if you have moles in <a href="/posts/how-to-clean-your-laptop-keyboard/">your</a> yard?
<strong>Well, here are the signs of moles in the yard; moulding, drying plants and grass, and sighting a mole. You need to deal with them, the moment you spot them before the level of damage can be extensive.</strong>
In this regard, there are a few questions to answer to help you understand what we are dealing with. Check also the
gopher traps
. If you want to know you have moles in your yard, here are some commons things you have to look out for.</p>
<h2 id="common-signs-of-moles-in-your-yard"><strong>Common Signs of Moles in Your Yard</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1moulding">1.<strong>Moulding</strong></h3>
<p>The first and the most visible signs of mole infestation in your yard are moldings. These are heaps of soil comes as a result of moles burrowing up the soil from the underground tunnels.
From the molds, you are likely to find the opening to the tunnel, though its not a 100% guarantee.
Tactically, the moles
and raccoons
do this when looking for food from underground. They can dig these tunnels of up to 8 ft. in an hour leaving several heaps of soil above the ground.</p>
<h3 id="2drying-plants-and-grass">2.<strong>Drying plants and grass</strong></h3>
<p>Another sign is the drying of grass and other plants in your yard.� As the moles burrow underground, they destroy the roots of anything they find on their way.
Most tunnels are shallow and easily reach plant roots. This destroys the grass and other plants along the tunnels leaving them dry and weathered.
With their strong and sharp claws, moles can tear down even the strongest of the plant&rsquo;s root system turning them yellowish and weathered.</p>
<h3 id="3sighting-a-mole">3.<strong>Sighting a mole</strong></h3>
<p>Moles spend a lot of their time in the underground and its a rare occurrence to spot one
They are mostly active in the evening and early morning. At this time, you may chance to spot them. Alternatively, they have a preference for loamy soils especially when the ground is moist.
Also sometimes after a light rainfall, you may spot them coming to get some warmth from the surface. Moles are loners and mostly move alone. Sometimes, most of the damage you see in the yard could be the work of just a single mole.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beAhFAmqfSY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beAhFAmqfSY</a></p>
<h2 id="what-are-moles">What are moles?</h2>
<p>Mole is basically some burrowing animals that are found underground. They feed on underground insects and worms for survival. They vary in sizes between 4-11 inches.
Some people confuse moles with rodents like mice or even rats.
However, you can also identify them by their physical appearances like a thin and a long snout, strong front feet, small eyes with grey to brownish or black fur.
Their eyesight is poorly developed but their snout compensates for that by being oversensitive to touch. If this is what you have spotted in your yard, then you are dealing with moles in your yard.

<h2 id="what-attracts-moles-to-my-yard"><strong>What attracts moles to my yard?</strong></h2>
<p>The reason why moles will burrow into your yard is that they are looking for food. As I said, they feed on earthworms, immature insects, white grubs, beetles, crickets among other insects.
They will dig multiple tunnels as they search these insects.
Another factor though not common is moist and loamy soil. Moles love to inhabit these kinds of soils. They burrow to keep their bodies cool since they spend most of their time underground.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-fastest-way-to-get-rid-of-moles-in-your-yard"><strong>What is the fastest way to get rid of moles in your yard?</strong></h3>
<p>To eliminate moles from your yard, here are quick ways of doing it;</p>
<h3 id="1traps">1.<strong>Traps</strong></h3>
<p>Traps are one of the best and the most
effective way to eliminate moles
and stop further destruction. You can get these traps from local retailers or from animal experts</p>
<h3 id="2baits">2.<strong>Baits</strong></h3>
<p>Baits are used to attract moles into the traps. For the best baits, you can use what moles love best and that is worms, grubs, and crickets. This is a good way to lead them into a trap and capture them.</p>
<h3 id="3removing-the-food-sources-from-your-yard">3.<strong>Removing the food sources from your yard</strong></h3>
<p>By removing what the moles come for in your yard, you actually starve them giving them no opportunity to be in your yard. You can achieve this through lawn maintenance and observing good landscape hygiene.
This can be a preventive measure as well as a way of eradicating them in an already infested yard.</p>
<h3 id="4using-repellents">4.<strong>Using Repellents</strong></h3>
<p>Repellents are a polite way of telling the mole, you are in the wrong place. It makes the environment inhabitable for the moles leaving them no choice but to leave.
You can purchase these repellents from retailers or use a homemade one. If you buy from retailers, you are likely to get them either in granules or liquid form.
Though am not an expert in homemade repellents but I know soap and castor are used to make them. The good thing with these repellents is that they are safe without causing harm to either the human or moles.

<h2 id="how-do-you-naturally-get-rid-of-moles"><strong>How do you naturally get rid of moles?</strong></h2>
<p>In a bid to control moles from getting into your yard, there are several natural remedies for you.</p>
<h3 id="1planting-repellent-plants">1.<strong>Planting repellent plants</strong></h3>
<p>The mole&rsquo;s snout is very sensitive to smell and touch which makes use of repellent plants very effective. You can use plants such as those from the allium family that produce a stringent smell. You can also plant other repellents like marigolds, daffodils, etc.
By planting them along the borderline, will keep off the moles from coming into your yard. If you are unable to get these plants, you can get more information from your local gardener.</p>
<h3 id="2digging-border-trenches">2.<strong>Digging border trenches</strong></h3>
<p>You can do this trench along the border of your garden to keep the moles. For convenience, dig the trench at 2 ft. deep and at least 6 inches wide.
To improve it, you can fill it with stones reinforced with wire mesh to create a strong barrier which moles cannot pass.
Though the process may be tiresome and also consume your time its worth protecting your lawn and beautiful landscape.</p>
<h3 id="3keep-your-lawn-clean">3.<strong>Keep your lawn clean</strong></h3>
<p>Last but not least keeping your lawn clean also serve as a natural way of keeping the moles off from your yard.
Some maintenance practices like mowing the grass, keeping large chunks of mulch, and maintaining a relatively dry yard can be very helpful in keeping off the moles.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rodent <a href="/posts/rodent-control-in-puyallup/">control</a> is crucial for maintaining a healthy and safe home environment, particularly in Tacoma, WA, where common rodents such as house mice, Norway rats, and roof rats are prevalent.</p>
<p>Here are detailed steps and tips for homeowners in Tacoma to effectively manage rodent issues:</p>
<h3 id="identifying-rodents">Identifying Rodents</h3>
<p>Understanding the specific type of rodent you&rsquo;re dealing with is the first step in effective control. House mice are small, usually gray or brown with large ears and eyes.</p>
<p>Norway rats are larger, with a robust body, blunt nose, and a shorter tail relative to their body length. Roof rats are sleek with a pointed nose, large eyes, and a tail longer than their body.
<strong>Signs of Infestation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Droppings:**Rodent droppings are one of the most obvious signs of an infestation. Mouse droppings are small and pointed, while rat droppings are larger and more capsule-shaped.</li>
<li>**Gnaw Marks:**Rodents need to gnaw to keep their teeth sharp. Look for gnaw marks on food packaging, walls, or other materials.</li>
<li>**Nests:**Rodents build nests from shredded paper, fabric, and other soft materials. Nests are usually hidden in secluded areas.</li>
<li>**Sounds:**Scurrying, squeaking, or scratching noises, particularly at night, can indicate rodent activity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prevention-measures">Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>Preventing rodents from entering your home is critical to avoid infestations. Here are some preventive measures:
<strong>Seal Entry Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect your home thoroughly for any gaps, cracks, or holes, especially around the foundation, walls, and roof. Use materials like steel wool, caulk, or metal mesh to seal these entry points.
<strong>Proper Storage:</strong></li>
<li>Store food in airtight containers to prevent rodents from accessing it. This includes pet food and birdseed.</li>
<li>Keep garbage bins sealed tightly to avoid attracting rodents.
<strong>Maintain Cleanliness:</strong></li>
<li>Regularly clean your home, particularly kitchen areas where food crumbs and spills are common. Ensure floors and countertops are free of food debris.</li>
<li>Reduce clutter in your home and yard to eliminate potential nesting sites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eliminating-rodents">Eliminating Rodents</h3>
<p>If you already have a rodent problem, eliminating them quickly and efficiently is essential:
<strong>Traps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use snap traps, glue traps, or live traps strategically around your home where you suspect rodent activity. Snap traps are effective for killing rodents quickly, while live traps can be used to catch and release them humanely.
<strong>Bait Stations:</strong></li>
<li>Bait stations are useful for controlling larger rodent populations. These<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-rat-poison/">stations</a>contain rodenticides and should be placed in areas inaccessible to children and pets.
<strong>Natural Deterrents:</strong></li>
<li>Substances like peppermint oil used cat litter, or ultrasonic repellents can help deter rodents. However, these methods may not be as effective as traps and bait stations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="professional-pest-control-services">Professional Pest Control Services</h3>
<p>For severe infestations or if you prefer professional assistance, hiring a pest control service is a reliable option:
<strong>Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Professional services start with a thorough assessment of your property to identify the extent of the infestation and potential entry points.
<strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM):</strong></li>
<li>IPM combines multiple methods for long-term control, including habitat modification, exclusion, and chemical treatments. This approach minimizes the use of harmful chemicals and focuses on sustainable solutions.
<strong>Regular Monitoring:</strong></li>
<li>Professionals can set up regular monitoring to ensure the rodents do not return. This may include periodic inspections and maintenance of exclusion measures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health-and-safety">Health and Safety</h3>
<p>Rodents can pose significant health risks, so taking proper precautions is crucial:
<strong>Hantavirus Precaution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious when cleaning areas with rodent droppings to avoid hantavirus, which can be fatal. Use gloves and a mask, and disinfect areas thoroughly with a bleach solution.
<strong>Sanitization:</strong></li>
<li>After dealing with rodents, sanitize all affected areas to prevent the spread of diseases. This includes wiping down surfaces, washing bedding and fabrics, and vacuuming with a HEPA filter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="local-pest-control-companies-in-tacoma">Local Pest Control Companies in Tacoma</h3>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring marks a period of increased <a href="/posts/healthy-pets-rodent-control/">rodent</a> activity due to warmer weather and the availability of food and shelter. This season, rodents become more visible and active, which can lead to infestations if preventive measures are not taken.</p>
<h2 id="increased-activity">Increased Activity</h2>
<p>During spring, many rodent species enter their prime breeding season, resulting in a population surge. The abundance of food sources such as plants and insects supports this growth.</p>
<p>Rodents, including mice, rats, and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-yard/">squirrels</a>
, become more active as they search for food and suitable nesting sites.</p>
<h2 id="common-rodents">Common Rodents</h2>
<p>House mice and deer mice are frequently encountered during the spring. These small rodents seek food and shelter in homes, garages, and sheds. Norway rats and roof rats are also common.</p>
<p>Norway rats tend to burrow into the ground, while roof rats prefer to nest in higher locations such as attics and trees. Ground and tree squirrels are more visible as they forage for food and sometimes nest in attics or chimneys.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-infestation">Signs of Infestation</h2>
<p>Identifying a rodent infestation involves looking for specific signs. Droppings are a primary indicator, often found in cabinets,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-pantry-bugs/">pantries</a>
, or along baseboards.</p>
<p>Gnaw marks on wood, wires, or food packaging are also common. Rodents create nests from shredded paper, fabric, or plant material, usually in hidden areas. Additionally, you might hear scratching or scurrying noises in walls, ceilings, or attics, especially at night.</p>
<h2 id="entry-points">Entry Points</h2>
<p>Rodents can enter your home through surprisingly small openings. Common entry points include gaps in walls, doors, windows, and foundations.</p>
<p>Unscreened vents and chimneys offer easy access, as do gaps around pipes and utility lines. Even doors and windows that are not properly sealed can provide entry points for these pests. It&rsquo;s crucial to inspect and seal these potential entry points to prevent rodents from entering your home.</p>
<h2 id="prevention-tips">Prevention Tips</h2>
<p>To prevent rodent infestations, its important to take several proactive measures. Seal all potential entry points using materials like caulk or steel wool to close gaps and holes.</p>
<p>Maintaining cleanliness is essential; keep kitchens and storage areas free of food debris and crumbs. Store food in sealed containers, and ensure pet food is also secured.</p>
<p>Regular yard maintenance can help; trim bushes and trees, keep grass short, and remove any debris that could serve as a hiding spot for rodents. Additionally, use lidded garbage cans and remove trash regularly to deter rodents from foraging near your home.</p>
<h2 id="disease-transmission">Disease Transmission</h2>
<p>Rodents pose significant health risks due to their potential to transmit diseases. Direct contact with rodents or their droppings and urine can spread diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contaminated food and surfaces are another common transmission route, as rodents can leave behind bacteria. Inhaling dust that is contaminated with rodent droppings or urine can also spread diseases.
Some common diseases transmitted by rodents include Hantavirus, Salmonella, Leptospirosis, and Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-infestations">Dealing with Infestations</h2>
<p>If you discover a rodent infestation, there are several methods to address it. Traps are a widely used solution; snap traps, live traps, and glue boards can be effective when placed along walls and in areas with evident rodent activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baits and poisons can also be used, but they must be handled with caution, especially in homes with children or pets. It is crucial to follow all safety instructions when using these products.
For large or persistent infestations, hiring a professional pest control service is advisable to ensure thorough and
effective eradication
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="health-risks">Health Risks</h2>
<p>Rodents are carriers of diseases that can pose serious health risks to humans.</p>
<p>Beyond the diseases they carry, rodent droppings and urine can also trigger allergies and asthma, particularly in sensitive individuals. Managing and preventing rodent infestations is essential to protect the health of your household.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-considerations">Environmental Considerations</h2>
<p>In addition to direct control methods, encouraging natural predators can help manage rodent populations. Birds of prey like owls and natural predators such as snakes can be beneficial.</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing habitats for these predators can help keep rodent numbers in check. Eco-friendly options, such as humane traps and organic repellents, should also be considered as part of an integrated pest management strategy.
Understanding these aspects of rodent behavior in the spring can help you effectively manage and prevent infestations, ensuring a safer and cleaner environment in your home and garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking proactive measures, you can minimize the risks associated with rodent activity and maintain a rodent-free living space.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opossums are omnivores, meaning that they <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> both plants and animals - like humans. But really, what do opossums eat? Opossums need a balanced diet of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to maintain good health.
<em>A natural diet for an opossum would be lots of insects (insects are high in protein), small mammals (high in fat), and the occasional fruit or nut (high in carbs). They need a very high calcium diet (which can be found in plant products).�</em>
<em>In captivity, opossums/ possums eat different foods including vegetables and dog food. But in summary, their diet can be leafy greens (like kale &amp; spinach), grains (like oats &amp; rice), and fruits (like oranges &amp; apples).�</em>

<h2 id="possum-diet-what-do-opossums-eat">Possum diet; What Do Opossums Eat?</h2>
<p>Virginia possum is the most common possum (among the over 60 possum species) as it&rsquo;s a wild scavenger. The opossums will eat during the night and dawn hours - they are nocturnal animals.</p>
<h3 id="1-opossums-eating-mice-roach-and-ants-">**1. Opossums Eating Mice, Roach, and Ants **</h3>
<p>Opossums can be beneficial as they&rsquo;ll feed on those annoying rodents and pests - including mice,
moles
, roach, and ants. The possum menu varies because they&rsquo;ll feed on different parasites!
The opossum is a scavenger - so they&rsquo;ll eat insects (e.g., bees), small reptiles (e.g., snakes) as well as plant material like fruits or leaves from trees. They also will consume bird&rsquo;s eggs if available.</p>
<h3 id="2-do-opossums-eat-plants">2. Do Opossums Eat Plants?</h3>
<p>Opossums will eat plants and nuts - but this is not their primary food source. The animals, despite being an omnivore (eat meat), they are really more herbivores.
They need a lot of calcium in their diet; it&rsquo;s needed to help form bones or teeth, but opossum mothers pass on calcium-rich milk while nursing the babies until weaning around six weeks old.
The animals also consume small amounts of grasses as well as leaves which they&rsquo;ll find near water sources. They also consume plant material like fruits or leaves from trees.
Any insects they happen to come across while foraging is then consumed too as well. The animal&rsquo;s diet changes seasonally, depending on what food sources are available (e.g., more fruit when there are different varieties of it).
**3. Eat Dead Weeds and Plants **
Opossums will also eat dead plants and weedy vegetation - this gives them a high quantity of calcium in their diet to maintain bone density. They&rsquo;ll feed on the plant matter that is decaying - as opposed to the well-nourished plants.
Consumption of animals will result in poor quality meat due to the high levels of uric acid which causes arthritis. Opossums do not produce an enzyme called uricase, so this substance builds up more quickly than other mammals such as dogs.
The same applies if the opossum consumes insects with hard exoskeletons or bones (e.g., bees). These types of foods may cause stomach ulcers and reduce calcium absorption for the animal.</p>
<h3 id="4-opossums-feed-on-carrion-">**4. Opossum&rsquo;s Feed on Carrion **</h3>
<p>Opossums are nocturnal omnivores - they&rsquo;ll feed on a variety of plant and animal matter (including carrion). They&rsquo;ll also eat roadkill and other
*dead animals that you find on the road or in the wild. *
Opossums have an excellent sense of smell and can find food in areas where other animals are unable to. This is because they will eat anything, no matter how rotten it may be - this includes bones, hair, fur, or teeth.
Insects that Opossums Eat: Spiders (dead) Termites Wax worms Beetles Ants Grasshoppers Crickets Fleas Caterpillars Slugs Moths Earthworms Butterflies
The opossum&rsquo;s low-quality meat doesn&rsquo;t affect its ability to digest the insects listed above well as their tough exoskeletons don&rsquo;t seem to
*bother them too much. *</p>
<h3 id="5-what-do-possums-eat-in-the-garden-insects">5. What do possums eat in the Garden; Insects</h3>
<p>What do possums eat from my yard? Opossums feed on a variety of food sources including meaty foods (rodents) such as squirrels or mice to more plant-based fare consisting of berries that grow wild in woodlands or forested areas.
A possum&rsquo;s diet is omnivorous. Possums like eating dead animals as well as vegetables; such as tomatoes and potatoes. They have a variety of food in the garden, including; dead animals, snakes, toads, rodents, garden slugs, and pests.
Insects that opossums generally consume include spiders (dead), termites, wax worms, beetles ants, grasshoppers, crickets, fleas, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, earthworms, butterflies, slugs, frogs, and lizards.
Insects are high in calcium and protein. They will eat any bugs they can find in the garden, like; ants, spiders (dead), slugs, frogs, termites, and beetles.
<strong>6. Do the Eat Snakes</strong>
Do possums eat snakes: Yes! The opossum has some blood protein that makes them safe from the snake&rsquo;s venom- and thus they tend to eat snakes.
The opossums are not bothered by the snake&rsquo;s venom - and so they will consume a rattlesnake, toads and thus save themselves from death by snakebite. The animals will eat snakes&rsquo; just like they do with frogs or slugs.
In fact, scientists are delivering and anti-venom for use on humans - taking advantage of the special feature of the opossums&rsquo; blood. Ty these

<h3 id="7-opossums-will-eat-garbage"><strong>7. Opossums will Eat Garbage</strong></h3>
<p>The animals will go through the trash bin and eat garbage if they are hungry. Despite that the Opossums will hunt down the household pests (free pest control) - it can get messy when they ransack the garbage area.
They are attracted by the garbage smell, and they will drink milk, juice, or soda if it is available. But this can be a problem when the opossums run down the garbage bins and bags to scatter the trash all over your yard as they look for food scrapes.
Opossums love garbage disposals; just like raccoons and they&rsquo;ll do what it takes to get their paws on a tasty meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums are opportunistic feeders, meaning they will eat whatever is readily accessible - for example if there&rsquo;s food spilled over the side of a garbage can, an opossum will climb up and fetch it so long as he or she doesn&rsquo;t encounter too much danger in doing so.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;ll scavenge through your trash cans at night looking for any edibles that may have been thrown out from dinner preparations earlier in the day (garbage disposals do not deter them).
Garbage contains various items including pet foods that can be eaten by opossums - but you must also

.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-opossums-can-eat-fruit-and-vegetables">8. Opossums Can Eat Fruit and Vegetables</h3>
<p>The opossum will also consume fruit, vegetables, nuts, berries, and eggs. Some of the vegetation that they&rsquo;ll eat includes corn kernels, pecans, apples, or beans - but not all possums are vegetarians.
They&rsquo;re omnivores so these animals can be either plant-eating or meat-eating; it is simply a matter of what&rsquo;s available to them. This means an Opossum may go out into your garden looking for tomatoes if you have plants in there&ndash;but then come back inside when he sees some bacon cooking on the stove!
They are attracted to fruit trees because of the availability of food - but there may not be a lot left on the ground once they&rsquo;ve eaten what was within reach.
They eat apples, oranges, grapes, figs, and persimmons as well as blackberries that have fallen from vines into overgrown bushes near their homes.
There have also been reports of opossums eating fruits with high sugar content such as peaches and plums - which can cause diarrhea in other animals who forage at commercial fruit bins (especially pigs).
This scavenging animal has learned to adapt its diet over time as conditions change because their environment changes too.</p>
<h3 id="9-pet-food-can-make-opossum-diet">9. Pet Food can Make Opossum Diet</h3>
<p>Cat or dog food is something Opossums would eat on their own if left to scavenge, but it is also food that can provide them with the nutrition necessary to survive in captivity and will sustain them during rehabilitation when in need of supplemental feeding.
Opossums will eat
<a href="http://agrilifecdn.tamu.edu/txwildlifeservices/files/2016/08/Opossum.pdf"><strong>pet food</strong></a>
in urban areas, particularly when left outside the homes - particularly since there is not much roadkill and wildlife to forage. So, these animals will prowl around your property at night hunting for pet food.</p>
<h3 id="10-what-wont-opossums-eat">10. What Won&rsquo;t opossums Eat?</h3>
<p>Outline the possum menu: Outlining what opossums eat is just as important as what they do not consume! Here are some foods that Opossums Don&rsquo;t or Won&rsquo;t Eat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corn on the cob (they don&rsquo;t have teeth)</li>
<li>Dog feces (it might contain worms if it has been left out in rain)</li>
<li>Human corpses from cemeteries (again because of possible worm infestation). They do however feast on roadkill! What Do Possums Eat Bugs? The possum tends to go through periods of activity at</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question; what do opossums eat - h
ere are some of the meals that opossums eat: - carrion (dead animals) - ectoparasites (animal or plant parasites found on an animal&rsquo;s skin, fur, feathers, scales, etc.) - fruits and vegetables. Opossum diets will vary depending on what is locally available in a given region.</p>
