      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review? Dont we all hate the common challenge of the slow-moving drain in the kitchen or sink?
In this post, Ive reviewed the Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria, which is one of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners I recommend for your plumbing systems</a>
. I tested Bio-clean using Friskies cat food that contains 10 % fats, 30 % protein, and the others are mineral substances &amp; carbohydrates.

You have to note that Bio-clean
Drain cleaner
is a bacteria/ enzyme formula that is eco-friendly. Luckily, itll tear down the clog/ gunk on the inner side of your

<p>Therefore, compared to other
drain cleaners that are either highly basic or highly acidic
, thus harming your piping system, this Bio-clean Drain cleaner has only enzymes and natural bacteria thatll break down the organic matter (the drain clog) thats blocking the plumbing system.</p>
<h3 id="safe-and-ease-of-application">Safe and Ease of application</h3>
<p>Youll require a single teaspoonful of the
drain cleaner and dump it into the clogged/)

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">drain cleaner powder with some hot water</a>
to activate the bacteria and enzymes&rsquo; working. Finally, pour your great water drain cleaner mixture directly into the clogged drain.</p>
<h3 id="the-slower-rate-of-action-4-6-hours-overnight-is-better">The slower rate of action: 4-6 hours (Overnight is better)</h3>
<p>Compared to the other drain cleaners such as
Pure Lye drain opener
,
Drano Max Gel Clog Remover
, or the
XIONLAB Safer Drain Opener
that required an allowance of 15-30 minutes to work on the drain clog fully, this Bio-clean Drain cleaner requires about 4-6 hours without flushing with either cold or hot water. This is mainly because The organic enzymes and bacteria have a slow rate of action compared to the basic, acidic or caustic cleaners.</p>
<h3 id="cost-effective-drain-cleaner">Cost-effective drain cleaner</h3>
<p>Bio-clean Drain cleaner is more very safe and cost-effective compared to other drain cleaners available in the market today  due to the en enzymatic mode of action. Bio-clean is highly economical.
It allows about 100 drain treatments per bottle. As noted above, youll only require just one tablespoon to treat your clogged drain. The natural bacteria tend to multiply fast after eating some organic matter in the plumbing system, giving you faster and cheap drain removal.

<h3 id="genetically-built-formula">Genetically built formula</h3>
<p>The genetically built formula will consume all the soap scum, oil, grease, hair, and cotton in your clogged drains. Its a unique formula that is a development from the advances in the recent decades biotechnology. The clog&rsquo;s enzymes act by digesting the foreign material in a way just like how humans digest food.
On the other hand, once mixed in water, the bio-clean digest the organic matter, tripling in number by the minute, and release mineral ash, carbon dioxide, and water. Further, the enzymes do not rely on gravity to act and will thus ill love throughout the clogged drain and eat away the organic matter.</p>
<h2 id="bio-clean-safe-for-pipes"><strong>Bio-Clean safe for pipes</strong>?</h2>
<p>I would say that Bio-clean, as they are just natural bacteria and enzymes, wont generate dangerous gases in their action. Bio-clean digests organic materials without heating or generation poisonous fumes.
The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner</a>
wont harm your pipes as it has not contained caustic, acidic, or alkaline formula. Further, it wont eat away any live tissue as hence its safe for yourself, your kids, or pets in addition to being eco-friendly.
Further, the products of its action are only mineral ash, water, and carbon dioxide. The mineral ash must not make you worry as it&rsquo;s safe and even helps aid plant development.</p>
