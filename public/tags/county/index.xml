<p>Definitely, I would say that the section between the tillers gearbox and the tractors PTO shaft is the issue. For example, I would check if only the friction clutch is freely spinning around the tillers gearbox shaft.</p>

<li>These could have worn out if you left the pack to carelessly loosen.
Further, to rectify the situation, we may need to tighten the 6 or so bolts that are on the connection.
However, ensure that you tighten each of the bolts using almost an equal amount of force to ensure that each of them exerts an even amount of pressure on the connection.
Also, probably the drive chain might have jumped off  so youll require to examine the clutch pack.

However, ensure that the tractor is switched off while youre working on the PTO equipment.</p>
