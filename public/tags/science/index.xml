      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watering a <a href="/posts/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/">lawn</a> seems like a simple task: just turn on the sprinklers until the grass looks wet, right? In reality, proper lawn watering is a nuanced science, and getting it wrong can lead to more problems than solutions. Overwatering wastes a precious resource, encourages shallow root growth, and creates an ideal environment for fungal diseases and pests. Underwatering, on the other hand, leads to a brown, stressed lawn susceptible to heat damage and thinning. The secret to a lush, healthy, and resilient turf lies in understanding how much water your lawn truly needs and how often it should receive it.</p>
<p>The optimal watering strategy isn&rsquo;t a fixed rule but rather a dynamic approach that considers several variables: your grass type, soil composition, local climate, and even the time of year. Dispelling myths about daily sprinkling and embracing the principle of deep and infrequent watering are crucial steps towards developing a robust root system that can withstand environmental stresses. This guide will delve into the critical question of how often you truly need to water your lawn, provide actionable advice on setting an effective watering schedule, and equip you with the knowledge to cultivate a verdant landscape that thrives with efficient water use.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-do-you-really-need-to-water">How Often Do You Really Need to Water?</h2>
<p>The idea that you need to water your lawn every day is a common misconception that often leads to more harm than good. In reality, most established lawns benefit far more from deep, infrequent watering than from shallow, frequent applications. The goal is to encourage your grass roots to grow deeper into the soil, seeking out moisture, which makes the turf more resilient to drought, heat, and disease.</p>
<p>The frequency of watering depends on several critical factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Grass Type:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm-Season Grasses (Bermudagrass, Zoysiagrass, St. Augustinegrass, Centipedegrass):</strong> These grasses are generally more drought-tolerant due to their extensive root systems. During their active growth period (warmest months), they typically need about 1 inch of water per week, sometimes a bit more in extreme heat. They can often go longer between waterings, perhaps every 2-4 days, depending on conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Cool-Season Grasses (Kentucky Bluegrass, Fescues, Perennial Ryegrass):</strong> These grasses are less drought-tolerant and prefer cooler temperatures. During their active growth (spring and fall), they also generally need about 1-1.5 inches of water per week. They might require more frequent watering, every 2-3 days, especially during hot, dry summer periods when they are most stressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Soil Type:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandy Soil:</strong> Drains very quickly and holds less water. Lawns on sandy soil may need more frequent watering but with shorter durations, as the water percolates rapidly. They still benefit from deeper watering, but you might need to split the 1-inch application into two shorter sessions to prevent runoff.</li>
<li><strong>Clay Soil:</strong> Drains slowly and holds water well. Lawns on clay soil can go longer between waterings because the water remains in the root zone for an extended period. However, heavy clay can lead to runoff if watered too quickly. Slower, deeper watering with longer intervals is best.</li>
<li><strong>Loamy Soil:</strong> The ideal soil type, offering a good balance of drainage and water retention. Lawns on loamy soil are often the easiest to water efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climate and Weather Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hotter temperatures increase evaporation and transpiration (water loss from plants), requiring more frequent watering.</li>
<li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity reduces evaporation, so less frequent watering may be needed.</li>
<li><strong>Wind:</strong> Windy conditions can rapidly dry out the soil, necessitating more frequent irrigation.</li>
<li><strong>Rainfall:</strong> Always account for natural rainfall. Use a rain gauge to measure precipitation and adjust your watering schedule accordingly. Your lawn doesn&rsquo;t need additional water if it has received sufficient rain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Signs Your Lawn Needs Water:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Footprints Remain:</strong> If you walk across your lawn and your footprints remain visible for a while, it&rsquo;s a key indicator of thirst. Healthy grass blades spring back quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Color Change:</strong> The grass may start to turn a dull, bluish-green or grayish color.</li>
<li><strong>Wilting/Curling:</strong> Individual grass blades may begin to wilt, curl inward, or fold.</li>
<li><strong>Soil Check:</strong> The most reliable method is to check the soil moisture. Dig a small hole (or use a soil probe/screwdriver) to see if the top 4-6 inches of soil are dry. If they are, it&rsquo;s time to water.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Golden Rule: Water Deeply and Infrequently</strong></p>
<p>Instead of watering lightly every day, aim to deliver 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week, applied in fewer, longer sessions. For many lawns, this translates to watering <strong>1-3 times per week</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to measure 1 inch of water:</strong> Place a few empty tuna cans or rain gauges in different areas of your lawn. Run your sprinklers until about 1 inch of water accumulates in the cans. Note how long this takes (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour). This is your watering duration for that day.</li>
<li><strong>Why deep?</strong> Deep watering saturates the soil to a depth of 4-6 inches, encouraging roots to grow downward, making the grass more drought-tolerant and resilient.</li>
<li><strong>Why infrequent?</strong> Allowing the top layer of soil to dry out slightly between waterings encourages oxygen to reach the roots and prevents constantly saturated conditions that promote disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>By observing your lawn, checking soil moisture, and understanding the factors above, you can determine the truly optimal watering frequency for your specific lawn, leading to healthier, more robust turf.</p>
<h2 id="setting-your-watering-schedule">Setting Your Watering Schedule</h2>
<p>Establishing an effective watering schedule for your lawn is about balance: providing enough water to support healthy growth while avoiding wasteful overwatering or damaging underwatering. It requires observation, flexibility, and adherence to best practices.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-best-time-of-day-to-water-morning-is-king">1. The Best Time of Day to Water: Morning is King</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Morning (4 AM - 9 AM):</strong> This is the ideal time to water your lawn.
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced Evaporation:</strong> Temperatures are cooler, and winds are typically calmer, minimizing water loss to evaporation.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Drying:</strong> The sun and natural air circulation allow grass blades to dry off quickly, significantly reducing the risk of fungal diseases (which thrive in prolonged moisture).</li>
<li><strong>Root Absorption:</strong> The water has ample time to soak deep into the soil before the heat of the day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Mid-Day (10 AM - 4 PM):</strong> Watering during the hottest parts of the day leads to significant water loss due to evaporation before the water can penetrate to the roots. Much of your water will literally disappear into thin air.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Evening/Night (After 6 PM):</strong> While evaporation is low, watering in the evening leaves grass blades wet overnight. This creates a perfect breeding ground for various lawn diseases like brown patch, dollar spot, and rust, which can severely damage your turf.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-how-much-water-and-how-to-measure-it">2. How Much Water and How to Measure It:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aim for 1 to 1.5 inches per week:</strong> This is the general guideline for most established lawns during active growth. Young, newly seeded lawns require different, more frequent, shallower watering.</li>
<li><strong>The Tuna Can Test:</strong> This is the simplest and most accurate way for homeowners to measure water output.
<ol>
<li>Place several empty, straight-sided cans (like tuna or cat food cans) across different areas of your lawn.</li>
<li>Run your sprinklers for a set amount of time (e.g., 20-30 minutes).</li>
<li>Measure the depth of water collected in each can.</li>
<li>Calculate the average.</li>
<li>Divide 1 inch by that average to determine how many times you need to run your sprinklers to deliver 1 inch. For example, if it takes 30 minutes to get 0.5 inches, you&rsquo;ll need 60 minutes to get 1 inch.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Cycle and Soak (for Clay Soils or Slopes):</strong> If your soil is heavy clay or you have sloped areas, water may run off before it can soak in. In this case, apply water in multiple shorter cycles (e.g., three 20-minute cycles instead of one 60-minute cycle), with an hour or two in between each cycle to allow the water to absorb.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-adjusting-your-schedule-seasonally-and-environmentally">3. Adjusting Your Schedule Seasonally and Environmentally:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring:</strong> As grass greens up, begin watering as needed. Often, natural rainfall is sufficient. Start watching for signs of stress.</li>
<li><strong>Summer:</strong> This is typically when lawns need the most water due to heat, low humidity, and active growth. This is where your 1-1.5 inches per week guideline becomes most relevant. Be prepared to water 2-3 times a week, ensuring deep saturation.</li>
<li><strong>Fall:</strong> As temperatures cool, reduce watering frequency. The grass is still growing and preparing for winter, but evaporation is much lower. Reduce to once a week or every 10 days, depending on rainfall.</li>
<li><strong>Winter:</strong> Dormant lawns generally do not need watering, especially if there&rsquo;s snow or rain. Evergreen cool-season grasses in mild winters might need very occasional watering during dry spells to prevent desiccation.</li>
<li><strong>Rainfall:</strong> Always turn off your irrigation system if significant rain is expected or has occurred. A rain sensor for your sprinkler system is a smart investment.</li>
<li><strong>Drought Conditions:</strong> During severe drought or water restrictions, prioritize watering to sustain the lawn rather than maintain peak greenness. Lawns can often survive extended dry periods by going dormant and will green up when water returns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-tools-for-efficient-watering">4. Tools for Efficient Watering:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Controllers:</strong> These systems connect to local weather stations or soil moisture sensors and automatically adjust your watering schedule based on real-time conditions, significantly optimizing water use.</li>
<li><strong>Rain Gauges:</strong> Simple and inexpensive, they help you accurately measure natural rainfall and sprinkler output.</li>
<li><strong>Soil Moisture Meters:</strong> These tools help you determine the moisture level at root depth, taking the guesswork out of &ldquo;when to water.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining these principles, you can create a flexible, efficient, and effective watering schedule that promotes a deep, healthy root system and a resilient, vibrant lawn year-round. Remember, the best schedule is one that is responsive to your lawn&rsquo;s specific needs and environmental conditions.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span># The Art and Science of Lawn Watering
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Watering your lawn might seem like a straightforward task: turn on the sprinklers until the grass looks green. However, effective lawn watering is an art form rooted in scientific principles, and mastering it is crucial for a healthy, vibrant, and resilient turf. Improper watering�whether too little or too much�is one of the most common reasons lawns struggle, leading to shallow root systems, increased susceptibility to diseases, pest infestations, and wasted water.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Understanding when, how much, and how often to water your lawn is key to encouraging deep root growth, fostering a robust microbial ecosystem in the soil, and ensuring your grass can withstand periods of stress, such as drought or extreme heat. This guide will demystify the process, helping you move beyond guesswork to implement a watering strategy that promotes a thriving lawn while conserving precious resources. We&#39;ll explore the tell-tale signs your lawn needs water, delve into the optimal frequency and duration, and provide practical tips for setting an effective watering schedule tailored to your specific lawn&#39;s needs.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## How Often Do You Really Need to Water?
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>The most common mistake homeowners make is watering too frequently and too lightly. This creates a shallow, dependent root system that makes the grass highly susceptible to stress and disease. The goal of watering is not just to wet the grass blades, but to thoroughly saturate the soil deep into the root zone, encouraging roots to grow deeper in search of moisture.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold">**The Golden Rule: Water Deeply and Infrequently**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Most established lawns require <span style="font-weight:bold">**1 to 1.5 inches of water per week**</span>, including rainfall, during their active growing season. The precise amount can vary based on grass type, soil type, climate, and shade. The key is to deliver this amount in one or two deep watering sessions per week, rather than several short, superficial sprinkles.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold">**Why Deep and Infrequent?**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Promotes Deep Roots:** When you water deeply, moisture penetrates several inches into the soil. As the top few inches dry out between waterings, the grass roots are &#34;forced&#34; to grow deeper into the soil profile to access the available water. Deeper roots make your lawn much more drought-tolerant and resilient to heat stress.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Discourages Weeds <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&amp;</span> Diseases:** Shallow, frequent watering keeps the topsoil consistently wet, creating an ideal environment for shallow-rooted weeds (like crabgrass) and common fungal diseases (like brown patch). Deep watering allows the soil surface to dry out between sessions, which discourages these problems.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Maximizes Water Absorption:** A deep soak ensures the water has ample time to infiltrate the soil rather than running off, especially on compacted or sloped areas.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold">**How to Measure &#34;Deep&#34;: The Tuna Can Test**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>To determine how long your sprinklers need to run to deliver 1 inch of water, perform a simple test:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">1.</span>  Place several empty, flat-bottomed cans (like tuna cans) or rain gauges at various points on your lawn within the sprinkler&#39;s coverage area.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">2.</span>  Turn on your sprinkler for a set amount of time (e.g., 15-30 minutes).
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">3.</span>  After the time is up, measure the depth of water in each can and calculate the average.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">4.</span>  Use this information to determine how long you need to run your sprinkler to achieve 1 inch of water. For example, if your sprinkler puts out 0.5 inches in 15 minutes, you&#39;ll need to run it for 30 minutes to get 1 inch.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold">**Reading Your Lawn: Signs It Needs Water**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Your lawn will often tell you when it&#39;s thirsty. Look for these visual cues before turning on the sprinklers:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Dull, Grayish-Green Color:** Healthy, well-hydrated grass has a vibrant green hue. When it starts to look dull or takes on a bluish-gray tint, it&#39;s a sign of water stress.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Footprints Remain:** Walk across your lawn. If your footprints or mower tracks remain visible for more than a few minutes, it means the grass blades lack the turgor (internal water pressure) to spring back up. This is a classic indicator of dehydration.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Wilting or Curling Blades:** Grass blades may start to wilt, curl, or fold inward to conserve moisture. This is a more advanced sign of stress.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Screwdriver Test:** A simple way to check soil moisture depth is to push a long screwdriver or a soil probe into the lawn. It should penetrate easily into moist soil (6-8 inches deep for established lawns). If it&#39;s difficult to push in, the soil is dry and needs water.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold">**Signs of Overwatering (and why to avoid it):**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Overwatering can be as detrimental as underwatering:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Yellowing or Pale Grass:** Roots deprived of oxygen due to saturated soil can turn yellow and eventually rot.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Mushy/Spongy Soil:** The lawn feels squishy or soggy when walked on, indicating excessive saturation.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Fungal Growth:** Mushrooms, mold, or brown patches (fungal diseases) thrive in consistently damp environments.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Increased Weed Growth:** Weeds like nutsedge and crabgrass flourish in overly wet conditions.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Runoff and Puddles:** Water that the soil cannot absorb pools on the surface or runs off, wasting water and potentially causing erosion.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Thatch Buildup:** Constant moisture can slow the decomposition of organic matter, leading to an excessive layer of thatch that suffocates the grass.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Pest Infestations:** Soggy soil can attract pests like grubs, which thrive in damp environments.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>By paying attention to your lawn&#39;s signals and aiming for deep, infrequent watering, you&#39;ll create a resilient and vibrant turf that&#39;s less susceptible to common problems.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Setting Your Watering Schedule
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Once you understand the principles of deep and infrequent watering, the next step is to translate that into a practical schedule for your lawn. This isn&#39;t a rigid, one-size-fits-all plan, as many variables come into play.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold">**Key Factors Influencing Your Schedule:**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">1.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Grass Type:**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Warm-Season Grasses (e.g., Bermuda, Zoysia, St. Augustine, Centipede):** These grasses are more drought-tolerant due to deeper root systems and generally require less frequent watering. They actively grow in hot weather. Aim for 1 inch of water per week, typically delivered in one deep session, or two sessions in extreme heat.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Cool-Season Grasses (e.g., Kentucky Bluegrass, Fescue, Perennial Ryegrass):** These grasses thrive in cooler temperatures and often have shallower root systems, making them less efficient at absorbing water. They may require slightly more frequent watering, aiming for 1 to 1.5 inches per week, often split into two deep sessions. They may go dormant and turn brown during hot summer droughts if not irrigated.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">2.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Soil Type:**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Sandy Soil:** Drains very quickly, so it holds less water. You may need to water slightly more frequently (e.g., 2-3 times a week) but for shorter durations to prevent runoff, aiming for the same total weekly amount.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Clay Soil:** Retains water well but can become compacted, leading to runoff if watered too quickly. Water less frequently but for longer durations, potentially using a &#34;cycle and soak&#34; method (water for 15-20 minutes, let it soak in for an hour, then water again) to allow for deeper penetration.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Loamy Soil:** The ideal mix, drains well but retains moisture. This soil type is the easiest to manage with deep, infrequent watering.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">3.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Climate and Weather Conditions:**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Temperature:** Higher temperatures increase evaporation, meaning your lawn will dry out faster and need more water.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Humidity:** High humidity reduces evaporation, so your lawn will need less water.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Wind:** Windy conditions increase evaporation, accelerating soil drying.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Rainfall:** Crucially, adjust your watering based on natural precipitation. If your area receives significant rain, skip your irrigation cycle. A rain gauge is invaluable for this.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">4.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Sunlight Exposure:**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> Sunny areas will dry out much faster than shaded areas and will require more water. Consider creating different irrigation zones for areas with varying sun exposure.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold">**Optimal Watering Times:**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>The best time to water your lawn is <span style="font-weight:bold">**early morning (between 4 AM and 10 AM)**</span>.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Reduced Evaporation:** Temperatures are cooler, and winds are typically calmer, minimizing water loss to evaporation. This ensures more water reaches the root zone.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Time to Absorb:** The water has ample time to soak deeply into the soil before the heat of the day sets in.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Disease Prevention:** Watering in the morning allows the grass blades to dry completely before nightfall. Wet grass overnight creates a prime environment for fungal diseases to develop and spread.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Avoid Evening Watering:** Watering in the evening is generally discouraged for the same reason � prolonging moisture on the grass blades promotes disease.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Avoid Midday Watering:** Watering during the hottest part of the day (10 AM - 4 PM) leads to significant water loss through evaporation and can stress the grass.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold">**Practical Schedule Examples (Adjust as needed):**</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Standard, Established Lawn (Loamy Soil, Moderate Climate):**
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Goal:** 1 to 1.5 inches per week.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Schedule:** Water once or twice a week. For example, if your tuna can test shows 30 minutes delivers 0.75 inches, you&#39;d water for 30 minutes on two separate mornings (e.g., Tuesday and Friday) for a total of 1.5 inches.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Sandy Soil / Hot Climate:**
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">*</span> **Goal:** 1.5 inches per week.
