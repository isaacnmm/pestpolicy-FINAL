.
But most of us wonder; which food or snacks should your avoid or give to beardies? Well,
bearded dragons eat a variety of foods
like fruits, vegetables or commercial foods.
<em>But can bearded dragons eat apple? Yes, bearded dragons will eat apples. However, for a healthy diet, peel the apple&rsquo;s skin and cut the fruit into small pieces.�</em>
<strong>Ensure the Caution - only feed apples like a treat because excessive apples will lead to runny stools.�</strong>
<strong>Apples are a source of nutrients including vitamin C, proteins, fiber and so on. Apples also contain a lot of water which helps in hydrating your beardies.�</strong>

<h2 id="bearded-dragons-and-the-apples"><strong>Bearded Dragons and the Apples��</strong></h2>
<p>Apples make a very good diet for bearded dragons like

. Apples are good for because of their high nutrition value. But peel the apple fruit first before feeding on the beardies.
Notably apples are a good source of vitamin C, protein, fiber, carbs and so on. Though bearded dragons require small amounts of vitamin C, its a vital component of their diet.
Improperly or unpeeled apples fed onto the bearded dragon could cause impaction. Also, give the apples as snacks - in small bits to avoid running stools. You can give bearded dragons water from some bowl.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ITWqNQyuU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ITWqNQyuU</a>
Deficiency in vitamin C can cause stomatitis, bleeding gums, bruising of skin. Bearded dragons or reptiles exhibiting such conditions are usually treated using vitamin C - known this to properly

.
Apples consist about 86% water. That gives you a perfect means of hydrating your bearded dragon. Notably these creatures drink little water and most of them dont even know how to drink water from a bowl. In fact, it takes time to train your beardie how to drink water. However, when you feed then with apples, you dont have to worry about dehydration.
Apples meant for bearded dragons need to be washed properly to remove chemicals used for pest control. Ingesting pesticides can make your beardie very sick or even result to death. In addition, apples should be peeled and sliced into very thin slices to make it easy for them to chew.

<h3 id="can-baby-bearded-dragons-eat-apples"><strong>Can Baby Bearded Dragons Eat Apples?</strong></h3>
<p>You can feed your baby bearded dragon on apples but not on a regular basis. The diet of baby bearded dragons should consist of 80% animal protein since they are still in their growing stage.
So, they should be fed more on insects such as roaches, worms, crickets and so on.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tqQijUN0Dw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tqQijUN0Dw</a>
Their plant protein diet should only be 20%. Therefore, baby bearded dragons should be fed with minimal amounts of apples. This applies to other fruits and vegetables.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-apple-skins">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Apple Skins?</h2>
<p>Well, bearded dragons will eat apples as part of their diet. However, don&rsquo;t feed the apple skins or peels to the bearded dragons as this may cause trigger runny stools.
Also, cut the apples into small bits after peeling their skins. Because bearded dragons won&rsquo;t chew properly, the small bites makes it easy to eat and equally delicious.
Bearded dragons won&rsquo;t easily eat the apple skins or peels. The pets are unable to properly digest the apples skins and thus you&rsquo;ll need to avoid feeding them on your beardies.

<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-drink-apple-juice"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Drink Apple Juice?</strong></h3>
<p>Apples are very enticing to bearded dragons. So, they wont resist the taste of apple juice. However, they should be given small amounts of apple juice because its sugary drink.
Too much sugar isnt good for a bearded dragons stomach. It causes loose stool thus leading to a lot of mess in their cage.�You can take advantage of the sweetness in apple juice to teach your bearded dragon how to drink water from a bowl.
Beardies are not used to drinking water from a pool when in the wild. They normally hydrate from their diet which mainly consists of plants and insects.
Adding apple juice to the beardies water bowl makes the water a little bit tasty. Your pet will get lured to the flavoured water and with time it will get used to using the water bowl even without the flavour.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-green-apples"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Green Apples?</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the apples appear red in color. But theres also a green apple going by the name Granny Smith Apple. Bearded dragons will eat all types of apples regardless of color.
Their differences in nutrition content are negligible, with the green apple having higher protein, iron and potassium content.
The only notable difference is their taste. Red apples are sweeter while green apples have a sour taste. Also, green apples have a slightly greater fiber content compared to the red apples.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-apple-peels"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Apple Peels?</strong></h3>
<p>Fruit peels including apple peels should not be given to bearded dragons for two reasons. First, bearded dragons have a delicate digestive system which cannot effectively digest apple peels. Chewing the peels also proves difficult for these tender creatures.
Another reason why you should not feed your beardie on apple peels is that the skin might contain chemicals sprayed on apples. Ingesting such chemicals can lead to illness or even death.

<h3 id="how-to-feed-bearded-dragon-with-apples"><strong>How to Feed Bearded Dragon with Apples</strong></h3>
<p>Some bearded dragons take some time to get accustomed to a new diet or environment. As a result you might notice that your beardie isnt eating apples.
But with some effort and trick you can easily get your
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">bearded dragon to start eating</a>
apples.�Follow these steps to prepare and teach your beardie to eat apples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash the apples to remove dirt and any chemicals used as pesticides.</li>
<li>Peel off the skin using a knife or vegetable peeler. Ensure you dont lose too much of the flesh. If this is too much work, you can get a mini peeler to help you peel apples in a short time.</li>
<li>Slice the apples into very thin pieces. Bearded dragons wont be able to chew large chunks of apples. For baby beardies, the pieces should be even smaller.</li>
<li>You can chop a sizeable amount of apples and store in the refrigerator for future use. But of course you should defrost the pieces before feeding. When feeding your beardie with apples from the freezer sprinkle some thiamin powder since freezing causes a reduction in thiamin.</li>
<li>Place the pieces in a shallow bowl so that your beardie can easily see whats inside.
If youre giving them apples for the first time, they might refuse to eat. In this case, you can teach them to eat apples through hand-feeding. You can touch the beardies mouth with a piece of apple so that it gets a taste of the sweetness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Apples are an ideal diet for bearded dragons in addition to other plants like vegetables. Other than being a source of vitamins and fibre, apples are less acidic which makes them good for beardies.
When feeding your beardie on apples, ensure that they are thoroughly cleaned, peeled and chopped into small pieces. Plus do not overfeed your pet on apples.
Therere plenty of other foods you can give to your beardie including insects and leafy vegetables. In particular, baby beardies should be given very small amounts of apples.</p>

      <description>Bananas (*musa spp)*</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hort.ufl.edu/trees/MUSSPPA.pdf">Bananas (<em>musa spp)</em></a>
are widely eaten at homes in cooked form or as snacks when ripe. It concerns many whether
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/">bearded dragons can feed</a>
on bananas, whether ripe or raw. May be you even wonders if banana peels, leaves or stems can be used to feed these lizards.
<em>So, can bearded dragon eat bananas? The direct answer is YES!� Bearded dragons will comfortably feed on bananas whether ripe or unripe. Bananas have rich vitamin composition (needed to boost immunity), high dietary fibers (specially unripe bananas  which prevents constipation), high potassium content (needed to regulate blood pressure and kidney stones).�</em>
<em>Bananas have strong antioxidants (dopamine, catechins  reduces heart diseases), low salt and sugar content (especially unripe bananas- which reduces diabetes and teeth decay), low water level (that reduce over hydration) as well as rich mineral components such as folate, iron, niacin, riboflavin, magnesium, manganese &amp; calcium, which improves growth and development of bones, tissues and organs.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas-7-secrets">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?? 7 Secrets</h2>
<p><strong>Yes, but</strong>
bananas shouldnt be fed as the main meal since they contain low calcium: phosphorous ratio (leads to metabolic bone disease). These are the key considerations in
<a href="https://www.texvetpets.org/article/bearded-dragons-cold-blooded-companions/">caring for beaded dragons</a>
.
They have relatively high sugar level (some ripe bananas � causing diabetes) as well as low glycemic index (controls carbs uptake into the bloodstream). Controlled and supplemented banana feeding is therefore required.</p>
<h3 id="1-rich-vitamin-composition">1. Rich Vitamin Composition</h3>
<p>Bananas are rich in vitamin A (10.67mg - which is necessary for normal vision, boosts reproduction and immune system), vitamin B1 (that helps in breakdown of carbohydrates to give energy on your beardie as well as boost nerve signals).
Bananas also have vitamin B6 (0.4mg-needed for creation of red blood cells and metabolism of protein &amp; fat) and vitamin C (8.4mg-necessary for growth &amp; development as well as repair of all worn out body tissues).
Ripe bananas have more vitamins than starch as compared to unripe ones, especially Williams and apple banana species. Related -
Can Bearded Dragons Eat Grapes?</p>
<h3 id="2-high-dietary-fibers">2. High Dietary fibers</h3>
<p>Bananas have a high dietary fiber-mainly pectin (thats water-soluble) which is needed to prevent constipation. For every 100g of banana meal, there is 3.1g of both soluble and insoluble fibers that helps lower cardiovascular disease CVD and coronary heart disease CHD.
Notably, unripe bananas have high fibers than ripe ones and at times are difficult for your beardie to digest. It is required that you feed your beardie with bananas that are just about to ripen so that you may acquire maximum nutrients from either side (ripe and unripe).
Though edible, green bananas should, least be used as meal for your beardie as it draws a lot of water during digestion thus leading to constipation on excess feeding.</p>
<h3 id="3-high-potassium-content">3. High Potassium Content</h3>
<p>For every 100g of banana fruits, there is 422mg to 453mg of potassium mineral on average. This quantity is quite high as compared to other fruits such as grapes, mangoes or apricots.
Potassium mainly regulates fluid balance, nerve signals and enables smooth muscle contraction of your beardie. NB: Ripe bananas have more potassium content that unripe ones.
In addition, high potassium in bananas will help reduce water retention in the body and lower blood pressure of your beardie. Importantly, potassium will protect your beardie against kidney stones and osteoporosis/stroke.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFL6Bmecvxs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFL6Bmecvxs</a></p>
<h3 id="4-strong-antioxidant">4. Strong Antioxidant</h3>
<p>Bananas (especially Cavendish species) are considered to have high antioxidants such as dopamine, cetachins and gallocatechins. Gallocatechins will help reduce cholesterol (that cause clogging of inner lumen of blood vessels) accumulation in your beardie by breaking any cholesterol traces.
On the other hand, dopamine will enhance oxidation of low-density lipoproteins and reduce plasma oxidative stress.
Importantly, the Trans-� carotene and cetachins found in bananas will further help reduce heart diseases and generative illness that may attack your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="5-low-salt-and-sugar-content">5. Low Salt and Sugar content</h3>
<p>Apple bananas, cooking banana and Williamss banana species have low salts and sugar levels, especially when raw. There is actually 4.5mg to 12mg sugar for every 145g of banana fruits.
Starch in unripe bananas inhibits salts and sugar concentration - just like with
Cucumbers
. However, as these bananas ripen, the sugar and salt levels increases.
Excess sugar in some ripe banana species such as red bananas will cause insulin resistance that lead to diabetes mellitus/insipidus in your beardie or cause obesity. In addition, sugar accumulation on their teeth will cause teeth decay.
Low salt in the blood is needed for healthy beardies life since excess salt will cause water retention and high blood pressure, which may lead to stroke or heart attack.</p>
<h3 id="6-low-water-level">6. Low Water Level</h3>
<p>As compared to other fruits such as mangoes, pawpaw, grapes or berries, bananas have far low water content. On average, bananas contain 34.5% to 59.2% water, which is mixed with solid carbs and calories content.
Unripe bananas (especially plantains and red species) have a higher water content that reduces as the banana ripens. Read too -

.
Low water content in necessary to reduce over hydration on your beardie. Excess water causes runny/watery poo, drooling, kidney failure as well as osmotic imbalance in your bearded dragon.
The water content in bananas, unlike in other fruits, is store in combined form thus will only be used after the food is completely digested.</p>
<h3 id="7-rich-mineral-content">7. Rich Mineral Content</h3>
<p>Bananas are rich in minerals such as Iron (which prevents anemia), Calcium (5mg  for strengthening of bones and teeth), Magnesium (27mg), Zinc (0.2mg), Sodium (1mg) and Manganese (0.3 mg) for every 100g of bananas.
These minerals will help boost growth and development of body tissues of your beardie as well as boost its immunity.</p>
<h3 id="8-no-cholesterol-and-improves-insulin-sensitivity">8. No cholesterol and improves insulin sensitivity</h3>
<p>Most banana species such as Cavendish and Williams are cholesterol free. This means that your beardie wont suffer from cholesterol associated disease such as heart failure or arteries clogging/thrombosis, which lead to death of many bearded dragons.
In addition, ripe bananas improves insulin sensitivity making it quick acting and thus reducing chances of diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure on your beardie.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragon-eat-bananas-peels-stems-and-leaves"><strong>Can Bearded Dragon Eat Bananas Peels, Stems and Leaves?</strong></h2>
<p>Most beardie species will eat banana peels and leaves but not banana stems. Actually, banana peels contain vitamin B6 (which protect Type 2 diabetes, weight loss), vitamin B12, polyphenol and carotenoids, which boost health immunity of your beardie.
Normally, feed your beardie with fresh peels of ripe bananas. Unripe banana peels are highly rejected by most beardie species.
Banana peels are not beardies favorite, therefore, your will need to mix chopped pieces with other fruits like grapes, guavas or main meals.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-bananas-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to prepare Bananas for your bearded dragon.</h2>
<p>Follow the following procedure when preparing bananas for your bearded dragon.</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest bananas while unripe and separate them from stalk.</li>
<li>Allow them to drip water for two to three days if you intend to feed your beardie when they are still raw.</li>
<li>You can keep them for one or two weeks (until they near ripening) in open air without adding any substance that may quicken ripening process - this will help maintain high nutrients content available.</li>
<li>Clean them with warm or treated water before peeling to remove any chemical or poisonous insects such as fireflies that may be on the skin.</li>
<li>Peel the bananas and chop them into small pieces that are not larger than the space between the beardies eyes.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can chop the bananas without peeling after cleaning  however, some beardie species wont eat bananas with peels.</li>
<li>Mix chopped bananas with other fruits such as guavas, kiwi, apricots as well as vegetables like
cabbages
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-broccoli/">broccoli</a>
in a ratio of 1:3.</li>
<li>You should supplement banana feeds with main diet always. Feed 250g to 600g of bananas per given meal.
<em><strong>NB</strong></em>
: Its necessary to feed you beardie with bananas nearing to ripen than feeding them with immediate or over ripen bananas.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-often-should-you-feed-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How Often Should You Feed Your Bearded Dragon?�</strong></h2>
<p>Bananas should be used as occasional meal due some problems (mentioned in this article) that may arise when used as main diet for your bearded dragon. Feed your beardie once or twice per month with banana salad.
Avoid excess use of green bananas combination when preparing the meal since they have very low glycemic index that lowers the carbs uptake rate.
Baby beardie shouldnt be fed using immediate harvested unripe bananas or fully ripe bananas as this may affects its digestive track or make it docile.
Occasional feeding is also attributed by low calcium: phosphorous (0.3:1). High phosphorous quantity in bananas as compared to calcium affects the calcium (necessary for bones and teeth strengthening) uptake leading to a calcium deficiency disease called metabolic bone disease.
NB: It is importance to improve calcium levels using power calcium supplement regularly.</p>
<h2 id="which-types-of-bananas-should-you-avoid-feeding-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>Which Types Of Bananas Should You Avoid Feeding Your Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-bananas-with-too-much-starch"><strong>1. Bananas with too much starch</strong></h3>
<p>Excess starch (especially found in unripe bananas) is hard to be digested by many beardie species. In addition, starch draws a lot of water during digestion leading to constipation if continuous banana feeding is undertaken.
You will need to use bananas with less starch level like apple bananas or allow them to ripen to lower the starch levels before feeding your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="2-banana-with-excess-phosphorous-content"><strong>2. Banana with excess phosphorous content</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, banana have higher phosphorous content as compared to other fruits like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">mangoes</a>
and
tomatoes
.
However, you should always select a banana species that has the lowest phosphorous content as it inhibits calcium uptake into the blood leading to calcium deficiency.</p>
<h3 id="3-green-bananas"><strong>3. Green bananas</strong></h3>
<p>Most green bananas/plantains species have high starch content (when raw) and low glycemic index, which affects the digestion of most beardie species. In addition, plantains have higher phosphorous content that is undesirable for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="4-bananas-with-too-much-sugar-content"><strong>4. Bananas with too much sugar content</strong></h3>
<p>Excess sugar will cause high blood pressure, heart attack/stroke as well as kidney fatigue on your beardies if not controlled. In addition, sugar from bananas clogs on the teeth leading to teeth decay.
Avoid regular feed of such bananas as red bananas in order to curb associated sugar problems</p>
<h3 id="5-bananas-with-low-glycemic-index"><strong>5. Bananas with low glycemic index</strong></h3>
<p>Glycemic index determines how fast carbs in food enters bloodstreams. A lower index is associated with high loss of carbs from the meals due to low absorption into the blood stream.
Actually, low glycemic index in bananas results from high starch and fiber structure (especially immediate harvested unripe bananas).
You will have to select banana species such as Williams that has higher glycemic index for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="6-bananas-with-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio"><strong>6. Bananas with low calcium: phosphorous ratio</strong></h3>
<p>Most banana species have low calcium: phosphorous ratio thus occasional feeding is recommended. However, some banana species have higher ratio than others do. Therefore, you are required to select those bananas that have higher calcium: phosphorous ratio in order to reduce occurrence of metabolic bone disease that may occur.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So,�can bearded dragons eat bananas?
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">Bearded dragons will not only eat</a>
bananas, but will also feed on their peels and leaves. However, bananas should not be used as main diet. Occasionally, feed your beardie with 250g to 600g of banana salad that is supplemented with other main meal.
Avoid banana species that have high sugar level, low glycemic index as well as low calcium: phosphorous ratio. Importantly, always engage qualified veterinary to provide medical checkups after every 3 months in case you often feed your beardie with bananas.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can bearded dragons eat broccoli? Vegetables are part of the

for bearded dragons.�Broccoli is a source of essential minerals and vitamins. However, not all vegetables are
good for your bearded <a href="https://cvm.ncsu.edu/documents/caring-for-your-bearded-dragon/">dragon</a>
.
<em>So, can bearded dragons eat broccoli? A simple answer is YES. A little broccoli wont do harm to your beardie. However, you should only feed your beardie with small amounts of broccoli once in a while. Thats because broccoli contains high contents of oxalic acid which may cause kidney failure in reptiles.�</em>
<em>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</em></p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-broccoli"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Broccoli?</strong></h2>
<p>Broccoli provides a good source of calcium, protein, fibre and vitamins such as vitamin A, B1, C, E and K. But they also contain high levels of oxalic acid which makes it unsuitable for reptiles including bearded dragons.</p>
<p>Although
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">bearded dragons can eat</a>
broccoli, they should be given very little of it. The high levels of oxalic acid in broccoli isnt good for their kidney and bone health. Taking too much oxalic acid reduces the amount of calcium in their body. Oxalic acid reacts with calcium in the body of the reptile which leads to an imbalance in the calcium: phosphorous ratio.</p>
<p>As a result, the body of the reptile utilizes the calcium from the bones which leads to bone degeneration. Inappropriate combination of calcium also affects the functioning of the kidney. It leads to bladder stones which in turn affect the kidney due fluid retention.</p>

<h2 id="broccoli-cap-ratio-how-it-affects-bearded-dragons"><strong>Broccoli Ca:P Ratio: How it Affects Bearded Dragons</strong></h2>
<p>The ratio of calcium to phosphorous in a bearded dragons diet is of great importance. The ideal Ca:P ratio for bearded dragons and other reptiles is 2:1. That means for every unit of phosphorous there must be two units of calcium.</p>
<p>Ca:P ratio determines how effectively calcium is absorbed in the reptiles body. Higher levels of phosphorous inhibits calcium absorption in their body which in turn causes Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD).</p>
<p>Equal parts of calcium and phosphorous result in a reaction which forms calcium phosphate. Since this is an insoluble salt, it wont be absorbed in your beardies intestine. Also, excess calcium in the beardies body inhibits the absorption of phosphorous which helps in bone health and PH balance.</p>
<p>The 0.7:1 calcium to phosphorous ratio in broccoli isnt good for your bearded dragon. Therefore broccoli should be given occasionally and in small quantities. A good balance of calcium and phosphorous can be achieved by mixing broccoli with a range of greens or vegetables. Alternatively, you add supplements to achieve the 2:1 ratio.</p>
<h2 id="broccoli-for-bearded-dragon-what-you-need-to-know"><strong>Broccoli for Bearded Dragon: What you need to know</strong></h2>
<p>As earlier said, you can give your bearded dragon small amounts of broccoli without any worries. If you resolve to give broccoli to your bearded dragon, remember these tips.</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat your bearded dragon with small amounts of broccoli.</li>
<li>Broccoli should be given only occasionally as a means of adding variety to their vegetable diet.</li>
<li>Serve only raw broccoli.</li>
<li>Broccoli should be cut into very small pieces to allow easy chewing and prevent choking.</li>
<li>Give only the floret because its softer for the beardie to chew and digest. Avoid the leaves and stalk.</li>
<li>Do not give broccoli to baby beardie. Not only do they need less vegetable diet but its also hard for them to digest.</li>
<li>In case your bearded develops complications after eating broccoli stop the feeding immediately. If possible consult your veterinarian.

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>If you own a pet bearded dragon you must be prepared to give it the best care possible. Perhaps a bearded dragons diet is the most delicate part of its maintenance. While they thrive on a variety of diet, some foods can be dangerous to them.</p>
<p>Although bearded dragons eat broccoli, they should be given very small amounts once in a while. If you give too much broccoli, it will affect their health because it exhibits unbalanced Ca:P ratio.</p>

<em>So, can bearded dragons eat cabbages? The simple answer is YES! The bearded dragon will feed on all varieties of cabbages without any problems. Actually, cabbages have rich vitamin composition (needed to boost beardies immune system), and high calcium: phosphorous ratio (that prevents metabolic bone disease).�</em>
<em>Cabbages have high dietary fiber (which prevents constipation), large mineral contents (needed for growth and development of tissues), contain powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory, low-fat content (thus preventing obesity) as well as relatively low sugar level that help reduce cases of diabetes and high blood pressure on your bearded dragon.�</em>

<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-cabbage">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cabbage?</h2>
<p>But it is necessary to keep close monitoring of the sugar and
water levels of your beardie
as excess intake may result from unregulated cabbage feeding. Read also;

<h3 id="1-high-calcium-phosphorous-ratio">1. High calcium: phosphorous ratio</h3>
<p>Cabbages have proven to be one of the best vegetables with very high calcium: the phosphorous ratio of 2:1 or 2.4:1.
This ideally means that your bearded dragon will enjoy high uptake of calcium (necessary for the strengthening of bones) into the bloodstream without phosphorous inhibition.
Actually, phosphorous is a dangerous cofactor that inhibits calcium absorption in the blood if it occurs in high quantities in any animal feed.
Problems that result from excess phosphorous (such as metabolic bone disease  calcium deficiency disease) will be reduced far or get eliminated by feeding your beardie with cabbages.
Green cabbages like Savoy and Nana cabbage species show high calcium: phosphorous ratio as compared to red and variegated cabbage species. Read also -

Storing harvested cabbage for 2 to 5 days before feeding your beardie will improve the calcium uptake level and reduce phosphorous activeness. This is important.</p>
<h3 id="2-rich-vitamin-composition">2. Rich Vitamin Composition</h3>
<p>Vitamin K, which regulates clotting of blood in case of injuries and building/replacing worn-out tissues, is found in very large quantities in cabbages (especially Savoy species). For every 100g of cabbage, there is 54% to 83% of RDI of Vitamin K -
from eggs
.
As compared to other vegetables like kales and corianders, cabbages show 64.6mcg extra of vitamin K. Cabbages also have vitamin D and B12, but in low quantities as compared to other vitamins.
Also, cabbages Vitamin C (51.5mg of RDI- needed for the proper functioning of the bones, blood vessels, and smooth skin /muscle flexibility), Vitamin B1 (0.11mg - which boost nerve signals and accelerates carbohydrates breakdown to give energy for your beardie), Vitamin B6 (required for fat/protein metabolism and red blood cell creation) as well as vitamin A that boosts the beardies vision during the night.

<h3 id="3-high-dietary-fiber-25g">3. High dietary fiber 2.5g</h3>
<p>For every 100g of fresh cabbage, there is 2.5g to 3.21g of fibers. Green cabbages have more fibers than variegated and red cabbage species.
Fibers will keep a healthy digestion/alimentary canal by fueling regular and smooth bowel movement. It is the insoluble fibers found in cabbages that add bulk to the stool network, bind it well thus preventing your beardie from constipation (difficulties in releasing bowels).
Cabbages also have 1.2g to 1.5g of soluble fibers, which add to the main meal during digestion  these cruciferous fibers decrease the cholesterol level and help break down low-density lipoproteins that may lead to a heart attack or high blood pressure.
Feed your beardie with cabbages that are 3days after harvesting to a period just before the outer leaves begins to turn yellow so as to acquire maximum fiber content  fibers lose action ability when the cabbage turns yellow.</p>
<h3 id="4-large-mineral-contents">4. Large mineral contents</h3>
<p>Cabbages have high mineral components such as potassium (367mg per 100g of cabbage) that is needed to regulated nerve signals, ensure smooth contraction of muscles, maintain optimal osmotic balance as well as prevent kidney stones and lower blood pressure.
In addition, cabbage has other minerals like magnesium (12mg), iron (0.47mg), zinc (0.18), manganese (0.19mg), and sodium (0.78mg) that help in the growth and repair of beardies tissues as well as boost its immune system.</p>
<h3 id="5-low-fat-content">5. Low fat content</h3>
<p>Cabbage generally have low fat content of about 0.2g for every 100g of cabbage. This quantity is very low as compared to over vegetables like lettuce or broccoli.
Fat is quite dangerous for beardie as excess of it accumulates at the tail and berry lining making it inactive or docile. Read Also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?</a>
In addition, excess fat will cause your beardie to generate high blood pressure and heart failure or stroke if not attended to accordingly.
In comparison, red cabbage species have lower fat content than variegated and green cabbage species. You can therefore supplement the main meal with savoy or red cabbage species if you want to lower the fat intake of your bearded dragon.</p>
<h3 id="6-relatively-low-sugar-and-starch-level">6. Relatively low sugar and starch level</h3>
<p>Fresh Cabbage has a lower sugar content of about 2.3g to 3.4g for every 150g of cabbage. This sugar level is relatively low and will not have effect your pet beardie if proper feeding routine is followed as advised in this article (below).
High sugar level will lead to high blood pressure, heart attack as well as kidney failure. Further, excess sugar may cause diabetes.
Cabbage has low starch content (7.3%). Excess starch (in combined form) in a meal will be difficult for most beardie species to digest.
Actually, starch draws a lot of water from intestine for digestion process and needs high energy thus may cause constipation.
Low starch as compared to other nutrients (all combined) is needed to help ease the digestion process of your beardie.
NB: Yellow cabbages (about to dry) are more sugary and should be avoided as beardies meal.</p>
<h3 id="7-high-energy-generation">7. High energy generation</h3>
<p>When broken down through digestion, cabbages will give out 103 kJ to 113kJ or 25cal of energy for every 100g of cabbages.
The value is quite high as compared to other vegetables such as kales, green beans, or corianders.
Enough energy is needed for beardies daily activities such as moving about, feeding as well as keeping it warm (homeostatic function)</p>
<h3 id="8-powerful-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatory-compounds">8. Powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds</h3>
<p>Cabbages have powerful antioxidants such as polyphenols that will prevent your beard from damages caused by free radicals (molecules with odd electrons that damage body cells) on body tissues.
The anti-inflammatory compound (kaempferol and sulforaphane) found in cabbage will
protect your bearded dragon
from diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease as well as heart disease.
Importantly, these compounds will also reduce any chronic and acute inflammatory diseases. Read also;

<h2 id="how-to-prepare-cabbages-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to Prepare Cabbages for Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Follow the procedure below when preparing cabbages for your bearded dragon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest mature cabbages (avoid immature cabbages as they have low calcium levels and nutrients arent fully stocked) and remove the base stalk  this prevents draining of nutrients from the cabbage.</li>
<li>Store the cabbage for 3 to 6 days before feeding your beardie  this will improve calcium uptake,
drain excess water
and reduce phosphorous activeness.</li>
<li>Remove the outer foliage leaves (may have infections) and clean the cabbage with warm water or treated water to remove any poisonous insects (fireflies) or chemicals that may be in contact.</li>
<li>Split the cabbage (into 3 or 4 pieces) and remove the mid-rib/talk  this is hard for beardie to digest.</li>
<li>Chop the cabbage in to small sizes (size not larger than the space between beardies eyes). Always check (when chopping) any possibilities of insects or worms that could have hid between leaf blades.</li>
<li>Mix the cabbages with fruits like grapes, mangoes, or bananas to improve the taste (normally, cabbages are not beardies favorite meals).</li>
<li>Feed your beardie with 250g to 650g of cabbages once or twice per week. You can supplement cabbage salad with other main meals like mealworms or silkworms.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cabbage-species-you-shouldnt-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Cabbage Species You Shouldnt Feed Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<h3 id="1-cabbages-with-very-low-glycemic-index"><strong>1. Cabbages with very low glycemic index</strong></h3>
<p>Glycemic index determines how carbs are absorbed into beardies bloodstream.
Most cabbage species such as nana cabbage and red cabbage have a relatively low glycemic index that affects starch breakdown.
This is attributed to the presence of certain cofactors that prevent starch conversion/digestion.
Select cabbage species that have a higher glycemic index e.g. savoy so as to eliminate digestion problems that results from undigested starch</p>
<h3 id="2-cabbages-with-high-water-content-">**2. Cabbages with high water content **</h3>
<p>Freshly harvested cabbages have a high water content of 60% to 85% (116g out of 150g) in relation to dry matters. As said earlier, cabbages should be stored for 3 to 6 days to drain excess water.
Avoid
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-should-i-feed-my-bearded-dragon/">feeding your bearded dragon</a>
with variety of cabbages that have high water content e.g. nana cabbage, before draining period.
Excess water that accumulates in the beardie due to continuous cabbage feeding will make your pet docile, have low blood pressure, or experience diarrhea and runny poo.
Moreover, overhydration that results from excess water will lead to osmotic imbalance thus causing homeostatic problems in your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="3-cabbages-with-high-sugar-level"><strong>3. Cabbages with high sugar level</strong></h3>
<p>Many varieties of cabbages have relatively low sugar content (2.3g to 3.4g for every 150g of cabbage). However, sugar level increases as the cabbage overstay after harvesting (as it tends to turn yellow).
On the other hand, species like red cabbages and variegated cabbages have higher sugar content if they overstay on the farm or in store thus should be used within the first 10 days after harvesting.
High sugar level (as stated in this article) cause high blood pressure, kidney fatigue as well as heart problems.
You will need to select low sugar cabbage for your beardies health safety and avoid cabbages that have overstayed in stores (15- 24 days).</p>
<h2 id="which-parts-of-cabbages-dont-you-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Which Parts of Cabbages Dont You Feed Your bearded dragon</h2>
<p>It is required of you to remove the following parts of the cabbages before feeding your beardie:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-middle-stalkmidrib"><strong>1. The middle stalk/midrib</strong></h3>
<p>This is the hardest part of the cabbage that is found at the center and prolongs outside to form the taproot network.
Though nutritious, your beardie wont be in a position to digest it easily (hard).
In addition, the section has tough starch composition that impairs the digestion process.�Actually, the stalk may get stuck in the alimentary canal causing impaction or chock your beardie to death.</p>
<h3 id="2-foliage-leavesfirst-leaves"><strong>2. Foliage leaves/first leaves</strong></h3>
<p>First/foliage leaves of cabbages should be removed as they contain many chemicals (acquired at the initial stage  if cabbage is not organically grown) that may impair/affect your beardies digestive system.
Moreover, these leaves stores excess oxalate (impairs digestion) needed for cabbage build up at the earlier stage of growth and development.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragons will feed on all species of cabbages to acquire vitamins, minerals, and enough energy needed for growth and development. Moreover, cabbages have a dense fiber network that will add bulk to beardies stool thus preventing constipation.
High calcium: phosphorous ratio should be one of the reasons for selecting cabbages as a regular diet for your bearded dragon.
Remember to involve a qualified veterinarian often to check your beardies health, if you consider cabbages as a diet since they contain average sugar and water level that may arise if not monitored.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>So, can Bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">Dragon</a> eat cantaloupe?Quick answer is No! Cantaloupes are over sugary (causing teeth decay), very acidic (cause indigestion problems). Also, cantaloupe have excess water content (which cause runny poo), Low calcium: phosphorous ratio as well as low quantities of minerals.</strong>
*Though most Bearded Dragon owners tend to feed their pet beardies with cantaloupe, this act may endanger the animals health at long run. *
<em>Some vet recommends occasional feeding of bearded dragon with little bit of cantaloupe, but I suggest you avoid them completely due to the above named problems.�</em></p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-cantaloupe-7-tips">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cantaloupe? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>Cantaloupe, also known as sweet melon, muskmelon, honeydew, rock melon or persian melon in different regions of the world, is a common fruit mainly eaten as a snack or dessert by people.
Could be you grow cantaloupe in your farm or have come across some in the groceries and wonders whether your Bearded Dragon can eat these fruits.</p>
<h3 id="1-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio">1. Low Calcium: Phosphorous Ratio</h3>
<p>The biggest danger of feeding your bearded dragon with cantaloupe is the low calcium: phosphorous ratio. Currently, a well-cultivated cantaloupe has a calcium: phosphorous ratio of 0.6:1. Actually, the ideal or recommended calcium: phosphorous ratio should be 1:1, 2:1 or more.
Why is the ratio crucial for your pets health? Well, its important to know that presence of high level of phosphorous as compared to calcium inhibits calcium uptake at the alimentary canal into blood stream.
This happens due to high affinity of phosphorous absorption. In addition, if phosphorous concentration is high, it will suppress calcium ions from any intake process.
This will lead to calcium deficiency in your bearded dragon. Since calcium is required for bone strengthening and making, your pet lizard will end up suffering a very dangerous/deadly disease called metabolic bone disease.
To avoid this occurrence, it is recommend that you feed your beardie with fruits that have high calcium: phosphorous ratio.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gIL6J6Sqv4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gIL6J6Sqv4</a></p>
<h3 id="2-excess-water-content">2. Excess Water Content</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe has a very high water content of about 90%. Though water is necessary for your pet beardie hydration, excess of it will lead to over hydration.
The alimentary canal of an over hydrated beardie has a mucus lining that prevents absorption of nutrients and accelerates flow of food before digestion occurs.
The lizard will also suffer frequent diarrhea and watery/runny poo that messes the cage often. The animals kidneys get fatigued easily or overworked by the ultrafiltration and may fail at long run (kidney failure).
The excess water content in cantaloupe also makes your bearded dragon inactive/docile if not taken care of. You need to monitor the water level of your pet beardie (through use of qualified vet) to ensure its not over hydrated or dehydrated.
Moreover, youll need to note that dehydration of your beardie will lead to dizziness, low blood pressure, dry mouth &amp; dry skin as well as indigestion problems like constipation.
It is therefore recommended that apart from avoiding cantaloupe for your beardies, also limit fruits that contain high water content in their meals.</p>
<h3 id="3-high-acidic-level">3. High Acidic Level</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe have a pH between 4.5 to 6.9. This alone tells us that excess feeding of these fruits will lead to acid accumulation in your beardies digestive track.
High acid levels will cause burning sensation or irritation along the gullet  the beardie will tend to move around abnormally or scratch its throat/neck region against objects in the cage.
Also, acidity will cause stomach upset to your bearded dragon. The lizard looks uncomfortable, fatigued and at times may even vomit feeds.
High acid levels affect normal digestion in the stomach and intestines of beardies by denaturing the enzymes, which controls the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-cucumbers/">digestion process</a>
.
At time, a beardie suffering from acidity problems will excrete dry undigested waste material that may even have mucus or blood stains.</p>
<h3 id="4-low-vitamins-and-mineral-content">4. Low vitamins and mineral Content</h3>
<p>As compared to other fruits such as grapes, berries, apple or apricot; cantaloupe has lower mineral content.
There is 0.21 mg iron, 0.18mg zinc and 0.14mg manganese for every 100g of cantaloupe Oz. This is an indication that you will need to overfeed your beardie with extra cantaloupe to acquire the right quantity needed by the body for normal functioning  this contradicts the recommendation that you should avoid cantaloupe.
Vitamins such as vitamin D, E and K that are very crucial for your bearded dragon are unavailable too and those that are present such as vitamin A, B1 and C are in low quantities.
This, therefore, is an indication that cantaloupe will not provide enough vitamins and mineral if used as a daily meal for your bearded dragon.</p>
<h3 id="5-very-sugary">5. Very Sugary</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe has 7.86g of sugar for every 100g of the fruit oz. This this level is quite high for bearded dragon
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">nutrition</a>
requirements.
In the ideal situation, an adult beardie should take 0.5g to 2g (max) sugar contentment for every 100g Oz of a given meal while juvenile beardies should be fed with meals that have 0.4g to 1.2g sugar content.
Ideally, the sugar content in this fruit is already far beyond the needed amount in your lizards body/physiological processes.�Excess sugar that is absorbed in the blood may cause high blood pressure or diabetes that may lead to death easily.
Sugar, also accumulates on the teeth and between teeth gaps leading to teeth decay or dental carries. Normally, its not possible to brush the teeth of your beardies as a form of healthcare.
However, you should monitor their sugar deposit level by ensuring that you feed less sugary meals and by also providing vegetable meals that have high fiber content, which brush the teeth in the process of feeding.
Actually, its very necessary to engage a qualified vet often for teeth inspection of your beardie.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-cantaloupe-for-occasional-feeds">How to prepare cantaloupe for occasional feeds?</h2>
<p>Though it is not advisable to feed your bearded dragon with cantaloupe, some beardie owners still feed their pets with these fruits.
To meet proper health standard of your bearded dragon, you will need right preparation and control feeding program. To achieve this, follow the procedure below while feeding your beardie:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all the vines and foliage when harvesting your cantaloupe and leave it for a week to reduce fresh water content.</li>
<li>Wash the cantaloupe thoroughly with warm/disinfected water (if possible)  this will help remove and kill any insect or bacteria on the fruit skin.</li>
<li>Peel the entire fruit to remove the green out skin  this part is usually more acidic and has high phosphorous content that lead to calcium: phosphorous imbalance condition.</li>
<li>Slice/chop the peeled cantaloupe into small sizes  the chopped sizes should not be larger the space between your beardies eyes to allow easier swallowing and reduces chocking that may happen.</li>
<li>Leave the chopped cantaloupe in air or warm environment to drip excess water before feeding.</li>
<li>Feed your adult beardie with 100g to 500g of chopped cantaloupe per month in order to control side effects associated with it.
Some veterinaries have recommended occasional use of cantaloupe, which in my case I suggest that there should be close monitoring of your beardies in order to curb any complications that may arise.
Occasional feeding of bearded dragon with cantaloupe (once per month) may not show any harmful effects on their health at all, especially when the feeding is supplemented with other daily meals.
However, if there is a laxity in sugar monitoring, calcium: phosphorous ratio control as well as water regulation, then, your bearded dragon will suffer some of sicknesses highlighted in this article at the beginning.
<strong>NB</strong>
: It is highly advisable to mixed cantaloupe with other fruits/vegetables such as berries, apple, cabbages, green beans/peas etc. at a ratio of 1:3 to supplement it and enhance its digestion process without complications.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cantaloupe, just like avocado and orange, shouldnt be used as a main meal for your bearded dragon. The fruit is very acidic and has high water content that may lead to kidney failure, diarrhea or watery/runny poo.
Moreover, cantaloupe has low calcium: phosphorous ratio, which inhibits uptake of calcium necessary for bone strengthening thus leading to metabolic bone disease.
The high sugar content found in cantaloupe will cause teeth decay if not monitored at long run. It is therefore advisable to avoid use of cantaloupe as main diet for your pet bearded dragon.</p>

<a href="http://avianexotichospital.com/bearded-%5Bdragon%5D(/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/).html">bearded dragons</a>
eat carrots? You know that bearded dragons love eating a variety of vegetables. Vegetables are a good source of minerals, vitamins, and water. So, we recently analyzed this -
what do bearded dragons eat?
But, can bearded dragons eat carrots?
<strong>Short answer is YES  Bearded dragons love eating carrots. Carrots are rich in Beta-carotene and vitamin A which are essential requirements in a bearded dragons diet. However, carrots should be avoided if the bearded dragon is presently on vitamin A supplements.�</strong>
Thats because feeding the bearded dragon on carrots while it is receiving vitamin A supplements might lead excess vitamin A. This condition is known as vitamin A toxicity or hypervitaminosis A.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrots"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Carrots?</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons will generously eat carrots! With carrots, you have a good chance of enriching your pets diet with valuable nutrients.
Carrots contain numerous nutrients which contribute to the overall health of your bearded dragon. Here is the breakdown.</p>
<h3 id="1-contains-vitamin-a">**1. **<strong>Contains Vitamin A</strong></h3>
<p>Vitamin A is an essential requirement in a bearded dragons diet. Bearded dragons get vitamin A either from plants such as carrots or it can be administered as vitamin A supplements. Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-cabbage/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cabbage?</a>
Giving vitamin A to your bearded dragon comes with three benefits. The main importance of vitamin A in a beardies body is vision. Just like in humans, carrots help in maintaining eye health since they contain a lot of vitamin A. A deficiency in vitamin A can adversely affect the beardies eye sight.
Thats why swollen eyes are the first symptoms of vitamin A deficiency in a bearded dragon.�Vitamin A also plays an important role in bone development, skin health, protein synthesis and reproductive health.
While vitamin A proves good for your bearded dragon, it can reach toxic levels if given in excess. If youre feeding your beardie on carrots, its extremely hard for the calcium to reach toxic levels.
However, if you feed your beardie with carrots and vitamin A supplements at the same time, theyre very likely to suffer vitamin A toxicity (hypervitaminosis A). Therefore, its advisable not to feed your bearded dragon with carrots at a time when they are on vitamin A supplements.</p>
<h3 id="2-contains-beta-carotene">**2. **<strong>Contains Beta-Carotene</strong></h3>
<p>Carrots also contain beta-carotene which acts as means of regulating the amount of vitamin A consumed by your bearded dragon. Excess beta-carotene wont have any harmful effects on your bearded dragon as long as it comes from plants including carrots. The only effect is the tendency of their skin to turn yellow.
However, if excess beta-carotene is administered in form of supplements, it is likely lead to hypovitaminosis A (vitamin A deficiency). In excess, the beta-carotene from supplements tends to destroy vitamin A thus leading to its deficiency.
In summary, beta-carotene from carrots will do no harm to your bearded dragon. But it becomes dangerous when you give carrots and supplements that contain excess beta-carotene.</p>
<h3 id="3-fiber">**3. **<strong>Fiber</strong></h3>
<p>The fiber content in carrots plays a big role in digestion. Without fiber, the outer shell from the insects that you give to your bearded dragon could prove very difficult to digest. Inefficient digestion causes constipation which in turn may make your pet beardie sick. Severe constipation can even lead to death.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrot-leavestops"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Carrot Leaves/Tops?</strong></h2>
<p>You might already be feeding your bearded dragon on greens such as kale, cucumber, celery leaves, Swiss chard and so on. But are carrot leaves also good for them? Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?</a>
Well, bearded dragons cant resist the luring scent from the carrot tops. However, these greens will do more harm than good to your pet beardie. They contain high levels of oxalates which are harmful to bearded dragons and other reptiles when consumed in excess.
Oxalates are associated with calcium binding in the body. With little calcium in the body, a lot of oxalates reach the kidneys which may eventually lead to kidney stones.
Therefore, although your beardie can eat carrot tops, you should give very small amounts and on very rare cases. Give carrot tops as occasional treats.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-cooked-carrots"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cooked Carrots?</strong></h2>
<p>Beardies readily eat cooked vegetables including carrots. However, cooking leaches out the nutrients that would otherwise be beneficial to your beardies health and growth.
When it comes to nutrients in vegetables, fresh is always a factor. So, if bearded dragons can eat raw carrots, there is not benefit of cooking it. Youll be denying them the nutrients required a healthy life.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-should-you-give-carrots-to-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How Often Should you Give Carrots to Your Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons require a host of other nutrients which are absent in carrots. In addition, their diet in the wild doesnt include carrots at all. Therefore, carrots should be given sparingly and not as their staple food. You can make it once every week.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-carrots-for-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How to Prepare Carrots for Your Bearded Dragon</strong></h2>
<p>Now its time to feed your bearded dragon with carrots. Below is a step by step guide for preparing a carrot meal for your pet: Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-grapes/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Grapes?</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Wash the carrots with clean water and peel using a kitchen knife or a mini peeler. Dont give the peels to your beardie because they might contain pesticides.</li>
<li>Chop the carrots into very small pieces because large pieces prove difficult for the bearded dragon to bite and chew. Alternatively, you can shred the carrots to make it even easier for your beardie to chew. Shredded carrots are even better for baby bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Place the chopped or shredded carrots in a dish and put it in the beardies terrarium. Bearded dragons love the sweetness in carrots. So, even if youre giving them carrots for the first time, theyll generously pounce on it with bites.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can prepare a sizeable amount of carrots and keep in the refrigerator. But remember to defrost when feeding your beardie with frozen carrots.
<em><strong>NB</strong></em>
: Only give fresh carrots. Once peeled and chopped, carrots will go bad easily. Rotten carrots might lead to diarrhea or other complications. Read also;

</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>From the above guide, you can certainly confirm that carrots arent a bad diet for your bearded dragon. They are a rich source of vitamin A, fiber and beta-carotene which are all beneficial to your beardies health.
However, you should avoid carrots if youre presently administering vitamin A supplements on your bearded dragon. Thats because you may end up raising the amount of vitamin A in their body to toxic levels.</p>

. They are not only delicious but also contain essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins. But can bearded dragons eat eggs?
<strong>The simple answer is YES  Eggs are a healthy diet for your bearded dragons. Feeding the beardie with eggs provides them with proteins and vitamins such as vitamin A, B12, D,</strong>
and E. However, since eggs contain a lot of proteins, bearded dragons should be given eggs once in a while. This is especially so for adult beardies which require fewer
** proteins in their diet.**

<h2 id="detailscan-bearded-dragons-eat-eggs">Details:<strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Eggs?</strong></h2>
<p>In the right quantities, eggs are good for your bearded dragons. You can give them eggs to supplement the protein diet they get from feeders insect. Below is a summary of the benefits of eggs to your bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">dragon</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eggs Contain Essential Vitamins and Minerals</strong>
Eggs contain vitamins and minerals which are essential to your bearded dragons health. As long as you are cautious on the high protein content in eggs, your beardie can benefit from the following vitamins and minerals.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>*Vitamin A:*Although bearded dragons require very minimal vitamin A, it helps in enhancing their normal vision, reproduction and developing their immune system.</li>
<li>*Vitamin D:*Eggs are rich in vitamin D which helps your bearded dragon in absorbing calcium from their diet. On the other hand, calcium helps in maintaining strong and healthy bones. Low calcium levels are associated with weaker and deformed bones.</li>
<li>*Vitamin E: *Vitamin E plays a big role in the bearded dragons body. Perhaps the most important is its role in boosting their immune system which helps in fighting bacteria and viruses. In addition it helps in red blood cells formation and preventing tissue damage.</li>
<li>*Vitamin B12:*Though not very common, vitamin B12 deficiency leads stunted growth, hatching discrepancies, weak leg muscles and high mortality rates. However, feeding your bearded dragon on eggs reduces chances of vitamin B12 deficiency.
Eggs also contain essential minerals such as magnesium, calcium, selenium, zinc, folate etc.

<li><strong>Eggs Contain Protein</strong>
Bearded dragons will readily eat eggs because they contain proteins which are vital in their growth. Baby bearded dragons require diets that are higher in proteins and less in vegetables because of their higher growth rate. Typically baby beardies need 80% proteins and 20% vegetables.
However, adults should be fed on 20% proteins and 80% vegetables. Whether youre dealing with adult or baby beardies, eggs should be given sparingly because they are very rich in proteins.
High protein intake makes your bearded dragon excessively fat. The problem with this is that it may lead fatty liver disease where fat builds up in the liver cells. The liver may eventually fail to function effectively.

<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-raw-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Raw Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>A big NO to raw eggs! The bacterias present in raw eggs are likely to make your bearded dragon sick. You may end up with a dead beardie.
Eggs should always be cooked before being fed to bearded dragons to kill the harmful bacterias.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-egg-shells"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Egg Shells?</strong></h3>
<p>The risks of feeding your bearded dragon with egg shells outweigh the benefits. Although they are richer in calcium than the egg itself, they cannot be easily be digested. Even in their finest form, egg shells take long to be broken down once inside the beardies digestive system
Also, because of the poor egg shell digestion, your bearded dragon may end up with lumps of shells in their stomachs which may cause impaction.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-hard-boiled-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Hard-Boiled Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>Hard-boiled eggs come with all the nutrients contained in an egg including protein, minerals and vitamins. So, giving them to your beardie would be very beneficial to their growth and health.
However, as earlier said, eggs should constitute a negligible percentage of their diet. Thats because too much protein can bring about health complications in future. They tend to become too fat and eventually suffer fatty liver disease.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-scrambled-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Scrambled Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>Scrambled eggs are just as good as hard-boiled eggs. Again, because of high protein issues, they should be feed in small quantities. However, they should not be cooked with fat the manner were used to prepare our eggs.
The reason for this is to avoid adding more fat to their diet. Also, check whether

<h3 id="egg-yolk-vs-egg-white-which-is-good-for-bearded-dragon"><strong>Egg Yolk vs Egg White: Which is Good for Bearded Dragon</strong></h3>
<p>Both egg white and egg yolk are good for bearded dragons. They contain vital nutrients that contribute to the well-being of your beardie. But owing to their high protein levels, bearded dragons should only have very little amounts of any of them.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-quail-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Quail Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>In terms of safety and nutritional value, quail eggs are just as good as chicken eggs. Similarly, you can only give your beardie small amounts of quail eggs because they contain too much protein.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-eggs-for-a-bearded-dragon"><strong>How to Prepare Eggs for a Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you have confirmed that eggs are good for your bearded dragons, its time to know how to go about preparing an egg meal for your beardie. Therere two ways you can prepare eggs for the bearded dragon.
<strong>Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Break the egg open and pour in a bowl.</li>
<li>Scramble until the egg white and egg yolk blends into a uniform paste.</li>
<li>Pour the resulting paste into a non-stick pan and heat on a low/medium flame gas burner to prevent sticking. Do not use any frying oil.</li>
<li>If the egg tends to stick, you can mix it with a spoon without concentrating on the final shape of the egg. Furthermore, youll have to break it into small pieces to make it easy for your beardie to eat.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can cook the eggs in the oven in bowl without using cooking oil.</li>
<li>Once its ready you can put it in the beardies bowl and serve once it has cooled. Ensure you slice the cooked egg into small pieces. You can serve it with their favourite vegetables such as kales, broccoli, collard and so on.
<strong>Boiled Eggs</strong>
Although scrambled eggs are tastier to your bearded dragons you can also give them boiled eggs. Below are steps for preparing hard boiled eggs for your pet.</li>
<li>Put the eggs in a pot and add water that just covers the eggs.</li>
<li>Boil the eggs in high heat until the water boils rigorously.</li>
<li>Put off the burner and leave the pot covered for 13-16 minutes.</li>
<li>Once they cool, peel off the shell and chop the egg into small pieces.</li>
<li>Put the egg in the bearded dragons bowl or feeding point. You can serve with vegetables or greens.
Note: You should only serve small amounts of eggs because they are very rich proteins. Too much proteins will fatten your bearded dragon to dangerous extents. Also, avoid adding salt or sauces to eggs meant for bearded dragons.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Eggs make a very nutritious diet for bearded dragons. Thats because they contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and proteins. However, because of the high protein content, they are only suitable as a once in a while treat.
If youre already treating your beardies with an insect diet, they already have enough of protein in their bodies. Eggs can be given occasionally to give them variety. Excess protein will only make your pet very fat. This may eventually lead to liver complications or even death.</p>

<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-grapes-7-secrets">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Grapes? 7 Secrets</h2>
<h3 id="1-richstrong-fiber-content">1. Rich/strong Fiber Content</h3>
<p>Grapes have rich and strong fiber content that is necessary for digestion process of your bearded dragon. For every 150g of grapes, there is 1.5g to 2.8g fiber content  this is quite high value as compared to other fruits and vegetables.
Maybe you have vineyard or have seen some grapes in groceries and wonders whether your
<a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/bearded-dragons-feeding">bearded dragon can feed</a>
on them. Would it be okay if you feed it with grapes leaves or vines?
Fiber acts as roughage and binds the food being digested within the alimentary canal. Normally, grapes fiber network will help prevent constipation (inability to release bowels) in your bearded dragon.
Moreover, the grapes fibers are strong, long and coiled (especially for seedless grapes) thus providing a strong grip on food being digested without breaking. This improves the peristalsis process too  the smooth flow of chyme within the digestive track of your bearded dragon.
NB: It is important to note that the fibers are never digested and are highly need in every diet that you feed your beardie.

<h3 id="2-relative-water-content-level">2. Relative Water Content Level</h3>
<p>Ripe grapes have 45% to 68% water content  this variation is due to climatic conditions in areas they are grown. Also, red grapes have slightly higher water content than green and pink grapes.
Apart from eating the grapes, your beardie will even eat their leaves too. However, grapes shouldnt be used as a regular diet for bearded dragon, since they have high calcium: phosphorous ratio (causes metabolic bone disease) and relatively high sugar content that may cause teeth decay, high blood pressure and diabetes.
However, on average, the water content in grapes is relative okay for your bearded dragon (if not overfed or when fed occasionally as advised).
For every 180g of ripe grapes, there is 80g to 121 g of water. This generally indicates that grapes will provide good amount of water (to your beardie) necessary for osmoregulation  this is a very crucial physiological process in beardies, which if not corrected will lead to high blood pressure or kidney failure.
Water also help in keeping your pet beardie hydrated thus preventing problems of dehydration such as dizziness, dry skin and dry mouth, constipation as well as low blood pressure.
Importantly, grapes water contain low glycemic index that helps control blood pressure and boost ultrafiltration process of your bearded dragon.
Note: You will need to be careful not to overfeed your beardie with grapes as this may lead to excess water intake that cause over hydration in your pet lizard. Actually, over hydration will make the beardie docile, have watery/runny poo, cause osmotic imbalance as well as diarrhea.</p>
<h3 id="3-low-acid-and-fat-level">3. Low Acid and fat Level</h3>
<p>The acidity level in either unripe or ripe grape is below 0.02mg for every 155g of grapes. In addition, the pH level of grapes on the chart ranges between 6.1 to 6.91.
This shows a strong indication that your bearded dragon has health safety when eating grapes as a diet.
We know well that high acid level in diet will cause discomfort and irritation along the alimentary canal (especially along the gullet). Moreover, acid will cause a burning sensation on the mouth inner lining and will cause indigestion problems to your beardies.
Its worth noting that grapes also have Antioxidants components �such as �phytochemical resveratrol (red grapes), lutein and zeaxanthin, �which help control heart related diseases and reduces inflammation on your beardie. These chemicals also promotes reduction of allergies occurrence on your pet lizard.
Notably, the skin of red grapes has high composition of antioxidant compounds like flavonoids myricetin and quercetin that will help repair radical cells in the beardies brain thus initiating stress relief.</p>
<h3 id="4-rich-minerals-and-vitamins-composition">4. Rich Minerals and Vitamins Composition</h3>
<p>Ripe grapes have rich vitamin C (27% of RDI), vitamin K (28% of RDI), vitamin B6 (6% of RDI) as well as vitamin A  these vitamins plays a crucial role in protecting your beardie against infection and boosts their pets vision.
Grapes also have compounds that reduces cholesterol absorption within the alimentary canal  this prevents cholesterol related diseases such as heart failure or obesity.
Thiamine and riboflavin found in grapes will richly boost the immune system of your bearded dragon further.
Grapes has high content of potassium that is necessary for controlling and regulating your beardies blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. Actually, for every 150 g of grapes, there is 288mg of potassium ions  relatively higher as compared to other fruits and vegetables.

<li>Wash the grapes with warm or treated water to remove any chemical or poisonous insects such as fireflies that may be on the skin.</li>
<li>For seeded grapes, remove the seed as they may chock and kill the beardie when swallowing. Normally, you should slice the seeded grapes into 2 or 4 parts for easier removal of seeds.</li>
<li>For seedless grapes, you can feed your beardie direct or mesh them to form a viscous meal, which it can lick with its tongue.</li>
<li>After slicing grapes (smaller pieces enables the beardie to roll them with its tongue), supplement them with other fruits like apples, guavas, apricots as well as vegetables to boost its nutritional value and balance the low calcium content.</li>

<h2 id="problems-with-overfeeding-bearded-dragon-with-grapes">Problems with Overfeeding Bearded Dragon with Grapes.</h2>
<p>Grapes, unlike other fruits such as bananas or guavas, should be fed to your beardie occasionally. This is because these fruits cause various side effects to your pet if overfed and not monitored.
Feed your adult beardie once or twice per week with 100g to 150g of ripe grapes. Supplement grapes with main diet when feeding your pet always. After one or two months of feeding your beardie as advised, it is necessary to involve a vet to monitor its health condition.
<strong>1. High sugar levels.</strong>
For every 100g of grapes, there is 23.37 g of sugars. This amount is relatively high and if not controlled may cause your beardie to suffer from high blood pressure, heart failure and diabetes. In addition, the sugar may be deposited on their teeth in large quantities leading to teeth decay.
<strong>2. Relatively High Water Content</strong>
Grapes are 45% to 68% water content. This a lone is an indicator that the fruits should be taken in fewer quantities to prevent over hydration on your beardie. Excess water in your beardie will cause diarrhea, runny/watery poo, kidney failure or make your pet inactive.� Feed your beardie with grapes that have low water content to curb these occurrences.
<strong>3. Imbalance calcium: phosphorous ratio</strong>
Major challenge of using grapes as main meal is the imbalance calcium: phosphorous ratio 0.5:1 This is far below the require/ideal ratio, which is usually 1:1, 2:1 or more.
Presence of high phosphorous as compared to calcium will inhibit calcium intake in the blood leading to metabolic bone disease. Since grapes has other high nutritional benefits, you will need to boost the calcium level using calcium powder or other feeds that have high calcium content.
Importantly, avoid using grapes species that has very high phosphorous content.�It is also necessary to note that most grapes contain oxalate, which inhibits calcium intake. You will need to avoid using such grapes species for your beardie too.
Avoid feeding your beardie with unripe grapes  they usually have high acid content and low nutrition value.�Grapes shouldnt be used in excess as main meal for your bearded dragon for the different reasons.

<h3 id="2-rich-pre-biotic-dietary-fiber">2. Rich Pre-Biotic Dietary Fiber</h3>
<p>Mangoes are known to have pre-biotic fibers that are will add bulk to your beardies stool thus preventing it from constipation (difficulties in releasing bowels). Scientific research shows that for every 100g of mango salad, there is 2.6g to 3.2g dietary fibers  this number is relatively high as compared to other fruits such as paw paws and berries.
The soluble based mango fibers will also add to the food content in the alimentary canal and ease the digestion process. Importantly, these fibers will help lower chances of your beardie suffering from coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease.
To acquire maximum dietary fibers, feed your beardie with ripe mangoes. Avoid mangoes that are over ripe as the fibers are usually very weak.

<h3 id="3-strong-antioxidant">3. Strong Antioxidant</h3>
<p>Mango species such as Apple mango have Strong antioxidant compounds that help in destruction of free radicals that mainly attacks body cells.
Antioxidants such as astragalin, gallate, quercetin, isoquercitrin, fisetin, and gallic acid and methyl work together in breaking down any free radical and poisonous chemical component that is taken in through ingestion by your beardie.
Moreover, mangoes contain other powerful antioxidants such as polyphenols, rhamnetinm, angiferin, catechins, anthocyanins and kaempferol, which further boost the intestinal lining protection and improve beardies immunity.
Notably, ripe mangoes have more antioxidants than unripe ones.</p>
<h3 id="4-rich-mineral-content">4. Rich Mineral Content</h3>
<p>There is 168mg of potassium in every 100g of fresh ripe mango salad. Potassium is required for smooth muscle contraction, fluid regulation and quick nerves signal control in your bearded dragon. In addition, potassium will lower the blood pressure, control excess water levels and prevent occurrence of diseases such as osteoporosis and kidney stones.
Presence of 11mg calcium will further help strengthen your beardies bones and teeth. Other minerals present include Sodium (1.3mg  needed for osmoregulation and blood pressure balance), Magnesium (10mg boosts heartbeat and maintains smooth nerve signal response), Zinc (0.19mg-required for cell division and repair of injuries), Manganese (0.063mg needed for metabolism of cholesterol and amino acid as well as clotting process) and Iron (0.16mg-prevents anemia and oxygen transportation).
Mangoes also contain phyto-nutrients such as �-carotene, �-cryptoxanthin and a-carotene, which easily combine with other antioxidants thus helping in elimination of free radicals.

<h3 id="5-relative-water-content-level">5. Relative Water Content Level</h3>
<p>On average, most mango species contain 49% to 74% water content when ripe. This quantity wont be harmful to your beardie if controlled feeding is carried out. Your beardie will have a stable osmoregulation (very crucial process for beardie without which it suffers kidney failure) if you follow proper feeding and preparation procedure given below.
Average water content is needed for your beardies homeostasis processes as well as maintenance of its skin and cells in hydrated state for proper physiological processes.
Low water content in beardie will cause dehydration that leads to dizziness, constipation and dry skin.
You should avoid overfeeding your bearded dragon with excess mangoes-it may lead to over hydration that causes high blood pressure and runny poo. Normally, Mangoes should be fed occasionally and be supplemented with other meals like mealworms or silkworms.

<h3 id="6-aphrodisiac-fruit">6. Aphrodisiac fruit</h3>
<p>Mangoes, from the recent scientific research, are now aphrodisiac. They contain compounds, which improves sexual activities of bearded dragons.
If your beardies are sexually inactive, just prepare 300g of mango salad weekly (as supplement feed) for a period of 3-4 months in order to boost their mating desire and performance.
Species such as chaunsa and alphonsos mangoes strengthen further the bonds of male and female beardies in a given cage they tend to stay together most of their time.</p>
<h3 id="7-low-fat-and-cholesterol-level">7. Low Fat and Cholesterol Level</h3>
<p>According to Jasleer (nutritionist), mangoes are cholesterol free and fat free. However, some species show about 0.0013mg of fat in every 100g of mango salad. This is a very low quantity thus safe for your beardies consumption.
Excess cholesterol in beardies accumulate in the inner lining of blood vessel thus narrowing them this causes high blood pressure and heart failure at long run.
In addition, excess fat builds up at the berry and tail regions thus making your pet beardie docile/inactive as well as obese.
<em>Mangoes have a high dietary fiber (needed to add bulk and reduce constipation), low fat and cholesterol (reducing obesity and heart problems), strong antioxidants (that prevent cells against free radicals) and high potassium level (needed for nerve signals control, muscle contraction and osmoregulation).</em></p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-mangoes-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to Prepare Mangoes for Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>To prepare mangoes for your bearded dragons meal, follow the procedure below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest ripe mangoes from the farm and leave them to drain water for at least two days  this will also improve their nutrients action/uptake by your pet beardie.</li>
<li>Clean/Wash mangoes using warm or treated water to remove any chemicals or stains that may harm your beardies digestive system.</li>
<li>Leave clean mangoes to dry in air/shade for 20minutes before peeling them.</li>
<li>Slice/chop the peeled mangoes into small sizes (the sizes should not be larger than the space between the beardies eyes)  this may lead to chocking that causes death easily.</li>
<li>Dont chop the central seed (dispose it instead)  mango seed is hard for beardie to digest and when swallowed may cause impaction or block the gullet.</li>
<li>Mix the mango salad with other supplement like cabbages and mealworms to add extra flavor.</li>
<li>Measure 300g to 545g of mango salad in a given time when feeding your beardie  the quantity is for one adult beardie.
NB: It is required of you to feed beardie twice or thrice per month with mango salad in order to avoid over hydration and side effects of excess sugar that may arise. Do not feed your beardie with unripe mangoes they are difficult for beardies to digest and often impact/chock them when swallowing.

<h2 id="mango-species-not-to-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Mango Species not to Feed Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<h3 id="1-mangoes-with-relatively-high-water-content"><strong>1. Mangoes With Relatively High Water Content</strong></h3>
<p>High water content is unfavorable for beardie as it leads to runny poo, high blood pressure, diuresis, difficulties in osmoregulation as well as diabetes. In addition, excess water will make your beardie docile or less active.
Mango species such as chaunsa have high water content as compared to others and should be fed least when they have not reached overripe condition.
Select mangoes, such as apple mangoes, which has low water content to eliminate such problems. It is also necessary to avoid overripe mangoes as they to be more acid the benzoic acid content in some mango species increases as they overripe.</p>
<h3 id="2-mangoes-with-high-sugar-levels"><strong>2. Mangoes With High Sugar Levels</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, mangoes have relatively high sugar content of about 7.68g per every 100g of mango salad. Excess sugar intake by beardies cause high blood pressure, diabetes and heart attack. In addition, sugar accumulates within teeth gaps and lead to teeth decay  this is very common.
Select low sugar mango species for your beardies occasional or daily feed supplement e.g.� keitt mango, osteen mango or haden mango varieties.
You can feed your beardie with mangoes that are about to ripen  they usually have low sugar content.</p>
<h3 id="3-mangoes-with-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio"><strong>3. Mangoes With Low Calcium: Phosphorous Ratio</strong></h3>
<p>One great problem of mangoes is that they have low calcium: phosphorous ratio of 0.4:1. This is dangerous since excess phosphorous inhibits (binds) calcium from being absorbed into the bloodstream leading to calcium deficiency disease called metabolic bone disease.
However, you can boost beardies calcium level in the mango salad by adding commercially manufactured calcium powder supplement when feeding.
You need to know that low calcium to phosphorous ration will also affect absorption of carbs by your beardie. Therefore, select mango species that have relatively high calcium: phosphorous ratio.

<h3 id="4-mangoes-with-high-acidity-level-">**4. Mangoes With High Acidity Level **</h3>
<p>Most mangoes have about 0.12% of RDI acid in every 100g of mango salad. Acid such as tartaric, benzoic acid and few traces of citric acid in some mongo species will affect the digestion process of beardies. Actually, high acid level will inactivate digestive enzymes leading to vomiting or drooling of the beardies.
You should consider mango species such as haden, keitt or apple mangoes that have least acid content as frequent diet supplement for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="5-mangoes-with-high-oxalate-content"><strong>5. Mangoes With High Oxalate Content</strong></h3>
<p>Just like phosphorous, oxalate found in some mango species will inhibit calcium absorption leading to metabolic bone disease. Moreover, oxalate will also limit carbs absorption and digestion of starch. It is therefore necessary to select mango species with low oxalate content.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragon-eat-mango-peels-stems-and-leaves">Can Bearded Dragon Eat Mango Peels, Stems and Leaves?</h2>
<p>Normally, bearded dragons do not eat stems and barks of mango tree since they are hard to digest and post swallowing challenges. Though mango lives have nutritious content, beardies dont like them they are rough, irritate beardies tongue and damage the mouth lining.
However, most bearded dragons will eat mango peels if they are well sliced/chopped. Actually, mango peels contain important antioxidant compounds necessary for destruction of free radicals that may be found within beardie body tissues.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded dragon will easily eat mangoes to acquire vitamin A, B6, C, E and K. In addition, mangoes have rich pre-biotic dietary fibers as well as rich mineral content.
Notably, low fat and cholesterol content makes mango salad a suitable feed supplement. However, mangoes contain relatively high sugar, moderate oxalate/acid and low calcium: phosphorous ratio and thus should be used occasionally.</p>

or have you seen one at you field or zoo and even wonder what they actually eat?
But when it comes to other foods such as onions, you may need to pay a little bit of attention.
<em>So, can bearded Dragon Eat Onions?�</em>
<strong>The simple answer is No. Never feed bearded dragon with (cooked or raw). Onions are laced with high levels of acids and have high calcium to phosphorous ratio. These components cause indigestion problems along the delicate alimentary canal of Bearded Dragon.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-onions">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Onions?</h2>
<h3 id="1-toxic-to-their-digestive-system">1. Toxic to their digestive system</h3>
<p>Onions (scientific name
<em>Allium cepa</em>
) usually contain toxic substance which when eaten by Bearded Dragon, it toxifies the alimentary canal leading to digestion problems such as incomplete digestion,
<a href="https://www.vetexotic.theclinics.com/article/S1094-9194(16)30081-0/abstract">vomiting and burning sensation</a>
.</p>
<p>You will notice mixed reaction when you feed your beard dragon with onions due to colorless steam produced by fleshly cut onions. These steam emissions from onions usually make your
pet bearded dragon
to even shed tears (though they dont cry like human beings do).</p>
<ul>
<li>Though scientific research has been done, it has not been able to establish the exact chemical that cause tears and itching sensation on bearded dragon.
The onion leaves produces slippery fluid between leaf layers, which makes it unpleasant meal for your bearded dragon.� The green leafy onions have hollow inner sections that incubate gas, which causes vomiting to your bearded dragon when eaten.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-high-acidity-level">2. High Acidity level</h3>
<p>Onions have high level of acid content, which cause hurt burn and throat discomfort to your bearded dragon when eaten. The Folate (Folic Acid) &amp; ascorbic acid portions found in onions form a high pH environment in chyme within the stomach thus inhibiting normal working of digestive enzymes (high acid levels inactivates the digestive enzymes).</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw onions when eaten causes burning sensation (due to acid content) on the tongue and inner lining of Bearded dragons mouth. This feeling makes the pet get agitated or angry leading to loss of appetiteand they can&rsquo;t mate.
The red onions (normally fed to bearded dragons most  have white fleshy interior leaves and are sweet) have compound that affect the red blood cells of your bearded dragon leading to low cell count.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-unbalance-nutrition-components-calcium-to-phosphorous-ratio">3. Unbalance Nutrition components (Calcium to Phosphorous ratio).</h3>
<p>Onions have unbalance calcium to phosphorous ratio. For every 1gram of calcium, there is 2 grams of phosphorous in a given onion species. This on itself cause ion imbalance in the body.
High level of phosphorous as compared to calcium is not ideal for Bearded Dragon Survival. Excess or phosphorous will inhibit calcium intake leading adrenal or renal disorder. On the other hand, excess or calcium within the body may not be healthy for your bearded dragon (this may result from inhibition caused by the phosphorous within the bones or kidneys).
Proper calcium to phosphorous ratio for your bearded dragon to achieve healthy life is 2 grams of calcium for every gram of phosphorous or 1:1 ratio. This will ensure a balance calcium intake and phosphorous removal from the bones and thus preventing any possible disorder.
Onion has other nutritional components that may be of nutritional value for your bearded dragon. For every 100 grams of onions sliced for analysis, the following nutritional components will be found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calcium  23 milligrams ,<strong>Phosphorus  29 milligrams</strong>&amp; Potassium  146 milligrams</li>
<li>Iron  0.21 milligrams &amp; Magnesium  10 milligrams</li>
<li>Protein  1.1 gram, Sugars  4.24 grams &amp;��� Carbohydrates  9.34 grams</li>
<li><em>Folate (Folic Acid)  19 micrograms &amp; Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid)  7.4 milligrams</em></li>
<li><em>Pantothenic Acid (B5)  0.123 milligrams</em>&amp; Niacin (B3)  0.116 milligrams
By observation, it is clear that the phosphorous (written in bold) levels in sample is far much high as compared to calcium. In addition, the acidity level in different onion nutritional components (written in italic) are far much high too. This means that onions are not suitable for bearded dragon at whatever case.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rule-and-guidelines-to-follow-when-feeding-your-bearded-dragon">Rule and Guidelines to Follow When Feeding Your Bearded Dragon.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Any plant feeds should be fresh, chopped and thoroughly washed before feeding your bearded dragon. Water provides added nutrition to your beaded dragon.</li>
<li>Never feed your bearded dragons with food pieces that are larger than the space between the eyes (this cause chocking while feeding).</li>
<li>Let your bearded dragon hunt for food (insects) introduced in the cage to enable it to exercise while moving.</li>
<li>Always ensure that you feed you bearded dragon from a dish to prevent it from direct swallowing, which may cause impaction leading to death or health complications.</li>
<li>Never leave excess food in the cage after feeding your bearded dragon -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-eggs/">including egg diet</a>
. This makes it less active or docile since most of them never stop eating.</li>
<li>It is always advisable to offer plant feed mixed with insects to boost the nutrients acquired per feed.</li>
<li>Fruits should be peeled and chopped when feeding your bearded dragon.</li>
<li>Never entrust your kids to feed your bearded dragon in your absence.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragon do not eat onions in any form (raw or cook). Though some owners mix onions with other feeds, this is not right since onions contain toxic substance, acids and high calcium to phosphorous ratio, which cause digestion problems.
It is therefore advisable to avoid giving your pet bearded dragon any onion species. Also, follow the feeding guidelines discussed above to ensure a healthy life for your pet bearded dragon.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">bearded</a> dragons eat oranges?</strong>
Well, previously we&rsquo;ve seen that
beardies feed on selected veggies, insects (bugs), fruits
.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The short answer is NO - bearded dragons don&rsquo;t eat oranges - oranges contain excessive fruit acid and sugar that may irritate the digestive system of the bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">dragon</a> causing dehydration and diarrhea.�</strong>
Also, oranges contain more phosphorous than calcium, giving a Ca:P ratio that is incorrect for bearded dragons.
These beardies love supplements that have a ratio of calcium: phosphorus ranging from 2:1 to 3:1. See other foods for bearded dragons.

<p>Don&rsquo;t feed
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/central-bearded-dragon">bearded dragons</a>
(or other lizards) with oranges. Oranges have excessive fruit acid and sugar that&rsquo;ll irritate the digestive system of your bearded dragon.
Like other citrus fruits, oranges are very acidic. When ingested by beardies, they can cause severe diarrhea plus dehydration.
Also, the consumption of oranges interferes with the pets Ca:P ratio. Oranges contain large amounts of phosphorus compared to calcium.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, calcium is utilized in the absorption of phosphorus from the intestines into the bloodstream.
The extra calcium required for phosphorus is obtained by the body from the bones.
This is a known cause of bone degeneration in beardies which are fed on oranges.�Read Also:

<strong>Side-note:�</strong>
<em>Feed Bearded dragons with very small portions of limited types of fruits - including grapes, pears, cherries, peaches, plums, raspberries, pineapples, apples, peeled bananas, watermelon, and papayas.�</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-orange-fed-insects"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Orange-Fed Insects?�</strong></h3>
<p>A bearded dragon may eat the food, but some may be poisoned, have serious illnesses, or death.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, is it okay to feed your omnivorous bearded dragon with oranges - maybe some Mandarin oranges?
Bearded dragons love eating small creatures like roaches, crickets, and so on.</li>
<li>Since roaches and crickets have an appetite for sugary foods, you can feed them with oranges to enrich their bodies with calcium.
Oranges are particularly very helpful in the thriving and reproduction of Dubai roaches.</li>
<li>If you feed your bearded dragon on these insects, youll be indirectly giving them the calcium in oranges.</li>
<li>Just like in humans, calcium helps in maintaining the bone health of your bearded dragon.
As for the citric acid, the insects digestive system breaks it down to levels that are just appropriate for your beardie to absorb.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-mandarin-oranges"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Mandarin Oranges?</strong></h3>
<p>Mandarin oranges are types of oranges that contain less concentrations of citric acid.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, they are still not far from being harmful to bearded dragons. The sugar content in these citrus fruits is likely to cause diarrhea.</li>
<li>These creatures require a high plant intake in their diet. Plant diet is broken down by beneficial micro-organisms in the beardies gut.
However, optimum activity for these organisms is significantly hindered by the acidity in oranges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-drink-orange-fruit-juice"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Drink Orange Fruit Juice?</strong></h3>
<p>The sugar content and acidity remain the same whether you have the raw orange fruit or its juice.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, orange fruit juice should not be fed to bearded dragons since it can also cause diarrhea and dehydration.
Further, bearded dragons have poor drinking habits. Theyre so accustomed to desert conditions that they rarely take drinks when in captivity.</li>
<li>So, you might not bring your bearded dragon to drink orange fruit juice.</li>
<li>It takes time to teach bearded dragons to start drinking anything including water.
But in case you manage, do not give it orange fruit juice.�Read Also:

</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-citrus-fruits"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Citrus Fruits?</strong></h3>
<p>Oranges are in the class of citrus fruits and so are grapefruits and lemons.
Fruits in this class contain different levels of citrus acid concentration. So none of these should be fed to bearded dragons.
The acidity and sugar levels in citrus fruits will readily cause diarrhea in bearded dragons and other lizards.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, citrus fruits contain high levels of oxalic acid, especially on their peels.
It combines with calcium to form an insoluble compound (calcium oxalate).�This causes a deficiency in calcium which in turn leads to bone degeneration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-oranges-peels"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Oranges Peels?</strong></h3>
<p>Orange peels should not be fed on bearded dragons because they are also very acidic.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also contain oxalic acid which combines with dietary calcium to form calcium oxalate (CaC2O4).</li>
<li>This leads to lower levels of calcium which is necessary for phosphorous absorption.
To compensate for the low calcium levels, the body system uses calcium from the bones which lead to bone degeneration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-clementines"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Clementines?</strong></h3>
<p>Clementines are close relatives of oranges derived from the crossing of sweet orange and mandarin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since theyre acidic, they should not be fed on bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Their acid content is much less than in oranges.
Although clementines are a good source of calcium, phosphorous, and fiber, their acidic content isnt good for your beardie.
Like other citrus fruits, it has the potential to cause diarrhea. In addition, the sugar level and the Ca:P ratio arent good for your beardie.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-tangerines"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Tangerines?</strong></h3>
<p>Tangerines are close relatives to oranges, mandarins, and clementines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a citrus fruit, tangerine also has excessive acidity and sweetness. That rules out its viability as food for bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Tangerines have loose and thick skin with orange flesh and are red-colored.
But these fruits have a slightly reduced sourness. But Tangerines are very acidic to be fed to bearded dragons like their staple food.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-bearded-dragons-eat-in-the-wild">What Do Bearded Dragons Eat in the Wild?</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons are
omnivorous lizards that&rsquo;ll also eat wild vegetation such as leaves and some fruits.
The beardies will feed on
vertebrates like lizards plus invertebrates such as beetles and ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beardies will forage the wild vegetation and fruits plus flowers, plants, and small-sized bugs.
These pets can go for a long time with no food while conserving energy as they wait for suitable prey including small bugs.</li>
<li>The wild bugs and vegetation provide the bearded dragons with nutrients plus vitamins to supplement their regular diet.
Thus, the captive beardies may need supplements to match such nutritional supply - but you can give them salads and bugs.</li>
<li>Also, make the beardies work a bit to get their food while you&rsquo;re equally providing diet change.
Further, you may simulate wild feeding by providing videos - this also enhances their physical and mental health.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons must never be fed with citric fruit because they&rsquo;re highly acidic and have high sugar levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>As much as you want to give a calcium diet to your bearded dragon, you should avoid feeding them with oranges.</li>
<li>The sweetness and acidity of oranges and other citrus fruits arent good for the health of your beardie.
Therefore, you should feed them with alternative foods like kale, carrots, collard greens, and other leafy vegetables.</li>

<ul>
<li>Can spinach harm the bearded dragons or does it hold some significant nutritional value for them?
<strong>So, technically, YES - bearded dragons will feed on spinach as it&rsquo;s not toxic to these pets and the leafy vegetables have some level of nutritional value.�</strong>
But spinach has notable compounds that would make the vegetable unsuitable for feeding to the bearded dragons on a regular basis. So, we generally advise you to avoid spinach in the beardies&rsquo; diet.</li>
</ul>

.</p>
<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-spinach">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Spinach?</h2>
<p>Veterinarians consider that you don&rsquo;t start or stop feeding spinach to your bearded dragon. But 1-2 spinach leaves won&rsquo;t be dangerous to your pet.</p>
<ul>
<li>A section of the dragon pet keeps saying that they won&rsquo;t feed their beardies with spinach to avoid the risk. I approve of this since spinach is instant necessary for the development of the pet.
So, I would recommend you consider other more nutritious and safer food or bites to feed your dragon compared to using spinach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dietary-requirements-for-bearded-dragon">Dietary requirements for Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons will require a dietary balanced meal that included veggies, fruits, and insects.</p>
<p>The adult dragon will require 20% insects and 80% plants. But baby or younger dragons require 30% plants and 70% insects (meat) or even 50-50 as advised by the veterinarian.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bearded dragons are considered omnivores - and thus they&rsquo;ll feed on both plant and meat foods. But their nutritional requirement will change with their age.</li>
<li>So, if you&rsquo;re checking out meat alternatives or sources to give your dragons, I would recommend trying some Nightcrawlers. Further, the plant-based dies must have mainly vegetables.
Feeding Spinach to�Bearded Dragons? Any Benefits?</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of feeding spinach to our bearded dragons include that it offers some level of nutritional value.</p>
<p>These are the nutritional values of raw spinach - this is per every 100 grams as noted by the
<em>Agriculture Department in the United States.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Magnesium 79 mg</li>
<li>Iron 2.71 mg</li>
<li>Vitamin A469 �g</li>
<li>Vitamin C28.1 mg</li>
<li>Protein 2.86 g</li>
<li>Fat 0.39 g</li>
<li>Potassium 558 mg</li>
<li>Phosphorus 49 mg</li>
<li>Calcium 99 mg</li>
<li>Sugar 0.42 g</li>
<li>Water 91.4 g</li>
<li>Fiber 2.2 g</li>
<li>Carbohydrates 3.63 g</li>
<li>Energy 23 kcal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-rich-in-antioxidants--minerals">1. Rich in Antioxidants &amp; Minerals</h3>
<p>Spinach is an antioxidant- and nutrient-rich vegetable as it comes with high levels of calcium, iron, folic acid, vitamin K, vitamin C, and carotenoids.</p>
<ul>
<li>On anti-oxidants, spinach is a great source of antioxidants such as lutein which is considered to reduce the probability of macular degeneration and enhance eye health.</li>
<li>Spinach contains a great blend of antioxidants and minerals that&rsquo;ll help the dragon to evade heart problems as it reduces cholesterol levels.
The anti-oxidants and minerals will also strengthen the bearded dragon&rsquo;s bones and tissue� - keeping the dragon&rsquo;s bonds strong and also healthy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-suitable-vitamins-source">2. Suitable Vitamins Source</h3>
<p>The beaded dragons will reap some significant vitamin quantities in the spinach - these include vitamins C, B-6, and A.
<strong>Vitamin C -</strong>
The USDA notes that there are 28.1 mg Vitamin C in every 100-gram of spinach - these include either the semi-savoy spinach, flat spinach, or savoy spinach.</p>
<p>Vitamin C has a major role in the repair, growth, and development of body tissues. The vitamin will assist in absorbing iron, maintaining bones and immunity.
<strong>Vitamin B-6</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin B-6 in spinach will help animals create their antibodies - these aid in fighting disease &amp; infections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin B-6 will help in the development of the nervous and immune systems while minting excellent brain development while also keeping appropriate weight.
<strong>Vitamin A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin aids in the development of excellent vision - while also promoting the growth of a suitable immune system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-high-potassium-levels">3. High Potassium Levels</h3>
<p>Spinach equally has high potassium levels - notably, a single spinach cup will have as high as 167-mg of potassium.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be great to notes that compared to amounts of potassium on a banana, spinach contains largely more. But how does Potassium help? Well, Potassium assists to keep normal fluid levels in the animal cells.</li>
<li>Further, the nutrient will assist muscles in contracting and keep blood pressure at normal.
Besides, potassium will also assist in regulating the normal body fluid levels, muscle activity, and kidney function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-suitable-phosphorus--calcium-balance">4. Suitable Phosphorus &amp; Calcium Balance</h3>
<p>Spinach will also offer a great Phosphorus &amp; Calcium balance that the bearded dragons will love.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is especially important for the younger beardies that will suffer when calcium levels are low in their diet.</li>
<li>Therefore, I recommend that you spray some supplements with calcium powder on the dragon&rsquo;s food. Further, we&rsquo;ve talked about phosphorous above, and this ingredient helps in binding the calcium for easier absorption.
Notable, metabolic bone disease (MBD) will arise in the dragon if it does not have adequate calcium in its body - 100 grams of spinach has phosphorus to calcium amounts of 49 mg and 99 mg.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-low-levels-of-fat-sugar-and-calories">5. Low Levels of Fat, Sugar, and Calories</h3>
<p>The bearded dragon could also be affected by obesity and thus it&rsquo;s important to control nutrients and ingredients that could contribute to this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>For this issue, spinach will have low levels of fats, sugars, and calories - and thus it&rsquo;ll be a great treat.
For hydration, the spinach also offers excellent water content that&rsquo;ll largely benefit the bearded dragons.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feeding-spinach-to-bearded-dragons-what-are-the-risks">Feeding Spinach to Bearded Dragons? What are the Risks?</h2>
<h3 id="1-calcium-and-oxalates">1. Calcium and Oxalates</h3>
<p>One of the challenges that will arise from feeding the spinach to your bearded dragons includes that there may be dangers of not getting inadequate calcium and high oxalates in the diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>This may occur when the dragons eat foods that have high amounts of phosphorous in comparison to what they have as calcium.
Further, the high levels of oxalic acids and oxalates in the spinach have proven to be problematic to bearded dragons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-risk-of-metabolic-bone-disease">2. Risk of Metabolic Bone Disease</h3>
<p>Feeding spinach to your bearded dragons makes you risk metabolic bone disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>The under 2 years with the beardies may become calcium-deficient and this may contribute to them having deformed, weak, and soft bones.
When the diet has low calcium, vitamin D-3, while also having high phosphorus - and this may cause a high risk of MBD.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in summary, should I feed my bearded dragons with spinach? Well, spinach is an okay munch for your dragon as it has good calcium: phosphorous ratio.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, spinach has high oxalates that will prevent the absorption of calcium and this may trigger metabolic bone disease in the beardie.
Cheers!</li>

      <description>Tomatoes are delicious and</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomatoes are delicious and
healthy veggie-like fruits-dragons-eat/)
on taco or salad. But, can bearded dragons eat tomatoes? Well, the aim when feeding the bearded dragons (omnivores) must be safety first and getting a balanced diet to maintain a healthy living.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>C</strong></em>*an bearded dragons eat tomatoes? As with most fruits, the *<em><strong>short answer is affirmative. Well, Yes and NO; bearded dragons can eat just 1/4 a tomato each meoht�</strong></em>
<em><strong>without causing harm to their health.�</strong></em>
<em><strong>Tomatoes are a good source of vitamin A, for bearded dragons. But as with any other fruits, bearded dragons must not eat tomatoes as the main diet. Bearded dragons require only a small amount of vitamin A, and the acidic content in tomatoes can harm your smart beard.�</strong></em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="why-bearded-dragons-must-not-eat-tomatoes-daily">Why Bearded Dragons Must Not Eat Tomatoes Daily?</h2>
<p>Tomatoes will provide nutritional benefits to your bearded dragons but let&rsquo;s first interrogate why you can use the fruit as your beardies staple or main diet as you
care for the Bearded <a href="https://cvm.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Caring-for-your-Bearded-Dragon.pdf">Dragon</a>
.
<strong>a. High Acid content;�</strong>
Maybe your vet (like
<a href="http://facultypages.vetmed.lsu.edu/faculty/jnevare">Dr. Javier Nevarez does</a>
) has mentioned that you limit citrus fruits (and related products) as food for your bearded dragons, but why? These fruits have considerable citric acid, which is harsh on the digestive system of your dragon.
Despite that tomatoes are not classified as citrus fruits (botanically), their citric acid content makes them unsafe to be fed to the dragons as they&rsquo;ll your dragon with severe dehydration and diarrhea.
<strong>b. High Phosphorus Levels;�</strong>
The high phosphorous in tomatoes when fed to dragons are comparable to kryptonite - they&rsquo;ll bind the calcium and thus reduces its chances of getting absorbed into the reptile&rsquo;s bloodstream.
Calcium is very critical to the health of the Bearded dragons and hence taking in tomatoes daily (which have high phosphorous) may cause
<a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/bearded-dragons-diseases">metabolic bone disease</a>
(MBD) - a hazardous disease that (if not treated) may kill or paralyze your dragons.
Tomatoes have little calcium but the harmful phosphorus roughly six times that amount. Quantitatively, safe foods for your bearded dragons must have a 1:1 to 2:1 range as the ratio of calcium to phosphorus - this ensures that calcium is more than the phosphorus.
Considering the above phosphorous hazard to bearded dragons, tomatoes also have less levels of calcium and this will lead to poor nutrition when used as their main diet.
<strong>c. Toxic Vitamin A;�</strong>
Tomatoes will hold high Vitamin A levels - and thus when the fruit-veggies are fed to the bearded dragons in large quantities, and maybe also using Vitamin A supplements, the reptile will show overdose symptoms resulting from excessive Vitamin A intake.
Notable Vitamin-A overdose systems will include dehydration, weight loss, reduced energy, and swelling. Thus, in addition to their acidity, tomatoes will cause dehydration and digestive issues to your bearded dragon.</p>
<h2 id="thus-can-bearded-dragons-eat-tomatoes">Thus; Can Bearded Dragons Eat Tomatoes?</h2>
<p>These beardies will readily eat tomatoes because they obtain vitamin A from them. Vitamin A has four benefits to your beardie:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage great vision</li>
<li>Assists in the growth and reproductive health</li>
<li>Helps in protein synthesis</li>
<li>Promotes skin development - just like<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">apples for Bearded Dragons</a>
However, it is advisable not to feed your beardie on too many tomatoes because they are high in oxalic acids. Oxalic acid inhibits the absorption of calcium which is necessary for bone development and in egg production by female dragons.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9dE88_bgqc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9dE88_bgqc</a>
Although tomatoes contain too much vitamin A, they are not likely to kill your bearded dragon. Thats because your beardie readily converts the beta carotene in tomatoes into vitamin A whenever their body needs it.
If theres enough vitamin A in their body, beta carotene is excreted as waste. However, they can easily be poisoned by synthetic vitamin A since they cannot excrete any excess.�Related:

<h2 id="how-often-and-what-state-can-your-feed-tomatoes-to-bearded-dragons">How Often and What State Can your Feed Tomatoes to Bearded Dragons?</h2>
<p>Tomatoes will be a healthy addition to the diet of your bearded dragons - despite being limited to smaller units - so it doesn&rsquo;t qualify for the category of don&rsquo;t feed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomatoes have nutritional sugar in small quantities that&rsquo;ll benefit the dragon</li>
<li>Further, at the correct dosage, Vitamin A in Tomatoes will help maintain &amp; equally strengthen the growth, reproduction, vision, and immune system.</li>
<li>Tomatoes have fewer oxalates - which are comparable to phosphorus - oxalates are high quantities that will absorb the calcium and may lead to MBD or reproductive challenges in the female beardie.
On how to serve the tomatoes to your bearded dragons, vets recommend feeding the reptiles with just about 1/4 of tomato each month to reduce health risks.</li>
<li>You can make a tomato treat with the aim of making the beardie to feed on your selected salad. So, simply wash &amp; peel that tomato, remove its seeds, and slice 1/4 of it before cutting into smaller pieces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-feed-on-tomato-leaves-or-stem"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Feed on Tomato Leaves or Stem?</strong></h3>
<p>Leaves and stems of a tomato plant should not be fed on bearded dragons because they are highly toxic. They are rich in alkaloids (tomatine and solanine) which negatively impact the animals physiology.
Being in the family of nightshade plants, tomato leaves and stems contain solanine which is a highly poisonous compound. Tomatine which is found in the entire tomato plant tends to be concentrated in the stem and leaves.
Thus, when feeding your beardie on tomatoes, remember to exclude the stem, leaves, flowers, and vines. Feeding your bearded dragons on tomatoes will provide them with vitamin A and lycopene.
However, you should only feed them with minimal amounts of tomatoes to avoid stomach complications caused by acidity.

<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-feed-on-tomato-worms-popular-as-hornworms"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Feed on Tomato Worms (Popular as Hornworms)?</strong></h3>
<p>Bearded dragons can feed on tomato worms (Popular as Hornworms) because they are soft &amp; nutritious - but only use the commercially-sold worms. The wild tomato worms will be toxic to the beardies just like the tomato leaves/ stems.
Tomato worms feed on tomato plants which are rich in solanine alkaloids. By feeding on the leaves of that tomato plant, they absorb much of the toxins. They can only be good for your beardie if they are fed on non-toxic plants.
Wild tomato worms also feed on other solanaceous plants like the nightshade family and tobacco. Since you dont have control of the number of toxins they absorb, it would be safer not to feed them on your reptile.
Tomato worms are available on Amazon and will provide your reptile with a good source of calcium and fat. Their soft exoskeleton enables your pet to eat and digest without difficulties.

<h3 id="how-many-tomatoes-should-i-feed-my-bearded-dragon"><strong>How Many Tomatoes Should I Feed My Bearded Dragon?</strong></h3>
<p>Tomatoes are considered to be too acidic for your beardie. Since they cant control their junk food intake, its advisable to limit the number of tomatoes you put in their feeders - feed it with just 1/4 each month. Otherwise, they will take too much acid which might upset their stomach.
Although tomatoes will provide your beardie with vitamin A and lycopene, they should be given as part of the diet. Its recommended that fruit and vegetables make only 10% of the diet.
To feed your beardie with tomatoes, place a few slices on green vegetables like kales, mustard greens among others.�When you feeding your beardie with tomatoes and other plants ensure that you wash them thoroughly to remove harmful chemicals or pesticides.</p>
<h2 id="other-alternative-foods-for-bearded-dragons">Other Alternative Foods for bearded Dragons?</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted, tomatoes won&rsquo;t make it into the main diet of your bearded dragons - and thus you&rsquo;ll require to get alternative fruits and vegetables - these are the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow squash</li>
<li>Sweet potato</li>
<li>Mango</li>
<li>Green beans</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Bell peppers</li>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-cucumbers/">Cucumbers</a></li>
<li>Acorn squash
Fruits and vegetables must be provided in healthy and vet-recommended quantities to the bearded dragon for a balanced and healthy diet - but take extra care when working with tomatoes - as it&rsquo;ll have to be limited to just a 1/4 tomato per month.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, on the question - can bearded dragons eat tomatoes; the oxalic acid in tomatoes also inhibits the absorption of calcium which is necessary for bone development and in egg production by female dragons.
Bearded dragons also require minimal amounts of vitamin A. So, feeding them with a lot of tomatoes gives the body system the burden of excreting excess vitamin A -

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bearded dragons are docile and beautiful reptiles that you&rsquo;ll love for their low maintenance.�In this article, I will let you know how big bearded dragons (Beardies) can grow while in captivity.
**In brief, an adult (and fully-grown) bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">dragon</a> will have a length of 16 - 24 inches and have a weight of between 380 - 510 grams. However, this reptile will be classified as unhealthy (suffering stunted growth) when it&rsquo;s under 300 grams all under 16 inches after one year - mainly due to cognitive or physical sickness. **</p>
<ul>
<li>**The bearded dragons reach sexual maturity at around 1 to 1.5 years and this is when they achieve full size. **
If the Beardies length is more than 24 inches, then this could be a German giant or what we call an uncommon mophr. The German giant achieves around 1,000 grams and a length of 32 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stage-1-of-growth-juvenile-bearded-dragon-size">Stage 1 of Growth: Juvenile Bearded Dragon Size</h2>
<p>If you are rearing a bearded dragon I&rsquo;m thinking of getting one, this information will help you prepare issues such as maintaining its general health, diet, and tank size.</p>
<p>A baby or juvenile bearded dragon is classified as one between the ages of 2 - 7 months.</p>
<p>Bearded dragons have different growth rates for stage 1 &amp; stage 2;</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1 growth rate: 1 to 3 inches every month</li>
<li>Stage 1 growth rate: 1 to 2 inches every week
The bearded dragons have a small rate of growth after one year but around this age, they&rsquo;ll have a thick tail base and their belly will be filled out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to its demanding body growth needs, a bearded dragon requires great nutrition (and regular feeding) at this age.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, you may need to feed this pet about 50 crickets daily to satisfy their dietary requirements.
Also, provide each of these pets with a separate cage of about 30 gallons. This is because they&rsquo;ll grow very dormant and territorial.</li>
<li>In fact, the large-sized dragons will dominate the hideouts, the lovely basking areas, and the food bowl.
Therefore, the small-sized dragons could be deprived of suitable lighting and adequate nutrition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stage-2-of-growth-size-of-baby--hatchlings-bearded-dragon">Stage 2 of Growth: Size of Baby / Hatchlings Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>The hatchlings of bearded dragons are about 3 inches in length and 4 grams in weight.</p>
<p>In the initial 2 months of growth, the bearded dragons grow at a rate of 1 inch to 1.5 inches every week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, in the first two months, these hatchlings will acquire about 3 grams to 5 grams.
So, to maintain a normal weight of the hatchlings of the baby bearded dragons, you need to weigh them weekly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I advise you to monitor the room lighting and the baby dragons feeding habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>I noted that some of the hatchlings would have diseases such as metabolic bone disease or also they could experience feeding competition leading to dietary deficiency.
Thus, Critical factors to consider and provide to the hatchlings of the baby dragons in their first year of growth are; proper bedding, nutrition, and appropriate lighting.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Notably, You should feed the babies of the bearded dragons with a diet that has a higher proportion or ratio of proteins (insects) as compared to the number of salads included.</li>
<li>You should also include a Tube light (T5 UVB) On the outer side of the Dragon smash but at a minimum of six inches.
Therefore, as noted, the survival and growth of bearded dragons or their babies are highly dependent on the environment and diet that you provide.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sizes-of-various-bearded-dragons-by-breed">Sizes Of Various Bearded Dragons By Breed</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons come in 8 subspecies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, You should note that these subspecies have different adaptations that allow them to live in a specific region;</li>
<li>This is because the various subspecies live in various locations of Australia.

What&rsquo;s The Growth Rate Of The Bearded Dragon?</li>
</ul>
<p>During the early life (i.e. 1 - 3 months), the bearded dragons tend to grow at a highly accelerated rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be summarised as the growth of about 10 to 50 g every month and 2 inches in each month.
However, the growth rate of the bearded dragons will have slowed down after 3 months since hatching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, the reptiles in the juvenile stage will gain about 50 g every month and roughly 1 inch to 1.5 inches every month.</p>
<ul>
<li>And rid of skin-shedding, these pets will shed about 1 to 2 times every month.
However, once the bearded dragons achieve their full size (this is in around 1 year), the bearded dragons will shed their skin at a slower rate which is about 1 - 2 times every year.</li>
<li>Another critical factor to notice is that the bearded dragons will have around 350 g in one year and will gain more slowly in the second year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-average-and-maximum-weight-at-each-growth-stage">The Average and Maximum Weight at Each Growth Stage</h2>
<p>The growth rate of a bearded dragon is highly impacted by factors such as their health, their diet, and their environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, experts recommend that you use some approved growth charts that will help you make some accurate guesses on the growth rate of bearded dragons.
The growth charts require that you check the juveniles&rsquo; growth rate during the first six months.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the bearded dragon will be 15 + inches while it&rsquo;s 6 months old, I&rsquo;ll say that your pet may grow to be among those large beardies in their species. Id predict that the bearded dragon could Grow to be around 25 inches in length.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, if the bearded dragon is only about 11 inches at 6 months, I&rsquo;ll say that the animal might only (as a full-grown adult) get to around 16 to 18 inches.
Between 8 to 18 months, the bearded dragon we have achieved sexual maturity and itll have stopped growing in size.</li>

<h2 id="the-factors-that-affect-the-size-of-the-bearded-dragon">The Factors That Affect The Size Of The Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons tend to grow very fast and their clothes are considerably first time in their first year but there are some factors that will also affect how fast they grow.</p>
<h3 id="1-husbandry"><strong>1. Husbandry</strong></h3>
<p>If a bearded dragon has some sickness, or has poor health care, then the animal could have a lower weight and be smaller in size than expected for its age.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notable parasites and diseases like impaction can affect the number of nutrients that are bearded dragons get from their diet.
Such health issues and illnesses will affect the physiological functioning of the Dragon and this slows down the rate of growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check for health issues such as extreme appetite changes, the Dragon becoming overly sluggish, bloating, and significant weight loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you notice such health issues on your dragon ensure to talk to the pets vet</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-housing-">**2. Housing **</h3>
<p>The type and size of the house ( among other environmental factors) is a major factor affecting how big to do bearded dragons will grow.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should provide an enclosure (for the bearded dragon) that has adequate room for feeding, movement, or exercise.</p>
<p>If the enclosure has a small size compared to the subspecies of reptile, then the pet cool experience stunted growth cheese that home is not adequate for exercise and normal growing.</p>
<p>For example, you will require a tank of 40 gallons capacity for a juvenile bearded dragon and one of 120 gallons capacity for the adult.</p>
<p>Also, provide appropriate and enough lighting in and outside the enclosure to avoid stunted growth of your lizard.</p>
<ul>
<li>With enough UVA or B rays or adequate heat, the bearded dragon will synthesize vitamin D and also absorbed other nutrients correctly.
Hence, the lizard will escape getting the metabolic bone disease and it will have a healthy metabolic function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-diet"><strong>3. Diet</strong></h3>
<p>The bearded dragon will grow and developed if you provide them with a balanced and complete diet.</p>
<p>Notably, to escape stunted growth, don&rsquo;t feed the animals with low-nutrient bites such as iceberg lettuce.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, don&rsquo;t feed the lizards with nutrients that are improperly balanced such as*grubs. *
Also, remember to alter the diet of the bearded dragons as the age advances.</li>
<li>The adults will require lesser proteins compared to the juveniles. So, you feed the juvenile lizards with 25% plants ( such as fruits, vegetables, and greens) end 25% are their diet should be insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-gender"><strong>4. Gender</strong></h3>
<p>The sex or gender of the bearded dragon will also affect how big they grow.</p>
<ul>
<li>These pets can be described as sexually dimorphic.
The females of the bearded dragons have a slender (slim) tail but with a broader body.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the mals have wider (larger) heads and longer bodies compared to the females.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-genetics-">**5. Genetics **</h3>
<p>The maximum size of the bearded dragon is also affected by their genetics animal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the bearded dragon will grow as big or close to the size of the parents.
Are the characteristics that will differ with the lizard subspecies include the spikes, scales, and color.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the German giant morph will achieve 35 ounces in weight and 32 inches in the length.</p>
<h2 id="but-is-my-bearded-dragon-really-overweight">But Is My Bearded Dragon Really Overweight?</h2>
<p>Youll know where&rsquo;s the bearded dragon is overweight if its belly is bulging and it extends beyond the lizard&rsquo;s sides well it&rsquo;s standing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The chest area also is plump and the legs are very thick.
However, if the bearded dragon is female and it has an enlarged belly then the animal could need surgery since it could be suffering from egg retention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, when you believe that the bearded dragon might be overweight, you should begin the examination with the tank temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>notably, the tank area used for basking must not exceed a temperature of between 95 degrees Fahrenheit to 200 degrees Fahrenheit for normal body weight.
Unique characteristics that may point that your bearded dragon is over it include having a full chest, fat limbs, looking around, and being a little stout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowing exercises such as walking, offering an appropriate diet (foods with high protein and fats), and also lowering the temperature of the tank (heat tends to make the lizards eat more) will assist the pets to have fewer weight issues.</p>
<h2 id="but-is-my-bearded-dragon-really-underweight">But Is My Bearded Dragon Really Underweight?</h2>
<p>Unique features that will show your bearded dragon is underweight include protruding spine and ribs, sunken fat pads, and sagging skin(wrinkly and sullen).</p>
<ul>
<li>If the lizards are underweight in the first two to three months (growth phase) might be due to hibernation (brumation), illness, all nutritional challenges.</li>
<li>Also, the plate could lose its appetite due to temperature or food quality changes - lower temperatures trigger a slower metabolism.
For the underweight dragons, experts recommend you feed them with supplements, appetite stimulants, and a diet that is high in fats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So on the question of how big the bearded dragons can grow, I&rsquo;ll see that these will not have a straightforward response but they are important considerations to make.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, you should ensure that the bearded dragons have the correct tank, proper nutrition, and diet to allow the animals to draw their maximum possible size.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bearded dragons are often hailed as one of the most intelligent reptiles, just behind some lizards.</p>
<p>Do bearded dragons behave like mammals? Do they respond to training? It is possible to train them?</p>
<p>This article will look at the intelligence of
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/reptile/care/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-bearded-dragons"><strong>bearded dragons</strong></a>
and answer these questions.
<strong>How smart are bearded dragons?�</strong>
<em>Bearded dragons may be less intelligent than some lizards, but these reptiles are equally smart.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>*They can learn to solve problems and are capable of imitating other bearded lizards (an intelligent skill thought to belong to mammals of higher cranial capacity). *</li>
<li>*Bearded dragons can tell if you are their owner or a person who feeds them. They will be happy or sad, depending on how they feel about you. *</li>
<li><em>They can be trained with actions (patterns and routines) like a head pat or push-ups and feeding time to reinforce desired behaviors.</em>

<h2 id="how-smart-are-bearded-dragons-research">How Smart are Bearded Dragons? Research</h2>
<p>While humans may have once been the only species capable of imitation, new research has shown that some lizards are on equal footing with us in the intelligence department.</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2014/09/970.asp">University of Lincoln, U.K research</a>aimed to provide a better understanding of the intelligence of bearded dragons - through imitation testing.
The bearded dragons were studied while in terrariums. They were offered a wire door and get to the sumptuous mealworm.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Group 1</strong>- One bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">dragon</a> was shown a video where another bearded dragon was opening the wire door from the left</li>
<li><strong>Group 2</strong>- Another bearded dragon was shown a video where another bearded dragon was opening the wire door from the right</li>
<li><strong>Group 3</strong>- Another bearded dragon was shown a video where a human being was opening the wire door</li>
<li><strong>Control group</strong>- Four bearded dragons didn&rsquo;t get any video instruction on how to open the wire door
**The results and conclusion? **</li>
<li><strong>Group 1 and Group 2</strong>(shown videos of other bearded dragons opening the wire door) acted in exactly the same way and even followed the direction used in opening the door in the video.</li>
<li><strong>Group 3</strong>- But bearded dragon showed a video of human beings opening the wire door didn&rsquo;t open the door; i.e. no imitation observed.</li>
<li>Finally, in the control group (the bearded dragons were not shown any videos) and the finding was that they did not learn door opening.
**Conclusion? **</li>
<li>Bearded dragons are clever animals and they can learn from one another especially through imitation.</li>
<li>Bearded dragons use their intellectual ability to imitate other bearded dragons better than they can mimic humans.</li>
<li>It took about three weeks for bearded dragons to understand and imitate the video instruction.

<h2 id="intelligence-signs---recognize-owners-or-feeders-feeding-time-routines">Intelligence Signs? - Recognize owners or Feeders, Feeding-time Routines</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragons are <a href="/posts/roku-smart-soundbar-review/">smart</a>; they learn and recognize their owners or people who feed them by use of sight, smell, pleasure, or anger.</p>
<p>The research showed that bearded dragons are intelligent as they can imitate other bearded dragons.</p>
<ul>
<li>But people with Bearded Dragons pets have seen other smart things they do for a long time.</li>
<li>A lot of animals kept as pets learn patterns and routines.
They are more intelligent than other reptiles like geckos, Gila monsters, or Komodo dragons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bearded dragons are highly motivated by food; they&rsquo;ll remember and adhere to feeding-time routines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the owner enters its cage, the Bearded Dragon smells his/her presence and while using its sight its able to recognize the owner/feeder  you will fill Bearded Dragon approach him/her on entering the cage.</li>
<li>It relaxes and also enjoys the pleasure of being held by the owner without resistance.
When it&rsquo;s mealtime, bearded dragons usually gravitate to the same spot as their food bowls - if you position it at a single location in their enclosure.</li>
<li>You can teach your bearded dragon to come when it hears its name, by calling them before they eat.</li>
<li>Also, the bearded dragon associates its human owner with pleasurable experiences, such as and eating.
Bearded dragon has great animal intelligence; they&rsquo;ll acknowledge waving and nodding by humans or bearded dragons because they understand that these gestures are signs of politeness, even though they don&rsquo;t have the ability to speak.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, the Bearded Dragon would not resist any presence of an intruder in its cage who is not the owner/feeder or someone or an animal who caused them a painful or bad experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, Bearded Dragon may generate anger (an aggressive posture) and begin to run away, or even attack.
Therefore, have a cover or screen on the reptile&rsquo;s enclosure, so that it can hide from any intruder who is not the owner/feeder.</li>
<li>Also, don&rsquo;t the bearded dragon be out of their cage without supervising them.

<h2 id="can-i-train-my-bearded-dragon">Can I Train My Bearded Dragon?</h2>
<p>First, dragons are not difficult to train on routine including potty training. But they won&rsquo;t perform tricks like cats or dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that your bearded dragons are much less intelligent than iguanas and tegus.
You can also train Bearded Dragon. The experiment carried out by researchers at the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom shows that a Bearded Dragon was able to be trained and learn how to open doors to access its food.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was achieved by placing Trained Breaded Dragon with untrained ones. When untrained Bearded Dragons saw trained ones open the door to access food, they were also able to open too.</p>
<p>In fact, these animals are able to imitate other reptiles (bearded dragons) and practice the learned skills - but their learning time varied.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed how bearded dragons respond to both negative &amp; positive daily experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best way to keep your bearded dragon from associating you with fear, anger, or pain is by giving it positive attention.
So, keep your beardie happy by giving him food like super worms and mealworms.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-tame-your-bearded-dragon">How to Tame your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>First, the sign of stress in most bearded dragons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hiding from other bearded dragons or you</li>
<li>Their beard turning dark-colored</li>
<li>Having an expanded or frilled beard</li>
<li>Bobbing their head
It is possible to train your Bearded Dragon so that it may conform and respond to some activities you may desire. Such activities may include:</li>
<li>Recognizing its name/sound.</li>
<li>Accessing a place to take their food.</li>
<li>Recognize their owner or people who feed them.</li>
<li>Locate a place to poop/excrete.</li>
<li>Wave to people/visitors.</li>
<li>Escape danger.
To achieve these skills in the Bearded Dragon, you must train one skill for a given period of time. It is not possible for the Bearded Dragon to master all these skills simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normally, Bearded Dragons are shy by nature. It wont be possible to train them in any of the above skills until you create a close bond between you and Bearded Dragon. To do this, you will need to carry out the following steps for your newly acquired Bearded Dragon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you bring a new Bearded Dragon in your home, allow it to have its free time without touching it. Feed it from a distance so that you dont create tension or fear. Ensure it is living in a large enclosed place.</li>
<li>Start to Hand Feed your Bearded Dragon. This will make your Bearded Dagon get free and comfortable with your touch. It will also boost its trust in you. Bearded dragons are normally harmless  they may not bite you when hand feeding.</li>
<li>Make sure you spend a lot of time in the cage where the Bearded Dragon lives. You can be there cleaning, making its sleeping place, or feeding it. This will create recognition with time.</li>
<li>Allow the Bearded Dragon to move about in an enclosed cage for some hours. This can be done effectively by setting up little food in bowls at various points to attract its movement. Keep watch from a distance to see if it has any signs of stress (showing an aggressive posture).</li>
<li>Once you realize that your Bearded Dragon is now free with you, pick it with your hand and softly rub its back softly to kill its tension or fear. Do not lift the Bearded Dragon from behind  this may make it get angered or generate fear. Never raise it up by the tail  it may startle. The tail of the Bearded Dragon does not grow back once cut. Slowly and calmly pick your Bearded Dragon from the front and support its trunk gently. In case it reacts restrictively, taps its back softly as you tend to put it on the ground.</li>
<li>Further, calm your Bearded Dragon until it&rsquo;s stress-free. This will be shown by indicators such as warm relaxations and lack of aggressiveness.
Once you are able to handle your Bearded Dragon with your hands freely without it reacting, then it will be easier for you to train it other skill as indicated above through the use of Conditioned reflex action.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Every time you handle your bearded dragon, try to get in the habit of washing your hands; you dont want to pass salmonella on to your pet.</li>
<li>Bearded dragons have an exceedingly high tolerance for pain, so never attempt to restrain them by grabbing their tail.</li>
<li>To reassure them, stroke their backs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-you-potty-train-the-bearded-dragon">Can you Potty Train the Bearded Dragon?</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragon report that they&rsquo;ve effectively potty-trained some of these pets.</p>
<p>Some bearded dragons don&rsquo;t quickly learn to use the litter. However, most will get into the habit of going in one spot on their own within a week or two.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reptiles hate the smell and sight of their poop, and thus they learn to avoid it by choosing a single pooping litterbox�spot that&rsquo;s far.</li>
<li>Also, the bearded dragons have a tendency to go out of the cage to poop.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-bearded-dragons-friendly">Are Bearded Dragons Friendly?</h2>
<p>Yes, Bearded Dragons are docile. These reptiles rarely show aggression unless you get too close to their space, at which point they may try to flee the area.</p>
<p>Bearded Dragons are a good pet because they do not bite people and they are easier to tame; they&rsquo;ll curl or turn when held as a sign of cool pleasure.</p>
<p>These reptiles will not attack your children when in their cage or when invading their hideouts.</p>
<p>Bearded Dragons do not cause any rebellion against other pets. If you have a bearded dragon, then you can also have other pets in the same cage.</p>
<p>But, when Bearded Dragon gets aggressive, it begins to Hiss, open its mouth, stare, bobbing its head, puffing the beards or generate stress marks.</p>
<p>The reaction may be caused by stress, stiff competition in the case, being scared often, shedding, hormonal imbalances, breeding season, or environmental change.</p>
<h2 id="do-bearded-dragons-show-affection">Do bearded dragons show affection?</h2>
<p>Yes! Bearded Dragons are special as compared to other reptiles in that they are eagerly waiting for their owner or the person feeding them. You will find them warming up as you approach which is a sign of affection and appreciation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Bearded Dragons Voluntarily seek to be held by their owner. You will find them preferring to feed on your hand instead of using their bowls.</p>
<p>The affection of the Bearded Dragon increases with age. You will find that it likes to always be closer to you/owner. In addition, it will even climb over you for fun. Therefore, Bearded Dragon is an incredibly affectionate reptile.</p>
<h2 id="are-bearded-dragons-nocturnal">Are Bearded Dragons Nocturnal?</h2>
<p>No! Bearded dragons are very inactive at night. Indeed, these lizards are diurnal  they are active during the day and sleep the whole night. We noted that
Leopard Geckos are<strong>crepuscular</strong>
Bearded Dragons are docile reptiles. They are active when the room temperature rises during the day to a level that can make them go hunting or move around in the cage.</p>
<p>Normally, the light will make the Bearded Dragons wake up while Darkness makes them sleep. Artificially, you can control the sleeping style of the Bearded Dragon in an enclosure/cage by switching off and on light or using a time switch.</p>
<p>However, it would be problematic to make your Bearded Dragon be active in the presence of light. They will sleep often during the day, especially after feeding.</p>
<h2 id="do-bearded-dragons-respond-to-their-names">Do Bearded Dragons Respond to Their Names?</h2>
<p>Yes! Bearded Dragons will respond to their names. However, they do not respond to those names as a human does. You must associate the given name/voice with something that will attract (at first) the Bearded Dragon such as food.</p>
<p>Any time you give the Bearded Dragon food, mention the name. With time, it will connect that voice with itself and food too.</p>
<p>It is not easy to take Bearded Dragons to respond to their names though with commitments and repetition, you will have them respond to your call even without food.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On how smart are bearded dragons; YES, they&rsquo;re smart - they&rsquo;ll imitate other Bearded Dragons and learn feeding-time routines such as name-calling.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can easily tame it for a given task through a conditioned reflex action method.</li>
<li>In case you want to feed your Bearded Dragon, you can this by calling it a given name just before giving it food. With time, Bearded Dragon will associate that sound/name with food or your presence.
We cannot say that Bearded Dragon is the most intelligent reptile we have. However, we can attest that Bearded Dragon is smart and able to learn with continuous training.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do bearded dragons eat? For a healthy life, it is important to feed your bearded dragon with a proper balanced diet. As a
smart omnivore
, this dragon either eats fruits, plant or animal products/ supplements.
Maybe you have come across a bearded dragon in the fields, zoo or probably own one and wonders what this reptile eats.
*So, what do Bearded Dragons Eat? Well, these reptiles feed on fruits such as tomatoes, apples, guavas, bananas, berries, figs, watermelons, mangoes, papayas, grapes, kiwi, apricots, pears or plums. *
<em>Bearded Dragons can also feed on vegetables/greens such as cabbages, celery, sweet potatoes, peas, green beans, courgette, butternut squash, okra, bell pepper, clover, turnip green, mustard green, coriander or collard/ kales.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-do-bearded-dragons-eat-7-tips">What Do Bearded Dragons Eat? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>Also, you can feed your bearded dragon with animals like crickets, earthworms, cockroaches, mealworms, waxworms, butter worms, Dubia roaches, silkworms, locust or king worms.</p>
<h3 id="1-fruits-eaten-bybearded-dragons">1. Fruits Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-tomatoes"><strong>a. Tomatoes�</strong></h4>
<p>Tomatoes are ideal meal for your bearded dragon
as they are the main source of vitamin A, which promotes good vision, skin development and protein synthesis.
However, it is dangerous to feed your dragon with excess of these fruits. Tomatoes contain oxalic acid (not easily excreted) which inhibits absorption of calcium needed for bone development.
Importantly, avoid feeding your pet bearded dragon with tomatos leaves, stem or flowers since these parts contain alkaloids such as solanine and tomatine, which negatively affects its health, and alter its physiological processes greatly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSH8c6AZ1k&amp;amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSH8c6AZ1k&amp;amp;t=2s</a></p>
<h4 id="b-apples"><strong>b. Apples�</strong></h4>
<p>Apples for bearded dragons
are an essential fruit as they contain 1% of vitamin A, 5% of Vitamin K and 14% of vitamin C, which enhances good vision and development. When feeding, it is necessary to peel the apples and slice them into sizable pieces that can be chewed and swallowed smoothly without chocking the lizard.
Apples have high-level Calories (95%) and 4g fibers per fruit that will boost your dragons energy and reduce indigestion problems.
Moreover, apples large quantities of magnesium and potassium minerals, which improves development and immune system of your Breaded Dragon.</p>
<h3 id="c-bananas"><strong>c. Bananas�</strong></h3>
<p>Peal your bananas and slice them into small pieces before feeding your bearded dragon if unripe. Most beardies wont eat banana peels unless they are grown under natural care.
You should feed your pet beardie with banana occasionally (maybe once or twice a month). Why because, bananas contain high levels of phosphorous that binds the calcium in the body (inhibits its intake) and thus may end up causing metabolic bone disease (calcium deficiency disease).</p>
<h3 id="d-berries"><strong>d. Berries�</strong></h3>
<p>Berries such as blackberries, raspberries, strawberries or blueberries can be fed to bearded dragon as they add extra water content to the blood stream. In addition, berries contain rich fiber-networks that improves digestion process - just like the
<em>cantaloupe.�</em>
Berries should be fed directly without peeling or mashing. However, wild picked berries should be cleaning thoroughly before feeding or you avoid them since they may contain toxins or harmful pests.
Blackberries are slightly harder and can be split for easier swallowing.�Blueberries should be given occasionally since they contain oxalates that binds calcium leading to metabolic bone disease.
<strong>e. Papaya and watermelon</strong>
Papaya and watermelon contain sugary taste that attracts your beardies for extra feeding. They have strong fiber content that prevents your beardie from constipation. You can also
feed your bearded dragons with cucumber
.
Though necessary, the excess water content found in these fruits may be dangerous as they may lead to over hydration and runny poo.�Therefore, it is recommended that you supplement these fruits with main meal and use them occasionally (twice per month).
<strong>f. Cherries and plums</strong>
Cherries have high level of potassium necessary for fluid balance regulation and blood pressure reduction. However, excess eating may lead to calcium inhibition and thus cherries should be fed once per week as a supplement to main meal.
Apart from water content addition, plums have fibers that help prevent constipation. It also contain iron, calcium and magnesium minerals necessary for growth and development.
It is necessary to remove the central seeds found in cherry and plum as they may cause impaction to your bearded dragon.
<strong>g. Grapes and mangoes</strong>
Grapes contains a high level of
calcium necessary for bone strengthening
. You will need to slice them into small pieces for easier swallowing.
Grapes also have fair level of oxalate and phosphorous thus should be supplemented with other main meal.�Like grapes, mangoes have fibers that help in digestion of your beardie.
The sugary component in mangoes makes them favorite to beardies. However, these fruits have high level of oxalate that binds and inhibits calcium absorption. They should, therefore, be fed twice or thrice per month and be supplemented with other main feeds.</p>
<h3 id="2-vegetablesgreenseaten-bybearded-dragons">2. Vegetables/Greens�Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-cabbages"><strong>a. Cabbages</strong></h4>
<p>Cabbages are essential meal for your bearded dragon
since they contain high-energy content (113kJ). They also contain strong fibers (prevents constipation), water and vitamin A, C, &amp; K necessary for growth and development.
Moreover, magnesium, iron, zinc and manganese minerals are also plenty - just like
broccoli for bearded dragons
. Notably, cabbages have high level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (2:1) which prevents occurrence of metabolic bone disease.
Ensure that green or red cabbages are thoroughly washed (to remove harmful chemicals or insects) and sliced into sizable pieces before feeding your bearded dragon.�Minimize use of purple cabbages since they are highly acidic.</p>
<h4 id="b-sweet-potatoes"><strong>b. Sweet potatoes</strong></h4>
<p>Normally,
bearded dragons dont eat
raw sweet potatoes. They may feed on peels, but occasionally. Actually, raw sweet potatoes are great challenge to chewing as most beardies swallow food as a whole.
However, these lizards will eat mashed or cooked sweet potatoes.
You can also supplement your beardies main meal with sweet potatoes vines, which should be chopped well. But
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrots/">bearded dragons can also eat carrots</a>
.
The relative level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (1:1.56) make it inappropriate to use sweet potatoes as daily meal.
Sweet potatoes vines have rich fiber networks that help in preventing constipation.</p>
<h4 id="c-green-beans-and-peas"><strong>c. Green beans and peas</strong></h4>
<p>Green beans and peas are ideal meal for your beardies as they contain high-energy content (131 kJ), vitamins A, C&amp;K as well as calcium, magnesium and iron minerals.
You can either feed your beardies with green pods or vines, which need to be chopped into small sizes first.�The relative calcium to phosphorous ratio of these greens means that they can only be used occasionally (once or twice per week.).
Beans or peas pods and vines have rich fiber content, which will help prevent your bearded dragon from indigestion problems.�You need to clean green peas and beans before feeding your pet bearded dragon so as to remove any toxic chemical or poisonous insects (fireflies).</p>
<h4 id="d-corianders-or-kales"><strong>d. Corianders or Kales</strong></h4>
<p>Corianders are rich in fibers, vitamin (A, C, E&amp;K) and minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, copper and phosphorous.�This occasion meal should be fed once per week. The relatively high calcium: phosphorous ratio means that overfeeding/excess use will lead to metabolic bone disease.
Kales are rich source of vitamin K and C as well as magnesium mineral. Kales also have thiamine that boost the immunity of your beardie. However, these green should only be supplemented with the main meal.
Notably, corianders or Kales are acidic in nature thus will alter the pH of digestive track leading to indigestion problems.</p>
<h3 id="3-animals--animal-products-eaten-bybearded-dragons">3. Animals / Animal Products Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-crickets-and-locusts"><strong>a. Crickets and Locusts</strong></h4>
<p>Crickets and locusts are staple insects to feed your bearded dragon. They have high level of proteins necessary for growth and development of your pet lizard.
Crickets and locusts also contain a large quantity of iron needed to strengthen teeth and bones. When feeding your beardie, remove the legs to allow easier swallowing and slice large locust where possible.
Baby beardies should only be fed with small locust/crickets (1-10 days).</p>
<h4 id="b-earthworm"><strong>b. Earthworm</strong></h4>
<p>Earthworms are major source of calcium for your bearded dragon. They are also fatty, thus should not be used as the main diet  too much fat accumulation will make your pet docile.
Purchase earthworms from vet approved vendors.
Avoid feeding your beardies with wild picked earthworms, as they may be poisonous.</p>
<h4 id="c-silkworm"><strong>c. Silkworm</strong></h4>
<p>Silkworms have soft bodies that make its swallowing easier. They contain high protein and calcium level needed for growth and development.
Bearded dragon (of any age) can be fed using silkworm as basic diet. Actually, you can use silkworms as main meal since they contain low-fat levels and are highly nutritious.
Silkworms also contain minerals such as magnesium, iron, sodium as well as vitamin B1, B2 and B3 that help boost immunity.</p>
<h4 id="d-mealworm"><strong>d. Mealworm</strong></h4>
<p>The tasty mealworms are known to be the most favorite of bearded dragons meals. They contain high fat level and thus should be used occasionally with other feeds such as fruits and vegetables.
Mealworms should be fed, mostly, to beardies aged 5-6 years.�Though Mealworms contains proteins and calcium, the quantity is quite low as compared to silkworms and earthworms.
<strong>e. Waxworm</strong>
Just like mealworms and silkworms, waxworms are fatty meals that should be fed to your bearded dragon occasionally in order to avoid abnormal weight accumulation, which may make it inactive.
Supplement 2-12 waxworms with vegetables and fruits per week. Waxworms are best diet for fattening young beardies.
<strong>f. Dubia roaches</strong>
Dubia roaches are the best insect meal for your bearded dragons as they contain 50% proteins (necessary for growth) and 61% moisture content. They have fairly soft bodies, which make your breaded dragons chew and digest them easily.
Unlike crickets, Dubia roaches have high calcium: phosphorous ration and thus enhance prevention of metabolic bone disease.�The top benefits of Dubia roaches is that they are quiet, never jump a lot, dont smell, live longer and are easier to breed.
What Can&rsquo;t Bearded Dragons eat? Which Foods Do You Avoid From Feeding Your Bearded Dragon?�Breaded dragons are very sensitive to some meals. You need therefore need to be very cautious of every diet you feed them. Avoid feeding your bearded dragon with some of the following meals:
<strong>g. Oranges</strong>
Oranges have high quantity of citric acid that causes throat discomfort and hurt burn. In addition, too much accumulation of acid content will inactivate digestive enzymes reaction leading to indigestion problems.
Oranges also have excess sugars that may cause tooth decay and excess diarrhea to your bearded dragon.
<strong>f. Avocados</strong>
Though avocados have good fiber content, they shouldnt be fed to bearded dragons since they contain excess oxalate that binds calcium and prevent its absorption in digestive track. This may lead to metabolic bone disease at long run.
**g. Rhubarb **
Rhubarbs have high content of oxalic acid and nephrotoxin that damages the kidneys of your bearded dragons when eaten. They also cause watery diarrhea and muscular weakness of beardie.
In case of consumption, seek immediate assistance from a veterinary.
<strong>h. Spinach and beet tops</strong>
These vegetables have chemical that binds calcium in the digestive system thus inhibiting it from absorption into the bloodstream. This, with time, may lead to calcium deficiency that cause metabolic bone disease.
<strong>i. Lighting insects</strong>
All insect that glow (produces light) such as fireflies should be avoided as they contain toxic chemical, which may poison/kill your bearded dragon when eaten.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-to-feed-on-bearded-dragons">What Not to Feed on Bearded Dragons</h2>
<h3 id="1-oranges">1. Oranges</h3>

<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-onions/">Onions?</a></p>
<h2 id="what-do-baby-bearded-dragons-eat">What do Baby Bearded Dragons eat?</h2>
<p>Baby Bearded Dragon will need a special care through proper feeding habit and health attention (use vet for regular medical check-up).
It is important to feed your baby beardie with more insect (especial Dubia roaches) than vegetables. Insects contains high protein level, fat and minerals that is needed at the young stage for growth and development.
Fruits such as grapes, peeled bananas and berries should be supplemented with mealworms or silkworms to boost the breadies feeding habit.
Though baby bearded dragon do eat vegetables, normally they climb on them when left in the cage. You will need to mix vegetables with some insects and monitor the feeding for 10-15 minutes.
Feed your baby beardie 1-2 times more that you feed adult ones. A baby bearded dragon aged 4-16 years should eat 40-60 insects per day. At juvenile stage, supplement their main diet with calcium and multi-vitamins powder to boost their growth and immunity.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-feed-a-bearded-dragon">How to Feed a Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>When feeding breaded dragon, it is necessary to follow the following steps and instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never feed your bearded dragon with dead insects. Always introduced live insect in the cage and allow the beardie to hunt  this create an exercise chance and boost its psychology.</li>
<li>All vegetable feeds should be washed thoroughly; freshly chopped and fed while wet water ease swallowing and reduces dehydration.</li>
<li>When feeding your bearded dragon, ensure that the chopped pieces are lesser than the space between its eyes.</li>
<li>Feed your bearded dragon for a given period (10-20minutes) and then carry the leftovers. Most of these beardies never stop eating - they may end up being docile because of excess feeding.</li>
<li>Peel and chop all fruit meals that you feed your bearded dragon.</li>
<li>It is necessary to mix vegetable/fruits with insects when feeding your bearded dragon to improve the nutrition level.
Never feed your bearded dragon directly into its mouth (this may cause health complication or impaction). You should, therefore, place all the meals in a dish to allow self-feeding unless the beardie is sick and needs medical attention.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded dragon can eat either fruits (apple, grapes, berries), vegetables (cabbages, green beans, corianders) or animals such as crickets, roaches, silkworms and locust.
Avoid feeding your beardies with avocados, rhubarbs, spinach, onions or fireflies as they negatively affect their health. Mix plant diet with animal feed to improve the nutritional value.
You will also need to supplement meals with calcium and multi-vitamin powder to boost growth and immunity of your bearded dragon further. Importantly, do not overfeed your dragon as they end up being docile.</p>

But they&rsquo;ll also eat some fruit and vegetables. They related -

. Here are the insects that insect meat that the bearded dragons will eat.</p>
<ol>
<li>Phoenix worms</li>
<li>Mealworms</li>
<li>Waxworms</li>
<li>Crickets</li>
<li>Cockroaches</li>
<li>Butterworms</li>
<li>Earthworms</li>

However, only adult Bearded Dragons because of their exterior skin that&rsquo;s hard. Therefore, don&rsquo;t give the baby bearded dragons such as insect meat.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-include-extra-supplements-and-proteins">2. Include Extra Supplements and Proteins</h3>
<p>Besides the fruits and vegetables, I suggest you get some extra supplements (substrates) plus some proteins to spice up the bearded dragon&rsquo;s diet.
The diet can include feeding them a dragon with 2-3 meals daily plus some additional supplements and an extra meal or insect - these provide the critical proteins. Avoid lowing insects, including Lightning bugs, since they&rsquo;re toxic to your dragons.
I recommend you feed your dragon with just the gut-loaded insects, which points out that they&rsquo;ll provide a high level of nutrients.
Further, offer some Dubai

, earthworms, crickets besides spraying some calcium powder on the pet&rsquo;s food. You may add some meal-worms, wax-worms, and butter-worms for extra fat.

<h2 id="what-fruit-do-bearded-dragons-eat">What Fruit Do Bearded Dragons Eat?</h2>
<h3 id="1-strawberries">1. Strawberries?</h3>
<p>Strawberries are a favorite food for bearded dragons, but you must wash and cut them into small pieces before giving them to your beadier.
But, can bearded dragons eat strawberry seeds? Well, bearded dragons will eat the strawberry seeds since they&rsquo;re located outside the fruit - particularly on the achenes ovaries.
Strawberry seeds will provide the beardies with great nutrients but don&rsquo;t feed them excessively to your pet as it&rsquo;ll lead to stomach problems.

<h3 id="2-bananas">2. Bananas?</h3>
<p>Bearded dragons will eat bananas (phosphorus)- however - only be 1-2 times every 30 days. Excessive feeding with bananas may lead to sicknesses like Metabolic Bone disease due to calcium deficiency.
Bananas will contain the following nutrients Calcium (5 mg), Phosphorus (22 mg), Magnesium (27 mg), and Iron (0.3 mg) that&rsquo;ll be helpful to your Bearded dragons if fed in moderation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Melon</li>
<li>Figs</li>
<li>Apricots</li>
<li>Guava</li>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Plums</li>
<li>Pears</li>
<li>Peaches</li>
<li>Strawberries</li>
<li>Mango</li>
<li>Papaya</li>
<li>Grapes</li>
<li>Raisins</li>
<li>Kiwi</li>
<li>Apricots
However, you must be careful as you feed your bearded dragon with some of this soft fruit such as kiwi because they&rsquo;ll ferment due to their sugary nature� - which eventually causes teeth issues.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-vegetables-can-bearded-dragons-eat">What Vegetables Can Bearded Dragons Eat?</h2>
<p>The baby of bearded dragons won&rsquo;t feed on most of the vegetables out there. Mainly, baby beardies eat 20% vegetables + fruits and 80% insects.
Please don&rsquo;t feed the pet with pale vegetables such as celery or iceberg lettuce because they have limited nutrients.
Adult bearded dragons eat 80% vegetables + fruits and 20% insects - a total reverse of what the baby beardies eat. Bearded dragons eat many vegetables, including turnip greens, mustard, and collards.</p>
<ol>
<li>Parsnip</li>
<li>Ocra</li>
<li>Bok choi</li>
<li>Yellow squash</li>
<li>Acorn squash</li>
<li>Butternut squash</li>
<li>Bell pepper</li>
<li>Okra</li>
<li>Cabbage</li>
<li>Green beans</li>
<li>Sweet potato</li>
<li>Asparagus</li>
<li>Brocolli (small bits weekly)</li>
<li>Peas</li>
<li>Courgette</li>
<li>Kohlrabi</li>
<li>Celery
Don&rsquo;t feed the Bearded dragons with spinach - simply because these leafy vegetables will significantly bind their calcium, and thus the pet won&rsquo;t absorb them easily.
Bearded dragons will also eat leafy vegetables like kale, bell peppers, carrots, pumpkin, squash, cabbage, and cucumbers without their peel.</li>
<li>Rocket</li>
<li>Coriander</li>
<li>Mustard greens</li>
<li>Endive</li>
<li>Collards</li>
<li>Turnip greens</li>
<li>Clover</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
<li>Dandelion greens</li>
<li>Kale</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This food should include vegetables (cucumber, grapes, banana, grated carrots) and fruits (pears, blueberries, tomatoes), substrates, plus insects.</p>
