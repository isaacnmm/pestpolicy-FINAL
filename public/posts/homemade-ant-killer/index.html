<h3 id="1-boric-acid-and-peanut-butter-straws">1. Boric Acid and Peanut Butter Straws<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-boric-acid-and-peanut-butter-straws">¶</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>These are excellent homemade ant killers to eradicate ants without exposing your kids and pets to toxic substances.</dt>
<dt>Since the peanut butter and the moderately toxic</dt>
<dt>boric acid</dt>
<dt>are contained in the plastic straws, there are fewer chances of being ingested by kids and pets.</dt>
<dt>The bait does not leave a sticky mess on your floor or any surface it is left.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dt>:</dt>
<dt>Boric acid</dt>
<dt>and Peanut butter</dt>
<dt><em>Equipment</em></dt>
<dd>Plastic straws, Mixing bowl, Spoon or whisk, and a knife
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix 1 teaspoon of boric acid with one teaspoon of peanut butter in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Fill plastic straws with the paste.</li>
<li>Cut the straws into 2-inch pieces and place them in places most frequented by ants.</li>
<li>Ants will be attracted by the peanut butter and get killed by the boric acid. Ants are social creatures that love doing everything together.</li>
<li>So, they will take the pieces back to the colony, hence distributing the poison to more ants.

<h3 id="2-food-grade-diatomaceous-earth-ant-killer"><strong>2. Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth Ant killer</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-food-grade-diatomaceous-earth-ant-killer">¶</a></h3>
<p>Diatomaceous earth powder provides a non-toxic and inexpensive way to kill ants at home. DE powder is available from a local shop or online.
It contains sharp microscopic pieces that pierce into the insects exoskeleton.
Once inside the body, the pieces will dehydrate the insect to death. The powder is, however, not dangerous to humans and other animals.
<em>Requirements</em>
:
Diatomaceous earth
powder.
<strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Begin by accessing your house to locate the infested places, trails, and common entry points.</li>
<li>To use DE powder, spread a generous amount on groups of ants and create a barrier around them. Also, apply a thin layer along the trails.</li>
<li>Apply the powder on the floor, baseboards, windows, and any crack that you usually see ants coming out from. In very narrow spaces, you can dust the powder using a soft cloth or duster. Just dip the cloth in the powder and flick it over the cracks.</li>
<li>Check the area after one or two days for dead ants. If theres no more ant activity, you can clean the area andwash it with soap. This will clear the pheromones to prevent more ants from coming in.</li>
<li>If the ants migrate to other locations or create alternative tracks, reapply the DE powder on these surfaces.</li>
<li>For outdoor use, apply the DEpowder along the building&rsquo;sfoundation to kill ants at their entry points. Apply a generous amount at the most notorious entry points to kill as many ants as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3-sugary-baking-soda-ant-killer"><strong>3. Sugary Baking Soda Ant Killer</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-sugary-baking-soda-ant-killer">¶</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>If youre looking for a natural and non-toxic ant killer, then you can prepare one at home using baking soda.</dt>
<dt>Its a safe recipe to use inside the house. However, it can harm your pets if consumed in large amounts.</dt>
<dt>Ants may shy away from the baking soda. But the sugar in this recipe will attract them to the bait.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dd>Baking soda and Confectioners Sugar
<em>Equipment</em></dd>
<dd>Measuring spoon, Jar lids, and Mixing bowl
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix equal portions of baking soda and confectioners sugar in a mixing bowl. Confectioners&rsquo; sugar is used because ants cannot differentiate it from baking soda. If you use regular sugar, ants will eat sugar and leavebaking soda.</li>
<li>Put the mixture in several jar lids and place them in strategic places in the house. Place the bait at the cracks they use to access your house and common meeting points.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the bait in narrow cracks such as along the baseboard.</li>
<li>Wipe out the mess in your house after the ants have died.</li>
<li>For outdoor use, sprinkle the bait along the foundation of the house and entry points.</li>
<li>Also, treat the ant mounds and common nesting locations such as trees, woodpiles, and stone piles.</li>
<li>If you are worried about your pets ingesting the bait, it is a bottle and places it in strategic locations. Ants will climb into the bottle and consume the bait. Your pets cannot reach the bait.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-boric-acid-and-sugar-liquid-ant-trap">4. Boric Acid and Sugar Liquid Ant Trap<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-boric-acid-and-sugar-liquid-ant-trap">¶</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>Boric acid and sugar liquid is a tried and tested homemade recipe for use against sugar ants such as Pharoah ants, Argentine ants, and house ants.</dt>
<dt>Borax is a very effective insect killer</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>The goal here is to mix it with a substance that will attract sugar ants to the bait-I use sugar.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dd>Boric acid, Sugar, and Warm water
<em>Equipment</em></dd>
<dd>Mixing bowl
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix 30g of boric acid with about 250g of sugar in a mixing bowl. Your bowl should be large enough to hold water.</li>
<li>Add water while stirring to prevent the formation of lumps.</li>
<li>Stir until all the boric acid and sugar is dissolved into a thin paste</li>
<li>To lay your bait, find a suitable location, preferably an area where ants love to congregate.</li>
<li>Pour the paste into jar lids and distribute them around the area. Pour some baits on the surface near the jar lids to lure the ants into the bait stations.</li>
<li>Leave the bait undisturbed for a couple of days. Ants will eat the bait and take more to their nest. Keep on refilling the jar lids with the bait until you get satisfactory results.</li>
<li>Store the remaining bait in a labeled, airtight container away from the reach of kids and pets. Keep it in a cool dark place.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-vinegar-and-water-ant-spray"><strong>5. Vinegar and Water Ant Spray</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-vinegar-and-water-ant-spray">¶</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>Vinegar works in two ways against ants - a great homemade ant killer. When sprayed directly on the ants, it can kill them instantly.</dt>
<dt>You can also</dt>
<dt>spray on the bed bug trails</dt>
<dt>, entry points, and emerging points to deter them. Ants hate vinegar because it blocks their communication aids (pheromones).</dt>
<dt>This prevents ants inside the house from following the trail of others and deters new entries. Vinegar also discourages ants from your house by interfering with their ability to smell food.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dt>:</dt>
<dt>Apple vinegar</dt>
<dt>and Water</dt>
<dt><em>Equipment</em></dt>
<dd>Spray bottle
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix equal portions of cider vinegar and water in a spray bottle.</li>
<li>Shake the contents thoroughly until they mix properly</li>
<li>To use the solution, spray on ant trails. Usually, ants will follow the scents of others in the trail. Spraying along the trail will deter ants from following the path they have been using.</li>
<li>Spray the solution in areas where ants usually emerge out in large numbers, such as baseboards, cabinets, and windows. This will prevent the ants outside the house from picking up the scent.</li>
<li>For a large number of ants, you can saturate them withvinegar to killthem. Allow some time and come back to wipe the carcasses.</li>
<li>Apply the vinegar solution at least two times a week. For more effectiveness, you can increase the vinegar concentration.

<h3 id="6-borax-acid-and-corn-syrup-ant-trap"><strong>6. Borax Acid and Corn Syrup Ant Trap</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-borax-acid-and-corn-syrup-ant-trap">¶</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>Most of the household ants love to</dt>
<dt>eat sweet food</dt>
<dt>. They cant resist the corn syrup in this recipe. Its easy to make ant bait using simple over the counter ingredients.</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>
<dd>Boric acid and Corn syrup
<em>Equipment</em></dd>
<dd>Mixing bowl and Spoon or whisk
<strong>Directions</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix about one teaspoon of boric acid with three teaspoons of corn syrup in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Stir thoroughly to make a fine paste.</li>
<li>Place small bits of the paste on a waxed paper or card.</li>
<li>Place your bait in areas where ants like to congregate. The sweet substance is quite irresistible to these critters.</li>
<li>They will feast on it and take some back to their colony. Give the ants ample time to share the poison with the rest of the colony.</li>
<li>For more effectiveness, add fresh drops after every two days.</li>
<li>Store the remaining bait in an airtight container and at room temperature. Keep the substance out of reach of children and pets.</li>
</ol>

<li>To repel the ants, spray on surfaces mostly frequented by ants, such as windows, baseboards, and common entry points.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can soak a cotton ball in the solution and wipecommon hot spots. This will repel ants and prevent new ones from coming.</li>
<li>To kill ants, spray-on directly on them. For more effectiveness, use higher concentrations of the cinnamon solution.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="8-dish-soap-and-water-ant-spray"><strong>8. Dish Soap and Water Ant Spray</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-dish-soap-and-water-ant-spray">¶</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>A dish soap solution is another effective do-it-yourself</dt>
<dt>remedy for eradicating ants in your home</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>Its one of the safest methods to use indoors without worrying about your kids and pets. Ants use their joints for breathing. So, you can easily suffocate them to death with the dish soap solution.</dt>

<li>Use a towel to wipe out the residues from the surfaces.</li>
<li>You can also spray atcommon entry points to prevent ants from cominginto the house.</li>
<li>Keep your spray ready and use it to kill the ants you see crawling on your surfaces.

<dt>You dont have to worry about using chemicals to eradicate ants in your house. With simple over the counter ingredients, you can make an effective ant killer. You can use it indoors without worrying about your kids and pets. Plus, it smells nice!</dt>
<dt><em>Requirements</em></dt>

</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mix baking soda, dish soap, and apple cider vinegar in a spray bottle.</li>

<li>Wipe the surfaces with a towel.</li>
<li>Spray at the entry points to prevent ants from entering the house.</li>
<li>For outdoor use, spray the solution on areas where ants like to congregate and on plants. Use a small amount of the solution to test the effect of vinegar on your plants before spraying.</li>
