<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-sprayer-for-latex-paint/">latex paint sprayer</a>
is stored without cleaning, the paint dries and clogs the channels. Dried paint affects the performance of the paint sprayer and may even cause a complete breakdown if not removed. Could you be having similar problems?</p>
<p><em>Well, in this article, I will be discussing how to clean dried latex paint from a paint sprayer. To begin, select required tools and material, unscrew and dismantle the sprayer, carefully clean the filters and nozzle, and flush clean water through the sprayer to thin and quench dried paint.</em>
*Further, clean the tips, gun, and the hosepipe, prime the sprayer with water once more, clean inlet pick-up/strainer carefully, mop and rinse the sprayer to dryness, assemble the sprayer and store it in a cool dry place. *</p>

<h3 id="step-3-flush-clean-water-through-the-sprayer">Step 3: Flush Clean Water through the Sprayer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fill an empty bucket with clean water</li>
<li>Add a little detergent (thinner) and stir to foam sufficiently</li>
<li>Flush water through the sprayer to quench/cure dried latex paint</li>
<li>Dip the sprayer gun into the soap liquid and lift gently to run the liquid through the channels sufficiently</li>
<li>Leave the sprayer to cure for 20 minutes or otherwise advised by the manufacturer</li>
<li>Pour the soapy fluid to remove quenched latex paint and flush more soapy water
NB: The soapy water should be left within the sprayer channels to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-thin-latex-paint-for-hvlp/">quicken the thinning process</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-clean-the-tip-gun-and-hose">Step 4: Clean the Tip, Gun, and Hose</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dip spray tips and gun into soapy liquid and leave them for 20 minutes to thin sufficiently</li>
<li>Using asoft blister brush, clean the spray tip gently</li>
<li>Scrub the tip orifice to remove interior clogging and paint blockage. However, you must be careful not to expand the internal orifice diameter</li>
<li>Using the thread brush, clean the sprayer guns interior channel. Gently, unblock the quenched paint and flush water through the channel</li>
<li>Adjust the gun width and clean the interlocking selections too</li>
<li>Rinse the tips and gun, and place them somewhere to dry naturally</li>
<li>Dip the hosepipe in a soapy bucket and flush water through it to remove stuck paint</li>
<li>Rinse the hosepipe with clean water  you can connect the hosepipe to the water point if the diameter is compatible</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-5-prime-the-sprayer-with-water-thinner">Step 5: Prime the Sprayer with Water Thinner</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prime the sprayer parts with water once more to quench the dried paint that remained</li>
<li>Alternatively, use commercial water thinner for latex paint  add to clean water</li>
<li>Clean the canister and paint cup with a soft paintbrush  scrub gently</li>
<li>Finally, rinse the parts with clean water</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-6-clean-inlet-pick-upstrainer">Step 6: Clean Inlet Pick-up/Strainer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using clean soapy water, thin the inlet strainer</li>
<li>Wash the inlet strainer with a sponge or a soft paintbrush</li>
<li>Remove stuck debris and blocked paint stain</li>
<li>You can choose to remove the strainer and clean it separately if possible</li>
<li>Rinse the inlet strainer with clean water and leave it to dry</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-7-wipe-and-rinse-the-sprayer-to-dryness">Step 7: Wipe and Rinse the Sprayer to Dryness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using a piece of cloth, wash the external spray parts</li>

<h2 id="problems-of-using-uncleaned-paint-sprayer">Problems of Using Uncleaned Paint Sprayer</h2>
<p>Its not advisable to use a paint sprayer that is not previously cleaned as it may lead to some of the following problems:</p>
<h3 id="1-low-quality-paint-finish">1. Low-Quality Paint Finish</h3>
<p>Uncleaned paint sprayer delivers low-quality finish coat  the paint stickiness is affected by internal blockage or narrowing of sprayers tips by the dried latex paint.
Moreover, the paint is incompletely atomized and ends up forming an uneven paint layer.�Clogged paint sprayer impends the paint flowability and causes internal strain that affects final paint delivery.</p>

<h3 id="2-incomplete-atomization">2. Incomplete Atomization</h3>
<p>Incomplete atomization is caused by the clogging of the sprayers channels or the narrowing of the nozzle or spray tips. The paint molecules fail to attain atomization point thus leading to raw paint coating during paint spraying.
Internally dried paint impends paint flow and blocks atomized paint from reaching the surface under paint application  the paint gets stuck at the tip thus blocking the entire flow.</p>
<h3 id="3-internal-cloggingblockage">3. Internal Clogging/Blockage</h3>
<p>Dried paint blocks and clogs the intake pipe, gun, and flow channel. The subsequent spray application is highly affected and the gun performance is lower. Internal paint strain causes paint gun fatigue and may cause trigger breakdown.
Moreover, dried paint impends paint flowability from the canister to the gun channel. Indeed, self-thinning of paint under application is inhibited thus affecting the quality of the finish layer. Importantly, dried paint affects spray tip diameter due to excess abrasive forces from solid paint.</p>
<h3 id="4-reduced-sprayers-service-life">4. Reduced Sprayers Service life</h3>
<p>Dried paint causes internal blockage and channel clogging, which leads to sprayer fatigue during paint application.
The paint gun wears due to excess abrasive force and filter tear often thus reducing the entire service life.�The inlet strainer is also clogged by dried paint limiting paint intake and overall performance.</p>

<h3 id="5-nozzle-or-tip-damage">5. Nozzle or tip Damage</h3>
<p>The sprayers nozzle is blocked by dried paint while the tip is often eroded by the solid paint particle as forced spray painting is undertaken  increased tip diameter leads to surface overspray.
In addition, continuous strained spray application damages the nozzle and wears the tips O-ring, which kills the sprayers overall performance.</p>
<h3 id="6-frequent-repair-and-high-maintenance-cost">6. Frequent Repair and �High Maintenance Cost</h3>
<p>With internal blockage and channel clogging, some sprayer parts like filters and tips fail too. Repair and part replacement are done frequently, which raises maintenance costs.
Moreover, metallic spray guns may rust and fail eventually due to continuous internal fatigue initiated by internal paint strains. Importantly, the running cost of the sprayer increases with time due to high energy uptake.</p>

<h2 id="precautions-when-cleaning-dried-latex-paint-for-paint-sprayer">Precautions When Cleaning Dried Latex Paint for Paint Sprayer</h2>
<p>When cleaning dried latex paint from a paint sprayer, stick to the following precautions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never remove dried paint from your paint sprayer before thinning is done</li>
<li>Always dismantle the paint sprayer when cleaning</li>
<li>Never assemble your paint sprayer before its dried to touch</li>
<li>When dismantling your paint sprayer, always follow the manufacturers instruction</li>
<li>Be careful when handling/cleaning the filters and tips to prevent damage</li>
<li>In case you are new to paint sprayers, contract a professional sprayer cleaner to help you in the quality cleaning process.</li>
<li>During the cleaning process, always wear protective gear for your own personal protection</li>
<li>Avoid storing your paint sprayer in a dusty environment  dust accelerates aging and reduces overall performance.</li>
<li>Importantly, thin dried latex paint sufficiently before you commence the cleaning process and use a soft blister brush for scrubbing.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on how to clean dried latex paint from a paint sprayer, you begin by selecting the required tools and material, unscrew and dismantle the sprayer, carefully clean the filters and nozzle, and flush clean water through the sprayer to thin and quench dried paint.
Besides, clean the tips, gun, and the hosepipe, prime the sprayer with water once more, clean the inlet pick-up/strainer carefully, mop and rinse the sprayer to dryness, assemble the sprayer and store it in a cool dry place.
Its advisable to put on protective gear (for personal protection) when cleaning latex paint and observe precautions given while handling the paint sprayer to prevent any damage. If you are new to a paint sprayer, contract a professional to help you in cleaning.</p>
