As a trusted car wash soap, Meguiar&rsquo;s G7101FFP will remove all kinds of dirt and grime from your car.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike detergents, this formulation works by foaming and lubricating surfaces to get rid of dirt.</li>
<li>That means it wont wash off the protective covering on your cars body.
It foams in a short time, causing the dirt, grease, and grime to glide over the surface for easy rinsing. It contains both washing and conditioning properties, which maintains the brilliance of your cars paint.
Meguiar&rsquo;s G7101FFP comes with a balanced PH and does not exhibit detergent properties. This allows you to wash your car without stripping the wax or affecting the polish.</li>
<li>Its quick drying time wont leave streaks that disfigure your cars body finish.</li>
<li>With its strong concentration, you only need 1-2 cups of soap per gallon of water.
That means one gallon will keep your car clean for several days. If you have clogged drains,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">check these drain openers</a>

For better results, the manufacturer recommends using the soap together with the Grift Guard, separately.
You use two buckets where one bucket contains the soap while the other contains water for rinsing. This protects your paint from possible swirls.

<p>Cleaning is part of car maintenance in addition to other routines like changing oil, replacing filters, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>But in order to get the best car cleaning results, you need to have the right kind of car wash soap.</li>
<li>Dish soaps are not recommended for a car wash because they tend to strip off the wax finish and paint on your car.
Below, Ive provided you with a guide for choosing the best car wash soap.
<strong>Foaming</strong>
Plenty of suds or foams help in lifting dirt to separate it from the car surface. It also lubricates the dirt and surface, making it possible to flow away from the rinsing surface.</li>
<li>This is an important consideration because it reduces or eliminates the need for scrubbing, which may leave your paint surface with scratches.
However, some stains like bird droppings tend to stick on the surfaces and may not be removed without scrubbing.
<strong>PH Level</strong>
The sealants and paint finish on your car cannot withstand
<a href="https://www.lenosgarage.com/blogs/auto-detailing/4-things-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-car-wash-soap">high PH levels</a>
.</li>
<li>High PH soap solutions tend to strip the layer of paint and wax finish making your car lose its original shiny appearance.</li>
<li>Luckily, therere products with a balanced or neutral PH that will not strip the finish coat in your car.
The high PH in most dish soaps makes them unsuitable for cleaning cars.
They are associated with stripping the protective coat and decreasing the durability of the paint.
Also, your skin might be affected by high PH in some car soaps. Therefore, its advisable to get a product with a balanced or neutral PH.
<strong>Finish</strong>
You want your car to retain its original shiny appearance or even become better.</li>
<li>Some car wash soaps are formulated with ingredients that enhance the paint finish after washing.</li>
<li>Shun any product that will make your car look dull than before.
Apart from cleaning, a good product should also leave the paint finish on your car free from streaks or water spots.
<strong>Value For Money</strong>
This will be determined by the concentration rather than the quantity of the product.</li>
<li>The higher the concentration, the little the amount you need per wash.
Thus, a highly concentrated car wash soap will give you several washes before buying another one.
<strong>Safety</strong>
Your product of choice should not contain harsh ingredients that might affect you or damage your car&rsquo;s paint.
