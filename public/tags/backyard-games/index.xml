<p>The <a href="/posts/best-acoustic-guitar-for-small-hands/">best</a> and highly recommended way to attract wild birds into your backyard is to install a <a href="/posts/how-to-make-a-suet-bird-feeder/">bird</a> feeder and fill it up with birdseed.</p>
<p>However, you dont need to have a bird feeder to attract the birds. You can just use a dish or scatter the food on the ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most wild birds are enticed with food and water, so it doesnt really matter where you place the food. Read this<a href="https://birdfeederhub.com/how-to-attract-birds-without-a-feeder/">article</a>on how to attract wild birds without a feeder.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="3-choose-local-native-plants">3. Choose Local Native Plants</h3>
<p>Using local native plants is an excellent bird-friendly backyard idea that will help attract a wide variety of birds. These birds are already familiar with these plants and they recognize them as rich food sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, landscaping for birds requires local trees, flowers, grasses, and shrubs.</li>
<li>Native plants also provide a wide range of bird food all year round. They cater to all birds including nesting, wintering, and migrating birds.</li>

<h3 id="4-layered-vegetation">4. Layered Vegetation</h3>
<p>A Layered Vegetation will provide the bird-friendly garden youve always wanted. Ensure that your backyard has a variety of plant layers that will help attract different types of birds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Naturally, the habitat is full of different bird species and each bird species may have or choose its favorite place. Therefore, if you provide variety in terms of vegetation in your backyard, youre likely to attract different types of birds.</li>
<li>Some birds prefer to nest in bushes; others love tall trees, while others love scavenging for food on the ground.</li>
<li>Therefore, its important that you select different plants with different heights and ensure that they are well spaced. You can plant low flowers, tall grasses, taller shrubs, or any other native plant that you like.

</ul>
<h3 id="5-consider-hummingbirds">5. Consider Hummingbirds</h3>
<p>If your area has Hummingbirds, you may want to attract them into your backyard. Hummingbirds are attractive; they will make your backyard look great.</p>
<p>Therefore, consider growing plants that will attract them. Its wise to first check whether the plants are native or ideal to your region. Do your research and due diligence before growing plants to attract Hummingbirds.</p>

<li>spotted jewelweed</li>
<li>Rhododendron</li>
<li>salmonberry</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-reduce-empty-spaces">6. Reduce Empty Spaces</h3>
<p>Empty lawn spaces will not attract any birds. As Ive mentioned above, most wild birds prefer layered vegetation and a place with lots of flowers, trees, shrubs, and grasses.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to achieve a bird-friendly backyard youll need to do the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant additional trees on those empty spaces</li>
<li>Enlarge the flowerbeds</li>
<li>Ensure your backyard has massive flowers and vegetation</li>
<li>Increase the size of the garden</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-provide-adequate-shelter">7. Provide Adequate Shelter</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can provide shelter by growing dense plants or dense vegetation that will help shield the birds from predators like cats, hawks, and others.
The dense vegetation will also provide a suitable place for birds to settle and nest. This means they will have a permanent residence in your backyard. They won&rsquo;t need to move as your backyard caters to all their basic needs including water, food, and shelter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-grow-plants-with-flowers-seeds-or-berries">8. Grow Plants with Flowers, Seeds, or Berries</h3>

Berry bushes also provide a reliable food source for the birds. Examples of plants that you can grow in a bird-friendly garden include wild roses, Oregon grape, blueberries, and cherries among many others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-use-organic-fertilizers">9. Use Organic Fertilizers</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="10-designate-you-backyard-accordingly">10. Designate You Backyard Accordingly</h3>
<p>Another Bird-friendly backyard idea worth considering is the importance of designating the spaces where birds and people will occupy. Therefore, you need to divide the yard in a way that both birds and people have their specific spots.</p>
<p>An area with a lot of activities, especially where your family plays
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-play-tetherball/">backyard games</a>
might not be the ideal spot for attracting birds.</p>
<p>Birds are shy and they tend to take off immediately they notice any movements or activity. Hence, its wise to set aside a specific portion of the backyard for birds only.</p>
<h3 id="11-keep-cats-indoors">11. Keep Cats Indoors</h3>
<p>Cats are a great threat to birds. Domestic cats have killed most birds. In the United States, for example,
<a href="https://abcbirds.org/program/cats-indoors/cats-and-birds/#:~:text=Predation%20by%20domestic%20cats%20is,of%20millions%20of%20outdoor%20cats.">cats kill about 2.4 billion birds every year</a>
.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you wish to attain a bird-friendly backyard, your cats should remain indoors. You can even talk to your neighbors and encourage them to keep their cats indoors.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<h2 id="steps-to-building-a-barrel-train">Steps to Building A Barrel Train</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-gather-everything-you-need-for-the-project">Step 1: Gather Everything You Need For the Project</h3>
<p>Youll need the following to start off</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2H5GVX/?tag=p-policy-20">55-gallon HDPE barrel</a></li>

<p>Barrels are usually white or blue in color. You may opt to paint them your favorite color or let them retain their original paint.</p>
<p>If youve decided on a different color, you can use spray paint and do several coats to attain the best look.</p>
<p>Allow the barrels to dry properly.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-cut-the-barrels">Step 3: Cut the Barrels</h3>
<p>Flip the barrels to the side and cut the top according to your preference. Ensure the openings are large enough to accommodate both adults and children for uninterrupted and fun-filled family time.</p>

provides helpful information on the successful completion of the barrels train.</p>
<p>Watch this video on how to cut and build a simple barrel train</p>
<h3 id="step-4-building-frames">Step 4 Building Frames</h3>
<p>To prevent the sharp edges at the top from hurting the users, its good to create rectangular frames. You can attach these frames on top of the cut barrels.</p>
<p>The size of your barrel will determine the actual measurements of the frame. Ensure that the frame you create fits properly on the barrel.</p>
<p>Next, cut and weld two &ldquo;V&rdquo; shapes using the steel rods. Attach the cut rods on the frame opposite the hitch. Weld the hollow circular rod into the &ldquo;V&rdquo; shapes.</p>
<p>Next, youll need to fasten the barrel onto the frame. Thus, drill holes through the frame into the barrel and insert bolt and nuts then fasten them.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-insert-wheels">Step 5 Insert Wheels</h3>
<p>Once youre through with constructing the frames, it&rsquo;s time to include the wheels.</p>
<p>I will encourage you to refer to this
<a href="https://howtoadult.com/trailer-plastic-barrels-4709116.html">website</a></p>
<ul>
<li>howtoadult.com for more detailed information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, insert your wheel axel or steel dowel through the circular steel rod. Attach the wheels.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-construct-seats-optional">Step 6: Construct Seats (Optional)</h3>
<p>You can opt to build seats for each barrel/cart. Although its an optional step, you can still put the seats for added comfort.</p>
<p>You can also include safety seat belts to keep the little ones safe while riding.</p>
<p>The seats dont have to be expensive. You can simply cut a fitting board and insert it inside the barrel. Add a cushion on top to enhance comfort.</p>
<p>You can add two seats or just one depending on the number of users that would ride on the backyard train.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-attach-the-carts">Step 7 Attach the Carts</h3>
<p>Weld the flat steel tongue onto the frame, then drill holes. Drill corresponding holes through the carts hitches and connect the frame with the cart.</p>
<p>Use a bolt to fasten them together nicely.</p>
<p>Next, you can attach the Golf Cart, ATV, or UTV for pulling the cart.</p>
