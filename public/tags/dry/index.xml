<h2 id="process-of-cleaning-various-sections-of-paint-stained-carpet">Process of Cleaning Various Sections of Paint Stained Carpet</h2>
<p>The process of cleaning the carpet may differ with the extent to which the paint stain is spread.
In this regards, you can use either of the following options when cleaning your paint-stained carpet:</p>
<h3 id="1-spot-cleaning">1. Spot Cleaning</h3>
<p>The spot cleaning method is used when removing a small paint stain that has dried over the carpet  the removal process intends to clean only the stained section and prevents adjacent areas from further paint staining or cleaning effect.
Fill the cleaning solvent in a spray bottle and rinse over the stained section  be careful not to overspray the adjacent area. Leave the stain remover to act (for the time stipulated by the manufacturer) and blot the section gently.
Avoid rubbing the section when cleaning (you may push the cured paint into the carpet). When carrying out spot cleaning, consider option factors such as the solvent concentration, the type of paint stain (is it oil-based or water-based?), and the stain duration.
NB: Its not advisable to rub or scratch dried spot stain  may lead to carpet damage.</p>
<h3 id="2-full-carpet-cleaningstripping">2. Full Carpet Cleaning/Stripping</h3>
<p>Dried paint stripping (from the carpet) is an approach undertaken when cleaning large paint stains or overspread spot stains.
During the paint removal process, you will need to soak the entire carpet in paint removal solvent. Leave the carpet to cure within the time directed by the manufacturer.
Alternatively, you can spread the carpet in an open place before applying stain remover sufficiently. Further, clean the cured carpet using a vacuum cleaner or a washing machine with soapy detergent.
You can also opt to scrub the cured carpet (manually) with a brush until the entire paint is removed. Soft blister brush does an incredible job when cleaning  prevents carpet damage.</p>
