      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you wondering which trampoline size would be perfect for you? Well, to make it a bit easier, I will look at 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline.</p>
<p>When deciding on the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-long-trampolines-for-gymnastics/">ideal trampoline shape</a>
, its crucial that you consider the available space in your backyard, the age of the user, and the purpose of the trampoline.</p>
<p>For example, the 14 ft. trampoline is a perfect choice for gymnastics, while the 12 ft. trampoline is ideal for normal bouncing or play.�Hence, check out my detailed analysis of 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline and decide on the best trampoline size for your backyard.</p>
<h2 id="12-ft-vs-14-ft-trampoline--differences">12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline- Differences</h2>
<h3 id="1-12-ft-vs-14-ft-trampoline-jumping-mat">1. 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline Jumping Mat</h3>
<p>Let us look at the jumping mats for both 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline. The 14 ft. trampoline has a jumping mat of about 148 inches in diameter. This diameter provides a bigger jumping surface to do flips and twirls.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the 12ft trampoline has a Jumping Mat diameter of about 125 inches.</p>
<p>However, weight restrictions may limit the number of people that jump on the large mat. Nevertheless, the big diameter mat provides enough space for two or more people to jump without colliding.�Therefore, the 14ft trampoline is better in terms of jumping space than the 12ft trampoline.</p>
<p>The larger jumping mat will provide ample space for your young gymnasts to perfect their tricks, twirls, and turns. Therefore, the 14-foot trampoline is a safe option for anyone who is into gymnastics.</p>
<p>The 12ft trampoline has a small jumping mat that might not be ideal for gymnasts. For your gymnastic exercises, youll need a spacious jumping area.</p>
<h3 id="2-12-ft-vs-14-ft-trampoline-weight-limit">2. 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline Weight Limit</h3>
<p>The 14ft trampoline will support a higher weight limit compared to the 12ft trampoline. This is because the 14ft trampoline is spacious, designed for a higher weight limit, and has more springs.</p>
<p>However, its important that you check the manufacturers recommended weight limit and see if it fits your situation. Each brand has its own criteria for weight limits. Check the recommendation first before making a purchase.</p>
<p>The 12ft trampoline has a weight limit of about 250 to 300lbs while the 14ft trampoline has a weight limit of 250 to 350lbs. The 15ft and 16ft trampolines can hold 250 to 450lbs.</p>
<h3 id="3-12-ft-vs-14-ft-users-age">3. 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Users Age</h3>
<p>Another crucial difference between the 12 ft. vs-14 ft. trampoline is the recommended users age. The 12ft trampoline is ideal for young children. This trampoline doesnt allow the child to bounce higher, hence its ideal for his/her safety.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the 14ft trampoline would be ideal for teenagers, youths, and adults. The large jumping mat will allow more than one person at a go. It will also encourage an upcoming gymnast to perfect his/her skills.</p>
<h3 id="4-12-ft-vs-14-ft-springs">4. 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Springs</h3>
<p>The 12 ft. vs-14 ft. trampoline may have a different number of springs depending on the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers will have the same number of springs in both the 12 ft. and 14 ft trampolines. While others will put more springs on the 14 ft. trampoline. Make sure you confirm the number of springs before making your purchase.</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher the number of springs in a trampoline the better and higher the bounce. Therefore, if youre looking for quality and higher bounces, youll want to choose a brand that includes more springs in their<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/small-trampoline-for-toddlers/">trampoline</a>.
However, if young children or toddlers are involved, you might want to choose a trampoline with fewer springs, hence, a lower bounce for their safety. Depending on the manufacturer, the 12ft would be ideal for children.</li>
</ul>
