<p>A tactical knife will be an excellent self-defense weapon for you at the home, office, or outdoors.
First, according to a Police-Policy Council
<a href="http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Tueller/How.Close.htm">Study</a>
, a tactical knife will be highly helpful than a gun when your target is within 20 feet from you.</p>
<p>In the current time, when most have adopted a more minimalistic life, I am sure youll love a weapon (the tactical knife) that serves more than one purpose in your outdoor activities.</p>
<p>So what should you consider in a tactical knife?�Well, like any other weapon, your tactical knife must be strong and have an appropriate length.</p>
<p>This will prevent the tactical knife from breaking while in use, which could expose you to danger from the attacker at the most critical time.</p>
<p>Also, the tactical knife should have the appropriate size to allow easy concealing as you move around in the outdoor or indoor space.</p>
<p>For example, using a knife would require that you get close to your attacker. But, sometimes, you might want to attack from a distance to minimize the possibility of the attacker getting close and personal to you.</p>
<p>In such cases, a reciprocating saw, pepper spray, batons, or sword walking sticks can help you protect yourself in case of a home invasion.</p>

<p>The C in the Taser X26C stands for the CIVILIAN version of the police or law enforcement equivalent device.
The key difference between the two Tasers is that with the law enforcement device, one can only pull its trigger once and goes for about 5 seconds.</p>
<p>However, with the civilian version of the Taser, one can pull the trigger thrice and can go for about 30 seconds, and thus you can take a more extended tease on your attacker.</p>
<p>The Taser is a long-range self-defense device that is used for long-range, about 12 feet, protection.</p>
<p>Due to the distance, it allows you from your attacker; the Taser is considered a highly effective self-defense mechanism.</p>
<p>It works by firing two darts that are attached to the 15 feet wiring propelled from its cartridge, and that affixes itself to the attackers skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>It sends a 30-second energy surge that affects the assailants nervous system and disrupts the brain muscle coordination.</li>
<li>The attacker will fall, but if this fails, you can still use the Taser as a stun gun until you hit your attacker appropriately.
Also, the tool uses a digital power magazine with a screen that shows the energy usage and will compute the remaining power life for the loaded magazine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Taser also has a timer that will alert you when to fire, mainly when its cartridge is present.</p>
<p>Further, you can purchase an extended battery that will enhance more grip and allow you to store an extra cartridge at the bottom that will be easily accessible while dealing with your attacker.</p>
