<h3 id="1-power-output">1. Power output<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-power-output">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is an important consideration if you are planning to work on rocky soil. Gasoline powered engines are more ideal for rocky terrain. In addition, the serviceability and reliability of the engine and availability of spare parts are important considerations for rocky soil pole diggers.
More importantly, the engine power output should match the auger specifications. A unit with an engine capacity of 40-50cc can be fitted with an auger of 12 whereas an auger bit of 14 is considered ideal for 150-200cc engine capacity.</p>
<h3 id="2-auger-bits">2. Auger bits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-auger-bits">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is the part that makes contact with the ground and hence it needs to be of the best quality to ensure it does not break or wear down easily. Although many auger bits are interchangeable, it is imperative to stick to known brand names. For gas-powered pole hole diggers, the diameter of drill is an important consideration in determining the hole size.</p>
<h3 id="3-weight-and-materials">3. Weight and Materials<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-weight-and-materials">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although most pole hole diggers are designed for heavy-duty work, they are lightweight in nature which eases and maneuverability around the work area. Consider also the material used to make the motor and the

.
Although most models are designed to be operated single-handed, more than a person may be required to operate the machine in rough terrains.</p>
<h3 id="4-handles">4. Handles<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-handles">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since automatic pole diggers are powerful enough to vibrate during usage, one of the most important features is padded and ergonomic handles. This feature also provides the user with a firm grip during usage, particularly during prolonged working periods.</p>
<h3 id="5-lawn-size">5. Lawn size<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-lawn-size">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is an important consideration in choosing between an automatic and manual pole hole digger.
A manual auger would not be ideal for larger lawns because it would both be cumbersome and time-consuming. The automatic option is considered ideal for lawns ranging from 10000-25000 square feet.</p>
<h3 id="6-budgetary-constraints">6. Budgetary constraints<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-budgetary-constraints">¶</a></h3>
<p>The best pole digger should provide value for money for the end-user. Gardeners might want to go for low priced manual pole diggers if they are dealing with smaller lawns. Nevertheless, the best auger pole diggers fall in the $100 range.</p>
<h3 id="7-utility">7. Utility<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#7-utility">¶</a></h3>
<p>During late summer and early spring, the ground becomes firm and needs to be aired out. For occasional hole digging, the manual pole digger is considered more ideal.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>The choice of the best pole digger for rocky soil depends on several factors. The GOplus 1200W pole hole digger distinguishes itself as the ideal choice for both small and medium scale tasks.
In addition to its highly efficient and environmentally friendly engine, the versatile nature of this pole digger makes it an ideal choice for both professional amateur users.</p>
