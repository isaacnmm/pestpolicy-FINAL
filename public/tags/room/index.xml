<h2 id="details-how-to-prep-a-room-for-paint-effectively">Details: How to Prep a Room for Paint Effectively</h2>
<h3 id="a-materials-and-tool-selection">a. Materials and Tool Selection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Putty knife or paint scraper  for stripping</li>
<li>Asanderand a vacuum cleaner</li>
<li>A piece of cloth and clean water</li>
<li>Partying compound and surface cover</li>
<li>Fine grade sandpaper and paintbrush</li>
<li>Polishing machine and thinner</li>
<li>Protective gear  gloves, respirator, dustcoat, boots,goggles, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-clean-the-room">b. Clean the Room</h3>
<p>Clean the walls, floor, and ceiling to remove surface dust or debris that may have settled previously.
To do this, you can opt to sweep using a broom or run a vacuum cleaner over the surface.
Cleaning is crucial as it helps identify sections that need stripping, sanding, or polishing without much straining.
Moreover, surface cleaning opens pores or surface holes sealed by the dust particles or debris.

<h3 id="c-strip-old-paint">c. Strip Old Paint</h3>
<p>Old paint should be stripped entirely to create a smooth paint contact surface  boosts surface stickiness ability.
When stripping, its advisable to thin the walls/ceiling sufficiently to break paint molecular bond and hence ease the removal process
the paint thinner
should match the applied old paint (oil-based thinner should be used over oil-based paint and vice versa)
Gently, strip the paint layer using a putty knife/
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toughest-Tools-Paint-Scraper-Remover/dp/B07XVBW45J/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=paint+scraper&amp;qid=1610135050&amp;sr=8-5">a paint</a>
scraper, � be keen when running the scraper over the old paint to protect primary surface material from damage.
Repeat the procedure until the entire paint is removed  there should be minimal old paint traces on the surface.</p>
<h3 id="d-sand-the-ceilingwalls">d. Sand the Ceiling/Walls</h3>
<p>Using medium grade sandpaper, sand the paint stripped surface gently (prevents structural damage) to remove old paint remnants.
For vertical wall, run the sandpaper up and down and then back and forth horizontally  this motion reduces surface grain damage, affecting the paint surface finish.
In the case of a wood reinforced room, consider running the sandpaper along the grain material direction.
Alternatively, pass a sander or a polishing machine over the wall surface  avoid over pressing, which may damage grain structure or the primary material.
Continue sanding until the traces of old paint are entirely removed. Notably, when using a sander, follow the manufacturers user guide. See Also:

<h3 id="e-dust-and-wash-the-wall">e. Dust and Wash the Wall</h3>
<p>Sweep the dust or vacuum the sanded walls/ceiling using a vacuum cleaner.
Then, wash/mop the surface with a wet clean piece of cloth to remove any dust or surface debris that may be left behind.
Besides, let the wet wall/ceiling remain for some time to attain complete dryness before carrying out the next step.</p>
<h3 id="f-sealrepair-the-damaged-ceilingwalls">f. Seal/Repair the Damaged Ceiling/Walls</h3>
<p>Seal the porous surface holes using putty or parting compounds. Repair the damaged sections and ensure that the entire surface is completely sealed.
Avoid using excess filler material, which may be cumbersome to remove during the final polishing process.</p>
<h3 id="g-polish-the-walls-and-ceiling">g. Polish the Walls and Ceiling</h3>
<p>Using a polishing machine, smoothly run it over the repaired sections and sealed areas to attain an even and smooth final surface finish.
The polishing machine should run at a low RPM (speed) to protect the surface from further damage. Finally, mop the polished sections and leave them to dry completely.
When selecting a polishing machine, match it with surface material under preparation  purchase a wood polishing machine for interior wood reinforced walls/ceiling or a concrete polishing machine for concrete walls/ceiling.</p>

<h3 id="h-protect-floorfixture-from-paint-staining">h. Protect Floor/Fixture from Paint Staining</h3>
<p>Before actual priming or painting is carried out, cover the floor (with polyethene paper) to protect it from stained.
Fixtures such as curtain rails, stair rail, and fixed furniture should also be covered to prevent them from paint staining.
You may need to remove furniture, picture frames, and other removable items far before you even start room preparation  you protect them from staining and getting dirty.
NB: Areas that are not meant for prepping should be covered sufficiently.</p>
<h2 id="which-problems-occur-if-you-paint-room-without-prepping">Which Problems Occur if you Paint Room without Prepping?</h2>
<h3 id="1-low-stickiness-ability">1. Low Stickiness ability</h3>
<p>Wall/ceiling surface preparation eliminates the roughness and debris, which impend and weakens paint stickiness ability upon application.
The paint action formulation is inhibited from penetrating through the primary material surface, leading to weak adhesive force on the surface contact.
Further, the dust that sticks on the walls/ceiling creates an internal layer that initiates scuffing with time.</p>
<h3 id="2-excess-drains-and-runs">2. Excess Drains and Runs</h3>
<p>The presence of dust and surface debris leads to paint drains/runs, especially when using a paintbrush or a roller. Usually, the dust or debris repels the paint solvent upon contact leading to surface runs.
Rugged wall/ceiling surface also offers a channel through which the paint molecules form runs/drains upon application.
Moreover, the ceiling&rsquo;s low stickiness action leads to unnecessary dripping, which may stain the floor if not attended to. See Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-remove-latex-paint-from-concrete/">Removing Latex Paint from Concrete</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="3-initiates-peeling-and-chipping">3. Initiates Peeling and Chipping</h3>
<p>Peeling is a problem that occurs when the paint layer detaches from the surface due to low stickiness action beneath it.
The painted surface may peel slightly or fully as per the level of the adhesive bond. Surfaces that are not prepped are highly prone to peeling action than prepped ones.
On the other hand, chipping results from point paint weakness beneath the paint layer, which dislodge in particle form.
Moisture content embedded within walls or ceiling (which is not prepped) accelerates chipping action. It kills the paint chemical action formula to remain stuck on the surface for a longer period.
Upon prepping, walls and ceiling should be dried completely (before painting) to improve stickiness action and eliminate peeling/chipping chances.</p>
<h3 id="4-forms-uneven-surface-finish-and-streaks">4. Forms Uneven Surface Finish and Streaks</h3>
<p>Room walls and ceilings that are not prepped usually have a rough surface  contain valleys and ridges.
Direct paint application without prepping (in a room) leads to uneven surface finish.
Moreover, using a roller on such surfaces may lead to streaks, which are difficult to correct once dried  streaks destroy the overall outlook impression.
Upon sanding and polishing walls/ceiling, the roughness/ unevenness on the surface is eliminated. Therefore, the paint coat forms a uniform/even layer, which is finely finished and attractive.
Remember, cleaning the polished surfaces is paramount before the actual paint application to improve overall surface stickiness.</p>
<h3 id="5-forms-a-non-uniform-finish-appearance">5. Forms a Non-Uniform Finish Appearance</h3>
<p>The finish impression is affected by the level of wall/ceiling prepping carried out.
Insufficient prep action leads to unmatched colour fading within the paint-coated room  some areas appear densely coloured than others.
Non-uniform finish appearance is more pronounced when you repaint a room, which is not prepped  the faded colour appears brighter than the original dull colour upon drying.
Prepping a room for paint creates a uniform surface, which leaves a uniform and stains free surface upon paint application.</p>

<h2 id="importance-of-priming-room-before-actual-painting">Importance of Priming Room before Actual Painting</h2>
<p>Its recommended to prime your room before actual paint for some of the following reasons:
<strong>1. Improves Secondary Paint coat stickiness</strong>
The primer provides surface contact over which the secondary coat layer is going to be applied.
The primer solvent helps seal the porous surface and holes, leaving an even finish, which boosts paint adhesive force.
The unprimed surface has low stickiness action and allows the formation of drains/runs, especially when applying paint with a paintbrush.
<strong>2. Reduces Repainting costs</strong>
The primed surface requires a few paint layers to achieve the best final finish.
Unlike the unprimed surface, primed walls/ceiling are not readily susceptible to peeling, scuffing, and chipping action, which calls for frequent repainting.
Besides, the primed room resists scratches and surface damage that may affect the primary wall material.
Fading is less pronounced on a primed wall surface as compared to an unprimed one.
<strong>3. Boosts overall service life and outlook</strong>
Primed room boost paint stickiness and hence the overall service life (before damage) is improved.
Moreover, the appearance of a primed wall/ceiling is stunning and attractive compared to an unprimed one.
Indeed, when painting a primed wall, you can achieve a smooth surface finish quickly than an unprimed surface.</p>

<h2 id="precautions-and-safety-measures-to-consider-when-prepping-room-for-paint">Precautions and Safety Measures to Consider When Prepping Room for Paint</h2>
<p>During room prepping activity, its necessary to adhere to the following precautions and safety measure to eliminate any accidents or health hazards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always put on protective gear (goggles, facemask, gloves, dustcoat, boots, and respirator) when prepping your room for paint.</li>
<li>Gently sand the wall surface with a sander or sandpaper to avoid dislodging/damaging surface material.</li>
<li>Mop the polished walls/ceiling with a clean piece of cloth and water to remove dust and surface debris, which lower surface stickiness action.</li>
<li>Cover the floor and other fixtures during the prepping action to protect them from being damaged or getting stained.</li>
<li>The mopped section should be dried completely before paint application is made to avoid chipping or peeling occurrence.</li>
<li>Strip old paint before sanding/polishing to prevent surface damage/boost stickiness ability upon paint application.</li>
<li>The cleaned surface waste and debris material should be swept and disposed of appropriately - in a dustbin or garbage pit.</li>
<li>Consider thinning old paint before stripping to weaken the paint bonds and reduce surface damage when stripping.</li>
<li>Prime newly constructed room to improve paint stickiness and eliminate drains.</li>
<li>Fill the damaged walls/ceiling surface with parting compound and gently polish before actual painting is carried out.</li>
<li>Always match the selected tool with the room&rsquo;s primary surface material when prepping to avoid chances of structural damage.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having read this article on how to prep a room for paint, I believe that you gained both application skills and surface restoration art, which will boost your DIY painting project.
Usually, you are required to select the right material and tools for prepping activity, clean/sweep the room, and strip old paint before sanding the ceiling/walls to eliminate debris and surface roughness.
Besides, it would help if you had to dust and wash the walls/ceiling (where appropriate), seal/repair the damaged ceiling/walls, polish the entire surface sufficiently to improve paint stickiness ability and reduce run formation when painting.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living in an urban area has its ups and downs. Among the major downsides of living in an urban area is having to deal with all sorts of noises from the external environment.</p>
<p>It gets even worse if your home is made of modern walling materials such as drywall that allow more sound to pass through than traditional brick and mortar homes.
Noise pollution is not something you should ignore especially if it is impossible to relocate to a different house.

<h3 id="1-use-furniture">1. Use furniture</h3>
<p>This is probably the easiest and cheapest way to reduce noise levels in your home since it simply involves rearranging the furniture you already own.
If youve ever paid attention when moving in and out of a place, there is a big difference between how rooms sound when they are empty versus when you have moved in your stuff in there. An empty room has more echo and things sound louder.
This is because since there are no obstacles, sound waves travel faster and they are never absorbed by anything. On the other hand, a room full of stuff has no echo and usually is quieter.
To soundproof a room using furniture, you can arrange your heaviest pieces of furniture next to the walls that are letting in the most sound, such as the walls facing the street and in front of windows.
Some of the best <a href="/posts/best-soundproof-earmuffs-for-sleeping/">soundproofing</a> furniture includes sofas, wardrobes, dressers, bookcases, and tables. Read Also:

<h3 id="2-use-carpets-and-rugs-to-soundproof-the-floor">2. Use carpets and rugs to soundproof the floor</h3>
<p>If you live in a condo complex or apartment building, soundproofing your floor is just as necessary as soundproofing the walls. Sound travels through the floor especially if its made of concrete.
Putting down heavy rugs or carpets can prevent sounds from traveling through your floor. Think of it as hitting two birds with one stone; you get a rug for your home as well as peace and quiet. On top of that, carpets will also help with heat insulation which helps you save energy costs.
The best type of carpet to use for soundproofing is a thick one made of wool or synthetic fiber that is woven together. The thicker the better.
If you are looking for a more permanent option, have a carpet installed. A rug is for those looking for a more temporary solution particularly if you live in a rented apartment. Read Also:

<h3 id="3-use-door-seals">3. Use door seals</h3>
<p>Doors are one of the major sources of sound pollution in any home. Doors have many spaces where sound waves can travel through; the tiny spaces between the door and its frame, the keyhole, and worst of all, the space between the door and the floor.
There are various cheap ways to soundproof a door. First, you can get a door rug that blocks the space between the door and the floor or a quality door sweep. Another cheap option is to use acoustic sealant tape to cover door openings.
Acoustic sealant tape also works well on windows and wall cracks. A permanent and slightly more expensive solution is to have a mounted seal installed around the door. Read Also:

<h3 id="4-soundproof-curtains">4. Soundproof curtains</h3>
<p>Windows are one of the biggest challenges when it comes to soundproofing. One of the things you can do to soundproof your windows is by using curtains.
There are various types of soundproofing curtains available to buy but the best should be heavy enough to block out light and preferably made of several layers of materials.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most often, it is hard to identify the best living room <a href="/posts/how-to-prep-a-room-for-paint/">paint</a> colors with brown
furniture
. At some point, some have gone to an extent of terming brown as boring.
Much as this is not true - maybe its time you give it a little more consideration and see what becomes of it with my recommendations.
There are several ways to compliment that brown furniture and give your living <a href="/posts/how-to-soundproof-a-room-cheaply/">room</a> a new and glamorous look.</p>
<h2 id="living-room-paint-colors-with-brown-furniture"><strong>Living Room Paint Colors with Brown Furniture</strong></h2>
<p>Below are different paints that you can consider to make the room more accommodative and less boring.</p>
<h3 id="1-denver-home-remodel">1. Denver Home Remodel</h3>
<p>This involves a combination of brown and gray. The different application of the textured colors bring out a very impressive look.
This combination impressively blends the colors to match the brown furniture.</p>
<h3 id="2-a-brown-floor">2. A Brown Floor</h3>
<p>Not every time you have to get rid of the already existing brown color, sometimes you can decide to make it better.
To achieve this, you can complement the brown floor with a purple or grey wall. This will override and make the floor look great.</p>
<h3 id="3-a-natural-wall">3. A Natural Wall</h3>
<p>To add shade and neutralize the brown furniture effect, a neutral wall will make a great deal.
Depending on how you like it to be, you can either make it to be reflective to draw the attention from the furniture or dampen it to make your furniture the center of attraction
To achieve this, you can use a mixture paints or use a mixture of items too to draw the attention from the furniture. A woven basket a pillow are some good additional that you can use.</p>
<h3 id="4-gray-wall">4. Gray wall</h3>
<p>There are dark grays and light grays too. You can either of the two depending on the theme you want to achieve in your living room.
Gray is a great neutralizer that has over time replaced beige and white. As a substitute for white, you may want to consider shading light gray.
This will lighten up the room and overshadow the brown furniture. For a beige substitute, a darker shade of gray will be very convenient, however be careful not to overdo it to avoid a scenario of an extremely dark room.
However, you can use this to create a perfect calm and dark atmosphere in your bedroom.</p>
<h3 id="5-beige">5. Beige</h3>
<p>Beige is seemingly a cool color. If you do not want a rather bright room, you can use beige.
It equally neutralizes, the brown furniture environment and the same time create a warm atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="6-white-wall">6. White Wall</h3>
<p>Depending on the tone of your brown furniture, you can also decide to introduce white color in the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-undercoat-paint/">walls of your living room</a>
.
By this, you create a clean environment white in turn reflects the nature of your room.
Being a bright color, it shout more and draws the attention more than the brown furniture therefore neutralizing it.</p>
<h3 id="7-red-color">7. Red color</h3>
<p>When you are considering painting your walls, think of the effect a red color would bring in the in the living room.
If your furniture is dark brown, doing a deep red color with dampen the room or even make it look small. Alternatively, you can also chose to have either a bright red or a deep red.
As for a bright red, combining it with golden or white accents will brighten and diverge the attention from the furniture.</p>
<h3 id="8-yellow">8. Yellow</h3>
<p>Yellow is such a fantastic color to use especially in the living room. It has a unique way of bringing excitement into the room. However, not everyone wants to make their rooms this vibrant.
In this regard, using muted portions of the yellow color blended or rather a golden yellow for that case, will leave your living room well lit up and with the brown furniture virtually visible.</p>
<h3 id="9-white-colored-ceiling">9. White Colored Ceiling</h3>
<p>If you are still scared of that brown furniture on your living room, maybe you should consider having a white ceiling to minimize on its attention.
The white ceiling will greatly light up the room and take away any attention drawn by the brown furniture.
To be on the safer side, you need to learn the art to balance the two to avoid the scenario of one overriding the other.
Choosing a brighter white is also dependent on how you want your living room to be, bright and warm.</p>
<h3 id="10-colored-throw-pillows">10. �Colored Throw Pillows</h3>
<p>Another way to way the attention of the brown furniture is use of colored pillows. Choosing either mixed color or singling out a particular color will be based on your preference.
Apart from the throw pillows, you can also choose to use either colored blankets to draw the attention form the furniture from seemingly dull furniture.</p>
<h3 id="11-colored-curtains">11. Colored Curtains</h3>
<p>Your curtains can be another source of diluting the color of the brown furniture in your living room.
At this point, you can use them to warm up the room and make it more cheerful.
A mustard yellow, a burnt orange are among the few colors you can use on your curtains to make it more exciting.</p>
<h3 id="12-blue-walls">12. Blue walls</h3>
<p>Having a blue can make a good turning point from the brown furniture. What I like about the color is that you can also blend or mix it with white to make the room brighter.
Another alternative, is a dark blue color which can bring out exceptional beauty to your living room.
White tulips on the blue walls will also play an essential role in illuminating the room.</p>
<h3 id="13-green">13. Green</h3>
<p>If you are a great fan of green color, you dont have to feel left out on blending your brown furniture with the color.
My favorite is deep forest green because of the way it harmoniously creates a jungle environment when it blends with brown.
I prefer this on the walls combined with a rusty pattern to make the room more warm and glamorous.
You can also choose a light green shade in the guest room.� This will be an excellent choice to harmonize the natures main colors green and brown.
To relax and calm your guests, this will be the perfect way to decongest and cool down any form of noise.</p>
<h3 id="14-cream">14. Cream</h3>
<p>In order to create a unique flow in the room, cream paint is an excellent choice for that.
What is amazing about cream is that you can combine it with white to pull the attention from the brown furniture.
If the living room is overcrowded, you can use this color to create a comfortable environment.</p>
<h3 id="15-gold">15. Gold</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a rich and a gorgeous color, this is perfect match for you. This will be a good match for your brown furniture.
You can also use this color on other surfaces like blue, red, or even green color.
Apart from using it on walls, you can also use it on frames to give your room a fine touch.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Brown is a great color and if you are looking for the best living room paint colors with brown furniture, then you already have an answer.
As listed above, the color ideas gives you the multiple options of colors to apply to either on your walls, ceiling or living room in general to match and blend with your brown furniture.
These color options will give your living room different styles that can be interpreted differently depending on what you want.</p>
