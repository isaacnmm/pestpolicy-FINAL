<p>Do fruit flies bother you by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fruit-flies-come-from/">flying all over in your house and compound</a>
that you wonder when they will die?
<strong>Fruit flies live for approximately 40 to 50 earth days. During this time, the female fruit flies are able to mate with males severally and lay thousands of eggs that hatch into new ones.�</strong>
In fact, the fruit flies do not just hatch into flies directly; they undergo different stages in their life cycle to achieve fully development.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-long-do-fruit-flies-live-">**Details: How long do Fruit flies live? **</h2>
<p>Fruit flies live for approximately 40 to 50 earth days. To achieve full maturity, they undergo various stages (metamorphosis). The duration in each development stage may vary from place to place due varying factors, which affects their growth.</p>
<p>The life cycle of a fruit fly begins from reproduction where the female lays eggs which develop into larva then pupa and finally adult.</p>
<p>The adult fruit fly is a very small insect and sometime you may not see it with naked eye unless they are in huge number. Many of them come together and create a swam that engulf rotting/fermenting foodstuff leading to spoilage.</p>
<p>The continuous reproduction of fruit flies within as short period give them a great advantage of rapid multiplication in a given area. Though they die, their birth rate is higher than death rate.</p>
<p>You will also realize that fruit flies follow foodstuff, without which they leave. You may keep off foodstuff that attract fruit flies if you desire to get rid of them entirely. Importantly, you must keep a close look into my other articles to learn more of ways to get rid of fruit flies.</p>
<p>I will now elaborate in depth each stage in the life cycle of a fruit fly in various subheading below.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-life-cycle-of-fruit-flies"><strong>What is a life cycle of Fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>The life of fruit fly is classified in various stages that are interlinked continuously. These stages together form its life cycle. �Each stage consists of a number of developments, which make it different from the next or other stages.</p>
<p>You will see that larvae and pupa are two different organisms though they are sub stage of an adult fruit fly. It is, therefore, important to learn these development stages as they may help you, in case you want to get rid of these fruit flies, to efficiently destroy them at any point of wish.</p>
<p>The Life cycle of fruit fly is classified into four stages i.e. egg, larvae, pupa and adult. The female fruit fly after mating lays eggs which hatches into larvae. This develop into pupa stage and later matures to an adult fruit fly.</p>
<p>Lets discuss each stage:</p>
<h3 id="stage-1--reproduction-process"><strong>Stage 1  Reproduction Process.</strong></h3>
<p>Once the female mates with male fruit fly, the fruit fly looks for a better place to lay eggs. This could be on your rotting/fermenting foodstuff, damp rag or mop, fruit skin, dustbin or even drainage system.</p>
<p>Before female fruit fly lays the eggs, the fruit fly must ensure that the temperature is high enough. The temperature of around 77 degree Fahrenheit suit her best. This can be lower however; it should not go below 22 degree, which may kill the fruit flys hatched babies. Fruit flies for reproduction purposes select humid environment.</p>
<p>Once that is done, about 24 hours after mating, the female fruit fries lays between 200 to 500 eggs at ago. This answers you why their survival rate is so high.</p>
<p>Each egg is able to hatch after 24 to 30 hours. By 8 to 13 days, you will be having adult fruit flies buzzing around in your place. No wonder you may keep complaining how quick these flies mature.</p>
<p>Once the eggs hatch, they proceed to the next stage called larvae stage.</p>
<h3 id="stage-2--larvae"><strong>Stage 2  Larvae�</strong></h3>
<p>This is stage is the most pronounce stage of fruit flies. Basically, a larvae is a worm-like organism that does not have legs. It is very active when it comes to movement and feeding so as to secure enough energy for the next stage.</p>
<p>Larva are seen mostly as they mess the fruits and other rotting foodstuff a lot. Though small in sizes, their impact is highly seen. They are highly attracted by the fermenting parts of the fruits or rotting substances.</p>
<p>These larvae feeds on yeast organism &amp; fungi in the rotting/ fermenting foodstuff and turns it into a messy semi-liquid substance that emits irritating smell.</p>
<p>In fact, they provides further acceleration of bacteria, which affects the foodstuff to a point of no use.�After about four days, the larvae moves to a dark place where matures and change into pupa, which is the next stage.
<strong>Stage 3  Pupa�</strong>
The pupa Stage is termed as an inactive stage by observation. This is because the pupa is actually an immobile organism.</p>
<p>During this stage, the legless larvae develop six legs, eyes and wings using the energy that was stored during the larvae stage.</p>
<p>The skins begins to darken as it continues to develop. The three body parts i.e. head, thorax and abdomen become distinct and at this point, the puparium is about to break.</p>
<p>This development takes about four days. Then the pupa breaks the skin and a light colored-young adult emerges. This now proceeds to the next stage.
<strong>Stage 4  Adult�</strong>
The development stage of young adult fruit fly to a fully adult is a self-developing process that takes two to three days.</p>
<p>The young adult emerges as light in color fly. However, its color darkens with time. This young Fruit fly feeds on the available rotting foodstuff so as to acquire the full adulthood.</p>
<p>During this time, the wings and legs are strengthened so as to help it in flying and landing. In addition, abdomen develops further such that spiracles for breathing are able to function properly.</p>
<p>The adult stage development time may vary from place to place due to environment. It is worth noting that you will expect to see female adult fruit fly being ready for mating and lay eggs after two days of its pupa stage.</p>
<p>This means that they quickly get into reproduction as soon as they are released as young adults.</p>
<p>NB: This process, from reproduction to full adulthood of fruit flies, is known as metamorphosis and we said it takes between eight to thirteen days, which may vary from place to place due climatic factor among other things.</p>
<h2 id="which-affects-the-lifespan-of-fruit-flies"><strong>Which affects the Lifespan of Fruit flies?</strong></h2>
<p>Survival of fruit flies is affected by various factors that may vary from place to place depending on the point of consideration. These factors may either favor their existence or cause their death. Some of these factors include:</p>
<h3 id="1-ambient-temperature">1. Ambient temperature</h3>
<p>Most fruit flies thrives very well is ambient temperature of a given environment. Research shows that the optimal temperature of about 78 degree Fahrenheit is suitable for best survival of these fruit flies.</p>
<p>They can also survive in low temperatures however; this should not go below 20 degree Fahrenheit as this may result to their dead or affect their reproduction activities.</p>
<p>We know that ambient temperature also accelerates the rotting/fermenting process as well as multiplication of these fruit flies; it is important then that you take precaution so as to prevent food rooting or any environment that may result to the same.
<strong>2. Ability to breed frequently�</strong>
It is to the advantage of fruit flies that they are able to breed and multiply at a very short time. Within eight to thirteen days from time the eggs were laid, the fully developed fruit fly is able to bring to existence the new generation of its own.</p>
<p>These flies are also very active sexually. The fact that after laying they are able to regain their sexual activeness after a short time, this gives them a super chance to bring more and more babies into life.
<strong>3. They have different food alternatives.</strong>
We know that the fruit flies are attracted by any rotting or fermenting foodstuff. This could be in any place e.g. within the house or outside.</p>
<p>Once fruit flies have depleted one food source, they quickly shift to another within the locality. Just think of youself expelling them from your house when you have the garbage at your compound unkempt or some damply rags or mops outside; definitely you will find some there after some times.</p>
<p>It is very important to ensure that you clean all possible sites that may, in any away, attract these fruit flies into their vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="can-fruit-flies-die-on-their-own"><strong>Can fruit flies die on their own?�</strong></h2>
<p>This is a nice concern. Definitely, fruit flies will die after forty to fifty days of survival. However, it may not seem like they really are dying if the source of food still exists.</p>
<p>You will agree with me that the more you feed them, the more they will stay since their reproduction rate is more that their death rate.</p>
<p>Just in case you want them to die on their own, kindly allow them to deplete the current food source and eventually once it is completely eaten away by them, they will either die of starvation or look for another food source around or kilometers away.</p>
<p>I am only worried if you will dread to face such infestation of fruit flies by giving them a chance to die slowly!</p>
<h2 id="do-fruit-flies-cause-sickness"><strong>Do fruit flies cause sickness?�</strong></h2>
<p>Sickness is something you always try to avoid. The fact that fruit flies are irritating is termed as a special kind of sickness as where they are you can stay at peace.</p>
<p>Moreover, these flies lands and touch over other contaminated substances before feeding on your food thus bringing disease-causing germs to it.</p>
<p>The larvae stage of fruit flies mostly prefer feeding on fermenting/rotting food. They accelerates the action of bacteria as well as food poisoning. If such food is eaten, it may cause illness, stomach upset or other types of sicknesses.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-destroy-fruit-flies-breeding-ground"><strong>How do I destroy fruit flies breeding ground?�</strong></h2>
<p>It is necessary know that the most destructive stages of a fruit fly is larvae and adult stage. These stages plays a great role in destroying your foodstuff.�In case you desire to destroy their breeding ground, just try and do away with these two stages.</p>
<p>For the case of larvae stage, it is difficult to handle them independently as they continuously change to next stage in a few days. Therefore, it is important to deal with egg stage and adult stage.</p>
<p>You can do this by maintaining very low temperature that ensures that these eggs never hatch do larvae within the room thus killing the generation.</p>
<p>This means that you will have to do that for about fifty days so that the living fruit flies die of temperature changes.</p>
<p>If you need to get rid of the living fruit flies, it is important to use efficiently the existing methods that are used to get rid of fruit flies such as the use of Yellow flytrap, vinegar or wine trap etc.</p>
<p>Chemicals can be used to kill both the fruit flies and their laid egg however; most of these chemicals cause environmental pollution.</p>
<p>I may therefore not recommend their use unless you find that the problem for fruit flies has escalated and other methods are not yielding results.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-prevent-fruit-flies-in-my-home"><strong>How do I prevent fruit flies in my home?�</strong></h2>
<p>This is just easy. You will require to keep off any substance that attract fruit flies into your house of place. This can be made by ensuring that you do not store any rotting foodstuff or ensuring those products with fruit flies attracting smell has securely stored.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is very important for you. Ensure that you empty garbage bin, clean all spilled food, store mops and rags when dry, flush sinks and toilet as well as drains with proper cleaning fluids or clean your kitchen and dishes immediately after use to keep off smell.</p>
<p>These, if you put them into practice, will help you a lot in preventing presence of fruit flies in your house or compound.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Your concern on life of fruit flies is valid. Fruit flies lives for about 40 to 50 earth days. The lifecycle of a fruit fly is classified into four stages: egg, larvae, pupa and adult.�Fruit flies lives may be affected by various factors such as temperature humidity as well as source of food nutrients.</p>
<p>It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that you keep your house or compound free from these irritating fruit flies by ensuring that you are able to observe proper sanitation requirement as I have advised in this articles. A fruit fly free home is a nice place to live. What do you think about it?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fruit flies
are tiny flying bugs that&rsquo;s attracted to rotting and over ripened fruits such as grapes, plums, strawberries, mangoes, and watermelon.</p>
<p>Each female will lay 500 eggs in summer and they&rsquo;ll develop to adults within 8 - 10 days.
Fruit flies come
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fruit-flies-come-from/">thrive in warmer temperatures</a>
with rotten fruits and vegetables laying their eggs in wall cracks,
home kitchen, or in cafeterias, hotels, and restaurants. So, how to get <a href="/posts/homemade-fruit-fly-trap/">rid</a> of fruit flies?</p>
<h2 id="1-toss-fruits-and-wipe-them-out">1. Toss Fruits and Wipe Them out</h2>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to too or dispose off the rotting or overripe vegetables and fruits that may be in your house or kitchen. Notably, fruit flies will hatch and then proceed into your foods.</p>
<p>Next, dip the vegetables and fruits that are not yet infested in some soapy water (or apple cider vinegar). Next, wash or use a clean towel to wipe all the produce. Finally, rinse the fruits with clean water and dry them.</p>
<p>This will clean off all the fruit fly eggs that could be lying on the surfaces of the produce. However, put the produce in a sealed contained or the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Wipe out all the possible breeding grounds for fruit flies. These areas include the cabinet surfaces or kitchen tops. In addition, you, must wipe out the bottom and inner sides of the trash cans to remove food residue and spills.</p>
<p>Remember to use trash bags but also dispose them off daily. However, any bag that&rsquo;s not full will need to be covered - at least if you won&rsquo;t be tossing it off.
Finally, clean up the moist drain as it may have fermenting waste - your may use one of the
best drain cleaners
. It&rsquo;ll easily unclog the drains with organic and fermented mater - including those of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<h2 id="2-apple-cider-vinegar--dawn-dish-soap">2. Apple Cider Vinegar + Dawn Dish Soap</h2>
<p>Apple cider vinegar�is the magical best fruit fly trap. But why do fruit flies love v
inegar? Well, vinegar is
<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vinegar/">fully fermented organic matter</a>
(with excellent scent). Fruit flies love broken-down natural ingredients and its acidity.

The bugs will jump into a jar containing Apple cider vinegar and drown in it as they try to drink it with its mouth-parts - acting like a Kryptonite. The requirements to make the vinegar fruit fly traps are just a
<a href="http://www.academia.edu/27434106/How_to_Get_Rid_Of_Fruit_Flies_with_a_Homemade_Fruit_Fly_Trap">plastic wrap and a jar or glass</a>
.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pour a portion of your Apple cider vinegar into a glass. Cover the glass with vinegar using a plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Now, use a pin or toothpick to poke some 2-4 small holes on the plastic wrap. This will allow the smell of your white vinegar to emerge.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to poke a bigger hole at the center of your plastic cover - this is where the fruit flies will gain entry into the glass.</li>
<li>Now, leave the glass with Apple cider vinegar around the area having a fruit fly infestation. To ensure that the fleas won&rsquo;t escape the glass having white vinegar - add 3-10 drops of<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dawn-dish-soap-for-fleas/">dawn dish soap for fleas</a>that&rsquo;ll act like glue on the insects.</li>
<li>The fruit flies will be stuck in the vinegar jar as they can&rsquo;t move out - they&rsquo;ll finally die.</li>
<li>Repeat the Apple cider vinegar treatment daily until the fruit fly infestation ceases.
<em>Alternatively�</em></li>
<li>Pour boiling water or boiling Apple cider vinegar in the infested drains. This will quickly repel the fruit flies from your yard and home.</li>
<li>The boiling liquids will flush out the fruit flies from the hidden and moist places such as toilets, garbage disposals, sink drains, and shower drains.
<em>Why Vinegar + Soap Works:�</em>
Fruit flies will be attached to the Apple cider vinegar due to its great scent. Therefore, the flies will try to land of the vinegar. But the soap will have broken the vinegar&rsquo;s surface tension making the fruit flies to sink and drown.
Luckily,
Apple cider vinegar is e
nvironmentally-friendly, cheap and won&rsquo;t generate harsh fumes. But liquid dish soap isn&rsquo;t&rsquo; safe for human consumption and thus must be kept far from kids.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3beer-or-old-wine-trap">3.*Beer *or Old Wine Trap</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/better-smelling-beer-thanks-fruit-flies">New scientific research</a>
show fruit flies have a unique relationship with yeast that&rsquo;s is beer or old wine. Yeast secretes some sweet scent that&rsquo;ll attract the fruit flies.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply pour half a glass of fresh or old beer into some mason jar that&rsquo;s covered with a lid. Place the bottle of glass with the beer at the area where you saw the fruit flies.</li>
<li>Hammer some holes on the lid of the metal lid covering the bottle, glass or jar. The fruit flies will enter the container, feast on the bear and ultimately drown.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to drop a little bear on top of the glass cover - this will lure the fruit flies into your stale beverage. The bugs will be trapped by the bottle&rsquo;s narrow neck - it acts as a natural barrier as they can&rsquo;t jump out.
<em>Why�Beer (Alcohol) works:�</em>
Similar to the case with vinegar, the smell of beer or wine attracts fruit flies. However, you can also some some drops of the dish soap that&rsquo;ll consequently act like glue.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4-liquid-soap--water--light">4. Liquid Soap + Water + Light</h2>
<p>Our next fruit fly trap will be using water plus liquid soap. For this trap, you&rsquo;ll simply mix the liquid soap and the water in a bowl.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix soap + water in the bowl until is creates a foamy and bubbly bath.</li>
<li>Next, position the bowl with the foamy water under some bright light such as stove lights or other lamps.</li>
<li>The light from your source will create a reflection that&rsquo;ll attract the fruit flies. However, the dish soap will make the flies to drown as it&rsquo;ll have broken the surface tension of the water.
<em>Alternatively:�</em>
Use an old fruit, vinegar plus a paper cone. Thus, simply position a large piece of overly rip fruit and some little vinegar in glass or a jar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, roll down some paper cone into your jar - ensure that it sticks. Place the narrow end of the paper cone at the bottom of the jar.</p>
<p>Thus, the odor of the smelling fruit in the mixture will attack the fruit flies. However, the fruit flies won&rsquo;t easily climb up the paper cone and thus they&rsquo;ll be trapped in the jar.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>How to prevent a fruit fly infestation.�The surest way of preventing a fruit fly infestation is by avoiding to attract them at all. Therefore, the main considerations would be maintaining a clean dining area and kitchen.</p>
<p>Wash Fruits and Vegetables.�As noted earlier, fruit flies will also pitch camp on dirty, overripe or rotting produce - fruits and vegetables. Thus, to prevent an infestation, you&rsquo;ll need to thoroughly wash and dry the produce.</p>
<p>Wash your eggplants, broccoli, apples, or melons etc once you get them from your store. The washing process will remove the eggs and adults of these fruit flies.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Could <a href="/posts/how-long-do-fruit-flies-live/">fruit</a> <a href="/posts/how-do-you-keep-horse-flies-away-naturally/">flies</a> have disturbed you in your place? Do you wonder where they may have come from or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-fruit-flies-live/">how long they live</a>
?</p>
<p>In this article, I will be answering this question in depth.</p>
<p>Summary:
<strong>Fruit fries come from bush hideouts through the windows, doors and even ventilation; fruit trees and flower in the compound or neighborhood; they can come as a result of weather changes in the area; they could have been on your food when you were bringing it home or it could even be possible that some of your food you bought had fruit flies eggs inside it without notice.</strong>
However, it is important to note that these fruit flies may come because something has attracted them into the vicinity. Their movement is mainly triggered by specific attractants - though there could be other means as highlighted above that may have resulted them to being in your household.</p>
<h2 id="what-attracts-fruit-flies"><strong>What attracts fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>Fruit fries are very small insects commonly found in tropical areas with humid climatic condition.�Mostly, fruit fries are attracted into your house by ripen fruits or vegetables.</p>
<p>Fruits like tomatoes, melons, grapes or other perishables in the farm attracts these flies. Rotting potatoes, bananas, onions, cabbages and other unrefrigerated products bought from groceries in your house attracts many of these fruit flies.</p>
<p>They can also be attracted to decomposing waste, empty bottles, cleaning rags or mops that are within the compound or farm. The key thing here is the fermenting smell. These flies have very high sense of smell thus; they can detect these scents when they are kilometers away.</p>
<p>Yeast leads to fermentation process and helps a lot in making these fruit flies get attracted to foodstuff. Alcoholic drinks tend to attract the fruit flies due to the fermentation scent in them especially the locally made brews. It is therefore important for you keep note of proper storage of these fruit flies attracting products so as to minimize the effects associated with them.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-fruit-flies-enter-your-house-from-outsidehideouts"><strong>How do fruit flies enter your house from outside/hideouts?�</strong></h2>
<p>You may wonder to find that even after closing all your doors, windows and keeping everything spotless clean, you still find fruit flies in your house. This is not magic! Fruit flies are very small. They can penetrate through the tinniest space left at the door or window from outside and find its way to the rotting/fermenting items in the house.</p>
<p>This is a major blow to individuals as its almost impossible to seal completely your house so as to prevent their entrance. In fact, you need ventilation for aeration in the house, which offers them a quick route into the kitchen, bathroom or toilet.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-fruit-flies-come-from-fruit-trees-and-flowers"><strong>How do fruit flies come from fruit trees and flowers?�</strong></h2>
<p>We now know very well that fruit flies are highly attracted by fermenting substances and through use of sense of smell, they can locate the rotting foodstuff. Fruits like grapes, mangoes or oranges highly produce these scents when they are ripening. You will find that more of these flies brood in these environments.</p>
<p>The flowers from various plants also hold breeding grounds for these fruit flies. This is attributed by nectar produced by these particular flowers. In case your compound or yard has these flowers, expect some fruit flies within.</p>
<p>Once the attractants are depleted from the vicinity, these fruit flies looks for any available option around which could be: in your house, nearby hotel or even damping site- just by use of smell.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-weather-change-favors-existence-of-fruit-flies"><strong>How does weather change favors existence of fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>Fruit flies tend to thrive very well during summer than in winter. This is attributed by the fact that temperature accelerate rotting/fermentation activity, which in turn releases a scent that attracts the fruit flies. Moreover, warm temperature favors breeding of these fruit flies in a given environment.</p>
<p>Fruit flies also work best during dusk or dawn. They like dim light environment more as compared to the bright light areas. This does not mean that you wont find them in bright-lit regions. No! Only that dim light is more favorable for Fruit flies.</p>
<p>During winter. You may experience less fruit flies as compared to summer. This wont overlook the fact that you will see some of them in your household! However, the number will drastically fall. This tells you why some people rarely experience fruit flies problems in their locality.</p>
<h2 id="in-which-way-do-fruit-flies-get-into-the-food-that-is-brought-home"><strong>In which way do fruit flies get into the food that is brought home?�</strong></h2>
<p>Often, you find yourself doing shopping of various fruits and vegetables. In case you buy them in a grocery where there were fruit flies invasion, chances are that your items will have some of these flies. You may ask how?</p>
<p>These fruit flies are very small. They may have laid eggs beneath the fruits or other vegetables and you may end up transporting them home where they hatch into fruit flies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of them may hide inside some vegetables like cabbages or kales only to go hatch and multiply in your house. It is very important for you to keep note of health matter of groceries that you frequently buy your fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>At times, you may even have bought flowers or drinks like wine that attracts these fruit fries. This may attract some of fruit flies to these items without your notice and they end up into your homestead where the further bred.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-fruit-flies-breedreproduce"><strong>Where do fruit flies breed/reproduce?�</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we know fruit flies are mainly found in hotels, homes or supermarkets where foodstuff are allowed to ferment or rot, lets elaborate their breeding process. Fruit flies lay eggs near the surface of the rotting/fermenting food, organic material or beneath the fruit skin.</p>
<p>Each fruit fly lay about 500 eggs, which takes 24-48 hours to hatch. This should tell you that within a week, you would expect thousands of these flies in the house if not taken care of.</p>
<p>These flies can also breed in any moist place. It could be drain, garbage disposal, wet rag or mop. The larvae is able to feed on the surface or fermenting/rooting product (fruit/vegetables) thus accelerating the process further.</p>
<p>These flies end up destroying the whole fruit or vegetable making them unsafe for human consumption.�This may really be pathetic. Therefore, you will need to take care of them before they get more nuisance.</p>
<h2 id="do-fruit-flies-cause-any-problemsharmful"><strong>Do fruit flies cause any problems/harmful?�</strong></h2>
<p>You will agree with me that there is nothing as much irritating as swam of fruit flies in your kitchen, living room or compound. It becomes even more disgusting to walk into a supermarket or restaurant and a swam of them flew over foodstuff. This will not auger well.</p>
<p>These flies causes discomfort to human where they even engulf a person when you try to chase them away. Worse of it all is that the more you chase them, the more they keep coming back. It is such a tedious work that many find themselves giving up on them or disposing the whole food items. �They actually cause waste of food material.</p>
<p>Fruit flies accelerate the rotting of the food substances. Fruits like ripe bananas rots faster in their presence since the larvae feeds on the surface exposing the inner part, which is most nutritious for human consumption.</p>
<p>Contamination caused on food by fruit flies lead to food poisoning. In addition, they introduce bacteria and other disease causing organisms that may be harmful to human beings.</p>
