<p>It can be an overwhelming choice for a pet owner to choose the perfect treatment for your pet when they
contact fleas
.
With a multitude of�options and solutions to choose from, we can help guide you through the process�so you can identify the right choice for you and your pet.
Luckily, the market today has a lot to offer, and they have massively reduced the use of harsh chemicals so they wont give off a harsh toxic odor or damage your hands nor your pet&rsquo;s skin.
When you have a flea invasion, you may feel like you want to mix every solution you can encounter while the infestation takes over your house. It can irritate not just your pet, other pets, and your family.
It is important to have a little insight into the flea&rsquo;s life cycle to best prepare and know how you can best prevent any further spreading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anadult�flea can produce up to fifty eggsper day, making it crucial to stop these.</li>
<li>Pests as soon as possible. They aresmall and jump, making them hard to spot.
The fleas survive through blood, with the new eggs hatching within six days. A�single
flea can produce two thousand eggs
in its lifetime.</li>
<li>The eggs tend to hatch indoors best nestled in carpets, soft furnishings, and anywhere that provides warmth.</li>
<li>While you have the heating on during winter, this can also encourage fleas to produceoutdoor, fleas hatch in shaded areas and sandy pits.
The worst part about a flea survival tactic is that it can remain in a cocoon for up to three hundred and fifty days until it hatches, waiting for the perfect conditions for best survival.
They wait for body heat and movement.
How�you can identify if your pet has
fleas is a lot easier than getting rid
of�them, unfortunately.
Check your pet&rsquo;s coat by eye and by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-combs-for-dogs/">combing through with a�flea</a>
comb and look for scales and bite marks on your pet&rsquo;s skin. You may also
Have some
bite marks on your skin
also. You can rub aloe vera on, which will soothe the bite.
Check your bedding if your pet sleeps near you for
flea eggs
and�clean these to prevent spreading.</li>
<li>Same with any bedding that your pets may be�sleeping on.</li>
<li>The most difficult stage to tackle a flea cycle is when the flea is in an immature state.
Again by ensuring your pet&rsquo;s
bedding is washed, you can immediately improve your chances of getting rid of fleas
. You can also apply flea shampoo regularly.
We suggest vacuuming the carpets whenever you can, too, which will remove any eggs or clean floorboards with eucalyptus.
Just be careful to dispose of the
vacuum�bag properly
; otherwise, you may risk the fleas hatching in the bag, and then you have another problem!</li>
<li>In terms of medications, you can provide to your pet; you can try flea bombs, which can be tricky for you if you want to get into your house any time soon.</li>
<li>It is also very toxic, and the smell can linger for quite some time afteryou have used it.
It will work well if you have a terrible and stubborn problem with fleas, but we would only recommend this as a last resort and not to apply directly to your pet, and it can also kill fish and birds.</li>
<li>You will have to remain off.The premises, while the flea bomb is activated too, and use external assistance for this. It is a more expensive option.</li>
<li>The spot-on treatments, which are usually applied behind your pet&rsquo;s ear or neck area, are also a popular option.
We have found that these can be difficult to apply, especially if your cat is particularly squirmy.
The treatment doesnt seem to target a full area, and you will need to reapply regularly on larger animals. With cats, in particular, they will room themselves and obliterate the ointment.
Oral solutions can be an option but do not work for long-term use, and the fleas can jump right back on your pet&rsquo;s coat once the pill is not potent any longer.
Pill and oral medications are an option but hard too often; it is hard to medicate if you are an owner and to ensure that your pet has swallowed the treatment fully.
Often the pet has a reaction to the pill and wont swallow the tablet or throw it up after mixing it in with their usual cat or dog food.
You�can stay ahead of a flea attack and keep your cupboards topped with the right�treatment and have enough so you can treat your pet all year round.
Shampoos are a great alternative to use, and vets and manufacturers have spent a lot of time developing products that wont damage your pet or the environment.
The solutions not only stop fleas in their cycle, but they will also care for your pet&rsquo;s coat, not give off any toxic smells or damage your hands while you are applying the solutions.
Most�of the shampoos are reasonably priced and also come in varying sizes and�smells. They are widely available and have been tried and tested by so many�animal lovers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have young children who may contact your pet, this may not be the best option for you as the solution is toxic, and they may touch their mouth or eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some pets have also been reactive to this type of treatment, especially if they suffer from hair loss or skin irritation.</li>
<li>The�solution isnt as chemically friendly as other alternatives nor as effective.
We know it can be expensive caring for your pet, and fleas are pests that can keep coming back and attacking.
It is hassle buying products that don&rsquo;t work, and you feel trapped in the pest-ridden household.
Shampoo your pet frequently in the solution, and comb and clean bedding will keep your
home safe�and fleas
at bay.</li>
</ul>
