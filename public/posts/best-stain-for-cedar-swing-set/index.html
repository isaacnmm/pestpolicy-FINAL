<p>As a parent or owner of a swing set, you need to take some time to maintain your cedar playset. It is important that you and your kids have years of fun.
Resurfacers are denser coatings to lock down splinters and fill cracks in any wood displaying signs of aging. Resurfacer enhances the appearance of weathered or worn out concrete and wood.</p>
<h3 id="1-opaque-finish-options">1. Opaque Finish Options<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-opaque-finish-options">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most people who own cedar wood products like cedar swing sets are likely to protect or seal their wood structure using a clear finish that would reveal the real characteristics of the wood.
However, it is important to note that semi-opaque and opaque finishes are great at concealing wood appearance issues on older swing sets.
In addition, these finishes can endure weathering properly compared to clear finishes, meaning, they can last long. Examples of opaque finish options include latex and acrylic stain, or outdoor paint.</p>
<h3 id="2-water-repellents">2. Water-Repellents<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-water-repellents">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are one of those people that wish to go all-natural, then water-repellents preservatives might be ideal for you. Water-repellents stains should be applied to cedar wood that is above the ground. Adding fungicide will help reduce the decay of wood as well as the growth of mildew.
In addition, the fungi will enable the wood to remain durable and strong all year long. The water-repellents stains also help to lower water absorption, but in the short-term.
To control wood discoloration that is triggered by depletion of water-soluble elements, a water-repellent that is rich in low-wax may be applied as a single layer on newly manufactured cedarwood. This may act as a pre-treatment process before you embark on painting. This process will greatly help reduce wood discoloration.</p>
<h3 id="3-exterior-polyurethane">3. Exterior Polyurethane<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-exterior-polyurethane">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using Polyurethane on your exterior cedar swing set can help to give it a great finish look as well as the ability to endure for years. However, all this will depend on the kind of weathering and friction the swing set is subjected to.
To get a more even finish on your cedar, and the cedar using sandpaper. Then apply either oil-based or water polyurethane in 2-3 layers in a span of few days.
However, if your swing set is always under the full sun, polyurethane might not be a very good choice. This is because under the full sun polyurethane is likely to wear out fast and may need to be removed frequently and reapplied to retain the color of cedar. This process might be expensive to those on budgets and time-consuming.</p>
<h3 id="4-clear-sealer">4. Clear Sealer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-clear-sealer">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want to retain that natural feel or the original color of your cedar swing set, Clear sealers may be the best choice for you. These penetrating sealers are perfect at bringing out the fascinating color of cedar of your wooden swing set.
To make the clear sealers even more appealing, they come in two different shades; the tinted and the clear shade. You get to choose what fits you the most.
Some of these sealers have protective UV absorbers or blockers, which can help in slowing the fading of wood caused by exposure to excess sun.
To maintain the color and appearance of your cedar swing set, you are required to reapply the clear sealers at least once per year. This habit will also greatly help to enhance the water-shedding capabilities of the wood.</p>
<h3 id="5-semi-transparent-stains">5. Semi-Transparent Stains<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-semi-transparent-stains">¶</a></h3>
<p>This type of stain can either be oil-based or latex. The stain can help to protect the wood grain of all outdoor wood structures. We recommend applying this Semi-Transparent stain to outdoor wood that is permanently located outside.
Structures that are located outside are more prone to algae and mold. Staining them with this semi-transparent mixture will help fight these elements as the stain contains an anti-fungal element, which is known to be effective at fighting mold, algae, or any other naturally occurring element.
Normally, these stains penetrate deeply into the wood and create a strong bond with the wood fibers, forming a great protective stain that fights all these unwanted elements. If you intend to maintain the natural appearance and basic texture of your swing set, you should consider using a semi-transparent stain.</p>
<h3 id="6-spar-urethane-or-spar-varnish">6. Spar Urethane or Spar Varnish<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-spar-urethane-or-spar-varnish">¶</a></h3>
<p>Spar Urethane or Spar Varnish is a highly recommended wood finish that is ideal for outdoor wood projects. The spar varnish gives wood surfaces a malleable and clear protective coat that safeguards it against splitting into layers when exposed to the sun.
The good thing with the spar varnish is that it deteriorates slowly, giving you value for your time and money for years. To use the spar vanish, just sand the surface of the wood lightly, removing mildew and dirt that might have accumulated over time.
After, apply a layer of spar varnish on to the wood. Spar Urethane is also an ideal option for your outdoor wood needs. It offers UV stability to wood, making them more durable and long-lasting. This wood vanish has similar properties as Spar Urethane.</p>

<p>Resurfacers and Solid color stains are opaque wood finishes that help to conceal the grain while allowing the texture of the wood to show. Solid color stains have two properties; it acts as a sealant and a stain. It helps to protect the wood from sun damage and moisture, allowing it to obtain a rich, opaque color.
Solid color stains do not penetrate wood; they rest on top of the wood as opposed to bonding with it, this can make the wood to flake or chip. Furthermore, solid color stains dont have anti-fungal properties, therefore, may not shield your wooden structures from water properly as compared to the penetrative stains.
However, solid stains are more like paint. A single layer of this stain can be enough on new wood. To get the best performance from the stain, the wood should be primed, then two coats of the stain should be applied. The best solid color stain is one that is 100% acrylic latex and should be applied in two layers to get superior results.
The solid color stain has numerous advantages on wood. They contain an acrylic formulation which offers great bond and durability. This stain is also fortified with urethane helping it to resist peeling and cracking. It also offers resistance against mildew. Finally, it contains a strong UV absorber that protects the wood against UV damage and fading.</p>

However, As opposed to applying a finish, just sand your swings set and wash it annually. Ensure you wash your set with a mild detergent solution using a brush. If you notice any mildew, ensure you treat it using a bleach solution or a mildew wash.</p>
