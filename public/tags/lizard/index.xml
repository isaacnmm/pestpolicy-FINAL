<p>Lizards will bite you when they feel threatened.�But are lizards poisonous?
<strong>Short answer is NO. Most house lizards are not poisonous. But they have viruses and bacteria on their skin which can cause serious illness when consumed by humans.�</strong>
<strong>Only the Blue-tailed <a href="/posts/are-lizards-vertebrates-or-invertebrates/">lizard</a> has poison on the skin. A few lizards are known to have venomous bites. These include the Mexican Bearded Lizards, Iguanas and the Gila.�</strong>

<h2 id="are-lizards-poisonous"><strong>Are Lizards Poisonous?</strong></h2>
<p>**1. Lizards Bite for Defence **
Most house lizards are harmless creatures and will always scamper for safety whenever they feel threatened. In rare cases they can bite you as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>However, their bites are not known to be poisonous. Although they might inflict some pain, the bites wont have any serious effects on your body. But
there are some
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8331-lizards-poisonous-secret-is-revealed/">venomous lizards</a>
.
<strong>2. Desert Lizards Are Poisonous</strong>
The only lizards with venomous bites include the Mexican Bearded Lizards, Iguanas and the Gila. These are found in northern Mexico and south-western US. These lizards live in the desert regions and rarely come to dwelling places. They are also not know to bite unless they feel threatened.
**3. Pathogens on Lizardss Skin **
Your only worry with lizards should be the pathogens on their skin such as
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/reptile/care/diseases-your-pet-reptile-can-give-you">Salmonella</a>
. When you touch your pet lizard, you might ingest the harmful pathogens causing you fall sick.</p>
<p>Lizards are attracted to food stuff especially milk. Thus when they touch your food or accidentally fall into milk, you might incur serious infections.�A few lizards like the blue-tailed lizard contain poison on their skin.</p>
<h2 id="common-venomous-lizards">Common Venomous Lizards</h2>
<p><strong>1. Gila Monster</strong>
Gila is an endangered lizard of northern Mexico and the south-western US. Its usually black in color with bright spots on various parts of the body. It has a notable stout body which is bulged at the head and tail.</p>
<p>An adult can reach about 20 inch and feeds on birds, small mammals and their eggs. The bulged head helps in holding the prey in place as it injects the venom to paralyze it.</p>
<p>But unlike snakes, all venomous lizards such as
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/11/17/1506321.htm">Australian lizards</a>
dont have fangs. Venom flows over the groves on their teeth to the prey. They rarely bite humans. If they bite they wont cause death.
<strong>2. Mexican Beaded Lizard</strong>
A close relative to the Gila monster, Mexican Beaded Lizard lives in western as well as the central parts of Mexico. It resembles the Gila monster in all aspects except that its darker and grows longer (32 inches).</p>
<p>Its also an endangered species and its trade has been banned. They inhabit thorn scrubs and pine forests where they feed on small mammals, birds and their eggs - like the
blue tailed lizards are venomous
.</p>
<p>Similar to Gila, this lizard bites it prey and holds on it with its powerful jaws before paralyzing it with its venom. For humans, the bite is only painful but it wont cause death.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8bD0y2M3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8bD0y2M3s</a>
<strong>3. Iguana</strong>
These are large lizards stretching to about 6.6 feet long. The most common is the green iguana usually found in Brazil and Mexico. They mainly inhabit arid areas, tree and the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Unlike most lizards, iguanas are vegetarians. However, they have sharp teeth which they use to bite impending intruders. Their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom">venom</a>
is relatively mild compared to other venomous lizards.</p>
<p>Although they dont attack easily, they can cause serious injuries on soft skin such as face, hands and legs.�But they are known to warn intruders before they strike. Watch out for iguanas when they take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on their fours.
<strong>4. Monitor Lizard�</strong>
Last but not least is the
monitor lizards
. Commonly found in Australia, these lizards vary greatly in size (2/3 foot to 10 feet). They are not usually very aggressive to intruders and will tend to run away.</p>
<p>Although they are venomous, they wont cause death. Whenever they are cornered, they might cause injuries with their powerful claws or jaws. Or they may whip with their powerful tails.</p>
<h2 id="can-lizards-harm-my-cat">Can Lizards Harm My Cat?</h2>
<p>Venomous lizards will definitely harm your cat in two ways  Being bitten by a venomous lizard or ingesting a poisonous lizard.</p>
<p>Your curious cat tends to run after every crawling creature oblivious if the dangers. Some lizards like the Blue-tailed lizard have poison on their skin. If your cat eats such a lizard it might suffer serious reactions from the toxins.</p>
<p>Possible symptoms of the toxin include vomiting, fever, dizziness, staggering, diarrhea etc. some toxins can even lead to paralysis. If venomous lizards stray into your compound, they might end up biting your curious cat in their encounter.</p>
<p>The Mexican Beaded and Gila Monsters lizards are two lizards to watch out for. When they bite your cat, they wont release easily. By the time you release the animal, itll have released the venom to your cat. Symptoms of the bite might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>General weakness</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Shock</li>
<li>Low blood pressure</li>
<li>Vomiting and nausea</li>
<li>Abnormal defecation and urination</li>
<li>Lizards broken teeth in the wound
The first thing you do is to try and remove the lizard from your cat using the safest method possible. You can insert a metal rod into the lizards mouth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively put some drinking alcohol or vinegar into the lizards mouth. After successively removing the lizard, take the cat to the vet.</p>
<p>Also if you dont manage to remove the lizard, take the cat to the vet with the lizard in place. Your vet will remove the lizard, and administer an anti-venom.</p>
<h2 id="are-lizards-harmful-to-humans">Are Lizards Harmful To Humans?</h2>
<p>Lizard venoms will inflict pain and cause serious reactions to your body. The intensity of the reactions will depend on species of lizard that bites you.</p>
<p>Lizard venoms are however less serious compared to snake venoms and can be treated with minimal complications. Kids can be at risk of developing serious complications from lizard venoms.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-carry-salmonella"><strong>Do Lizards Carry Salmonella?�</strong></h2>
<p>Lizard bites can transfer pathogens such as
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/salmonella/symptoms-causes/syc-20355329">Salmonella</a>
.
Symptoms of lizard bites in humans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain and Convulsions</li>
<li>Decreases blood pressure</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Swelling and�Numbness</li>
<li>Diarrhea and�Shock</li>
<li>Difficulty in breathing
In case of lizard bites, seek medical attention as soon as possible. Delayed medical attention can lead to complications or even death.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-lizard-bites">How to Treat Lizard Bites</h2>
<p>When youre bitten by a lizard you might not immediately know whether its poisonous or not. So the first thing to do is to call poison expert to help in identification.</p>
<p>If they cannot respond your call of distress with prompt, take a photo of the lizard and report to the nearest hospital.�If possible take the lizard with you. But you risk getting more bites which can worsen the condition.</p>
<p>Waiting for symptoms to show might only make the condition worse. Treatments for poisonous and non-poisonous lizard bites include:
<strong>1. Treating Non-Poisonous Lizard Bites</strong>
House lizard are certainly not poisonous. So, if youre bitten by a house lizard you dont have to go to hospital.</p>
<p>You can treat yourself at home with simple methods and ingredients to prevent infection and ease the symptoms. Heres what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop the bleeding by applying a little pressure on the bite.</li>
<li>If the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">lizard broke its teeth on the wound</a>, remove them carefully with a pair of tweezers.</li>
<li>Clean the wound with warm water to prevent infection.</li>
<li>Apply a little petroleum jelly on the wound to inhibit bacterial contamination.</li>
<li>If need be, cover the wound with a non-stick bandage.</li>
<li>A cold therapy can help ease pain and inflammation.</li>
<li>If symptoms persist, see a medical doctor.
<strong>2. Treating for Poisonous Lizard Bites</strong>
If youre certain that the lizard is poisonous or you are not sure about that, call for medical assistance - but some
lizards such as
Green Anole are venomous.
Meanwhile here are some home interventions you should try before medical help is available.
<strong>First Aid</strong></li>
<li>Keep calm and remove tight cloths and jewelry. They are hard to remove when swelling begins.</li>
<li>Call poison control hotline. These will help in the correct identification of the lizard and advice you accordingly. You may be asked to send photos of the lizard.</li>
<li>Keep the affected part below the heart level.</li>
<li>Monitor the spread of the venom with 15 minute interval markings.
<strong>What a Medical Specialist Will Do</strong></li>
<li>Cleaning the wound and Removing any lizard teeth</li>
<li>Administration of painkillers, anaesthesia and antibiotics</li>
<li>Performing sawyers extraction to remove the venom</li>
<li>Tetanus injection</li>
<li>Cardiac examination</li>
<li>Pulse monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-know-if-a-lizard-is-poisonous">How Do You Know If A Lizard Is Poisonous?</h2>
<p>Therere only few venomous lizards on earth. Unlike the common house lizards, venomous lizards live in the wild away from humans. Most of them live in burrows and dont come out so often. Here are notable features to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theyre relatively larger than house lizards</li>
<li>Their skin is beaded skin instead of being scally</li>
<li>Can be recognized by their distinct colors i.e black and yellow, black and red or black and orange.</li>
<li>Strong limbs</li>
<li>They exhibit signs of panic. For instance, some lizards will produce a hissing sound. Notably the iguanas will take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on its four limbs.</li>
<li>When they bite, they clamp on until they are forcefully dislodged</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-dislodge-a-lizard-from-a-victim">How to Dislodge a Lizard from a Victim</h2>
<p>Whenever they bite, venomous lizards tend to cling on the victim while they release venom. The powerful jaws on their head makes it hard to detach.</p>
<p>Its advisable not to try to pull the animal as this would leave broken teeth in the victims flesh and cause further tissue damage. Here is what to do.
<strong>Open the Jaws with a Prying Tool -�</strong>
A prying tool such as a pliers or butter knife can be used to force open the jaws, and safely dislodge the lizard from the victim.
<strong>Immerse the Lizard in Water -�</strong>
Immersing the victims body together with the lizard in cold water is a safe way of detaching the animal. Some lizards are protected and so killing them is an offence.
<strong>Flame under the Chin -�</strong>
Another method of getting the lizard from the victims flesh is to slightly apply a flame just below the chin.
<strong>Allow the Lizard to Stand On Its Feet -�</strong>
If the lizard gets good grip on the ground, it may feel secure and release the grip. But this is not a quick method if you want to save the victim from subsequent venoms.</p>
<h2 id="final-word"><strong>Final Word</strong></h2>
<p>Most lizards are non-venomous and will not readily bite you. Even the few venomous lizards bite when provoked or in defense when they feel threatened.</p>
<p>Although the venom can barely kill a human, it can cause serious body reactions. In addition the bite can cause serious tissue damage. So, it good to be on the safe side whenever you encounter such lizards.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May be you have come across various species of lizards in your home, park or zoo and wonder whether they have backbones or not. How could their internal organs be protected or supported? Could they be having similar anatomy as mammals or other animals?
**So, Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates? The simple answer is, all species of <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">Lizard</a> are vertebrates (they have backbone also called the vertebral column/spinal column). **
**The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal regions and sacral apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into caudal and precaudal. **
<strong>The main function of the backbone is to offer protection to the spinal cord. It also provides an option for attachment of body muscles.�</strong>

<h2 id="are-lizards-vertebrates-or-invertebrates">Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates?</h2>
<p>Lizards including
bearded dragons
are vertebrates whose spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal and sacral vertebrae. Some species may have lumbar region too.</p>
<p>The main function of vertebral column in Lizards is to protect the spinal cord (this house the nervous system and aid in body coordination). In addition, the backbone offers support to the body and attachment of muscles, pectoral and pelvic girdle for easier locomotion.</p>
<h3 id="a-vertebral-column-in-lizards">a. Vertebral column in lizards.</h3>
<p>Lizard (apart from legless lizards) have vertebral column also called spinal column or backbone that is divided into four parts i.e. cervical, dorsal, sacral and sacral vertebrae. Some lizard species may also have lumbar region.</p>
<p>These vertebral sub-divisions are formed mainly to help perform a given functions in lizards. The major function of vertebral column it to ensure sufficient protection of spinal cord  which runs vertically and centrally within vertebral column from the head to tail. The spinal cord helps in condonation of the nervous system of the entire lizard.</p>
<p>Related:
Do Lizards Have Teeth?
<strong>i. The cervical vertebrae.</strong>
This vertebra is found at the neck region of the lizards. The cervical vertebrae help support the neck and assist in free movement of the neck  side by side, up and down or around.</p>
<p>The special type of cervical vertebrae called atlas is well adapted to help in nodding while axis allows rotary motion. In most lizards, the vertebral are articulated and fused is such a way that they seem vestigial. In some lizard species, most of these bones are advanced to form dorsal vertebrae.</p>
<p>The cervical vertebrae also provide the option for attachment of neck muscles and skull resting point.
<strong>ii. Dorsal vertebrae.</strong>
This is also called Thoracic vertebrae. The Dorsal vertebrae offer the point for attachment of the ribs. The ribs provide protection for the lungs, heart and the liver. The sternum and scapula are also attached on these vertebrae.</p>
<p>The number of dorsal vertebra varies according to the species. The small lizards such as chameleon lizards and savannah lizards may have 8 to 12 dorsal vertebra. The medium size lizards such as Nile monitor lizards may have 11 to 17 thoracic vertebra while large lizards such as Komodo dragon may have 16 to 25 dorsal vertebra.
<strong>iii. Lumbar Vertebrae.</strong>
These are vertebrae that are found between the dorsal and the sacral vertebral. These vertebrae do not carry any rib. Most lizards do not have Lumbar vertebrae thus their dorsal and sacral vertebrae are directly interconnected.</p>
<p>Lumbar vertebrae are only found in few large lizard species such as monitor lizards and Komodo lizards. The lumbar vertebrae provides an option for the attachment of body muscles. These vertebrae also enable lizards to fold coil easily.
<strong>iv. The Sacral Vertebrae.</strong>
The Sacral vertebral is the found in sacrum section. It is connected with pelvic to offer option for support and attachment of pelvic muscles.</p>
<p>The sacral vertebral has 1 to 7 bones in lizards. The number varies according to the lizard species. The first 3 sacral bones are fuse to form a strong support at the pelvis girdle.</p>
<p>The sacral vertebra has a short stout rib-like protrusion, which offer point of muscle attachment. Moreover, these vertebrae have short arches and spines.
<strong>v. The Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
This is also called the tail vertebrae. In some lizards, the caudal vertebrae are fused with sacral vertebrae. These vertebrae have short stouts on the sizes that provide for the attachment of the muscles. There are 1 to a maximum of 30 caudal vertebra in lizards.</p>
<p>The small-tailed lizards such as stumpy-tailed lizards have few vertebra while long tailed lizards such as skinks, basilisk and chameleon lizards have large number of caudal vertebrae (10 to 30).</p>
<p>The arches and spines in caudal vertebrae continuously decreases up to the last vertebra. The caudal vertebral are adapted to provide easier movement of the tail.</p>

<h3 id="b-the-vertebral-column-of-legless-lizard">b. The Vertebral Column of Legless Lizard.</h3>
<p>Legless lizards are lizard species that have lost their legs independently at a point in life or their legs have reduced into point of no use in locomotion. These lizards crawl on the ground like snakes.</p>
<p>The legless lizard has its backbone divided into two sections i.e. the precaudal and caudal vertebrae. These sections collectively support the lizard and protect the spinal cord from external damage as well as offer support and attachment for body muscles.
<strong>i. Precaudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The precaudal vertebrae consist of bones that are found before the tail/caudal or pelvic region. In precaudal vertebrae, bone are interconnected to form one chain that help the lizards in locomotion.</p>
<p>The cervical, dorsal/thoracic and lumbar are connected into one unit. These vertebrae offer option of attachment of body muscles and the ribs.</p>
<p>Most legless lizards have the first to fifth bones in the precuadal vertebrae fused thus having minimum movement/turning.
<strong>ii. Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The sacral and tail vertebrae in legless lizards are fused to form caudal vertebrae. Legless lizards do not have lumbar vertebrae and pelvic girdle (if any is very small).</p>
<p>The caudal vertebrae forms the tail region, which is powerful for defense action. The first 5 to 10 vertebral bones are fused to give ample strength to the legless lizard at the caudal origin.</p>
<p>The caudal vertebra has stout that protrude laterally to provide option for attachment of back muscles. Moreover, the caudal vertebrae have short spines and arches that decreases gradually till the tip of the tail.</p>
<h3 id="c-functions-of-the-backbonespinal-column">c. Functions of the Backbone/spinal column</h3>
<p>The major function of spinal column in lizards is to protect the spinal cord, which controls the nervous systems. The spinal cord runs vertically from the head to the tail and its centrally located through the hollow sections left along the vertebral column.</p>
<p>The backbone also provides option of attachment of the body muscles and point of growth of other body somatic cells. The muscles grows from the backbone and accumulate enough to help coordinated movement of the lizards.</p>
<p>The backbone provides the point of connections for other appendicular skeleton. The femur, the humerus and scapula are jointed to the backbone using either ball and socket joint or hinge joint to enable easier locomotion. The appendages are interlinked and their entire weight is housed at the backbone.</p>
<p>In addition, the backbone provides extra support and protection to internal organs such as the heart, liver, lungs and intestine. The clavicle, ribs and pelvis girdle are well jointed on the backbone to help in provide further internal protection.</p>
<h2 id="is-lizard-a-reptile-or-amphibian">Is lizard a reptile or amphibian</h2>
<p>All lizards are reptiles including
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-monitor-lizards-poisonous/">monitor lizards</a>
. They are cold-blooded animals (ectothermic). Unlike amphibians (which have smooth and slippery skin), Lizards have skin which is covered with scare  this one features of all reptiles. The following are characteristics/fears of reptiles (lizards):
<strong>1. They are cold blooded</strong>
. This means that their body temperature changes according to the change in temperature on its environment. Because of the ectothermic metabolism of the lizards, they are forced to bask under the sun to raise its body temperature. A warm lizard is more active that a cold one.
<strong>2. Their skin is covered with scale or scutes</strong>
. Reptiles develop hard skin that is made of scale using protein keratin. Reptiles such as turtles and armored crocodile have scutes which form deeper layer under the skin. All lizards skin is covered with scale.
<strong>3. Most reptiles lay eggs.</strong>
Like most reptiles, lizards are oviparous  they lay eggs, which have hard shells. Their eggs are laid mainly on land. Lizards also take care of the eggs until they hatch. The eggs of amphibians (frogs) do not have hard shell. The eggs are enclosed in a jelly substance that offer protection  the female frog never take care of its eggs once laid in water.
<strong>4. They breathe by use of lungs</strong>
. Reptiles (lizards) breathe though the lungs in their entire life  even when in water. Contrary, amphibians such as frogs and toad breath through lungs, skin or gills (at young stage - tadpole).
<strong>5. They have four walking legs (apart from legless lizards)</strong>
. The reptiles (lizards) have four legs that are used for locomotion/walking. Amphibians such as frog, newt or toad have two hind legs for jumping and two front legs adapted for landing. Their legs cant walk as in the case of lizards.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-have-backbones">Do Lizards Have Backbones?</h2>
<p>Yes. Lizards have backbones since they are classified as vertebrates. The backbone is used to give support to body organs, muscles and cells. Moreover, the Backbone of lizards offers option for attachments of body muscles.</p>
<p>The backbone provides point link for appendicular skeleton such as ribs, femur, humerus, sternum or scapula as well as protect internal organs such as heart, lungs, livers and kidneys.</p>
<p>The hard bone spines and arches formed by the spinal column of lizards provide suitable defense tool against its enemies.</p>
<h2 id="major-facts-about-lizard-as-a-reptile">Major facts about Lizard as a reptile.</h2>
<p><strong>1. The Survival Mechanism</strong>
.</p>
<p>Lizards have adapted to living in the harshest conditions without getting extinct due to their feeding diversity. Lizards feeds on variety of food such as small insects, crustaceans, snakes, birds and ever lard animals such as baby turtles.</p>
<p>Lizards such as Komodo dragon and tree crocodile are known for predation culture. They even attack human beings for food.</p>
<p>Lizards are able to camouflage and escape any predator. For example, the chameleon lizards are able to change color randomly to march the background and use this mechanism to escape the predator.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">venomous lizards use the poison to paralyze</a>
their prey before swallowing them. The strong tail of predator lizards is used a weapon to grasp and knock down their prey or defend themselves in case of attack.</p>
<p>Lizards often escape in case they notice dangers to hideouts that make predators difficult to reach them e.g. under the roof, in the thorn bushes or holes/cracks.
<strong>2. The lizard Habitat.</strong>
Lizards are found everywhere in the world. They mostly live on the ground. Lizards do not make nests. You will spot some lizards in trees, marshy areas or riverbanks (Nile monitor and Asian Water monitor)</p>
<p>Though lizards are ectothermic (cold blooded), you will find them in cold region as well as in arid and semi-arid areas e.g. Savannah monitor.
Leopard geckos are crepuscular
.</p>
<p>Lizards such as marine iguanas dwell under the water though they often come to the shore to bask and lay eggs. Lizards, which dwell on trees, have short wide toes that are well adapted to climbing.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All Lizard species are vertebrates. They have backbone, also called the vertebral column/spinal column, whose main function is to protect the spinal cord and offer option for attachment of body muscles and appendicular skeleton.</p>
<p>The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, sacral and vertebrae apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into precaudal and caudal vertebrae.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best substrate for <a href="/posts/best-cages-for-bearded-dragons/">bearded</a> dragons, you can consider things like safety, ease of cleaning, and the natural feel that mimics their
environment
.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-safety-">**1. Safety **</h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Reptile Carpet such as�Zoo Med Eco Cage</strong>
, are designed to minimize the risk of impaction, a common concern with loose substrates.</p>
<p>Reptile Carpet is a non-loose <a href="/posts/best-substrate-for-leopard-gecko/">substrate</a> that provides a solid surface, reducing the chance of your bearded dragon
ingesting harmful particles
. However, it may require frequent cleaning and replacement to maintain hygiene.</p>
<h3 id="2-ease-of-cleaning"><strong>2. Ease of Cleaning</strong></h3>
<p>Some substrates, like
<strong>Tiles</strong>
(e.g.
<strong>SunGrow, Reptile Mat,</strong>
slate or ceramic tiles), are incredibly easy to clean. Tiles are non-absorbent and can be easily wiped down or removed for thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>Additionally, they help in keeping your bearded dragon&rsquo;s claws trimmed. However, they might lack the natural feel of loose substrates.</p>
<h3 id="3-natural-feel"><strong>3. Natural Feel</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Play Sand</strong>
, provide a more natural feel that closely mimics the desert environment of bearded dragons. Play Sand is loose and allows for natural digging behavior, which is beneficial for the mental stimulation of your pet.</p>
<p>However, it can pose a risk of impaction if ingested and may require regular monitoring and cleaning to avoid bacterial growth.</p>
<h3 id="4-temperature-regulation"><strong>4. Temperature Regulation</strong></h3>
<p>Some substrates, like
<strong>Coconut Fiber</strong>
(e.g., Eco Earth), offer good insulation and help maintain humidity levels within the enclosure. Coconut Fiber retains moisture well, which can be beneficial in dry climates.</p>
<p>However, it may not be ideal for desert-dwelling reptiles like bearded dragons, who require lower humidity levels.</p>
<h3 id="5-cost-effectiveness"><strong>5. Cost-Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>Some substrates, like
<strong>Paper Towels</strong>
, are highly cost-effective. Paper Towels are inexpensive, easy to replace, and do not pose a risk of impaction.</p>
<p>However, they do not provide a natural appearance and may require frequent changes to maintain cleanliness.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anole lizards, often referred to as &ldquo;Anoles,&rdquo; are common in many households and outdoor environments. Known for their vibrant colors and territorial behaviors, these small reptiles are often a source of curiosity. One common question people ask is whether anole lizards bite. In this article, we&rsquo;ll explore the possibility of anole lizards biting and when it might happen.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-anole-lizards">Understanding Anole Lizards</h2>
<p>Anole lizards are part of the
<em>Polychrotidae</em>
family and are commonly found in the southeastern United States, the Caribbean, and Central America. They come in different colors, with the green anole being the most well-known. These lizards are typically small, with some species reaching lengths of around 5 to 8 inches.
While anole lizards are generally non-aggressive, their behavior can vary depending on the situation. They are more likely to exhibit territorial behavior, especially during the mating season, or when they feel threatened. Anole lizards use their vibrant colors to communicate, and males often puff up their dewlaps (throat flaps) to assert dominance.</p>
<h3 id="1-do-anole-lizards-bite-humans">1. Do Anole Lizards Bite Humans?</h3>
<p>Although anole lizards are not known for being aggressive towards humans, they can bite in certain situations. Typically, these bites are not harmful and are more of a defensive response. If an anole feels threatened or cornered, it may bite in an attempt to escape. The bite is not strong and rarely breaks the skin, but it can be startling for the person handling the lizard.</p>
<h3 id="2-when-do-anole-lizards-bite">2. When Do Anole Lizards Bite?</h3>
<p>Anole lizards may bite in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>**When they feel threatened:**If an anole feels it is in danger or being handled too roughly, it may bite as a defensive mechanism.</li>
<li>**During territorial disputes:**Male anoles, especially during mating season, may bite other males in an attempt to defend their territory.</li>
<li>**When they are startled:**If an anole is caught off guard or feels trapped, it may bite out of instinct to protect itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-do-anole-lizard-bites-hurt">3. Do Anole Lizard Bites Hurt?</h3>
<p>Anole bites are typically not painful. The bite is more of a nip and is unlikely to cause any significant harm. The lizard&rsquo;s teeth are small and pointed, so while it may feel like a mild pinch, the bite is rarely severe enough to draw blood or cause lasting damage. However, some individuals may experience mild irritation or discomfort after a bite, especially if the bite occurs in a sensitive area.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-to-avoid-getting-bitten-by-an-anole">4. How to Avoid Getting Bitten by an Anole</h3>
<p>To prevent getting bitten by an anole lizard, it is important to handle them gently and with respect. Here are some tips to avoid bites:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Approach calmly:**Avoid sudden movements or loud noises that may startle the anole.</li>
<li>**Avoid cornering them:**Anoles may bite if they feel trapped or unable to escape. Always allow the lizard to move freely.</li>
<li>**Use proper handling techniques:**If you must handle the anole, gently support its body and avoid holding it too tightly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-what-to-do-if-you-are-bitten">5. What to Do If You Are Bitten?</h3>
<p>If an anole does bite, it is generally not a cause for concern. Clean the bite area with soap and water to avoid infection. If the bite causes any discomfort, you can apply an antiseptic cream. In rare cases, if the bite leads to an allergic reaction or significant swelling, seek medical attention.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Anole lizards do have the ability to bite, but it is rare and typically happens in self-defense. If you avoid handling them too roughly and respect their space, bites are unlikely to occur. If bitten, the bite is usually harmless and can be treated easily. These fascinating reptiles are mostly non-aggressive, and with proper care, they can make great pets without posing a risk to humans.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lizards are fascinating creatures, and their diverse dietary preferences reflect their adaptability to different environments.</p>
<p>The question of whether lizards eat snails can be answered with a resounding &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; though the specifics of this feeding behavior depend on various factors, including the species of
<a href="https://ucanr.edu/sites/MarinMG/files/116745.pdf">lizards</a>
, their natural habitat, and the availability of other food sources.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the dietary habits of lizards, their relationship with snails as prey, and the broader ecological role both animals play.</p>
<h2 id="lizards-and-their-dietary-preferences">Lizards and Their Dietary Preferences</h2>
<p>Lizards belong to a diverse group of reptiles, encompassing over 6,000 species worldwide. Depending on their species, they can be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.</p>
<p>Most lizards that prey on snails are typically insectivores or carnivores, feeding on a variety of small animals, including insects, worms, spiders, and, in some cases, snails.�Certain lizards have a specialized diet that includes specific prey, while others are opportunistic feeders that consume whatever is readily available.</p>
<p>In the wild, food scarcity often pushes lizards to diversify their diet, including feeding on snails, particularly when they are abundant. This is especially true in environments where snails are easy to catch and offer a good source of nutrition.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-lizards-eat-snails">Why Do Lizards Eat Snails?</h2>
<p>Snails provide an excellent source of protein and other essential nutrients for lizards. Their soft bodies, though protected by a hard shell, are rich in energy, making them an attractive food option for many <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> species.</p>
<p>Moreover, snails are relatively easy to catch because of their slow movement, and lizards can easily overpower them.�The availability of snails often depends on environmental factors, such as moisture and temperature.</p>
<p>Snails tend to thrive in humid conditions, which makes them abundant in environments like forests, gardens, and wetlands. Lizards living in these habitats may naturally encounter snails more frequently and incorporate them into their diet.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-lizards-that-eat-snails">Types of Lizards That Eat Snails</h2>
<p>While not all lizard species eat snails, several species and
baby lizards
are known to do so, particularly those that dwell in areas where snails are abundant. Lets explore some of the lizards that are likely to include snails in their diet.
<strong>1. Skinks:</strong>
Skinks are one of the most well-known groups of lizards that frequently feed on snails. These small, smooth-scaled reptiles are found in various habitats, from deserts to forests. Skinks are generally insectivorous but will not hesitate to eat snails when available. Their strong jaws help them crush the snails shell, allowing them access to the soft body inside.
<strong>2. Anoles:</strong>
Anoles are another group of lizards that might occasionally eat snails. Native to the southeastern United States, Caribbean, and parts of South America, anoles are small, agile lizards that primarily feed on insects. However, larger anole species, such as the Cuban brown anole, may also eat snails if they are easy to catch.
<strong>3. Geckos:</strong>
Geckos, particularly larger species, may also eat snails. These nocturnal lizards, known for their ability to climb vertical surfaces, typically feed on insects, but they are opportunistic feeders. If snails are readily available in their habitat, geckos may include them in their diet.
<strong>4. Monitor Lizards:</strong>
Large lizards, such as monitor lizards, are known to eat a variety of prey, including snails. Monitors are powerful carnivores that can hunt larger animals, but they are also skilled at scavenging and foraging for smaller prey. Snails, though a small meal for these large reptiles, can be a convenient source of nutrition in environments where food is scarce.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-lizards-eat-snails">How Do Lizards Eat Snails?</h2>
<p>The act of eating snails requires some specific adaptations, particularly when it comes to dealing with the snails protective shell. Many lizards that eat snails have strong, sharp teeth or jaws that allow them to break through the shell to reach the soft flesh inside.</p>
<p>For instance, skinks are known for their ability to crush snail shells with their strong jaws. Once the shell is broken, the lizard consumes the snails body, leaving the broken shell behind. In some cases, lizards may even swallow smaller snails whole, shell and all, allowing their stomach acids to break down the calcium-rich shell.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-impact-of-lizards-eating-snails">Ecological Impact of Lizards Eating Snails</h2>
<p>Lizards play an important role in the ecosystem by regulating populations of smaller animals, including snails. By consuming snails, lizards help control snail populations, which can be beneficial in both natural and agricultural environments.</p>
<p>In gardens and farms, for instance, snails are often considered pests because they feed on a variety of plants, causing
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">venomous</a>
to crops and ornamental vegetation. Lizards that feed on snails can act as a natural form of pest control, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>This predator-prey relationship helps maintain ecological balance and prevents any one species from becoming too dominant.�Additionally, the consumption of snails by lizards contributes to the nutrient cycle in ecosystems.</p>
<p>By feeding on snails, lizards facilitate the transfer of energy and nutrients up the food chain. The calcium in snail shells, for instance, is a valuable nutrient for lizards, helping them maintain healthy bones and eggshells during reproduction.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, lizards do eat snails, though the frequency with which they do so depends on factors such as species, habitat, and availability of other prey. Snails provide a rich source of protein and nutrients for lizards, making them a valuable food item in certain environments.</p>
<p>Lizards that are capable of overcoming the protective snail shell, such as skinks, geckos, and anoles, often include snails as part of their diet.�The consumption of snails by lizards is not only beneficial for the reptiles themselves but also has broader ecological implications.</p>
<p>By controlling snail populations, lizards contribute to the balance of ecosystems and help reduce the impact of snails on plants and crops. This predator-prey dynamic exemplifies the interconnectedness of species within an ecosystem and highlights the important role that lizards play in maintaining biodiversity.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably you have come across various species of lizards in your home, compound, fields, yards, or zoo and wonder if they have bones. How then are their body muscles supported?��So,
<em>do lizards have bones?�</em>
<strong>The direct answer is, YES, all **
lizards are vertebrates
** that have bones that are interconnected together to help them in locomotion.�</strong>
<strong>The bones of lizards are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton. These bones offer support, protection of internal organs, and options for attachment of body muscles and cells. The number of each bone varies according to size and species of lizard.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-do-lizards-have-bones">Details: Do Lizards Have Bones?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860302/">Lizards, like other reptiles, have bones</a>
. Their bones are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton. The appendicular skeleton consists of the pelvic girdle, the pectoral, the limbs, and the bones of the front and hind legs.</p>
<p>The axial skeleton form the central axis of the lizards body. It comprises the skull, the dorsal/thoracic cage and the vertebral column.</p>
<p>The two skeleton structures are interconnected and plays a great role in protecting the inners body organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and intestines as well as the spinal cord (vital). Moreover, they provide suitable support of the body and enhances easier locomotion.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-functions-of-bones-in-lizards">What are the functions of Bones in Lizards?</h2>
<p>The following are main functions of bones in lizards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protecting the spinal cord - the vertebral column bones.</li>
<li>Protecting the brains and cerebral system - the skull.</li>
<li>Protecting providing option for attachment of internal organs such as digestive organs, heart, kidney, liver and lungs (ribs).</li>
<li>Provides option for attachment of the body muscles  axial skeleton, pelvic and pectoral girdle.</li>
<li>Help in locomotion/movement  the appendicular skeleton  femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, scapula, metacarpals, and metatarsals.</li>
<li>For grasping and grinding over the surface  the phalanges, metatarsals and metacarpals - including<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">lizard teeth</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-many-bones-does-a-lizard-have">How Many Bones Does a Lizard Have?</h2>
<p>Lizard species have different varying number of bones due to their difference in sizes. However, the skeleton of lizard has 28 specialized bones, which work collective to offer protection and locomotion effectively.</p>
<p>These bones include the vertebral column (caudal, sacral, lumbar, thoracic/dorsal and cervical vertebrae), the sternum, the scapula, the tarsals, metatarsal, carpal, metacarpal, tibia, fibula, ulna, radius, ribs, mandibles, maxilla and the phalanges.</p>
<p>Most lizards have 100 to 300 bones while large lizards such as Tree crocodile may have more. On the other hand, small lizards such as gecko may have less than 100 bones.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-have-bones-in-their-tails">Do Lizards Have Bones in Their Tails?</h2>
<p>Yes! Lizards have bones in their tail. The tail which is formed from the caudal vertebrae contain bones, ligaments, nerves, vasculature and tail muscles which gives it the tail power.</p>
<p>The tail of most lizards get detached easily when held. The Fracture of the tail vertebrae usually occurs at the fracture plane leaving behind flesh tail tissue to heal.</p>
<p>The cut tail is not easily returned in lizards  thus most of lizard species wont grow their tail back (remain tailless) - check
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5484412/">lizard tail bones regeneration</a>
.</p>
<p>Though a few lizard species show lateral growth of detached tail, the tail may not be as functional as the original tail. The First 3 bones in the lizard caudal vertebrae are fused to give it tail power. In case the tail detachment occurs past these three bones, there is normally no regrowth that can occur in most cases.</p>
<p>Lizards lack the tail autotomy and cannot be treated once their cut tail. Ensure you hold your pet lizard from below at the chest region (not lifting it by the tail).</p>
<h3 id="a-appendicular-skeleton">a. Appendicular Skeleton.</h3>
<p>The appendicular skeleton in lizards comprises of the bones that form the front and the hind legs plus the pelvic girdle and pectoral girdle from which the limbs are attached to the axial skeleton. These bones collectively coordinate the lizards movement.
<strong>1. Pectoral girdle.</strong>
This consist of two main bones, that is, the scapula and the collarbone also called clavicle. The clavicle is s-shaped <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-bones/">bone</a>, which articulates with the sternum at the front chest of the lizard. The clavicle also joins the scapula at the end of lizards shoulder.</p>
<p>Its main function is to support the scapula. Lizards have two collarbones  each jointed at the sternum and scapula.�Scapula is a bone that articulates with humerus and aid in the shoulder movement of lizard.</p>
<p>Scapula has a wide v-shaped surface area that offers an option for attachment of the neck and back muscles that coordinates the movement of joints. Lizards have two scapula  one for each front leg/limb.
<strong>2. Front Legs.</strong>
Lizards have two front legs. Each leg has similar and equal number of bones as the other. Humerus (limb) joins scapula at the shoulder articulation point.</p>
<p>Then, the two leg bones (ulna and radius) join humerus at the sigmoid notch. At the end of ulna and radius lay carpal bones, which allow rotary movement of the arm.</p>
<p>The Carpals extent to form the metacarpal bones (bones at the palm of the arm) and phalanx bones (the bones that allows the folding of the arm). The phalanges are jointed to help the lizards when grasping the prey.</p>
<p>The bones at the front legs of lizards function to coordinate in the locomotion and grasping the prey. In addition, they provide option for attachment of front leg muscles.
<strong>3. Pelvic girdle.</strong>
The Pelvic girdle has three bones that provide an option for the attachment of the lizards hind legs. The three bones are the pubis (front), ischium (back) and ilium (wing). The pelvic girdle also provides the surface for attachment of back muscles.</p>
<p>Most lizard species have their pelvic girdle fused and linked to the axial skeleton at the caudal vertebrae except in large lizards such as Komodo Dragon and Tree Crocodile Monitor and
bearded dragons� do they eat tomatoes?
.</p>
<p>In small lizards, the femur is connected directly to the axial skeleton through the ball and socket joint at the sacral vertebrae.
<strong>4. Hind legs.</strong>
Lizards have two hind legs. Each leg has equal number and similar bone type as the other. The Hind leg is joined to pelvic girdle at caudal vertebrae using the femur  which has the ball shaped end to allow the notch rotary motion.</p>
<p>At the end of femur, there is a patella bone, which helps form the knee joint. The leg is extended using two bones called tibia (larger) and fibular (smaller). These two bones function to support the weight of lizards and offer
<a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3013">option for attachment of leg muscles</a>
.</p>
<p>At the end of tibia and fibula lay tarsal bones that allows two-way motion of the arm. These bones are connected to metatarsal bones (metatarsals are elongated bones and forms base of lizards foot). At the end of metatarsals are phalanx bones. The phalanges are jointed and form the toes, which help in grasping on the ground, trees or rocks when walking.</p>
<h3 id="b-axial-skeleton">b. Axial Skeleton.</h3>
<p>The axial skeleton comprises of the skull, the dorsal/thoracic cage and the vertebral column. Axial skeleton forms the central axis of the lizards. The major function of axial skeleton is to offer point for the attachment of the appendicular skeleton and protect the spinal cord (spinal cord is responsible for nervous system coordination).
<strong>1. The skull.</strong>
Skull is a bony structure, which forms the head. The lizards skull is divided into several bones, which include the facial bones, the cranial bones, the hyoid bone and auditory ossicles.</p>
<p>The skull also contain the lower jaw (mandible - the only movable bone) and maxillae. The meninges (head hard skin and muscles) grow and merge with the lizards body skin.</p>
<p>Major functions of the skull is to protect the brain  which is be most sensitive part of the body coordination system.
<strong>2. Cervical Vertebrae</strong>
The cervical vertebrae consist of vertebra found at the lizards neck region. The first two cervical vertebra (atlas and axis) are specialized to help the nodding of head (atlas) and rotary motion of the head (axis).</p>
<p>Other vertebra are fused making the neck region of lizard stiff while some advance to form thoracic vertebrae. The cervical vertebrae also offer option for attachment of neck muscles.
<strong>3. Thoracic/dorsal vertebrae.</strong>
The dorsal vertebrae, also called thoracic vertebrae, is found at the chest region of the lizards. The vertebra provides option for the attachment of the ribs (ribs protects internal organs such as lungs, heart and livers from external damage).</p>
<p>The end of each rid is attached to sternum (breastbone) that is located at the front chest region. The number of ribs and vertebra varies from one lizard species to another. Large lizards like Tree Crocodile monitor and Komodo Drago have 15 to 24 vertebra, the medium sized lizard lizards have 10 to 16 dorsal vertebra while small lizards such as savannah and chameleon lizards have 7 to 11 thoracic vertebrae.</p>
<p>Each dorsal vertebra is connected to two ribs (one on either side).� The dorsal vertebral provides option for the attachment of the back muscles.</p>
<p>Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">Are Lizards Poisonous?</a>
<strong>4. Lumbar Vertebrae.</strong>
Most lizard species do not have lumbar vertebrae apart from the large lizards such as Komodo dragon and Asian water monitor lizards. The lumbar vertebra do not have the ribs attached. This region is where the stomach lay and provides option for the lizards to coil effectively during attacks.
<strong>5. Sacral Vertebrae.</strong>
The sacral vertebrae are found at the sacral section (sacrum). The pelvic girdle is jointed with the sacral vertebrae and offers large surface area for attachment of back muscles. The Lizards have 1 to 7 sacral vertebra. However, larger species can have 3 to 5 more vertebra.</p>
<p>Small and middle-sized lizards such as Nike water lizards, savannah lards and house lizards have their sacral vertebra fused to form caudal vertebrae.
<strong>6. Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The caudal vertebrae, also called tail vertebrae, is what forms the tail of the lizards. Caudal vertebrae has bones that decrease in size up to the last one. Each vertebra has two short protruding ribs that provide surface for attachment of tail muscles.</p>
<p>The caudal vertebra has short spines and arches. Long-tailed lizards such as Basilisk, chameleon lizards and skinks have 10 to 32 caudal vertebrae while small-tailed lizards have 1 to 10 caudal vertebrae.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>All Lizard species have bones that are collectively linked to aid them in protection and locomotion. The bones are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton.</p>
<p>Main functions of the bones include support, protection of internal organs and offer options for attachment of body muscles. �The total number of bones vary according to size and species of lizard. Lizards have an average of 28 specialized bones.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably youve seen a <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> running around your house or yard. So, youre wondering whether these reptiles can bite you, other humans, in your residence, or even pets.</p>
<p>Further, how do these lizards even feed  with or without teeth? So, do lizards have teeth?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The short answer is, YES! Lizards have teeth that are well adapted to the type of food they eat. The dentition of lizards varies from one species to another within the taxonomic family where some have pleurodont teeth formation while others have acrodont teeth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The shape of their teeth is either conical, pointed, or serrated to help them grip the prey and push it into the digestive tract. Lizards do not have alveoli or tooth sockets in their dentition. Some lizard species have venom ducts connected to their tooth roots to help paralyzed their prey.�</strong>

<h2 id="do-lizards-have-teeth---reptile-dentition">Do Lizards Have Teeth? - Reptile Dentition</h2>
<p>Lizards have teeth that are well adapted to the type of food they eat. Lizards,
<strong>unlike mammals which have several types of teeth</strong>
, have all their teeth similar (one type) except a few species.</p>
<p>Normally, lizards do not have teeth sockets or alveoli. Their teeth are either acrodont or pleurodont.
<strong>1. Acrodont teeth classification.</strong>
In this classification, the teeth are superficially fused to the tooth-bearing bone usually at the biting edges of the maxilla and mandibles.</p>
<p>Particularly, this fusion should be handled with care (by lizard owners) since acrodont dentition is not replaceable on removal. However, only young lizards can have their acrodont teeth replaced.</p>
<p>The acrodont teeth are weak and easily lost. With wear and tear resulting from biting, their jawbones are left exposed or sometimes bleeding due to abrasive action.</p>
<p>Lizards possessing the acrodont type of teeth include Agamid lizards like water dragons, bearded dragons, and chameleons. �Acrodont class is highly susceptible to diseases such as periodontal.
<strong>2. Pleurodont teeth classification.</strong>
This is the main type of dentition that is found in most lizards. The teeth are attached to the interior side of the jawbone creating a wider surface that offers strong fusion as compared to the acrodont type.</p>
<p>The teeth are often replaced in the lifetime of lizards while others may be swallowed with the prey during feeding. Some lizards may grow numerous teeth in their palate.</p>
<p>The front acrodont teeth are shed off and replaced often since they are frequently involved in grasping, biting, and holding the prey when feeding as compared to the posterior teeth.</p>
<p>The sharpness and shape of the pleurodont class lizards vary from species to species. The majority of lizards have short, sharp-pointed, and conical-shaped pleurodont teeth.</p>
<p>Some lizards like Kamodo Dragons have curved and serrated teeth that can cut hard flesh causing serious breeding on biting.</p>
<p>Molluscivores such as Nile Monitor and Caiman Lizard have teeth that are flat, blunt, and rounded. These teeth also have crowns, at the back of the jaw, adapted to the crushing of crustaceans such as clams and snails.</p>
<p>Venomous lizards, also known as heloderma, have a large longitudinal fold or groove in the interior part of each lower jaw tooth that helps in storing venom used to paralyze the prey.</p>
<p>Lizards that are herbivores such as iguana have wide and flat teeth crown with serrated sides adapted to plant feeding.
<strong>The pleurodont class</strong>
of lizard teeth is mainly found in monitor lizards, iguanas, anoles, basilisks, and chuckwallas.
<strong>3. Thecodont teeth classification.</strong>
This type of teeth is mainly found in other reptiles such as snakes, crocodiles,s and all mammals. Importantly, the thecodont teeth are easily confused with the pleurodont and acrodont types in reptiles - you must therefore be keen.</p>
<p>However, the thecodont type of teeth is characterized by well-established, deep bony sockets which hold into place teeth that are replaceable in a given order and cycle according to the individual animal species.</p>
<p>Thecodont is firmly adapted for strong grasping without being shed off.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-teeth-do-lizards-have">How Many Teeth Do Lizards Have?</h2>
<p>Different species of lizards have a varying number of teeth from the young stage to adulthood. These lizard species include:</p>
<ol>
<li>This type usually has an average of 20 to 30 teeth in each quadrant. At maturity, iguana would have a total of 80 to 120 teeth.</li>
<li>**Nile Monitor.**Its teeth are classified into: premaxillary teeth are 9, each maxilla has 10 to 11 teeth and each dentary has 11 to 12 teeth that are well adapted to crushing and grinding food.</li>
<li>**Kamodo Dragon. **It has approximately 60 teeth protruding one inch from the jawbone. The teeth are sharp-pointed and cause serious harm on a single bite.</li>
<li>Apart from few exceptions, an average Gecko has approximately 50 to 100 teeth. However, a leaf-tailed Gecko has 300 or more teeth  the largest number of teeth ever found in lizards.</li>
<li>The number of teeth found in skinks is not defined in various species available. However, the minimum number of teeth you can get in a given skink is 20 while the highest number is 90 teeth on average.</li>
<li>An adult chameleon has 32 to 44 teeth on average. However, these are not the number of teeth it has during death. Most of the front teeth are worn out or removed due to grasping and biting, leaving behind a roughjawbone.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-are-lizards-teeth-used-for">What are Lizards Teeth Used For?</h2>
<p>Lizards Teeth can be used in any of the following functions:
<strong>1. For Feeding.</strong>
These are the primary functions. Lizards use teeth to grasp, bite, and coarse the food/prey before swallowing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The teeth also help in preventing the prey from slipping away during feeding.</li>
<li>Some lizard species use their teeth to cut prey into small sizes that would facilitate easier swallowing.
Normally, Lizards dont chew their food; instead, they swallow in bits.
<strong>2. For Protection/Defense.</strong>
Lizards use their teeth for defense in case of danger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Veterinary examination shows that young lizards make rapid snaps when agitated or stressed as they try to bite while large adult lizards make deep cut when biting and use their tails to knock off their enemy.
<strong>3. Aid in Mating.</strong>
During the copulation period, male lizards latch on the female. It bites the females back, head, or neck to gain the ample stability needed during mating.</p>
<p>The Iguana lizards are more aggressive as compared to other species since the female produces pheromones during the menstrual cycle that attracts the male often.</p>
<h2 id="do-baby-lizards-have-teeth">Do Baby Lizards Have Teeth?</h2>
<p>Yes! Young lizards are hatched with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-lizards-eat/">teeth in place for eating</a>
. As the lizard grows and near maturity, the teeth increase in number. The Pleurodont class of lizards is able to shed off and replace their teeth regularly up to 6 times a year.</p>
<p>Contrary, the acrodont class of lizards do not replace their teeth once they are shed off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, special care should be taken (by owners) when handling these species of lizards.</li>
<li>The teeth of baby lizards are adapted to feeding on soft food substances.
Though they can grasp, the teeth are usually not strong enough to cause any substantial resistance against their prey. So, most of the young lizards are fed by their mothers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-lizard-bite-human-being">Can Lizard Bite Human Being?</h2>
<p>Lizards, usually, will bite you if they feel threatened or when they are stressed. Some of these bites are not injurious (are harmless) while some
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizards are poisonous</a>
and may infect you, your humans, and pets badly.</p>
<p>Iguanas, Monitor lizards, and Nile monitors are some of the lizards that are rampant in biting when threatened or stressed.</p>
<p>Normally, Lizards dont attack human beings. They live a cohesive and associative life with the human being thus becoming a nice pet to have.</p>
<p>However, research shows that lizards at times rebel, a special class of people such as veterinarians, when undergoing medical checkups  they try to defend themselves by biting back.</p>
<p>In case a lizard bites you, it is necessary to seek medical attention from the hospital.</p>
<p>However, most of the bits from house lizards (Geckos) are mild scraps that can be attended at home using a home fast aid kit.</p>
<p>NB:

<p>All lizards have teeth. The teeth of young lizards increase in number as they grow to their adulthood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Importantly, lizards have either acrodont or pleurodont type of teeth that are well adapted to feeding, mating, or defense.</li>
<li>Lizards rarely bite human beings. Their bites are usually harmless though there are few species that have venom that may cause infections.
Lizards are generally harmless thus can be nice pets if taken care of well.</li>

these vertebrate
s live. Could House Lizards live just like human beings or survive for a couple of weeks?
<em>So, whats the house lizards lifespan?�</em>
**The simple answer is, house lizard live for 4 to 6 years on average. However, this lifespan is subject to factors such as the care given, environment/climate and availability of basic needs for the house lizard. **
<strong>Some house lizards may even live slightly longer than 6 years if the above factors are maintained. On the other hand, skin shedding problems and wounding occurrences may lower the lifespan of the house lizards.�</strong>

<h2 id="whats-the-house-lizard-lifespan">What&rsquo;s the House Lizard Lifespan?</h2>
<p>The house lizard (also known as house gecko) has a life span of 4 to 6 years on average. This period is subjects to factors such as environment/climate, care given and availability of basic needs.
Most of the house lizards are faced with problems of wounding and skin shedding which lower their life span. For those house lizards that are well taken care of, they live slightly longer than 6 years.
The oldest House Lizard that ever lived recorded 27 years. House lizards are known to hatch in 60 days after which they grow to maturity in a couple of months (12 months) before breeding.

What Does a Garden Lizard Eat?</p>
<h2 id="general-factors-that-affect-the-lifespan-of-house-lizard"><strong>General Factors that affect the Lifespan of House Lizard</strong></h2>
<p>The lifespan of the House lizard is affected by the following factors.
<strong>1. Environment/Climatic conditions.</strong>
House lizards are known to live in warm environment. Being cold blooded (ectothermic), these reptiles are adversely affected by change in temperature (sudden rise or fall). You must ensure that your pet house lizard has suitable/optimal warmth in its cage.
House lizards living in cold climates live lesser years as compare to those living in warm temperate climate. This is because cold environment makes house lizards less active (inactive) forcing them to hibernate till summer.
The environment full of predators such as cats, dogs, snakes, skinks etc. posts risks to life house lizards. Most of house lizards are fed on by their predators before they reach full maturity. Large water bodies easily drown the house lizards since they tend to
walk on water instead of swimming
.
Very hot climate/environment like desert will kill the house lizards faster due to their ectothermic nature. Their body enzymes (protein in nature) are denatured by high temperature leading to death.
<strong>2. Availability of basic needs.</strong>
House lizards requires basic needs such as proper habitat, food and water and right care. The habitat should entail nice cage with proper lighting and temperature. The cage should also have a hideout option for your house lizard and comfortable beddings (leaves or plant materials that does not cause discomfort).
The presence of food and water is vital for the survival of house lizard. Provide a variety of food such as crickets, ants, flies, leafhoppers, mealworms, grasshoppers, moths, soft shell beetles, pupae of butterflies and moths to your pet house lizard. Lizards that lack enough food and water die earlier (short life span  less than 18 months)
Provide the right amount of water for your house lizard in shallow bowls and make sure you replace it regularly. You can even provide a small pod in the cage for your house lizard to swim. Lack of right basic needs for your house lizard will reduce its life span.
<strong>3. Care given.</strong>
Proper care is vital for the house lizard if you need to boost its lifespan.� Ensure that you take your pet house lizards to veterinary regularly. Monitor the health of your house lizard every 48 hours. Clean the cage regularly and quarantine new pet house lizards for the first one to two months.
Provide stimulation such as mist spay that cause house lizards to relax and active within the cage. You can have rocks, hollows, plants and hideouts within the cage. You can even hide food for your house lizard to make it do something else.
House lizards that have been given continuous proper care have lived even more than 6 years.</p>
<h2 id="health-problems-that-affect-the-lifespan-of-house-lizard"><strong>Health Problems That Affect the Lifespan of House Lizard�</strong></h2>
<p>The following are problems that affects the lifespan of the House Lizards mostly:
<strong>1. Wounding Problem.</strong>
House lizards have soft skin that is easily wounded. Scratch from the walls or spikes on the house lizards skin cause mild to severe wounds.
Normally, House Lizards would prefer to roll on soft surfaces. You must ensure that the substrate in the cage does not cause injuries on landing or while moving about. You can also provide some soft beddings in your House lizards hideout.
House lizard are easily wounded when they fall due to their soft skin. Their skin also get ruptured by impact force. The scratch from the paws of the other lizards while playing cause back and skin wounds. These would leads to severe bleeding and their autotomy nature (self-amputation of tail in case of danger) may lead to death if not attended.
Lizards that are often wounded have lower lifespan (1 to 2 years) whereas those house lizards that are less wounded have longer lifespan (4 to 6 years).�NB: In case your pet lizards are wounded, seek quick medication from your vet.
<strong>2. Skin Shedding Problem.</strong>
House Lizards do shed their skin often (after every 4 to 6 weeks). They, then, eat their skin such that you may not notice easily. However, their skin color change can be noticed.
Contrary, some house lizards have problem while shedding their skin. You will notice a thick/excess skin at the neck, back/dorsal, tail, at the head and around the eye due to the unshed skin. This skin cause extreme pain, unhappiness and continued discomfort to your house lizard.
Seek your veterinary assistance to help remove excess unshed skin on your pet house lizard.
<strong>3. Loss of Tail.</strong>
House lizards have tendency of losing their tail in case of attack as a defense mechanism. This cause the gecko to lose a lot of energy during replacement. In addition, the regeneration of the tail takes longer and makes your house lizard less active as compared to other tailed house lizards.
In case your house lizard undergoes through a several loss of tail, it will die earlier (less than 2 years) than its expected time even if normal care is carried out.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-bones/">Do lizards have bones</a>
?
To prolong the lifespan of your pet house lizard, do not hold it by the tail. Instead, lift your house lizard by the chest. Moreover, do not cause tension to your house lizard while in its cage too.</p>
<h2 id="weird-life-behaviors-of-house-lizard">Weird Life Behaviors of House Lizard</h2>
<p>House lizard has several weird behaviors that you may need to know. These behaviors include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eating their own shed skin</strong>. Gecko eat their skin -<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">using their teeth</a>- as soon as it is shed. You may not notice that, however, you will find a change in its new skin color.</li>
<li>**Female is parthenogenesis.**This mean that the female house lizard does not need a male to reproduce always. It have ability to reproduce without mating with male. However, it has been found that such offspring lack a certain gene needed for diversity.</li>
<li>**Lack eyelids and lick their eyes.**Unlike human beings, house lizards do not have eyelids. Instead, their eyelids forms a colorless membrane that protect the eyes. To moisten the eyes when dry, the house lizard licks them often unlike in human where eyes are moisten automatically by the eyelids.</li>
<li>**Have autonomy capability.**This means that house lizards can cause self-amputation of their tail. This is done when the gecko detects danger during which it uses this method as a defense mechanism since the predator your tend feed on the tail and let go the lizard.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>House lizards have a lifespan of 4 to 6 years on average. However, this period is subject to factors such as care given, environment/climate and availability of basic needs for the house lizards.
Some House lizards may even live slightly longer than 6 years under proper care. Skin shedding problems and wounding occurrences may lower the lifespan of the house lizards. Consult your vet on your gecko care always.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How Do Lizards Mate? Maybe you have pet lizards at home or have seen one and wishes to know how they mate. Do they court like human being before mating? Well, in this article we shall answer the question, How Do Lizards Mate?
*During Mating, the male <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> (vertebrates) clings on the females back and support itself by biting the females neck. Then, the male lizards connects is hemipenes/male organ to the females cloaca (female organ) and pours its sperms that move up the oviduct to fertilize the ova (female egg). *
<em>However, before mating, the male and female may have 1 to 2 months of courtship during the mating season (spring). After fertilization, the lizard (Savannah, monitor, iguana, or Komodo dragon) lays eggs, which hatch into baby lizards in 4 to 8 weeks.�</em>

<h2 id="details-how-do-lizards-mate-and-reproduce"><strong>Details: How Do Lizards Mate and Reproduce?</strong></h2>
<p>Lizards undergo the following steps/stage during mating. Contrary, some viviparous lizards such as the blue-tongue skink and Solomon Island skink give live birth to their baby lizards.</p>
<h2 id="step-1how-lizards-attract-their-mate-for-sex-mating---courtship">Step 1:<strong>How lizards attract their mate for sex (mating - courtship)</strong></h2>
<p>Before mating, lizards court for 1 to 60 days to create a strong friendship/bond and form a royal pair that may last them their entire lifetime. During this time, there are some of things/techniques that lizards (either male or female) use to attract their mate for copulation or coitus. These may include:
<strong>1. Tactile commination�</strong>
Some lizards such as monitor lizards use touch as a way of attracting their mates to sexual engagement. The Komodo dragon likes to lick its female mate to see if its sexually ready or responsive.
The direct touch is used severally by lizards to create a close bond -

.
<strong>2. Auditory calls�</strong>
The lizards use the auditory call to entice the mate they intend to court with. Many lizards may not use this method since the predators may take advantage and catch/trace them using auditory call signals.
However, Tokay Gecko are known to use auditory calls when looking for courting mate. But
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/421925v1.abstract">Male Anolis**lizards�**prefer virgin females.</a>
<strong>3. Use of visual display�</strong>
The lizards mostly use visual displays such as, swaging of tail, changing of colors, frequent gapping of the mouth, moving of the tongue, special body posture, head bobbing as well as inflation and push-ups to attract its mate for courtship.
Flying lizards and Anoles lizards, males have well-developed and brightly colored throat dewlaps and fans which open and close and use them to attract the female lizards for courtship. This method is most used and pronounced as compared to others.
<strong>4. Chemical Cues�</strong>
The lizards produces a chemical pheromones that when smelled will attract the mate for courtship. Normally, female lizards produces these chemical cues to attract the male lizard for mating purpose.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-mating-process">Step 2**: Mating Process�**</h3>
<p>During mating, the male lizard climbs over the female lizard. Then, it connects its hemipenes into the cloaca of the female lizard and pours the sperms into the cloaca from where the sperms swim up the uterus to the oviduct to fertilize the ova (singular - ovum).
The puring process is not a bumpy liquid but continuous drips. The male lizard must wait until the whole pouring process is completed.
The male lizard usually bites the neck of the female lizard to support itself during coitus/copulation. In addition, the male lizard will produce/secret cellular debris that have scent, which makes the couple be able to locate each other in a colony of lizards. Moreover, this debris prevent the male lizard from sliding during mating.
During mating, the female lizard raises the tail slightly to enable the male access the cloaca (you may see as if lizards are coiling while mating). There is no kissing in lizards. However, lizard species such as Komodo dragon and monitor lizards lick their female mates during copulation/coitus.</p>
<h3 id="step-3after-mating-occurrences">Step 3:<strong>After mating occurrences.</strong></h3>
<p>Once the male lizard mates with female lizard, it leaves the female and go to search for other female (most lizards are polygamous). The female searches for a nice place where it intends to lay the eggs.
This place can be in warm holes, leaves, under the sand, seashores or in caves where predator cant locate them (the eggs have strong eggshells that offer further protection).
Then, the female lizard lays the fertilized eggs in batches may have 1 to 20 eggs. Eastern Bearded Dragon usually lay 5 to 17 per batch. Water Dragon will lay between 6 to 18 eggs per batch while Blue tongue lizard will lay 10 to 20 eggs per batch.
The eggs are left to hatch after 4 to 8 weeks. The female lizards rarely take care of the eggs.�Some lizards such as the blue-tongue skink and Solomon Island skink give birth to young live offspring after 10 weeks.
However, these lizards do not have mammary glands to breastfeed their baby lizards. Baby lizards usually have low life expectancy since they face many predators and less care from the adult lizards.

<h2 id="which-is-the-matingbreeding-season-for-lizards">Which is the Mating/breeding season for lizards</h2>
<p>Normally, lizards prefer to court and mate during the spring season. This is favored by warm temperatures that provides a conducive outdoors bonding for lizards. During this time, the male lizard undergo through spermatogenesis (sperms production) and mates with the female lizard after courtship.
The female lizard will then store the sperms in its oviduct until ova (female egg cells) are produced and mature for fertilization. The warmth in spring makes lizards more sexual active such that, they can mate severally in a given day.
The ability of the female lizard to store sperms in some species makes them easier to carry fertilization even when they are not mating.�Some lizards such as Iguanas and Monitor lizards love mating during summer due to high temperature, which activates the copulation/coitus urge for the mates.
The Asian Water dragon becomes bright red during mating season while North American Lizards become orange skinned when mating season approaches.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-lizards-reproduction-organs-specialized-for-mating-in-lizards">How Are Lizards Reproduction Organs Specialized for Mating in Lizards.</h2>
<p>Lizards, unlike human beings, have special reproduction/sexual organs. The male have hemipenis (plural hemipenes) or penis (tubular) that is used during copulation (sexual intercourse). These organs are sac-like and lack erectile tissues as in human being or other animals.
The testicles and the hemipenes in male lizards are stored inverted inside the body at the back of the tail and are only used during copulation (they are not used for urination or egestion). The testicles of male lizards enlarge during the breeding season (you may notice the bulge part at the back of the lizards tail).
The female lizard has two oviducts, which join to form the cloaca (a special type of female organ). The cloaca is a multi-purpose organ in female lizards as it is used during mating, egestion and urination too.
During mating, the male lizard connects and pours into the cloaca of the female lizard from where the sperms swim to the uterus and up the oviduct to fertilize the ova.
The uterus of the female lizards (especially the viviparous lizards  those that give birth) has large volume that help carry many eggs/baby lizards.
During mating, the cloaca stops completely its other functions i.e. urination and egestion. You can locate the tiny pole at the back of the tail in each sex (male or female lizard) that represents the sexual organ.

<h2 id="do-all-female-lizards-need-to-mate-to-get-fertilized-or-pregnant">Do All Female Lizards Need to Mate to Get Fertilized or Pregnant?</h2>
<p>No. Not all lizards that need mating to lay eggs. Some lizards such as gecko, rock lizards, monitor lizards are parthenogenetic (do no need to mate to lay eggs). These lizard species lay eggs (though not fertilized), which hatch to baby lizards.
However, the young ones from these eggs do not have genes that favor diversity like those from fertilized eggs.�The asexual lizards (parthenogenetic) usually have both chromosomes that are provided by the male sex cell thus helps in grow of the egg to maturity.
Other lizard species such as Komodo lizards are bisexual- they can reproduce sexually or by parthenogenesis. In most cases, the bisexual lizards would prefer mating as it offers the bonding chance that make them create a colony for daily activities or defense purposes.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-babiesoff-springs-do-lizards-hatch">How Many Babies/Off Springs Do Lizards Hatch?</h2>
<p>The number of eggs laid by a give lizard species determines the number of baby lizards that are raised in a given season. After mating, the female lizard lays 1 to 20 eggs per batch in a warm environment.
In a given breeding season, female lizards can lay 2 to 3 batches, which may lead to breeding problem on hatching. 80 to 90 percent of the laid eggs normally hatch to baby lizards in 50 to 57 days.
About 1 to 40 lizards are hatched in a given breeding season from a single female lizard. However, due to large predation in the breeding ground, 60 percent of the population do not survive to maturity. Most of them are eaten away or die due to adverse weather conditions and less parental care.
Species such as Blue tongue lizard can raise between 5 to 18 baby lizards. The Asian water dragon manages 5 to 12 baby lizards while Bearded Dragon can hatch between 15 to 20 young ones.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-baby-lizards-take-to-mature">How Long Does The Baby Lizards Take To Mature?</h2>
<p>Baby lizard takes about 12 months to acquire full maturity. During this time, the baby lizard is fed partially by the adult ones and also engaged in light hunting of food.
At this age, the lizard can carry out reproduction (can mate and lay eggs). The adult lizard then assumes the duties of food gathering (hunting) since its old enough to even have its own shelter/cage.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When mating, the male lizard climbs over the female lizard and introduces its hemipenes (male organ) into the cloaca (female) of the female lizard and pours the sperms that swim to the oviduct where they fertilize the ova (singular ovum).
The male lizard has scary underneath skin with debris, which prevent it from sliding during coitus. The male and female lizard must court before mating begin.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Road noise in a car may be one of the most distracting, or rather irritating things about driving - <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">Lizard</a> Skin Vs Dynamat.</p>
<p>You may have already heard about sound deadening mechanisms, and are now confused about which to pick.
This article will look at lizard skin s.v dynamite and break it down for you. Read Also:

.
With Lizard Skin, however, the risks in terms of application, both to you and your car, are minimal. It is also cheaper as compared to Dynamat. But in terms of quality and effectiveness, Dynamat takes the day.</p>
<h2 id="lizard-skin-vs-dynamat">Lizard Skin Vs. Dynamat</h2>
<h3 id="the-plus-side-of-dynamat">The plus side of Dynamat</h3>
<p>Dynamat, first of all, most is a better option to go for when looking for the perfect sound deadening mechanism. Dynamat is also water-based, which makes it more comfortable in terms of application.
With Dynamat, you have a minimal amount of work to put in during the installation. You also have the option of doing it in small phases and do not have to finish the job at once, since none of the sprayings will cause damage to your car.
Dynamat is the most preferred option for a lot of people and has been for quite some time, thanks to its near-perfect ability to lessen road noise. It is also not asphalt-based, which a lot of other sound deadening mats are made of.

<h3 id="cons-of-using-dynamat">Cons of using Dynamat</h3>
<p>Dynamat is costlier than its other counterparts, so despite its superior quality, a lot of people will still go for other options since they are more affordable. Read Also:

.
Even though the amount of work it takes to apply it is minimal, it still needs extra concentration since leaving air gaps will have moisture trapped in it, and that is not good. You also need to be extra careful during the cutting process and have the right tools.
Application on small surfaces is not too much of a hassle, but larger surfaces are a bit trickier. It is not capable of covering the cars whole surface. You will most probably need a professional to apply it for you, and this will end up costing you more.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-using-lizard-skin">Advantages of using Lizard Skin.</h3>
<p>The sound deadening abilities of the lizard skin spray are not bad, and many of the reviews from people who have tried it so far are good.
Application of the lizard skin spray is not hard; you can do it by yourself and in quite a small amount of time too.�No parts are left unsprayed when you use lizard skin, so you are assured of full coverage.
Using the Dynamat, as earlier mentioned, involves risking trapping of moisture, causing air bubbles. You do not run this risk with Lizard Spray since it is a spray and not a mat.
You will not risk any injury during application since it does not involve any cutting. Even if you hire a professional to spray it on for you, you still will end up paying a cheaper cost as compared to Dynamat.

<h3 id="disadvantages-of-using-lizard-spray">Disadvantages of using Lizard Spray.</h3>
<p>Just like any other spraying process, things can get messy and all over if you do not exercise caution.�Lizard spray completely sticks on, so make sure you are super careful with your car paint.
Even though application seems more comfortable as compared to Dynamat, it would still be highly recommended to get a professional to execute it for you, unless you are one and have done it before.
It may be cheaper than Dynamat, but that still does not make it super affordable. Prepare your coins. Read Also:

Well, there is not a world of difference between Lizard skin Vs. dynamat, with the differences only being a select few. For both, you should get a pro for the installation, plus the installation process for both of them requires attention and precision.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion.</h2>
<p>My two cents? If you have a bit of extra cash to spare, consider getting the Dynamat. It is much better quality, plus it will serve you longer and has more positive reviews. LizardSkin is also a pretty decent choice.
Now, it is essential to note that none of these two options will give you the type of soundproof quality that you get in a movie or home theatres. Hopefully, with this information provided, you are better informed about which sound deadener to go with, lizard skin vs. dynamat, and why.</p>

<p>The
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/group/bearded-dragon/">bearded Dragon</a>
, scientifically called
<em>Pogona vitticeps,</em>
is an intermediate <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> that looks fiercer and resembles tiny dragon. It has mild personalities and doesnt post much threat to humanity  they are friendly in nature and enjoy much interaction with people as well as love close attention.</p>
<p>When fully grown, Breaded dragon measures 60 cm or 2 feet long and can live for 5 to 10 years when taken care of well. Normally, Bearded Dragon is omnivore. It can feed on fruits and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-tomatoes/">vegetables</a>
as well as dust insects (crickets) with high calcium level. When trained, some bearded dragon can feed on dead insect mixed with fresh vegetables.</p>
<p>For the beginners level, this is the best <a href="/posts/healthy-pets-rodent-control/">pet</a> lizard dragon that you can give priorities. .The reptile is easier to handle and can be a nice pet for young responsible children  they rarely attack kids.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, Bearded Dragon is a perfect example for anyone who desires to have a pet dinosaur or dragon at home. The lizards does not feed too much (low maintenance) and is calm and responsive to the owner.</li>
<li>The Bearded dragons are native to Australia and live in arid, semi-arid and rocky environment. Therefore, as pet lizards, they should be provided with similar environment.</li>
<li>Their cage should have shallow dish or basin water to ensure that they are kept hydrated. Expose your pet Bearded dragon to light bulb designed purposely for reptiles (you can get these in your nearby pet store).
A threated Bearded dragon has an expanded throat with standing spikes which flattens when the lizards calms and gets contented. It is easier to train Bearded Dragon for some activities such as feeding and recognition. Bearded dragons are the most common pet lizards.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do <a href="/posts/can-i-use-baby-shampoo-on-my-cat/">baby</a> lizards eat?�What do lizards feed their young ones (also know as
<a href="https://nhm.org/stories/tis-season-baby-lizards">hatchlings</a>
)? How do they do it and how long before they can go get their food?
Well, this article piece is all about lizard baby food -just like noted that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-a-garden-lizard-eat/">garden lizard eats caterpillars, insects, small crickets, and some greens and fruits</a>
.
*But what do baby lizards eat?� *
<em>Baby lizards eat what their parents eat. Yes, they eat insects, roaches, plants, or even both. The only difference is the food ratio. Baby lizards only eat baby portions. For example, if they are eating an insect, the insect should be smaller than them.�</em>
<em>Baby lizards eat by themselves. Nobody mashes up the prey for them. Its like a natural instinct in their DNA. They get the prey or plant and eat it up. You should note that a baby lizard will eat what its line of species eats. The other element that forms a baby lizards diet is the kind of environment it dwells in.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Baby Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
<em>A lizard can be carnivorous, insectivorous, herbivorous, or omnivorous.� A carnivorous lizard will eat insects or even small rodents and worms. The herbivores are vegetarians while the omnivores are on a balanced diet of vegetation and meat. Well, a pet lizard does not have very many options as the wild one but you need to know what to feed them and their young ones so that their dietary requirements are met.�</em></p>
<h2 id="what-do-baby-lizards-eat-7-lizard-diets---food-portions">What Do Baby Lizards Eat? 7 Lizard Diets - Food Portions</h2>
<p>A baby lizard eats what the adult lizard eats. The only difference is the portion. In short, you can call them miniature adults because they are independent of day one.� They will eat small portions or sizes of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small worms</li>
<li>Small insects</li>
<li>Flies</li>
<li>Ants</li>
<li>Plants</li>
<li>Non-poisonous spiders
What a baby lizard eats goes hand in hand with its body size and its hunting abilities. The older they become the greater and high quality the prey is. When eating an insect, ensure that the baby lizard is not eating one that is bigger than its head.
You should also ensure that once they are done eating, the extra food or prey is removed from the pet enclosure. This is because they are babies and still vulnerable; they can be attacked by the prey.
At night you might notice that their bodies are buried inside the soil. Dont be alarmed, this is how they protect themselves. However, we also noted that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-leopard-geckos-nocturnal/">leopard geckos are crepuscular</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-and-what-do-i-feed-my-baby-lizard"><strong>�How And What Do I Feed My Baby Lizard</strong></h2>
<p>Your baby lizard has been born in your pet enclosure; so naturally, they cannot go off hunting because they eat what you provide. First and foremost, you need to know the type of lizard you have. If it is a meat-eater, a plant-eater or it eats plants and meat.
Once you have cleared this, the next thing to do is to go to a credible pet store. You will find food assorted according to size so that your hatchling does not choke while eating. Get enough food because their hunting skills are still at a novice level.
A hatchling is born with all the digestive organs that they require to process an adult diet. If you have a baby lizard under your care you should not be afraid. They are not too young to handle live prey. You are taking care of their nutritional needs and you are also stimulating them mentally.
Do not go away when the baby lizard is feeding. Monitor them and if there is any unfinished food or prey after twenty minutes then you should remove it.� This is to ensure the prey does not harm the hatchling and that there is no soiling in the cage from the prey.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-baby-lizard-drink"><strong>What Does A Baby Lizard Drink</strong></h2>
<p>A lizard cage with plants, natural substrate, and water is a misting paradise for lizards. This ensures high humidity levels which is great for them. There are lizards that actually take in water via their skin instead of drinking.
Just because the lizards do not consume water heavily does not mean that you leave the water dish in the cage for a day. Ensure that they have a fresh supply daily.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-carnivorous-baby-lizard-eat"><strong>What Does A Carnivorous Baby Lizard Eat</strong></h2>
<p>This hatchling is a flesh-eater. They start small prey but progressively move to more elusive ones. For example, as babies, they will eat small insects and when they grow up they will be enjoying some mice and frogs. They will also be eating insects but this will not be part of their course as much.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-herbivorous-baby-lizard-eat"><strong>What Does A Herbivorous Baby Lizard Eat</strong></h2>
<p>The baby lizard will eat plants but not all types of plants. The kind of plants they will eat depends on where they live and their size. The following should do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Greens
These guys do not have a huge appetite but they still have their favorite.
You should be able to note this while monitoring them as they feed however just because they enjoy something so much does not mean that you should not offer variety in their diet. Nutritional deficiency is something that you should prevent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-an-insectivore-baby-lizard-eat"><strong>What Does An Insectivore Baby Lizard Eat</strong></h2>
<p>An insectivore baby lizard will eat small insects. Some of the common insect delicacies for lizards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crickets</li>
<li>Roaches</li>
<li>Small invertebrates
So what is the difference between an insectivore lizard and one that is a carnivore? The difference is in the preference. The insectivore is restricted to insects while the carnivore devours flesh such as frogs, rodents, and other lizards.

<h2 id="what-does-an-omnivorous-baby-lizard-eat"><strong>�What Does An Omnivorous Baby Lizard Eat</strong></h2>
<p>Well, these lizards get to enjoy the best of both worlds. They enjoy their vegetables, fruits, and protein. You should note that even though they can eat whatever they like, they also have a preference. Examples of such lizards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetongue skinks</li>
<li>Green iguanas</li>
<li>Bearded dragons</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-fruits-and-greens-should-i-give-a-hatchling"><strong>What Fruits And Greens Should I Give A Hatchling</strong></h2>
<p>The first rule is to ensure that you will be offering variety.� There are different fruits and greens lizards can enjoy.
Variety ensures that the lizard has an option and that they are catered for nutritionally.
Greens like dark green lettuce are great as for fruits, grapes are a favorite. To ensure that none of the fruits and vegetables have been sprayed with any pesticides or chemical fertilizers.
<strong>Fruits for your baby lizard</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kiwi</li>
<li>Grapes</li>
<li>Strawberries</li>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Peaches</li>
<li>Plums</li>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Figs
<strong>Vegetable for your baby lizard</strong></li>
<li>Spinach</li>
<li>Kale</li>
<li>Collard greens</li>
<li>Romaine</li>
<li>Boston</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Beans</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Sweet potatoes</li>
<li>Okra</li>
<li>Zucchini</li>
<li>Bell peppers</li>
<li>A mixture of frozen vegetables from your favorite grocery store
Did you know that there are lizards that love eating flowers?� Yes, they love roses, hibiscus, and some other flower petals that tickle their fancy.
Whatever your lizard eats, ensure that you practice good hygiene. Wash the fruits, vegetables, or any other plant before feeding it to them.
You can use mild soap for this purpose then rinse thoroughly. This is to ensure that your pet does not consume any chemical used to treat the food while it was being grown on the farm.
Do note that some dark leafy greens contain oxalates meaning that they can inhibit the absorption of calcium into the lizards body.
This could lead to them having the metabolic bone disease. You should, therefore, serve these greens in moderation.
Feed them greens once daily. Ensure that you cut up the greens in manageable slices. The bowl should be shallow enough for them to see the food. Any uneaten food must be removed daily.
Lettuce has no nutritional value but it helps with hydration.�Feed your lizard some seeds or pellets once a week.
For baby lizards or lizards in captivity, you will need to add supplements to their food. You can dust their prey with some calcium dust or any other approved lizard multivitamin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-ants-a-favorite"><strong>Are Ants A Favorite</strong></h2>
<p>There are many types of lizards that eat ants. In fact, desert lizards love them.
It is no wonder that you will always find a lizard on top of an anthill seeking whom they will devour. This is one of the fail-proof methods of feeding.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-difference-in-diet-between-a-pet-and-a-wild-lizard"><strong>Is There A Difference In Diet Between A Pet And A Wild Lizard</strong></h2>
<p>Lizards are the same whether in captivity or in the wild. So if a lizard is insectivorous, it will eat insects whether in captivity or in the wild.
The number of times your baby lizard eats is determined by several factors.
First of all, what type of lizard it is, its size, and how active it is.
Of course, the more active it is, the frequent the feeding but as they grow up they can even go a day without a meal. Just remember that after eating, go back after twenty minutes to clean up.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-a-desert-lizard-eat"><strong>What Will A Desert Lizard Eat</strong></h2>
<p>You definitely have to wonder about this because I had earlier stated that a lizard will eat what is in its habitat.
Well, desert lizards live in difficult conditions and that is why most of their time is spent hunting and gathering food.
When the weather is too hot, they hide underground, and when the temperatures drop they continue with their daily routine.
When the weather is too hot their heart and breathing rate drops and they also do not require a lot of food and energy to function.
One typical coping mechanism for desert lizards is hiding under the sand with only their heads exposed and their bodies are motionless. This is to track any prey that may be wandering close by. Their diet is mainly grasshoppers, ants, crickets, and other invertebrates.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>A baby lizard is a future adult lizard and should be taken care of accordingly. It is important that you know the type of lizard you have, what they should eat, how they should eat it when they should, and what they should not eat among other things.
It is important that you know what you should supplement. They are very active at this stage and you might just have to spend more on lizard food but it is only for a while.
Do note that lizards are cold-blooded and you might not quickly notice changes in their behavior or bodily functions.
Therefore, offer them good food of great quality and at a good frequency. Ensure their environment is also great. I hope this article helped you out and now you know something about baby food for baby lizards.</p>

A <a href="/posts/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/">garden</a> lizard is a great reptile pet for homeowners. These reptiles� (Calotes Veriscolor ) also known as oriental garden lizards reside in warm areas like Asia.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find these lizards in grass, trees, and bushes. They are always behind the scenes observing their environment quietly.
<em>But the question is, what does a garden lizard feast on?�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>**In summary, garden lizards eat snails, caterpillars, insects, small crickets, and some greens and fruits. They also dont consume much. **<strong>Garden lizards work with small portions at a time</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The oriental garden lizard feeds on insects such as ants, cockroaches, ants, and grasshoppers. They also eat small vertebrates such as rats and also eat other lizards.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-a-garden-lizard-eat">What Does a Garden Lizard Eat?</h2>
<p>The garden lizard has teeth and they are used for gripping the prey. They do not tear the prey when eating, they swallow it whole. The young and inexperienced garden lizards normally choke if the prey is too large for them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Baby Snakes- Surprising but true. The garden lizard can eat newly hatched nonpoisonous snakes and there are those that even consume the snake eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Butterflies  Lizards love to eat these colorful creatures and therefore if your garden has plenty of butterflies you can be assured that the lizards will make them an endangered species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cockroaches Garden lizards eat roaches as though they were light snacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their own eggs- At times when the hunger is too much, the lizard will opt to eat its own eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slugs  They will use their teeth to have a grip then swallow the slug effortlessly since a slug is covered in a mucus-like membrane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small lizards- When they are roaming looking for females, the males will eat up other tiny lizards and do so to assert domination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fruits  Garden lizards love fruits and especially berries. Succulent fruits also provide them with water. They also love bananas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-do-small-garden-lizards-eat"><strong>What Do Small Garden Lizards Eat</strong></h3>
<p>The bigger the lizard, the bigger its prey. Small lizards go for small prey such as flies and crickets and if they want more flesh they will go for spiders, snails, and caterpillars.
<strong>Do Garden Lizards Need Water</strong>
Yes, these lizards need water in order to survive and also maintain a healthy amount of moisture on their skin. Garden lizards cannot live without water but at the same time, you should understand that they cannot thrive in places where there is excessive water. They will drown and die. So water levels or amounts should be moderate.
<strong>Do They Have Teeth</strong>
Garden lizards possess teeth and these teeth are used for gripping their food not tearing it apart. The prey is then swallowed whole once its captured.</p>
<h2 id="do-garden-lizards-eat-vegetables-and-plants"><strong>Do Garden Lizards Eat Vegetables And Plants</strong></h2>
<p>You might be led to think that garden lizards eat only meat but in some instances, they eat greens.
<strong>Do Garden Lizards Eat Flying Termites</strong>
Yes, garden lizards eat flying termites. When the termite flies near the lizard, the lizard simply opens its mouth and swallows the termite. Flying termites love to get a glimpse of light and normally fall down on the ground afterward. This makes it easier for the lizard to just gulp them up.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-lizards-live-naturally">Where do Lizards live naturally?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, garden lizards love warm weather hence the reason for their abundance in such climate areas. Secondly, they dwell in grass and trees. Water is essential for their wellbeing and so they live in places where they can have access to water and not become dehydrated. When the weather becomes cold, they will go missing in action and hide under rocks.
<strong>Are They Poisonous, Do They Bite</strong>
Garden lizards are harmless reptiles. Yes, they are related to other poisonous reptiles but they are venom-free. These lizards do bite but as I said before, there is no poison. In fact, when these little fellows bite you, it looks like a small scratch, and a simple dressing will do. They never attack unless they feel they have to.
<strong>How Do I Make My Garden, Lizard Friendly</strong>
The best thing about having the lizards in your garden is that they will eat up all the insects and larvae plus any mosquitoes that could be irritating you. For the lizards to come or stay, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant native grasses</li>
<li>Do some mulching or leave behind some leaf cover</li>
<li>Plant some berries</li>
<li>Have a shallow bowl of water in the garden</li>
<li>If you have a cat, try as much as possible to keep it indoors lest it scares away the lizards</li>
<li>If you can then make a pond that will also attract insects and frogs. Throw in a ramp or stick so that the lizards can get out in case they jump in.
<strong>What to avoid</strong></li>
<li>Avoid using pesticides or any other chemical solution</li>
<li>Do not rake the leaves</li>
<li>Do not capture lizards from the park. Garden lizards find their own habitat</li>
<li>Do not feed the lizards because they have to learn how to fend for themselves
<strong>Some Things To Note</strong>
A lizard cannot control its body temperature so it will be good if you can turn on the sprinklers during the hot summer holidays. When you notice that their tails are down then something is wrong. The lizard could be stressed or hurt by another animal. Again, keep your cat away from the lizard because the cat will make a snack out of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Garden lizards are creatures that simply love a low profile. They will eat all the bugs and cockroaches and be your constant companion in the garden. And as it is said, you are what you eat, and knowing what a lizard eats is the first step in truly knowing the garden lizard so that you can co-exist with them in a mutual manner.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> <a href="/posts/what-does-raccoon-poop-look-like/">poop</a> look like?�Reptiles such as salamanders lizards and geckos love to hang around the house. You will find their poop on any surface including your bed, sofa set, and wardrobe among other places.
Certainly, these fecal droppings can create a disgusting mess in the house - particularly after a
heavy meal
. Sometimes, it difficult to differentiate lizard poop from that of rodents and birds.
<em>So, how does lizard poop look like? Lizard poop appears as black droppings with a white substance on one end. The white matter shows the presence of uric acid and its excreted together with the solid waste.�</em>
<em>This is because lizards use one opening (cloaca) to excrete solid waste and urine. The size of the droppings vary according to the size and species of the lizard. Related: What Does Leopard Gecko Eat?</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-does-lizard-poop-look-like">What Does Lizard Poop Look Like??</h2>
<h3 id="1-size">1. Size</h3>
<p>If you suspect you have lizards in the house check for black pellet-like droppings about  inch long and 1/8 inch wide. Attached on one end of the poop is the urine crystal which is usually white in color. Thats because lizards poop and pee from the same opening (cloaca).</p>
<h3 id="2-shape">2. Shape</h3>
<p>The droppings might be tapered or rounded at the ends and their size varies with the species and size of lizards. Normally, wild lizards have bigger droppings compared to urban lizards.</p>
<h3 id="3-color">3. Color</h3>
<p>Lizard poop can be easily be confused with poop from snakes, birds or rodents. Similar to lizards these pests, poop and pee through the same opening. Thus, their droppings contain solid matter and solid uric acid. However, the white cap in birds and snake poop covers a larger portion and tend to be more liquid.

<h3 id="where-do-lizards-poop"><strong>Where Do Lizards Poop?</strong></h3>
<p>According to a
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/08/lizards-poop-biggest-rocks-around">research</a>
done at the university of Antwerp, lizards exhibit some similarity in their choice of toilet. In the controlled experiment, 90 lizards were each placed in an enclosure with different sizes of rocks. Surprisingly, 80% of the lizards pooped on the largest rock.
It has been previously indicated that wall lizards communicate with their fecal droppings. Male lizards mark their territories with feces so that other males can keep off. So, defecating on the biggest rock suggested an attempt to make their signals as conspicuous as possible.
Another explanation for this is that lizards spend most of their time on large rocks, to have a good view of possible predators. The research doesnt however conclude on the possible motivation for the observed behavior. But it suggests that lizards leave their poop in conspicuous areas as a sign of communication.</p>
<h3 id="is-lizard-poop-toxic"><strong>Is Lizard Poop Toxic?</strong></h3>
<p>Lizard feces are toxic because they spread zoonotic diseases such as salmonella. They contain certain disease-causing bacteria which can get into your body through ingestion, inhaling or open skin.
With proper hygiene its possible to reduce the risk and prevent infections from lizard droppings. If you have pet lizards, wash your hands with water and soap any time you handle them. Their cages should also be kept clean and free from fecal droppings. Use gloves every time youre cleaning your pets cage.
If you have kids in your home, its not advisable to keep lizards or other reptiles as pets. Thats because you cannot completely restrain kids interaction with the pets.
Other diseases that can be transmitted from lizards to humans include Leptospirosis, botulism and Campylobacteriosis.</p>
<h3 id="lizard-poop-versus-snake-poop"><strong>Lizard Poop versus Snake Poop</strong></h3>
<p><em>Lizard Poop:</em>
The diet of lizards is composed of small insects and arachnid. A few species include plants in their diet. They excrete small pellet-like feces the size of rodent feces.
The size of the droppings depend on the species and size of the lizard. The droppings have a small white portion which is fairly dry compared to those of snake poop.
<em>Snake poop:</em>
