belt sander
.
Dumond-Chemicals 3332 will eat off the paint and won&rsquo;t damage the underneath surface. Further, it&rsquo;ll remain cool, and thus your hands won&rsquo;t heat up unnecessarily. It has a thermal fuse that&rsquo;ll readily trip to allow the paint stripper to cool down.
Thus, you&rsquo;ll need to reset the stripper&rsquo;s switch if it&rsquo;s switch trips. However, the paint stripper is quiet and lightweight - including when scraping paint off from metal (including copper, steel, and aluminium) or wood.
The stripper has a
3.2 Amp motor that&rsquo;ll quickly smooth the metal surfaces after removing any paint chips.
Dumond-Chemicals 3332 has a useful sanding disc that is made using the o
pen-web disc technology, which reduces the accumulation of dust and paints while working. It&rsquo;ll thus work on the uneven metal surfaces for an even and smooth finish.

The paint remover will be appropriate for metal doors, car wheels, and other metal surfaces (including vertical surfaces and walls). However, ensure that the surface to be treated has no rubber because it&rsquo;ll be eaten away by the paint remover.
Rust-Oleum 255449 is a gel-like stripper and won&rsquo;t be hazardous to Methylene Chloride or bases, plus it won&rsquo;t be a fire hazard. Also, the remover will be highly helpful for stripping epoxy, polyurethanes, and glue. Again, this stripper is eco-friendly.
Luckily, with Rust-Oleum 255449, you won&rsquo;t have to scrub the surface excessively or even scrap off the metal using some knives. The paint removal will dry the paint on the metal surface, and thus you&rsquo;ll need to brush lightly to leave the metal bare - ease of use!
This paint remover is also budget-friendly and easy to use since it&rsquo;ll be ready within 10 - 15 minutes, particularly on metal, vehicles, or bikes. However, avoid getting the gel coming into contact with the skin as it&rsquo;ll cause a burning or irritation sensation.

Further, the Klean-Strip will strip off various paints in your home, including furniture,
