<p>I hope that this review on the best shoes for boot camp has been helpful. Our top choice in this review is the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0891SDV1G/tag=p-policy-20">Reebok Women&rsquo;s Nano X1 Cross Trainer</a>
. This shoe has excellent features and technologies that will make your burn boot camp experience worthwhile.</p>
<p>However, that is not to say that the rest of the other shoes are at a lower level. All the reviewed shoes meet the standard for boot camp workouts and choosing any of them will guarantee you better results.</p>
