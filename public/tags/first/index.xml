      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many homeowners and DIY enthusiasts grapple with this question - should caulk before or after painting?
Well, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. We&rsquo;ve done extensive research to help you understand the best approach for your project, ensuring a professional and polished finish.
*<strong>The Answer:</strong> <strong>Caulking before painting</strong> is the recommended approach in most cases. Caulk serves as a sealant, filling gaps and cracks between surfaces, ensuring a smooth and uniform appearance. *
*By applying caulk before painting, you create a seamless and cohesive surface, preventing <a href="/posts/airless-paint-sprayer-tips/">paint</a> from seeping into gaps and enhancing the overall finish. The caulk also helps improve the durability and longevity of the paint job by providing an additional layer of protection against moisture and drafts. *
