<p>Borax particles adhere to these exoskeletons and absorb moisture from the insects body, causing rapid dehydration. Additionally, when ingested, Borax interferes with the digestive systems of pests, further ensuring their demise.</p>

<p>To get the most out of 20 Mule Team Borax, strategic application is essential. Heres how to use it effectively:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify Pest Hotspots</strong>: Determine where pests are most active. Common areas include cracks around windows, doors, utility pipes, and in pet bedding.</li>
<li><strong>Clean and Prepare</strong>: Before applying Borax, thoroughly clean the areas to remove food residues and other attractants. This ensures that Borax is not diluted or masked by other substances.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Borax</strong>: Lightly dust Borax powder in areas where pests are active. For example, apply it along gaps around windows and doors, around utility pipes, and in the corners of rooms where pests may hide.</li>
<li><strong>Treat Pet Bedding</strong>: Fleas often infest pet bedding. Wash and fully dry the bedding before applying Borax. Ensure pets are kept away from treated areas until the Borax is cleaned up to avoid irritation.</li>
<li><strong>Target Nesting Sites</strong>: Different pests have specific nesting preferences. For example, silverfish favor moist, dark areas like basements, while cockroaches prefer warm, humid spaces. Apply Borax directly to these areas to address infestations effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Use as Bait</strong>: Mix Borax with attractive food items such as honey, syrup, or peanut butter to lure pests like ants and cockroaches. When pests consume the Borax-laced bait, they will carry it back to their nests, helping to eliminate the entire colony.</li>
