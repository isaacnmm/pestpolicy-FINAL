<h2 id="considerations-for-best-stain-for-cedar-swing-set">Considerations for Best Stain For Cedar Swing Set</h2>
<p>As a parent or owner of a swing set, you need to take some time to maintain your cedar playset. It is important that you and your kids have years of fun.
Resurfacers are denser coatings to lock down splinters and fill cracks in any wood displaying signs of aging. Resurfacer enhances the appearance of weathered or worn out concrete and wood.</p>
<h3 id="1-opaque-finish-options">1. Opaque Finish Options</h3>
<p>Most people who own cedar wood products like cedar swing sets are likely to protect or seal their wood structure using a clear finish that would reveal the real characteristics of the wood.
However, it is important to note that semi-opaque and opaque finishes are great at concealing wood appearance issues on older swing sets.
In addition, these finishes can endure weathering properly compared to clear finishes, meaning, they can last long. Examples of opaque finish options include latex and acrylic stain, or outdoor paint.</p>
<h3 id="2-water-repellents">2. Water-Repellents</h3>
<p>If you are one of those people that wish to go all-natural, then water-repellents preservatives might be ideal for you. Water-repellents stains should be applied to cedar wood that is above the ground. Adding fungicide will help reduce the decay of wood as well as the growth of mildew.
In addition, the fungi will enable the wood to remain durable and strong all year long. The water-repellents stains also help to lower water absorption, but in the short-term.
To control wood discoloration that is triggered by depletion of water-soluble elements, a water-repellent that is rich in low-wax may be applied as a single layer on newly manufactured cedarwood. This may act as a pre-treatment process before you embark on painting. This process will greatly help reduce wood discoloration.</p>
<h3 id="3-exterior-polyurethane">3. Exterior Polyurethane</h3>
<p>Using Polyurethane on your exterior cedar swing set can help to give it a great finish look as well as the ability to endure for years. However, all this will depend on the kind of weathering and friction the swing set is subjected to.
To get a more even finish on your cedar, and the cedar using sandpaper. Then apply either oil-based or water polyurethane in 2-3 layers in a span of few days.
However, if your swing set is always under the full sun, polyurethane might not be a very good choice. This is because under the full sun polyurethane is likely to wear out fast and may need to be removed frequently and reapplied to retain the color of cedar. This process might be expensive to those on budgets and time-consuming.</p>
<h3 id="4-clear-sealer">4. Clear Sealer</h3>
<p>If you want to retain that natural feel or the original color of your cedar swing set, Clear sealers may be the best choice for you. These penetrating sealers are perfect at bringing out the fascinating color of cedar of your wooden swing set.
To make the clear sealers even more appealing, they come in two different shades; the tinted and the clear shade. You get to choose what fits you the most.
Some of these sealers have protective UV absorbers or blockers, which can help in slowing the fading of wood caused by exposure to excess sun.
To maintain the color and appearance of your cedar swing set, you are required to reapply the clear sealers at least once per year. This habit will also greatly help to enhance the water-shedding capabilities of the wood.</p>
<h3 id="5-semi-transparent-stains">5. Semi-Transparent Stains</h3>
<p>This type of stain can either be oil-based or latex. The stain can help to protect the wood grain of all outdoor wood structures. We recommend applying this Semi-Transparent stain to outdoor wood that is permanently located outside.
Structures that are located outside are more prone to algae and mold. Staining them with this semi-transparent mixture will help fight these elements as the stain contains an anti-fungal element, which is known to be effective at fighting mold, algae, or any other naturally occurring element.
Normally, these stains penetrate deeply into the wood and create a strong bond with the wood fibers, forming a great protective stain that fights all these unwanted elements. If you intend to maintain the natural appearance and basic texture of your swing set, you should consider using a semi-transparent stain.</p>
<h3 id="6-spar-urethane-or-spar-varnish">6. Spar Urethane or Spar Varnish</h3>
<p>Spar Urethane or Spar Varnish is a highly recommended wood finish that is ideal for outdoor wood projects. The spar varnish gives wood surfaces a malleable and clear protective coat that safeguards it against splitting into layers when exposed to the sun.
The good thing with the spar varnish is that it deteriorates slowly, giving you value for your time and money for years. To use the spar vanish, just sand the surface of the wood lightly, removing mildew and dirt that might have accumulated over time.
After, apply a layer of spar varnish on to the wood. Spar Urethane is also an ideal option for your outdoor wood needs. It offers UV stability to wood, making them more durable and long-lasting. This wood vanish has similar properties as Spar Urethane.</p>
<h3 id="7-solid-stains-and-resurfacer">7. Solid Stains and Resurfacer</h3>
<p>Resurfacers and Solid color stains are opaque wood finishes that help to conceal the grain while allowing the texture of the wood to show. Solid color stains have two properties; it acts as a sealant and a stain. It helps to protect the wood from sun damage and moisture, allowing it to obtain a rich, opaque color.
Solid color stains do not penetrate wood; they rest on top of the wood as opposed to bonding with it, this can make the wood to flake or chip. Furthermore, solid color stains dont have anti-fungal properties, therefore, may not shield your wooden structures from water properly as compared to the penetrative stains.
However, solid stains are more like paint. A single layer of this stain can be enough on new wood. To get the best performance from the stain, the wood should be primed, then two coats of the stain should be applied. The best solid color stain is one that is 100% acrylic latex and should be applied in two layers to get superior results.
The solid color stain has numerous advantages on wood. They contain an acrylic formulation which offers great bond and durability. This stain is also fortified with urethane helping it to resist peeling and cracking. It also offers resistance against mildew. Finally, it contains a strong UV absorber that protects the wood against UV damage and fading.</p>
<h3 id="8-leaving-cedar-untreated">8. Leaving Cedar Untreated</h3>
<p>If you are on a budget, the color or texture of your cedar swing set should not bother you. Cedarwood can perform fairly well without any finish. When the cedar wood ages it becomes silver-gray with a rustic feel making the appearance different.
However, As opposed to applying a finish, just sand your swings set and wash it annually. Ensure you wash your set with a mild detergent solution using a brush. If you notice any mildew, ensure you treat it using a bleach solution or a mildew wash.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In addition, it offers mold, algae, and mildew resistant finish. They are also good water repellent stains that help to fill cracks in the woods. Therefore, ensure you do annual maintenance and staining on your playsets.
You can relax knowing that your kids are playing on a safe swing set, one that has no risks of splinters, sharp edges, or breakage to bring harm to you or your children.</p>

      <description>Cedar oil (</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cedar oil (
an essential oil
) is an effective pest repellent that works on a number of pests like mosquitoes, chiggers, gnats, chiggers, silverfish, <a href="/posts/are-fleas-nocturnal/">fleas</a>, ticks, and ants.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/best-stain-for-cedar-swing-set/">Cedar</a> oil or cedarwood oil is extracted from cedar trees - i.e. from its needles, leaves, barks, and berries.
Besides the woody scent of the cedarwood oil is loved by many homeowners for keeping their houses smelling great. But it also has anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiseptic, antispasmodic, and diuretic properties.</li>
<li>In this article, Ive detailed how to mix cedar oil for pest control - it is safe to use around animals and garden trees but you must know the quantities to use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-make-or-mix-cedar-oil-spray">How to Make or Mix Cedar Oil Spray?</h2>
<p>Mix 120 ml (4 oz) of the cedar oil with 770 ml (26 Oz) of water.
First, pour the 120 mL of oil cedar oil into a sprayer that has a hose end.</p>
<ul>
<li>The hose-end sprayer will simply be a canister that will fit the end of a hose while its side has graduated measurements.
Next, you will add 770 ml (26 Oz) of water into the container that has the cedar oil.</li>
<li>Ensure to properly screw the container to the water hose.
Finally, turning on the water makes it properly dilute your cedar oil to a concentration that will control the pests.
The cautions involved in this pest remedy are to effectively read the product instructions because various brands may have a different dilution ratio.</li>
<li>When you mix 120 ml of cedar oil with 770 ml of water, you&rsquo;ll have made enough spray to pest-treat about 5000 square feet.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WHXX7vaMy8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WHXX7vaMy8</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-pests-can-be-controlled-by-cedar-oil">Which Pests Can Be Controlled By Cedar Oil?</h2>
<p>Cedar oil is mainly composed of cedrene and cedrol - components that create
<a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/56116/cedarwood-oil-MRP-NYSIPM.pdf?sequence=1">cedar camphor.</a>
Cedar camphor is a very volatile and critical chemical for repelling and killing fungi, biting insects, and moths.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because the pests will find it hazardous to breathe the air sprayed with cedar oil because it has high volatility levels and so it is classified as a<a href="http://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/wakullaco/2017/06/01/native-red-cedar-is-a-natural-insect-repellant/">natural bug repellent</a>.
The cedar oil pest control formulation can be used when dealing with the following pests;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-controlling-bed-bugs">a. Controlling Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>A recent
<a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news">Rutgers University study</a>
reported positively on the effectiveness of cedarwood oil in controlling bed bugs - this was also the case with other essential oils such as paraffin oil and silicon oils.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, experts note that cedar oil is an effective and natural alternative to using chemical-based pest control products if you need to<a href="https://new-url.com/bed-bugs-vs-other-pests">control bed bugs</a>and it will be a cheaper option compared to<a href="https://new-url.com/how-much-do-bed-bug-exterminators-cost/">hiring a professional exterminator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-controlling-fleas">b. Controlling Fleas</h3>
<p>Cedar oil is a key ingredient in
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">most flea repellents</a>
as it is effective in killing these bugs - reported by the
<a href="http://juniper.oregonstate.edu/bibliography/documents/phpSK42c4_epa.pdf">EPA</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>But it is very critical to maintaining the correct mixing concentration or ratios before spraying the dogs.</li>
<li>Caution: Before using the cedar oil spray on your cat, consult the vet on an appropriate concentration - if any allowable for this pet.
You can also mix your dog shampoo with lemongrass oil (one drop) and Cedar oil (two drops).</li>
<li>Effectively massage the shampoo &amp; essential oils mixture into the dog&rsquo;s skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-controlling-slugs">c. Controlling Slugs</h3>
<p>Cedar oil can be utilized as one of many molluscicides - which are substances that will kill slugs and mollusks.
A recent study on snails and garden slugs shows that cedar oil will
<a href="https://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=10540">suffocate these organisms</a>
to their death.</p>
<ol>
<li>Luckily, cedar oil won&rsquo;t harm the various plants in your yard or garden - while the oil is killing the slugs.
But will Cedar oil be toxic or harmful to humans? Well, cedar oil has very low toxicity levels for humans and other mammals - which means that it will isn&rsquo;t dangerous to people.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>However, humans should not intentionally ingest or inhale the Cedar oil - but if you touch the cedar oil, you should wash your hands immediately.
Further, caution must be taken not to expose toddlers/ babies and expectant mothers to cedar oil and other essential oils that are harsh.
So, cedar oil will kill a number of bugs including ants, ticks, moths, bed bugs, mosquitos, fleas, and mites.</li>
<li>However, cedar oil wont harm the garden plant or beneficial yard insects such as butterflies and bees</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-cedar-oil-in-horticulture-settings">How to Use Cedar Oil in Horticulture Settings?</h2>
<p>For the horticultural settings, I advise you to spray (to saturation levels) the bugs and their hiding places using cedar oil.</p>
<ul>
<li>As outlined above on the concentration of cedar oil spray, mix about 120 ml of cedar oil with about 770 ml of water into some hose-end sprayer before screwing the container into a hose.
Next, you should put on the hose to spray the bugs in the horticulture settings - including spraying on patios, concrete driveways, standing water, grass, shrubs, and flower beds.
Caution on some plants or trees:
Cedar oil will, however, cause damage, especially to the color of trees such as hickories, black walnut, Amur maples, and Japanese maples.</li>
<li>Also, cedar oil has been documented to dull the green color of the blue spruces and other evergreens.
Experts recommend, therefore, that you should avoid spraying on citrus trees, especially after the October season as this can, otherwise, increase cold damage.</li>
<li>For citrus trees, it is advisable to apply cedar oil during early summer or spring.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-cedar-oil-kill-insects">How Does Cedar Oil Kill Insects?</h2>
<p>Cedar oil kills the pests by suffocating them in their exoskeletons - the oil covers the breathing holes of the insects.
So, it is recommended that you apply the cedar oil (through spraying) directly to the body of that pest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, in some of the pests, cedar oil will damage their metabolism and that&rsquo;s cause death
Cedar oil has a quick knockdown effect on the various tests and so you notice them stopping the movement in just minutes.</li>
<li>Lucky, cedar oil will also exterminate larvae and eggs of different pests - remember it kills the organisms through suffocation.
Does cedar oil have a long-term pest control effect? Well, cedar oil will not keep the bugs from coming back in a spayed area for a long time.</li>
<li>As noted earlier, cedar oil will only kill pests if it directly covers its exoskeleton and thus causes the bug&rsquo;s suffocation.
Therefore, if you need to achieve longer-term pest control in an area using cedar oil, you will need to reapply the solution once you see any pests around.</li>
<li>For humans, you should spray the cedar oil on the skin and clothes before stepping outside.</li>
<li>The woody scent of the cedar oil will also repel ticks and mosquitoes.
You must shake the cedar oil bottle (containing the mixture) well before spraying it on the next surface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in summary, you will be required to mix 220 ml of cedar oil with 770 ml of water and the spray will treat an area of 5000 square feet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cedar oil kills various pests by covering their exoskeleton and thus suffocating the bugs.
Cedar oil with higher concentrations will destroy the pest exoskeleton or emulsify its body fat.
Cheers!</li>
