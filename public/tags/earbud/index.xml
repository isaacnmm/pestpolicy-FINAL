<h3 id="1-jbl-live-100-in-ear-headphones-earbuds-with-in-line--1-pick">1. JBL Live 100 In-Ear <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5DQH2P/?tag=p-policy-20">Headphones/ EarBuds with In-Line -#1 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Next, on the list is this JBL Live 100. The JBL Live 100 aluminum earbuds has the natural sound quality, an excellent build quality (fabric cable - tangle-free ), comfortable fit, and the one-button mic or remote - all for under $50.</p>
<p>JBL Live 100&rsquo;s natural sound is adequately balanced between treble and mid-range sound (balancing low &amp; high notes) to create some treble sound effects. While you have 3 varied silicone tips, they all have 8 mm drivers to give you enhanced and deep bass.
With the one-button mic or remote, you readily access the voice assistant, phone calls, and control your music - and hence you can go hands-free. Finally, the earbud comes with flat cables that do not experience tangling.
With its deep bass, this earbud will be great for listening to hip-hop, rock, and pop music.
I also loved its lightweight design and the overall aluminum housing - which is aesthetically amazing.
I noted that the earbuds fat low end made the rock music choruses to be highly meaty and lush. However, this JBL Live 100 lacks volume control, but for its price range, I love it.

.
Due to the sensitivity and accuracy of its driver, this earbud won&rsquo;t struggle to give sound output from your smartphone. It performs flawlessly with both low and high-frequency sounds.
Regarding noise isolation, SE112-GR will easily outdo most earphones in the market. It also comes with three different-sized tips, which further help in noise isolation. They fit perfectly in the ear canal, and you don&rsquo;t have to insert very deep to get a perfect fit.
Shure still manages to maintain durability in this earbud despite not using metallic materials. The earbud housing is all plastic while the cable is made of durable rubber. The 3.5mm cable is intentionally made to be right angle because it does not put a lot of stress on the headphone jack.

Another notable extra is the ability of the earpieces to stick together due to the magnets on the back of each earbud. When not in use, the earpieces close around your neck like a chain. Thus, it&rsquo;s not easy to lose them.

With the remote function, you can use these earphones with iOS, Android as well as some window devices.

<p>This SoundMAGIC E10 is a great addition to your collection or even take as a birthday (or maybe Christmas) gift.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they have an audiophile quality sound and feel equally premium. Further, the earbuds will give you a neutral sound signature  and guess what all for cheap.
For runners, you&rsquo;ll need the sweat-proof option for your runs. So, for small ears, go for an earbud that feels snug on the ear and one that&rsquo;s having soft silicone tips to fit your size. I noted that the medium-size (silicone-rubber) tips are a great fit for most people. But the double-flanged tips offered adequate seal.
It&rsquo;s designed from durable metal and textured cable, but you could find them to be slightly more substantial compared to the plastic earbuds. Luckily, with the tangle-resistant, you&rsquo;ll not have problems with line interweaving.
Further, the SoundMagic E10 provides enough bass response and noise isolation. Also, it allows an agile and neutral response, which guarantees that you&rsquo;ll not disturb people near you, such as travelers.
It has some extended bass, and they tremble  with an active bass that easily handles complex music track mix. However, note that these earbuds are not the

<p>If youre looking for a basshead earphone, then CX 300 II from Sennheiser will be a good choice. Its popularly known for its enhanced bass and excellent noise isolation capability.
Some earbuds wont give you the bass sound you want with some music genres. But CX 300 II performs greatly with all music genres.
The highs also tend to be very pleasant, allowing you to listen to the vocals without getting fatigued quickly. Thus, no matter how long you listen to music using these earbuds, you won&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable.
CX 300 II features silicon ear tips, which enhance the quality of sound and ensure your comfort. The package comes with three different-sized ear tips so that you can choose one that fits into your ear perfectly.
Sennheiser sticks to the asymmetrical cable which for some reason doesnt impress much. You might have to wrap it over your neck to keep the earcups from being pulled down.
In addition, the material and design of the cable make it vulnerable to twisting under certain conditions. But its long enough to use comfortably in any position.
Both new and popular brands are innovating each day to edge one another in the earphones industry. This puts users in a dilemma when searching for the best cheap earbuds.
