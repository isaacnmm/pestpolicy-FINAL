<p>Mold thrives on moist surfaces, especially in places with inadequate ventilation, making your <a href="/posts/a-tour-of-chelseas-hall-bathroom-renovation/">bathroom</a> ceiling a fertile breeding area for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot just apply any paint, say the water-based type, and expect to eradicate it because some regular water-based paints provide food for these fungi in the long run.</p>
<p>I have labored to give you a list of paints that will solve the mold problem and turn your bathroom into a place you will want to spend a little more time.</p>
<h2 id="s-7-best-paint-for-bathroom-ceiling-to-prevent-mold-2025">s: 7 Best Paint for Bathroom Ceiling to Prevent Mold 2025</h2>

<p>More excitingly, you will realize that it only features the real metal particles and combines the traditional color pigments and pearlescent to deliver a beautiful palette of gleaming colors.</p>

      <title>Do You Need to Backroll After Spraying Ceiling</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve recently sprayed the <a href="/posts/how-do-you-paint-a-ceiling-in-a-stairwell/">ceiling</a> in your home or are considering doing so, you might be wondering if backrolling is necessary after the spraying process.</p>
<p>In this article, we will delve into whether backrolling is required after spraying the ceiling, why it matters, and provide you with a comprehensive guide on achieving a professional-looking ceiling paint job.
<strong>Yes, backrolling is essential after spraying the ceiling</strong>
.
<em>While spraying can help you cover large areas quickly and evenly, backrolling plays a crucial role in ensuring proper paint adhesion, removing air bubbles, and achieving a smooth and consistent finish. Without backrolling, you may end up with an uneven surface, visible streaks, or poor coverage, which can negatively impact the overall aesthetics of your ceiling.</em>
To explain it simply, backrolling involves using a paint roller to go over the sprayed surface immediately after applying the paint with a paint sprayer. This technique helps to press the paint into the surface, ensuring better adhesion and a more even distribution of the paint.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-backrolling-after-spraying-ceiling"><em>Importance of Backrolling After Spraying Ceiling</em></h2>
<p>Backrolling after spraying the ceiling is a crucial step in the painting process that shouldn&rsquo;t be skipped. It serves several important purposes:
<strong>Improved Adhesion:</strong>
Backrolling helps the paint adhere better to the surface. When you backroll, the roller presses the paint into any pores or imperfections on the ceiling&rsquo;s surface, ensuring better bonding between the paint and the substrate.
<strong>1. Eliminating Air Bubbles:</strong>
Spraying paint can sometimes introduce tiny air bubbles into the paint film. Backrolling helps to smooth out these bubbles, leading to a more even and uniform appearance.
<strong>2. Achieving Uniform Coverage:</strong>
Backrolling ensures that the paint is evenly distributed across the surface, reducing the risk of patchy or uneven areas.
<strong>3. Minimizing Drips and Runs:</strong>
When using a paint sprayer, there is a higher chance of overspray, drips, or runs. Backrolling allows you to catch and correct any of these issues quickly.
<strong>4. Enhancing the Finish:</strong>
By combining the techniques of spraying and backrolling, you can achieve a professional-looking finish that rivals the results achieved by experienced painters.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-backroll-after-spraying-ceiling"><em>How to Backroll After Spraying Ceiling</em></h2>
<p>To effectively backroll after spraying the ceiling, follow these step-by-step instructions:
<strong>1. Preparation:</strong>
Before you begin, ensure that the ceiling surface is clean, dry, and free from dust or debris. Cover the floor and furniture with drop cloths or plastic sheets to protect them from paint splatters.
<strong>2. Select the Right Roller:</strong>
Choose a high-quality roller suitable for the type of paint you are using and the texture of your ceiling. A 3/8-inch nap roller is a common choice for most ceiling surfaces.
<strong>3. Cutting In:</strong>
Begin by &ldquo;cutting in&rdquo; the edges of the ceiling using a paintbrush. This involves painting a border around the edges of the ceiling, usually about 2-3 inches wide, where the roller cannot reach easily.
<strong>4. Spray the Ceiling:</strong>
Once the cutting-in is complete, use a paint sprayer to apply the paint to the rest of the ceiling. Maintain a consistent distance from the surface to ensure even coverage.
<strong>5. Backroll Immediately:</strong>
While the sprayed paint is still wet, take the roller and gently go over the sprayed area in a single, continuous motion. Apply light pressure to avoid creating additional texture. Work in manageable sections, overlapping each stroke slightly.
<strong>6. Maintain a Wet Edge:</strong>
To achieve a seamless finish, make sure to keep a &ldquo;wet edge&rdquo; while backrolling. This means rolling into the unpainted area while the paint is still wet, preventing visible lines between the sections.
<strong>7. Work in Small Sections:</strong>
Complete the backrolling in small sections to avoid the paint drying too quickly, which could result in visible lines or uneven textures.
<strong>8. Check for Uniformity:</strong>
After backrolling the entire ceiling, step back and inspect the surface for any areas that may need touch-ups or additional backrolling to ensure a consistent finish.</p>
<h2 id="additional-tips-and-considerations"><em>Additional Tips and Considerations</em></h2>
<p>Here are some additional tips and considerations to keep in mind when backrolling after spraying the ceiling:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Quality of Paint and Tools:**Use high-quality paint and rollers to achieve the best results. Cheaper paints and rollers may not provide the level of adhesion and coverage needed for a flawless finish.</li>
<li>**Test in an Inconspicuous Area:**Before spraying and backrolling the entire ceiling, conduct a test in a small, inconspicuous area to ensure you are satisfied with the technique and the appearance of the paint.</li>
<li>**Practice Makes Perfect:**If you&rsquo;re new to painting or using a paint sprayer, consider practicing on a scrap piece of drywall or cardboard to get comfortable with the equipment and technique before tackling the actual ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q1-is-backrolling-necessary-for-all-types-of-ceiling-paint"><em>Q1: Is Backrolling Necessary for All Types of Ceiling Paint?</em></h3>
<p>The necessity of backrolling after spraying the ceiling can depend on the type of paint you are using and the surface&rsquo;s texture.</p>
<p>While it is generally recommended for most types of paint, some specialized ceiling paints, such as certain low-sheen or self-leveling varieties, may not require backrolling. Always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s guidelines and product recommendations for the best results.</p>
<h3 id="q2-can-i-backroll-over-a-previously-sprayed-ceiling">*Q2: *<em>Can I Backroll Over a Previously Sprayed Ceiling?</em></h3>
<p>Yes, you can backroll over a previously sprayed ceiling if you are repainting or touching up the surface. Ensure that the existing paint is still in good condition and adhering well to the surface.</p>
<p>If necessary, lightly sand any flaking or peeling areas before applying the new paint. Backrolling will help blend the new paint with the existing one, providing a seamless finish.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><em>Conclusion</em></h2>
<p>In conclusion, backrolling is an essential step in achieving a professional-looking finish when spraying the ceiling.</p>
<p>By understanding the importance of backrolling and following the right techniques, you can ensure better adhesion, eliminate air bubbles, achieve uniform coverage, and enhance the overall finish of your ceiling paint job.</p>
<p>Remember to choose the right paint and tools, practice before starting, and always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations. With these tips, you can confidently take on your ceiling painting project and create a stunning and flawless result that adds beauty and value to your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Painting a ceiling in a <a href="/posts/how-to-decorate-a-stairwell/">stairwell</a> can be a challenging task due to the confined space and height involved. However, with the right preparation and techniques, you can achieve a professional-looking result.
In this guide, we will walk you through the steps of painting a ceiling in a stairwell, providing tips and tricks to make the process easier and more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-paint-a-ceiling-in-a-stairwell">How Do You Paint A Ceiling In A Stairwell?</h2>
<p>To paint a ceiling in a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-paint-a-stairwell/">stairwell</a>
, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preparation</strong>: Before starting, gather all the necessary materials, including paint, brushes, rollers, drop cloths, painter&rsquo;s tape, a ladder or scaffolding, and safety equipment like goggles and a dust mask. Clear the area beneath the ceiling and cover it with drop cloths to protect against paint spills. Use painter&rsquo;s tape to protect walls and handrails from accidental splatters.</li>
<li><strong>Safety First</strong>: Safety is paramount when working in a stairwell. Ensure your ladder or scaffolding is stable and securely positioned. Use a ladder with adjustable legs or a ladder stabilizer to provide better stability. Always maintain three points of contact with the ladder while painting.</li>
<li><strong>Choose the Right Paint</strong>: Opt for a high-quality ceiling paint that is specifically designed for ceilings. These paints have better coverage and adhesion properties, reducing the need for multiple coats. Additionally, consider using paint with a matte or flat finish to hide imperfections and minimize glare.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting In</strong>: Start by &ldquo;cutting in&rdquo; the edges of the ceiling using a brush. Carefully paint along the perimeter where the ceiling meets the walls and any architectural features. This will create a smooth transition between the ceiling and walls.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling the Ceiling</strong>: Once the edges are painted, use a roller with an extension pole to apply paint to the rest of the ceiling. Work in small sections, using a W or M pattern for even coverage. Avoid applying too much pressure on the roller to prevent paint splatters.</li>
<li><strong>Work from Top to Bottom</strong>: To avoid accidentally brushing against wet paint, start painting the ceiling at the highest point of the stairwell and work your way down toward the bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Coats</strong>: Depending on the color and type of paint, you may need to apply multiple coats for complete coverage. Allow each coat to dry thoroughly before applying the next.</li>
<li><strong>Touch-Ups</strong>: After the final coat has dried, inspect the ceiling for any missed spots or imperfections. Perform touch-ups as needed to achieve a flawless finish.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="additional-tips-and-techniques"><strong>Additional Tips and Techniques</strong></h2>

<h3 id="a-painting-tools-selection">a. Painting tools selection</h3>
<p>Tool selection is the most critical step in achieving quality finish when painting since tools determine the paint pick-up and release effectiveness.ï¿½Ensure to remove all excess paint from the roller as you&rsquo;re
putting the paint roller
to get different paint. When painting, you will need some of the following devices for tools/items in place:</p>

<li>Ceiling paint andpaint remover
<strong>NB:</strong>
Not every tool may be used during the painting process. Some ceiling surfaces demands different tools. However, you will need to have at least the listed tools in case of immediate considerations when painting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-surface-preparationcleaning">b. Surface Preparation/Cleaning</h3>
<p>The ceiling must be cleaned thoroughly before the paint application begins. In this regard, a newly constructed ceiling should be left to dry completely before painting. You can accelerate the drying process by warming the room gently for some time.
When restoring a painted ceiling, scrape off the old paint with a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086JDRQ8T/?tag=p-policy-20">blunt knife</a>
or scrapper gently  avoid destroying the primary surface material. Then, sand the surface appropriately.
You can fill the damaged ceiling with putty or
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071X7TYYM/?tag=p-policy-20">sealant</a>
before polishing to eliminate protrusions or leakages that may lead to streaks or roller marks when painting. Moreover, wipe the ceiling entirely to remove dust or debris from the surface  these remnants weaken the paint stickiness and cause peeling action with time.
<strong>NB:</strong>
Concrete ceiling should not be sand to avoid structural distortion. Instead, the surface should be finished using fine cement plaster in the right ratio.

<p>Select
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LNYA34/?tag=p-policy-20">ceiling paint</a>
according to the type of primary ceiling material. The paint used on a concrete ceiling may not work best when used on a wooden ceiling or granite ceiling. Some water-based paints often peel or chip when applied on a humid concrete ceiling without priming.
On the other hand, acrylic paint wont work correctly on granite ceiling material without a proper thinning process. Marine board ceiling requires thin oil-based paint (not in the kitchen or fireplace) for the perfect finish, while the wooden ceiling is best painted with
acrylic latex paint
.
It is essential to thin thick paint appropriately for easier pick-up by the roller or paintbrush during paint preparation. Paint over dilution will lead to excess drains and dripping when painting.
Usually, you will need to carry out a drop test on the ceiling surface to ascertain the effectiveness of a given paint concentration before the application process commence. Moreover, its required that you follow the manufacturers instructions appropriately when preparing the paint.</p>
<h3 id="d-actual-painting">d. Actual Painting</h3>
<p>To carry out the painting process, you need to follow some of the following steps to the dot. The steps differ slightly (as explained) according to primary ceiling material.
You may also use the double coating or laying tactic through
spraying on different courses
while spraying your walls and selling.
<strong>1. Prime the ceiling</strong>
A porous and new drywall ceiling should be primed before any painting process begins  this improves the surface stickiness ability. Though some paint does not require priming when painting, porous/humid walls should be primed to reduce peeling and chip action due to reduced stickiness action.
<strong>2. Set the masking tape</strong>
The maskin tape
applies to the ceiling that is painted with different paint-color designs. When setting the tape, it should be aligned so that the side to be painted lay on the tape&rsquo;s inner side. It would be best to allow the paint to dry (select fast-drying paint) before re-setting the tape.</p>

<strong>3. Cut all corners with a paintbrush before rolling.</strong>
Roller painting may not reach the corners sufficiently when painting. You will need to use a
paintbrush
to cut all corners and edges before you start roller-painting. Angled paintbrushes with tapered tips are best for edges, while round paintbrushes work excellent for paint application corners.
When cutting corners, load your paint slightly and apply gentle force when painting to avoid dripping on the sidewalls  wipe out immediately with soapy detergent or use paint remover.
<strong>4. Less paint load in roller</strong>
When loading your roller, use less paint to prevent roller marks on the ceiling  excess paint leads to a thick layer, which drains or drips as the application occurs.
You need to remove excess paint on the roller edges when loading to prevent roller marks. If required to use a sprayer, you may employ
an airless sprayer</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>avoid air or HVLP sprayer.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uYMSxBh_Ro">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uYMSxBh_Ro</a>
<strong>5. Use a thin roller nap</strong>
The thickness of the roller nap should be as minimal as possible. Thicker roller nap produces a sloppier paint layer that is thick and ugly stipple. Indeed, a thick roller nap creates conspicuous roller marks that are more tedious to smoothen with a paintbrush.
Consider buying aï¿½  roller nap with fine finish material and perfectly trimmed to prevent side paint release when painting.
<strong>6. Rolling technique</strong>
When paint rolling, move your paint loaded roller in one direction of the ceiling continuously. Then, change the direction of rolling  the opposite direction. These rolling techniques help eliminate roller marks that may have been formed before drying out (for fast drying paints).
Typically, the first coat should be rolled in one direction while the other takes the other rolling direction. Do not over press the roller on the ceiling when roll painting (may cause roller marks)  high-quality paint should stick instantly upon contacting the ceiling&rsquo;s primary surface.
NB: Always run your roller from painted section than dry areas to prevent/reduce roller mark formation.
<strong>7. Flat paint sheen</strong>
Sheen determines how shinny the ceiling finish will appear after painting. Paint could either be satin (little sheen), semi-gloss (medium sheen), gloss (very high sheen), or flat (no sheen).
Consider flat sheen paint for your ceiling painting activity  this particular paint has no sheen thus wont reflect tiny roller marks left behind.
<strong>8. Multiple layers</strong>
The newly painted ceiling should be coated with several paint layers to improve stickiness and durability. Usually, appropriate rolling techniques (directional) should be used when painting.
The subsequent layers should only be applied after the previous once have cured to improve stickiness strength. Multiple layer painting reduces the ruggedness (on the ceiling material) that may initiate roller marks when painting.</li>
</ul>

<strong>9. Use of ladder</strong>
Set a stand-alone ladder at an appropriate height that you can access the ceiling without straining. The roller motion should be smooth at that selected ladders height without over pressing.
Utilizing the ladder while painting with your roller will significantly get

<ul>
<li>you get to employ an extension pole while you&rsquo;re getting to reach the ceiling surface.
Besides, it would help if you cut edges when painting without frequent shifting of the ladderhaving an assistant person when painting reduces the hassle of setting the ladder or even toughing it with paint-stained hands.
<strong>10. No overfilling</strong>
Avoid overloaded
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-roller-to-hide-imperfections/">roller</a>
or paintbrush as it causes drains and leaves roller marks when painting. Upon application of rolling force, the paint spreads to the edges leaving side drains and drips.
You must clean excess paint (squeeze) before application  the best method of reducing paint load is by running the roller over a tray that picks excess paint.
<strong>11. Spray the ceiling</strong>
The best method of eliminating roller marks is by use of
a ceiling paint sprayer
. The sprayer releases paint in small quantities that stick uniformly, forming a thin, smooth final finish.
Though the method is slightly expensive (compared to paintbrush and roller), it guarantees quality service and minimal wastage during the application process.
Importantly, spray painting is faster and improves stickiness ability due to extra painting force from the sprayer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="e-paint-finishing">e. Paint finishing</h3>
<p>Once the entire ceiling is painted, inspect keenly on points that may have roller marks. Remove any existing roller marks using a soft nap roller  you need a 1/2 roller nap with a fine material finish for efficient performance.
When eliminating roller marks, run the soft nap roller gently on the section with roller marks until they are eliminated.
A small sized paint roller is the best for roller marks elimination  it reduces direct contact with adjacent areas without any roller mark. Leave the newly painted surface to cure naturally without any warming or overcooling.
<strong>NB:</strong>
Never sand painted ceiling trying to remove roller marks  sanding creates scratches and dislodge primary material eventually.</p>
<h2 id="safety-measures-and-precaution-to-consider-when-painting-a-ceiling">Safety Measures and Precaution to Consider When Painting a Ceiling</h2>
<p>Successful painting without roller marks is not until safety measures, and precautions are put in place. Consider some of these precautions and safety measures when painting your ceiling:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never use a ladder without a ground stopper when painting  prevents sliding.</li>
<li>Wear painting gears always  face mask, respirator, hand gloves, overalls, boots, andeye goggles for painting</li>
<li>Avoid painting when standing on a wet floor  you may accidentally slip and injure yourself. Moping should be done before painting commences.</li>
<li>The polished ceiling should be cleaned thoroughly to remove dust particles that may weaken the paint stickiness when painting. More so, breathing dust/dirt cause nasal irritation.</li>
<li>Thin, thick paint before rolling to avoid roller mark creation</li>
<li>A porous ceiling and drywall ceiling should be primed to improve paint stickiness strength.</li>
<li>Appropriate paint should be selected according to the nature of the primary surface material of the ceiling.</li>
<li>The stand-alone adjustable ladder should be used when painting to access the ceiling at ease  avoid ladder that leans on the wall (it may slide when painting and dont support maximum access of ceiling center when painting)</li>
<li>The floor should be covered with a plastic cover or newspaper to prevent dripping paint (from the ceiling) from staining the floor.</li>
<li>Clean the paint-stained section with water and soap or paint remover immediately before it dries out</li>
<li>Over diluting will cause excess drips and drains when painting.</li>
<li>Always follow the manufacturers instructions when preparing paint.</li>
<li>The kitchen ceiling and fireplace ceiling should never be painted with oil-based paint  may catch fire.
NB: Consider
paint sprayer
as the best alternative for excellent ceiling paint without roller marks.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-roller-marks-from-dried-paint-from-the-ceiling">How to Remove Roller Marks from Dried Paint from the Ceiling</h2>
<p>Dried roller marks may be challenging to repair due to continuous reinforcement of the paint and primary surface material. However, you can still achieve a classic finish if you follow the steps below:</p>
<h3 id="a-mark-and-clean-the-area-with-roller-marks">a. Mark and clean the area with roller marks</h3>
<p>You will need to identify the section with roller marks and scrap it off gently using the scraper. Make sure you dont extend too far on the adjacent area in the process.</p>
<h3 id="b-prime-the-clean-area">b. Prime The Clean Area</h3>
<p>Primer is usually applied for the porous ceiling and new drywall ceiling to improve stickiness strength. Besides, some water-based paint will always need a primer (as per the manufacturers instructions) before the actual application.</p>
<h3 id="c-prepare-the-paint-and-apply">c. Prepare the paint and apply</h3>
<p>Dilute or thin paint appropriately and apply gently using a soft paintbrush or a roller on the cleaned section. To achieve the best finish result, use the paint sprayer instead  the sprayed paint perfectly merges with the adjacent old paint layer without any roller marks.ï¿½Leave the painted surface to cure naturally.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Roller marks are common problems experienced when painting a ceiling. Suppose you want to succeed in painting a ceiling without roller marks?
In that case, you will have to consider the following step appropriately: surface preparation/cleaning, painting tools selection, paint preparation, actual painting, and paint finish techniques keenly.
You must also adhere to safety measures and precautions highlighted in this article for your health safety when painting.
Remember, high-quality final finish calls for the best method, which is a function of more financial input. You can consider a paint sprayer as a better alternative for a roller or paintbrush.</p>

      <description>Before proceeding to paint the popcorn ceiling, lets first understand what is popcorn ceiling?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before proceeding to paint the popcorn <a href="/posts/do-you-need-to-backroll-after-spraying-ceiling/">ceiling</a>, lets first understand what is popcorn ceiling?
Popcorn also referred to as stucco ceiling is a ceiling that has been designed with acoustic texture made from mixed Styrofoam balls.</p>
<p>Popcorn used in the pre-1970s contained some elements of asbestos and therefore its important to first check for asbestos in your ceiling before you can proceed to paint.
Asbestos is considered to be carcinogenic and no longer advisable for use on ceilings. If present, you may consider getting rid of the ceiling due to its health risk.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-paint-popcorn-ceiling-step-by-step">Details: How to Paint Popcorn Ceiling (Step-by-Step)</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-choosing-the-right-color">Step 1: Choosing the Right Color</h3>
<p>If you are
DIYer using a sprayer
is by far much better - it is faster and even more effective compared to a roller. But, not everyone can afford a sprayer making a roller the best alternative.
Now that you have settled for painting your popcorn ceiling, there are a few things that you need to note before you can proceed to have your ceiling done.
Choosing the appropriate paint color for your ceiling is the first step to starting your paintwork. This is a very important step in the sense that you have made the choice of how you want your ceiling to be.
After this, you will need to gather tools for doing the paintwork. What tools must you have?</p>
<h3 id="step-2-tools-for-painting-popcorn-ceiling">Step 2: Tools for Painting Popcorn Ceiling</h3>
<p>Another advantage of popcorn is that they are sound-proof and also good at hiding imperfections. Choosing
a sprayer or a roller
is something that needs consideration.</p>

<li>Utility knife</li>
<li>A 9-inch roller frame</li>
<li>inch roller covers</li>
<li>Rolls of masking tape</li>
<li>Extension pole</li>
<li>Painters brush</li>
<li>Drop cloth</li>
<li>Respirator</li>

<h3 id="step-3-surfacesite-preparation">Step 3: Surface/site Preparation</h3>
<p>When you are sure you have all the tools needed for the job, you can begin by setting up the site in preparation for the job.
This includes sitting at the most strategic point to place your step ladder for good coverage of the ceiling.
The next point is laying the drop cloth by clearing any material underneath and organizing where to keep your tools.
When you are done, mark out all the edges and the walls that are within your painting range with masking tape to help minimize paint dropping.
You can either remove the furniture within the room or have them well covered with a big drop cloth.ï¿½Ensure to mask the drop cloth to the floor to avoid dust from underneath getting on the furniture.
Ensure the furniture is protected from paint dropping above and the dust from below the surface. When the workspace is ready and covering done - proceed to the next step.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-thinning-the-paint">Step 4: Thinning the Paint</h3>
<p>Use the utility knife to open the paint and if the paint is very thick, they are a high likelihood it going to flake off.
Thinning the paint to at least 20 % is recommendable but that will also be determined on the given paint recommendations.
Further recommendations on thinning formula can also be provided by the paint store. A thinner paint is by far much easier to roll and minimizes the chances of clogging the sprayer.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-dusting-off-the-ceiling">Step 4: Dusting off the Ceiling</h3>
<p>By now, you are probably done with preparing everything on the ground and only left with the ceiling.
It is advisable to brush off the surface with a dry brush. This is to get rid of any dust and webs that could have been to the ceiling.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-removing-ceiling-stains">Step 5: Removing ceiling stains</h3>
<p>If the ceiling is stained, painting it directly will be a bad idea. It is therefore prudent to get a general primer that will work well with the paint.
I recommend you consider a primer like Kilz Oil-Based Primer. This will do an amazing job that will hardly notice there was a stain after painting.
Leave it for about 30 minutes to dry before you can proceed to do the painting - check these
Wagner Paint Sprayers
.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-rolling-the-paint-on-the-popcorn-ceiling">Step 6: Rolling the paint on the popcorn ceiling</h3>
<p>You can start by painting the edges of the walls and borders with a brush, an angled brush would be better.
If you are using a roller a  inch is the most suitable with good absorbing abilities be careful not to press it hard against the ceiling.
This is to minimize any chances of the ceiling flaking. Roll it gently in one direction (say north-south or east to west) while creating an overlap of 50%.
Sometimes you may notice little texture coming off which is perfectly normal, but if it reaches a point where large chunks are flaking off, I advise you to stop using the roller and instead opt for a sprayer.
This overlap is an important role to help you achieve full coverage of the ceiling. Repeat the paint until you have a dried surface while avoiding any roller lines that may occur.
Wait for at least 30 minutes before you can apply the second coat. In the second coat, roll the paint in the opposite direction, this will help you achieved a well-covered surface.
Do not forget to observe a 50% overlap to achieve full coverage. Repeat this for the third and the fourth coat if the popcorn was in a bad condition until you get that professional finish.
Take your time after you are done to check if there are any imperfections so that you can work on them before cleaning up your tool.</p>

<ul>
<li>Popcorn ceiling and walls are mainly applied because they are cheap. When you compare it to another kind of ceilings, they are easy to fit and consume little time and labor when fitting. The smooth textured surface like knockdown requires a lot of skill, but that not the case with popcorn.</li>
<li>Popcorn uses Styrofoam which creates a sound-proof ceiling and therefore reducing noises and echoes in the room.</li>
<li>Another benefit of popcorn is how it hides imperfections. Unlike the knockdown, you will hardly notice the imperfections because of the textured nature of the popcorn</li>

<h3 id="spraying-vs-rolling">Spraying Vs Rolling</h3>
<p>If you are stuck between rolling and spraying your popcorn ceiling, I have an answer for you.
If you have a sprayer or considering owning one, it is the most appropriate form of the application over rolling.
With a sprayer, you are likely to finish your work faster as compared to rolling. With a sprayer, you will most probably take about an hour to finish a house while for a roller, you may take the whole day.
Another benefit is that unlike spraying, rolling is most probably going to cause flaking or peeling off the ceiling while spraying won&rsquo;t.
However, the advantage of rollers is that they are readily available and cheap.</p>
