ow to get rid of squirrels in the yard.
*Are you tired from squirrels and want to get rid of them? We will help you with this. *
<em>With the passage of time and need of the hour, various methods have emerged to tackle this specieshome�remedies to eliminate squirrels.�</em>
Squirrels are an animal that looks quite funny, being small in size, and extremely active and elusive. With the
restless nature and extreme swift movements, they are tough to catch and potentially can cause a lot of damage to your property and holdings.
<strong>See <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-attack-humans/">Squirrel</a> solutions.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;How To Get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">Rid</a> of Squirrels in the Yard&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Squirrels dont leave anything unharmed, from woods to vegetables; all are vulnerable to their potential of harmful instincts.
They can cause fleas and even tick to your pets.</p>
<h2 id="1squirrels-repellents">1.Squirrels Repellents<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1squirrels-repellents">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the present world, there are numerous products available in the market. These products come in a wide variety.
Most of them are made with natural ingredients, which aids in keeping the squirrels away from the place. There are different ways of how these repellents are being made presently; a few of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A kind of repellent is made from the urine of squirrels predators, which is very interesting and a relatively new concept, adopting recently.</li>
<li>Theserepellents are sprayedaround gardens for the sake of keeping the squirrels away. Their effectiveness has been very impressive and is slowly turning into a go-to option for people suffering from these species.</li>
<li>There are a few kinds of repellents that are made up of black pepper. The advantage with this type of method is that while they are very effective in repelling the squirrels, at the same time, it doesnt take trouble birds, which makes it handful and keep the birds happy and calm. This kind of repellent can easily be added to bird feeders.
So what do you wait for? Get rid of squirrels by using the following easy to carry out remedies.
But first:

</ul>
<h2 id="2-dont-feed-them">2. Dont feed them<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-dont-feed-them">¶</a></h2>
<p>Squirrels come to the home because you feed them. Surprised?
Yes, we are feeding these squirrels unintentionally. These squirrels come to our home regularly because they find something to fill their belly up every time they come.
So its high time we figure out what they eat and start keeping such things away from them. Please dont give them an easy meal to have and a party at your place.</p>
<h2 id="3-applyapple-cider-vinegar">3. ApplyApple Cider Vinegar<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-applyapple-cider-vinegar">¶</a></h2>
<p>The usage of apple cider vinegar has turned fruitful in an attempt to free place from squirrels.
It works very simply by adding apple cider vinegar into a spray bottle and spray it near the holes, open corners, flower pots, or any other place where squirrels frequently visit.
The factor that makes this method useful is its pungent acidic smell, which squirrels couldnt handle.</p>
<h2 id="3-use-electric-fencing">3. Use Electric Fencing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-use-electric-fencing">¶</a></h2>
<p>This method is an old fashioned one but mighty effective. Squirrels find it very easy to nibble the wires and extremely difficult to manage these fences.
Even these fences have been upgraded to an electric type. Therefore, it is highly advisable to use an electric fence around your place rather than mere wires.</p>
<h2 id="4-use-of-safflower">4. Use of Safflower<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-use-of-safflower">¶</a></h2>
<p>Seeds of safflower are very bitter and acidic in taste and can be life-taking in squirrels. If these rodents are to be kept away from bird feeders, put safflower seeds in it.
On the one hand, these seeds are devastating for the squirrels and, on the other hand, harmless for birds, making it a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="5-sprinkle-pepper-chilli">5. Sprinkle Pepper (Chilli)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-sprinkle-pepper-chilli">¶</a></h3>
<p>A mixture of chili pepper and birdseed has turned into a good natural weapon to free place from squirrels. This mixture can be placed in the feeder for birds.
As the previous method of Safflower, this method keeps the squirrels away while keeping the birds unharmed and normal.</p>
<h2 id="6-hot-peppers-and-garlic-cloves">6. Hot Peppers and Garlic Cloves<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-hot-peppers-and-garlic-cloves">¶</a></h2>
<p>Talking about mixtures, one more mixture has become very useful. This is a mixture of finely grounded hot peppers and garlic cloves in almost equal proportions.
Then add some water to mix it and a paste of it. Once the powdery paste is ready, sprinkle it to the parts where squirrels normally visit.</p>
<h2 id="7-jalapeno-pepper">7. Jalapeno Pepper<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#7-jalapeno-pepper">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the list of the mixture, one more mixture has recently gained popularity, i.e., the mixture of jalapeno pepper, water, and vinegar.
Shake it as hard as you can and like the other methods, spray it to the corners and commonly used places by squirrels.

<h2 id="how-to-scare-away-squirrels">How to Scare Away Squirrels<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-scare-away-squirrels">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Squirrel Exclusion Collars</strong>
<em>Want to scare the squirrels?�</em>
Scaring the squirrel can be an effective and proactive approach for the exclusion of squirrels. One of the things that really scare out these squirrels is the collar typically made up of sharp metal.
These collars are positioned around the trees, poles, and bird feeders. When this animal tries to
climb up the pole
, it finds it extremely difficult to climb a smooth metal disk. Not only is it difficult to climb up, but it also injures the squirrels, perhaps the reason for their fright.
<strong>2. Usage of chemicals</strong>
As science has evolved, different kinds of chemicals have been explored and used to clear the place from squirrels; at
times, chemicals can be damaging for squirrels also, which aids in creating a fear factor in these species&rsquo; minds.
Attics are dry, warm, and mostly uninhabited. Thus, it makes it an ideal place for squirrels to settle down, build a place for them, a nest, store food, and try to be protected from other enemies outside.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-attic">How to Get Rid Of Squirrels in the Attic<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-attic">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Close Attic Entry Points</strong>
The basic thing to protect an attic from squirrels is to close all possible and visible entry, and exit points squirrels can utilize.
Make sure you use nails and a hammer to seal all such spots. Please dont give them an easy access point to come over and live and build.
<strong>2. Use of mothballs</strong>
Usage of mothballs has gained acceptance and popularity in the ear past, as they have proven themselves enormously useful when it comes to getting rid of squirrels.
Mothballs are made up of naphthalene balls, which is the chief element in driving out these species. The cost of this method is very affordable, hence the grown usage.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-roof-space">How to Get Rid Of Squirrels In Roof Space<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-roof-space">¶</a></h2>
<p>These days, squirrels are regarded as the peskiest of the pests, mainly due to their tenacity coupled with their devastating fretting and chewing on woodwork.
The two options that have proven themselves most effective are Exclusion and Trapping.
Upon removing squirrels, you must sot let them these species come again to your home.
You must carry out repairs and make sure you animal-proof your property, and consequently, more of this creature will come in to replace their evicted numbers.
People are not very aware of this type of trap. Different agencies are marketing it, hoping that this will gather popularity and acceptance.
<strong>1. Cage Traps</strong>
An evergreen method of catching squirrels is to trap them in cages. This method has remained a useful option ever since its inception.
Even today, its being used very aggressively to get rid of squirrels. Again like previous methods, this one also scares and annoys the squirrels.
One way exclusion doors.
As the name indicates, this box has only a way in and no way out for squirrels. This is a slightly newer kind of trap box that has come into the market.</p>
<h2 id="killing-squirrels-with-anti-freeze">Killing Squirrels with Anti-Freeze<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#killing-squirrels-with-anti-freeze">¶</a></h2>
<p>*Have you ever thought anti-freeze can kill these squirrels? Trust me, they can, but the process is risky. *
Anti-freezes active and decisive ingredient is its Ethylene Glycol. Its taste is quite sweet, hence that attraction for squirrels.
Its proven now that anti-freeze works as an outstanding
pest control
poison that curbs or eliminate rodents from your home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>Its risky because these are dangerous for our
pets like dogs and cats
, as they also like the sweetness of it and fall in the trap thats being laid, not for the squirrels.
The anti-freeze works as a useful and effective homemade
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-poison-for-squirrels/">squirrel poison</a>
; its dark side is it puts our pets&rsquo; lives at risk also.</p>
