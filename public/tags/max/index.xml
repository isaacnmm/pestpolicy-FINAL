      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a combat max 12-month roach killing bait review. Maybe youve already heard the old myth that roaches and bed bugs can survive a nuclear bomb exposition. Roaches are by far the most adaptable pests on earth, which is why getting rid of an infestation is never an easy task.

is designed to kill some of the biggest of all roaches  German roaches in as little as 12 hours and prevent re-infestations for as long as 12 months.
But, roaches can withstand a high radiation exposure level but won&rsquo;t survive Combat Max 12 roach killer. This review will discuss why Combat Max 12 roach killer is an effective roach killer against German roaches and is
safe for cats and dogs

<p>While roach showers and sprays are only good for getting rid of the roaches you see, they are not very effective at dealing with infestations. This is because
roaches propagate at an alarmingly high rate, and it doesnt take long for them to repopulate after a roach spray
attack.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkrhY-2sqIY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkrhY-2sqIY</a>
You need a powerful bait, such as the one in the Combat Max 12 Month
Roach Killer
. Baiting is a more effective way of dealing with cockroaches because it slowly but gradually spreads the poison within their population and hideouts.
Unlike sprays and showers, baits can affect many of their population because the toxin can be spread from roach to roach even when theyre dead.
Combat Max utilizes Fipronil, a powerful insecticide, in the creation of their baits, which are also comprised of food particles designed to attract German cockroaches and smaller, more stubborn roaches.
This 12-month roach killer comes with 18
bait stations
. Youll want this kind of coverage if youre dealing with a severe infestation or trying to de-infest a large house.
Combat Max starts to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/">kill off roaches</a>
in a matter of hours. Any roach killer that shows results in hours is promising. However, what makes this particular roach killer unique is that it remains active for up to 12 months.
If youve handled
roach infestations
before, then you know the only way to stop them is to be persistent about it. With a bait thats active for up to 12 months, you dont have to worry too much about the roaches coming back, especially if you set up the bait stations in the right places.

<h2 id="5-reasons-why-this-could-be-the-roach-killer-you-need">5 Reasons Why This Could Be the Roach Killer You Need</h2>
<h3 id="1-starts-killing-roaches-in-hours">1. Starts Killing Roaches in Hours</h3>
<p>When it comes to ridding your home of roach infestations, speed is an essential factor. The faster you can kill them off, the more effectively you will control the infestation.
Combat Max contains a lethal mix of the insecticide fipronil and tasty food scraps to bait the cockroaches. Once set up, the baits start killing immediately, and within a few hours, you may start seeing dead roaches all over the place.
Combat Max is, therefore, a good solution for large infestations as its killing potential is enough to disrupt the roaches re-population cycle.</p>
<h3 id="2-designed-to-kill-german-roaches">2. Designed to Kill German Roaches</h3>
<p>Combat Max is designed to eliminate
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/">German roaches</a>
, which can be bigger, smarter, and very stubborn pests. Go for it if youve confirmed that the roach infestation you want to get rid of is a camp of these stubborn nuisances.
That being said, the 12-month roach killer is just as effective when targeting smaller roaches, which can be harder to kill with sprays and showers as theyre very agile.
The baits work like charms when it comes to bringing roaches out of the woodwork and killing them (or at least assaulting their sensory organs) when they come into contact with them.

<h3 id="3-easy-to-set-up-and-use">3. Easy to Set Up and Use</h3>
<p>When shopping for the perfect roach killing bait, its easy to overlook the simple stuff, such as how easy it is to use or set up. Considering that youre handling very poisonous bait, it is important to think about this for a moment.
The Combat Max roach killer is very easy to set up thanks to its no-mess baits. Youre not dealing with powders or formulations here, just a good old solid roach bait thats completely child-resistant and deadly for roaches.
With plug-and-play functionality like this, you dont have to worry about anything other than setting up the baits in the right location. It doesnt get more convenient than this.</p>
<h3 id="4-comes-with-18-baits">4. Comes with 18 Baits</h3>
<p>One thing to love about the Combat Max roach killer is the amount of coverage you can get with such a small package. Offering up to 18 baits per pack, this is the roach
killer you need when
relentless roaches run over your home.
The bait stations are perfect for placing in the places roaches frequent the most  behind the fridge, dishwasher, and cooker, under the kitchen sink, hidden away in cabinets, under furniture, and wherever else the roaches are taking over in your home.
Though it depends on your roach infestation&rsquo;s severity, 18 baits are more than enough to get the situation under control.</p>
<h3 id="5-all-baits-are-childproof">5. All Baits are Childproof</h3>
<p>If youve got toddlers and young children in the house, you need to think about their safety when setting up the bait stations. With Combat Max, you can rest easy knowing that all 18 bait stations are encased in childproof containers and are therefore safe to use around the house.
For maximum effectiveness, always ensure that the bait stations are touching the walls and spread out at least 1 foot away from each other. They are especially useful when setting up in corners.
<strong>Pros�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers excellent coverage with 18 bait stations</li>
<li>Utilizes a powerful insecticide that kills in hours and lasts for 12 months</li>
<li>Designed to handle German cockroaches</li>
<li>Bait stations are easy to set up.
<strong>Cons�</strong></li>
<li>While sufficient enough to reduce infestations, Combat Max fails at curbing proliferation permanently.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Combat Max 12 Month Roach Killer should be enough for most roach infestations. The baits are encased in childproof containers, and thats a massive advantage if you have a family with small children.
Furthermore, it draws out roaches quickly and
kills them just as fast
. Setting up out of the box is relatively easy too.
On that note, it is fair to say that Combat Max is a decent choice for dealing with roaches (mainly German roaches), but dont expect it to completely stop the spread of roaches to other houses around you. It excels mostly at driving roaches out of your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today, Im at my house in Downtown Houston ready to do a review of the Drano Max Gel Clog Remover - the runner-up product in the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaners</a>
. I aim to see what the cleaner can do about a severe clog in my kitchen sink.
<em>Summary: Drano Max Gel will liquefy even the most challenging drain clogs in your plumbing or septic systems. This powerful drain cleaner will clean soap scum, hair, shampoo oil, organic matter, paper, &amp; grease. Its ultra-thick to move through standing water, and it&rsquo;s a 100% biodegradable product.�</em>
So, Ill go ahead. The label instruction recommends that I pour about a fifth of cleaner in this container and allow it to sit in there for 15-30 minutes. It&rsquo;s excellent for drains in the kitchen, laundry sinks, bathroom, lavatory, garbage disposals. Luckily, its also odorless, and not corrosive, and wont leave any waste.
<strong>See top drain cleaners.</strong>
I&rsquo;d tried to use boiling water, plungers,
vinegar, and baking soda, but they didn&rsquo;t remove the drain clog
.</p>
<h3 id="whats-this-drano-max-gel">What&rsquo;s this, Drano Max Gel?</h3>
<p>This Drano Max Gel is a powerful enzymatic
drain cleaner
that will clean most of your tough drain clogs. The cleanser is produced by S. C. Johnson &amp; Son  an American company that stands for quality and ethical manufacturing.
But the Drano Max Gel cleaner was first produced in 1923. So, you can guess that it has undergone numerous iterative improvements in safety and quality. �However, the company also has other products such as Drano snake and Drano Aerosol Plunger.
What makes Drano Max Gel unique among all the drain cleaners include-:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its produced to protect your pipes (both PVC and metal pipes) from corrosive action. Also, you can leave it overnight,working on your clogged drain.</li>
<li>It has quick action time  about 15 to 30 minutes before you flush out the debris using warm water.</li>
<li>You can pour into the sink with water, and itll cut through it and get to the drain clog fast with its natural enzyme formula.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="drain-test---time-it-takes-bottle-of-water-to-drain">Drain Test - Time it takes Bottle of water to drain</h2>
<p>To test this Drano
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner&rsquo;s</a>
effectiveness, well time how long it takes to drain a pre-measured bottle of water before and after using the drain cleaner. So, lets get started. I now pour the water (filled to the top line) while setting off the timer to check on time.
So, I am done pouring the water, and it has gone down the drain in 7.74 seconds (
<em>as shown in our timer below</em>
).</p>
<h2 id="now-pour-a-5th-of-the-drano-in-the-clogged-drain">Now, pour a 5th of the Drano in the clogged drain.</h2>
<p>As noted above, it took 7.74 seconds to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">drain the clean water</a>
. We&rsquo;ll come back to this time at the end of the experiment. But first, now we pour the Drano Max Gel.
Therefore, I thoroughly rinsed out this sink. Next, I pour about a fifth of the Drano Max Gel into the drain. Next, I set my timer and allow 20 minutes before we come back for the next process. Finally, the 20 minutes ended.</p>
<h2 id="flash-drain-with-warm-water">Flash Drain with Warm Water</h2>
<p>So, we continue following the label instructions. Next up, we now use warm water to flush the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/sink-not-draining-but-pipes-clear/">drain hoping that Drano has now cleared</a>
the clog. So, we do that right away  flush the water for about a minute, as fast as the faucet can run from the tap.
Luckily, I can already tell that the water is draining much faster than before using the Drano MAX Gel cleaner. When my wife brushed her teeth this morning, the water was backing up and getting to about three-quarters of the sink.
However, to verify my claims, well repeat the drain test  with clean water and a timer.</p>
<h2 id="second-drain-test---draining-clean-water-timer">Second Drain Test - Draining clean water (Timer)</h2>
<p>Now, we go back to the bottle filled with clean water and have our timer running. So, let&rsquo;s get right to the test. So, the water runs down the drain in about 4.36 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, this test shows we achieved faster water draining - but about 3.38 seconds. So, definitely, this Drano Max Gel Clog Remover works, and I would recommend that you trust it for your clogged drains and garbage disposal pipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage-results--">Usage Results: -</h3>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drano Max Gel Clog Remover is made to be a thick formula that&rsquo;ll dissolve even the toughest of the drain clogs. Further, being denser than water, the cleaner will move through standing water and work on the challenging clogs - including hair, soap scum, oils, and grease.
It has no phosphorus and will work great for septic systems, garbage disposals in addition to metal, PVC, and plastic pipes.</p>
