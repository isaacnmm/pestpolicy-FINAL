such as
Tea Tree Oil
and

Salt is cheap and readily available and is also easy to use. However, not all of them will give you the best result. So, does salt
kill bed bugs
?
<em>The short answer is, Yes and NO; bed�bugs have a waxy shell. Therefore, if you apply salt on them, the waxy shell will prevent the salt from being absorbed into their body to dehydrate them. Also, bed bugs feed solely on blood. Therefore, there is no way you can poison them with salt.�</em>

<p><strong>Why salt Might Kill Bed Bugs</strong>
For many reasons, individuals believe that they can use salt to
exterminate bed bugs
. For instance,
salt has been used for a long time to kill
other insects such as snails and slugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>People link this association to think that salt can affect bed bugs andbed bug babies.</li>
<li>Diatomaceous earth can kill bed bugs- this makes it easy to believe that salt can be used in the same way.Diatomaceous earth is one of the naturalways to rid bed bugs. Also, it is a short leap to create a connection to salt.</li>
<li>Bed bugs are best killedby dehydrating them, and salt might be a great tool to provide that result.
The statement above tends to show that salt cannot be used to
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/do-it-yourself-bed-bug-control">exterminate bed bugs</a>
. Nevertheless, there are tips to help you use salt in the right way to help you
eradicate bed bugs
in your house successfully.

</ul>
<h2 id="does-salt-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Does Salt Kill Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>It is hard to make it evident that salt
kills bed bugs
. There is no scientific proof of the claim.
Also, there are no blogs that prove that it works. With that, good reasoning reveals that it might not be sufficient.
Unlike
other pests, bed bugs
do not ingest poison since they only feed on blood. Still, you cannot expose them to salt and expect them to dry up and die off. Below are many other reasons why salt may not work to achieve your expectations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs know the thingsthat might hurt them, and they know how to avoid such. Even if salt were poisonous to them, theyd walk around it.</li>
<li>Bed bugs are highly mobile. If you treat one area of the house, they will relocate to safer areas. Therefore, you need something that can spread widely to kill them.</li>
<li>Unlike pesticides that diffuse to other locations, salt sits there.
From that, you can see that you might not use salt to get
rid of bed bugs
. Compared to other treatment methods, you will achieve the least with salt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-table-salt-be-used-on-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Table Salt be used on Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Table salt is one of the best solutions for other
pests, but not for bed bugs
. The top reason table salt doesnt work is that people have formed many
misconceptions about bed bugs
.
They think you can use salt to kill them through dehydration. Though it is possible, you cant use salt to dry bed bugs out.
Diatomaceous earth
is a perfect solution if you want to dry them out. You cant do the same with salt because the diatomaceous world uses a different technique to dry bed bugs and
their eggs
out.
Instead of sucking water directly from their body, diatomaceous earth peels the
exoskeleton of bed bugs
. It does this without drying them off, but they end up dying.
The property that gives the diatomaceous earth the ability to do this is quite rough at a molecular level. Though table salt is also coarse, it cannot match
diatomaceous earth
.

<h2 id="can-salt-water-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Salt Water Kill Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Sprays are the most effective
way to kill bed bugs. This is because, with spraying, you get to spread the toxic substance widely. This way,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/">bed bugs will have to walk through</a>
them.
If you spray a highly effective substance, you will get the best results. Alternatively, check these commercial
bed bug sprays
.
However, in this case, we are talking about saltwater. Salt is not
toxic to bed bugs
. Hence, it cannot kill them even though spraying. If you took a jar full of saltwater
and dropped the bed bugs
in it, theyd die.
But if you spray, they will live on and keep reproducing. This is true because it is not the salt that kills them; the water in the jar drowns them. Spraying saltwater on your mattress will give you the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>They will run and hide in other parts of the room until you are done trying to spray them.</li>
<li>They will back and infest your mattress as soon as you are done trying to kill them using the saltwater.
You certainly will not kill the
bed bugs by spraying
them with saltwater.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="salt-and-baking-soda-on-bed-bugs"><strong>Salt and Baking Soda on Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>The chances are that you have heard about using salt and
baking soda to kill
bed bugs. For a long time, people have used salt and
baking soda to clean
around the house. Some also use it to clean their teeth.
The idea in this belief is that salt and baking soda can be used to suck moisture from the body of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-vinegar-kill-bed-bugs/">bed bugs to kill</a>
them. However, this cannot happen as long as their waxy shell is not broken into. Sadly, baking soda does not have the right texture. Hence it cannot do that.
Also, there is nothing so special in the mixture than just baking soda. Mixing salt and baking soda does not improve anything or create a special mix that can
kill bed bugs
.

<h2 id="can-salt-and-borax-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Salt and Borax Kill Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Sodium borate or simply borax is another cleaning powder. However, unlike other solutions that we have mentioned on this list, it can be effective against bugs.
<strong>How Sodium Borate Works on Other Bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It sticks on the legs of bed bugs when they walk through it.</li>
<li>By trying to clean themselves, they ingest some borax accidentally.</li>
<li>Though it does not kill them instantly, it is a slow-working poison used tocontrol some bed bugs.
That said, borax might
kill other bugs such as cockroaches
. However, there is no way it can kill bed bugs since they only ingest blood. Therefore, it is not possible that they will ingest sodium borate accidentally. They dont use mouth to feed. Instead, they have an elongated tube similar to that of mosquitoes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-epsom-salt-really-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Epsom Salt Really Kill Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Also known as magnesium sulfate, Epsom salt is another type of salt used for many home and industrial purposes. Farmers use it to add sulfur to the soil to enhance productivity by getting rid of pests. Also, Epsom salt is used to brew beer.
Whether it
kills bed bugs
, there is no proof of that. Just like other types of salt, Epsom salt will not dry bed bugs off. Moreover, bed bugs dont ingest anything other than blood, which means you will not use the salt to poison them.
It is accurate to mention that it is not possible to use Epsom salt to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-dryer-kill-bed-bugs/">exterminate bed bugs</a>
. Instead, you want to try tested and proven methods to rid
bed bugs in your home
.</p>
<h2 id="can-salt-in-your-bed-sheets-really-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Salt in your Bed Sheets Really Kill Bed Bugs?�</strong></h2>
<p>This would only make sense if salt can
kill bed bugs
. If it was some toxic material to bed bugs, then you can use it to kill them. It makes
sense since the bed bugs
will be forced to stay around the salt since they get their food, which is your blood as you sleep.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-salt-to-exterminate-bed-bugs"><strong>How to Use Salt to exterminate bed bugs</strong></h2>
<p>If you are looking to kill bed bugs using salt, there are many ways to achieve that.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can put some salt around the feet of your bed. This will keep the bed bugs from around your house to come and feed on your blood.</li>
<li>Use salt to target their entry and hiding points. These can be the holes, cracks, and crevices in your house. They will not be able to come out and feed.</li>
<li>Look for thebed bug harboragesand apply salt in those areas. Consider doing this under the mattresses and the furniture in your bedroom.
Salt can only help you starve the bed bugs to death by keeping them from reaching you to feed at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>It is not possible to use salt to exterminate bed bugs. It is not rough enough to destroy the exoskeleton of the bed bugs.
Still, bed bugs cannot ingest it since they only feed on blood. For effectiveness, use something that would dehydrate and kill the bed bugs.</p>

<p>Most notably, salt can dry out the fleas, and this, in turn, kills them. Let&rsquo;s look at this in a little more detail - review these
foggers for fleas
.
Salt is something that we are all aware of can draw moisture out, and the reason that this is particularly useful in eradicating fleas because these tiny creatures have little air holes through which they breathe.
These holes need to remain moist; otherwise, the flea will die. By using salt, you can soak up the moisture and effectively end the flea&rsquo;s life. The salt acts quickly, and the fleas cannot replenish the moisture soon enough to survive.</p>

<p>If you are suffering from a wave of unwelcome house guests in the form of fleas, you can use any of the following methods using your usual household table salt to remove them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of salt is great for large areas such as carpets and area rugs as the product can be sprinkled on and left to work its magic. You can also do this in other areas of the home, such as soft furnishings and bedding.</li>
<li>As you are probably well aware, a most flea infestation can be found on your pet, so it is highly relevant to treat them with salt. To have the most success from the salt treatment, you should give you pet a salt bath.</li>
<li>This can be achieved by mixing salt and water (one part salt to ten parts water) in a suitable container such as a basin or bathtub.
You can then bathe your pet in the water paying particular attention to areas where the fleas are most dense, for example, behind the ears.
After the salt bath, you can then brush your pet and allow the salt to take action.�Read Also:

<p>But can salt assist you in the removal of the eggs as well as the live pests? In short, the answer to this question is a resounding, yes!
The salt will act in the same way as it does with the adult
fleas and will dry out any eggs
, causing them to die off before they have the chance to hatch.
More often than not, the majority of the flea eggs will fall off their host once they have been laid and will remain around the home-in carpets and nooks and crannies until they develop into adult fleas, which then reattach to the host, and the process begins again.
