      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a bed bug has ever bitten you, you will agree with me that these bloodsuckers instill painful injections that may even lead to allergic or abnormal swelling.
<em>Some home remedies for Bed bugs include the use of Diatomaceous Earth, Steam treatment, Borax, Hairdryer, Vacuuming, Heat treatment (very high or low temperature), Use of oil extracts (Tea Tree Oil/Peppermint Oil), Baking soda, and Hydrogen peroxide.</em>
<em>Moreover, Bed bug Herb such as Sweet Flag, Lavender, Mint Leaves, Peppermint Leaves, Tea Tree Oil, Lemongrass, and Black Walnut Tea are best for killing and keeping off bed bugs plus baby bed bugs in your home.�</em>

<h2 id="details-9-home-remedies-for-bed-bugs">Details: 9 Home Remedies for Bed Bugs</h2>
<h3 id="1-use-extreme-heat-or-extreme-cold">1. Use Extreme Heat or Extreme Cold</h3>
<p>One of the endless ways of killing bed bugs is by use of high or low temperature. Temperatures above 120 degrees Fahrenheit will destroy the entire infestation of bed bugs (eggs, larvae, and adults) in your home. To achieve this, you will need to carry out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all the infested items with bed bugs/)and scatter them in one room to allow heat action on them.</li>
<li>Open all the closets in your house/room to enable heated airflow.</li>
<li>Lock all the windows, doors, and available ventilation to boost heating efficiency.</li>
<li>Remove all heat-sensitive items such as plastics and nylon clothes for special treatment (vacuuming).</li>
<li>Place the room heating machines centrally to enhance equal distribution of heat within the room (uniform heat transfer.)</li>
<li>You can put the indicator on window panes or doors to show a given color when<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/">bed bugs killing</a>temperature (119 degrees Fahrenheit) reaches.</li>
<li>Switch on the machine and let it heat the room for 30 to 60 minutes, after which you will switch off.</li>
<li>Open the doors and window and let in fresh air for 30 minutes (helps in cooling the room) before cleaning the bedbug treated room and items.
All eggs and larva stage of bed bugs will begin to die at a temperature of 98 degrees Fahrenheit while adult bed bugs will start breaking at a temperature of 118 degrees Fahrenheit. It is essential to maintain the killing temperature anywhere between 120 to 140 (max) degrees Fahrenheit to allow the complete killing of bed bugs infestation.
Alternatively, you can freeze the
bed bug-infested items
or room to a temperature below zero degrees. The low temperature denatures enzymes&rsquo; action in the
bed bugs lifecycle, thus killing
it.
You will need to carry out freezing at least four days for complete
bed bugs killing
to take place.�NB:
<em>This method may be slightly expensive but very efficient and environmentally friendly (it cause no pollution).�</em>

<h3 id="2-vacuuming">2. Vacuuming</h3>
<p>In vacuuming, the
vacuum machine
sucks very tiny particles, including small insects (bed bugs). You will require a vacuum cleaner and a source of power/energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug the vacuum cleaner into a power source and switch it on.</li>
<li>Run the machine for 1 to 3 minutes to enable it to reach the maximum working point.</li>
<li>Point the nozzle of the vacuum on the surface ofbed bugsinfested items. Make sure you leave ample space to allow effective sucking.</li>
<li>Ensure your vacuum walls, floor, cracks/crevices, and closets wherebed bugs can hide.</li>
<li>After thoroughly vacuuming all the places, empty the vacuum cleaners trash bin into a furnace to burn all the sucked substances. Burning is the best way of ensuring all that has been sucked (includingbed bugs) is dead.
The vacuuming kills bed bugs by sucking and whirling them at a higher velocity/speed. Those
bed bugs that are not destroyed
during sucking are secured at the trash bin, ready for destruction.
This method eliminated over 90% of
bed bug infestation, including eggs
and larvae. Ensure you vacuum your bed bugs infested items thrice a month to remove bed bugs traces thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-diatomaceous-earth">3. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth
is naturally occurring sedimentary rocks that are formed from microorganisms that decomposed for many years. Your need to carry out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grind the Diatomaceous Earth in fine grain powder.</li>
<li>Wear gloves and sprinkle the powder into bed bugs infested area. You canrub bedbug-infested�items with Diatomaceous powder or sprinkle it over the items.</li>
<li>You can also fill cracks and crevices with this powder too.</li>
<li>Leave the treated area or items for 1 to 3 days. You will need to do this after every three weeks for complete bed bugs elimination.</li>
<li>Then, vacuum the area or items to remove the Diatomaceous Earth and dead bed bugs.
Diatomaceous Earth kills bed bugs on contact. The sharp edges of the rock particles penetrate/easily pierce the exoskeleton/cuticle of the bed bugs, thus dehydrating them to death. The arsenic component found in the Diatomaceous Earth poisons the bed bugs when ingested (rare). This product is quick-acting and increases its working with the quantity applied.
Diatomaceous Earth is poisonous to your pets and children when swallowed though it does not cause irritation to your hands-on contact. When purchasing Diatomaceous Earth, buy the one that is pest-related such as safe brand Diatomaceous Earth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-using-a-dryer-hair-and-clothes">4. Using a Dryer (Hair and clothes)</h3>
<p>A
Dryer (for clothes)
is a suitable device that can be used to kill bed bugs in bed bugs infested clothes and smaller items, which can fit in a given dryer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a dryer with a power rating that will generate a temperature above 110 degrees Fahrenheit (bed bug killingtemperature).</li>
<li>Plug the dyer into the power supply/socket.</li>
<li>Putbed bug-infesteditems into the dryer and close.</li>
<li>Switch on power. Set the dryer into a maximum temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit and a run time of 15 minutes. Then, press the dryer start button.</li>
<li>Stop the dryer after 15 minutes if its not automatic and remove the items.</li>
<li>Blow flesh air over the treated items to remove dead bed bugs or hung them for 2 to 3 hours.
The Bed bugs in the infested items will die due to the high temperature on the dryer and swirling in the chamber. 99% of the live bed bugs, larvae, and eggs will be destroyed by this method. Its not advisable to put temperature-sensitive items in the dryer.
Alternatively, you can use a hairdryer.</li>
<li>Plug the hairdryer into the power supply and switch on.</li>
<li>Once heated, point the hot air from the dryer over the bed bugs infested items or areas.</li>
<li>I was once treated, leaver the items to cool before blowing cold air over them.
The heat generated from the hairdryer kills the bed bugs on infested items on contact. This method can destroy 93% of the infestation (eggs, larvae, and adults).
The killing power of hair dryer or
bed bug heaters
is a function of the dryer&rsquo;s power rating (select a higher rated hairdryer to help generate high temperature).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-steam-cleaning">5. Steam Cleaning</h3>
<p>Steam cleaning involves the use of superheated steam from a steam generator to kill bed bugs infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat water in a steam generator to 117 degrees Fahrenheit (bed bugs killing temperature).</li>
<li>Direct the steam nozzle of the steam generator onto bedbug-infested items or areas.</li>
<li>Steam all closets, crevices/cracks, and floor. Take care since superheated steam may burn badly.</li>
<li>Leave the treated items to cool for 30 minutes before cleaning them.
Superheated
steam kill bed bug eggs
, larvae, and adult bed bugs on contact. This method is quick-acting though it may require a specialist for complete bed bugs elimination.
Keep off all heat sensitive items and pets during treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-using-borax-boric-acid">6. Using Borax (Boric acid)</h3>
<p>Borax, also called boric acid, is a home solution that can instantly kill bed bugs on application. The borax concentration determines the ability to kill bed bugs�and the amount fed/breathed by a bed bug.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear hand protection (gloves) and sprinkle borax on bed bugs infested items (mattress, bed sheet, clothes, etc.) or area (cracks, floor, or closets).</li>
<li>Leave them for 20 to 50 hours for the chemical to work.</li>
<li>After treatment, clean the items to remove borax and dead bed bugs.
Box kills bed bugs by suffocating them. Though
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">bed bugs wont eat</a>
box as per se, the environment will make bed bugs difficult to breathe, thus dying. This method will kill up to 95% of adult bed bugs. This method wont kill eggs. Therefore, you need to combine it with a complement method such as steam treatment.
Borax will cause a burning sensation when in contact with eyes and upset your stomach when swallowed and should be kept away from children.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-using-vinegar">7. Using Vinegar</h3>
<p>Vinegar is a robust bed bug killer
since it contains a strong acetic acid, which affects the bed bugs&rsquo; nervous system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure 100ml of vinegar (Kroger Brand Heinz Distilled or Walmart) and mix with an equal amount of water.</li>
<li>Put the mixture in a spray bottle and spray over the bed bugs infested items or area (cracks, floor, or closets).</li>
<li>Leave the area for 30 minutes for the medicine to act/kill.</li>
<li>Clean the items after treatment to remove vinegar and dead bed bugs.
Vinegar will kill adult bed bugs on contact. The acetic acid in the vinegar will attack the nervous system, thus inhibiting transport activities.� Most of the bed bugs larvae wont die on contact (especially if the concentration wont be much). Therefore, it is recommended to supplement this method with others, such as the use of Diatomaceous Earth. It would help if you did not use vinegar on acid-sensitive items.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-rubbing-alcohol">8. Rubbing Alcohol</h3>
<p>Alcohol is able to kill the entire life-cycle of bed bugs
(eggs, larvae, and adults) on contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put concentrated alcohol in a spray bottle.</li>
<li>Spray over the bed bugs infested items (beddings, clothes, couch) and areas (crevices/cracks, walls, floor, and closets).</li>
<li>Leave the area for 4 to 6 hours for the chemical to work.
All the bed bugs that come into contact with alcohol will be killed. Wear a breathing mask (irritates nasal cavity on inhaling) and hand protection when spraying.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-baking-soda">9. Baking Soda</h3>
<p>To kill bed bugs using baking powder, carry out the following steps. The baking powder kills bed bugs on contacts. It will dehydrate the exoskeleton/cuticle of bed bugs, thus killing them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle baking powder over the bed bugs infested areas (floor, wall, cracks/crevices, and closets) and items (clothes, couches, beddings, or mattresses).</li>
<li>Leave the items for 2 to 6 hours.</li>
<li>Clean the treated items/area to remove baking powder and dead bed bugs.
This method will kill up to 97% of bed bugs infestation. Though some eggs may be destroyed, it is advisable to supplement this method with other ways, such as steam or Diatomaceous Earth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-use-of-bed-bug-herbals-indiana-lilac-leaves">10. Use of Bed Bug Herbals: Indiana Lilac Leaves</h3>
<p>Bed bug herbals entail plant and plant extracts that keep away or kill bed bugs in your place.
Indiana Lilac or lavender emit a scent that either poison the bed bugs
or keep them off. To achieve this, you can carry out the following procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crush the Indiana Lilac lives into fine particles.</li>
<li>Spread the crushed leaves in bed bugs infested area and items.</li>
<li>Alternatively, boil the Indian Lilac leaves and strain the solution.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the solution over the bed bugs infested items or areas.
The Indiana Lilac leaves extract/liquid will kill bed bugs on contact. The insects breathe the scent and get paralyzed to death. Moreover, this product will also keep off bed bugs in your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-spraying-tea-tree-oil">11. Spraying Tea Tree Oil</h3>
<p>Tea Tree Oil has anti-microorganism properties that will kill bed bugs on contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dilute 20 drops ofTea Tree Oilwith little water.</li>
<li>Put the solution in a spray bottle.</li>
<li>Spray over bed bugs infested items (clothes, beddings, mattress, or couches) and areas (cracks/crevices, closets, walls, or floor).</li>
<li>Leave the liquid to act for 5 hours.</li>
<li>Clean the area and items to remove the oil and dead bed bugs.
Once bed bugs breathe Tea Tree Oil, they get suffocated and die since they affect both the nervous and respiratory systems. Undiluted Tea Tree Oil is unsafe for humans during use. Well-diluted Tea Tree Oil will leave a lovely scent on the items or areas sprayed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-will-kill-bed-bugs-instantly">What will kill bed bugs instantly?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Heat treatment</strong>and use of household dryer will kill bed bugs instantly. The generated heat denatures the hormonal system and enzymes (protein in nature), thus destroying them.</li>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>will also kill the entire lifecycle of the bed bugs. They destroy the exoskeleton/cuticle and inhabit the transport system, thus killing them. Superheated steam destroys the incubation stage of bed bugs eggs and their larvae.</li>
<li><strong>Use of bed bugs sprays</strong>such as Eco Defense Bed bugs killer will kill bed bugs instantly. The sprays contain ingredients that destroy the bed bugs eggs or inhibits the hatching of the eggs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-bed-bug-bites-last/">Bed bugs bite</a>
human beings and pets, injecting pain and leaves marks that may swell or lead to allergic reactions. It is also necessary to observe proper bed bugs in preventive measures.

      <description>For most home and pet owners,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most home and pet owners,
a flea infestation (see images)-look-like/)
can cause panic. Below I&rsquo;ve discussed the 7 top home remedies for fleas - they&rsquo;re useful, convenient, and budget-friendly.
Fleas bite humans and pets to suck blood, leading to anemia and
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/parasites/4-surprising-%5Bflea%5D(/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/)-diseases-you-need-know">transmission of diseases</a>
such as Tularemia, Tungiansis, Murine typhus, and Bubonic plague.
<em>In summary, you can keep your cats, dogs (including dips, flea combs</em>
<em>), and home being flea-free using simple home remedies that are effective and safe equally - control on the carpet and furniture - including killing flea eggs.�</em></p>
<h2 id="details-7-home-remedies-for-fleas---natural-treatment">Details: 7 Home Remedies for Fleas - Natural Treatment</h2>
<h3 id="1-dawn-dish-soap">1. Dawn Dish soap</h3>
<p>To
get rid of fleas
, I first recommend you use dawn dish soap to wet plus lathe your skin or pet&rsquo;s hair., Dish soap will reduce the surface tension of water and make the fleas drown.
Further, dish soap tends to break the waxy layer in the respiratory system of fleas. Breaking the waxy layer in their trachea will allow water to go into the bug&rsquo;s respiratory systems.</p>
<p>The bugs will suffocate once the air is replaced by water - further, the dawn soap will block the fleas&rsquo; spiracles. So, place a plate or dish and drop some dish soap - position a lit candle.
The candlelight will attract the fleas from where they&rsquo;ll drop and suffocate into the soapy water on the plate. It acts as a trap for the fleas - they&rsquo;ll trap the fleas temporarily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The dish soap created high viscosity in the water - trapping the fleas like glue to kill them.</li>
<li>However, fleas treat with dish soap only at night since fleas are nocturnal bugs. However, the dish soap flea treatment with candlelight may pose a fire hazard.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas">2. Diatomaceous earth for fleas</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous earth will kill fleas at home</p>
<ul>
<li>this will exterminate the fleas will the fossilized-algae diatoms. Luckily, the home remedy is non-toxic for pets and humans.
Besides, Diatomaceous earth will help exterminate
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef602">fleas</a>
on pets, including killing fleas on cats and fleas on dogs - the sharp diatoms break the bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton and cause dehydration.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the diatomaceous earth powder into places that you think have a massive flea infestation and traffic - but apply only a thin layer of the powder.</li>
<li>Let the DE treatment do its work for 3-5 days before you vacuum the floors and carpets thoroughly to prevent the bugs&rsquo; spreading.
However, ensure to use the food-grade diatomaceous earth since it&rsquo;s the natural option that&rsquo;s equally safe for humans and other pets, including cats and dogs.
Don&rsquo;t miss your face with the DE powder since it may irritate your throat and eyes - so ensure that you put on some personal protection equipment like face masks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-baking-soda">3. Baking soda</h3>
<p>Baking soda
will kill fleas just like diatomaceous earth, and it&rsquo;s equally safe to exterminate the bugs - but vacuuming is still the most recommended.
Vacuuming will remove the fleas from your furniture or carpet fibers. Using baking soda with your vacuuming machine on fleas will help improve its effectiveness.</p>
<ul>
<li>So sprinkle the baking soda on the furniture and carpets. However, rub and brush the surfaces and fabric and empty the vacuum bag into a trash can that&rsquo;s placed outside.</li>
<li>The powder will dehydrate and exterminate the bugs, eggs, and flea larvae and, hence, avoid another infestation.</li>
<li>Use the baking soda plus table salt - you&rsquo;ll only need to sprinkle some of your table salt. The best thing is that it&rsquo;s safe for both humans, pets, and kids.
But the salt plus baking soda could trigger some minor irritation on the pet&rsquo;s open wounds. Also, remember to isolate animals in the treating zone.
Baking soda plus sprinkle salt on the affected places, furniture, and carpets and letting it sit overnight will dehydrate the flea eggs and larvae.
However, you&rsquo;ll need to repeat the flea treatment - clean the bag and canister. Repeating the treatment allows you to remove all the left-over eggs to hatch and trigger a re-infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-lemon-spray">4. Lemon spray</h3>
<p>The lemon spray will both exterminate and repel fleas as it contains D-limonene as an active ingredient. But lemon may be used to treat the wasp stings - check best wasp spray.
You&rsquo;ll require a spray bottle, funnel, large bowl, strainer, large pot, fork, and knife. Ingredients; 356 ml or 1.5 liters of vinegar, 711 ml or 0.7 liters of water, and three lemon fruits.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, you&rsquo;ll need to make some citrus spray that&rsquo;ll use on the infected surfaces and furniture. Juice the three lemons after cutting into 3 millimeters thick slices.</li>
<li>Get a lemon slice and put it into the water - finally, boil the water for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Now steep your three lemons - and let the lemon to simmer before removing the water from heat. Allow the citrus juice to stand over the night before putting it into a spraying bottle the next day.
Finally, spray the citrus spray on infested places on the yard, including chairs, pet bedding, and sofas. It&rsquo;ll kill with the juice in the rinds or use a fork to cut down the rinds.</li>
<li>If your pet has a flea collar, you&rsquo;ll need to add 2-3 lemon mixture drops in the pet&rsquo;s flea collars, which will control the fleas. Further, you&rsquo;ll need to drop some lemon mixture on the pet&rsquo;s shoulder blades.</li>
<li>For use with pet&rsquo;s shampoo - you&rsquo;ll require 0.25 cups of the lemon treatment that&rsquo;ll mix with the cat flea shampoo or the flea shampoo for dogs and use it for bathing the pets - but avoid the eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-apple-cider-vinegar">5.� Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>
<p>For fleas, Apple cider vinegar is an effective home remedy against the bugs besides using collars and yard flea sprays besides other natural flea remedies.
Luckily, you&rsquo;ll discover that vinegar has no fragrance, and it&rsquo;s equally friendly to the surroundings - it&rsquo;s chemical-free and natural, which means that it&rsquo;ll be safe for kids, adult humans, and pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a dog, use a single apple cider vinegar teaspoon for 40 pounds of the dog. Add this vinegar into a bowl of water and make sure to change the water after each dog wash.
Fleas like bed bugs hate vinegar, and hence they&rsquo;ll be repelled easily from the house and surrounding - you can also use the vinegar solution like a spray.
Despite that dogs and cats will love apple cider vinegar more - particularly its scent, it&rsquo;s also helpful to use white vinegar. However, cats might not love the vinegar spray
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-puppies/">flea treatment</a>
.</li>
<li>Mix equal parts of the water and vinegar ingredients into a big bowl - this is the dilution process that&rsquo;ll make the solution fit for controlling fleas.</li>
<li>However, some homeowners also tend to mix in the ingredients in the ration of 1:3 for vinegar and water.
Before spraying the vinegar for fleas control, inspect if the dog or cat has open wounds, sores, or cuts on their skins. Avoid
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-kittens/">using the flea treatment</a>
on open wounds.
Avoid spraying the pet&rsquo;s into their eyes - this may lead to pain, irritation, or reduced ability to see. It&rsquo;s your role to ensure that the flea treatment is safe and comfortable for the pets.</li>
<li>Put the vinegar solution in a spray bottle or use some cloth that you&rsquo;ll dip into the vinegar solution - for example, therub-down technique will be more appropriate for cats.</li>
<li>However, remember to clean your spraying bottle, mainly if it had previously been used to spray a different chemical to avoid adverse reactions.
Finally, within half an hour, comb the cat&rsquo;s hair to remove any of the dead or live fleas plus their eggs and larvae that&rsquo;re stuck or trapped by the sprayed vinegar.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-salt-for-fleas">6. Salt for fleas</h3>
<p>Salt for fleas (salt will kill fleas), just baking soda, will effectively kill fleas - particularly if you combine it with vacuuming. The salt will dehydrate the adult fleas and thus kill them.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, sprinkle some finely-ground table salt on surfaces like furniture and carpets. All the sprinkled salt to sit on the surfaces for about 1 to 3 days.</li>
<li>Finally, vacuum the surfaces and carpets to clean up the salt and fleas trapped or trapped by this effective home flea remedy.
Constant flea vacuuming plus salt treatment against fleas will help keep the flea infestation at bay. You can use the salt on
pet beds, carpets, and live hosts - cats and dogs to kill even flea
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-eat/">larvae</a>
.
To treat you home effectively with salt for fleas, you&rsquo;ll need to treat the upholstery, home floors, and carpets. However, ensure that you empty and clean the vacuum bags and canisters.</li>
<li>Further, salt must allow sitting on the sprinkled areas overnice or for long hours so that the fleas will be dehydrated. But note that fleas won&rsquo;t kill flea pupae in the cocoons.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Natural remedies for fleas will work just as well as chemical flea treatment, including sprays, shampoos, and flea collars. Also, flea repelling plants like Spearmint, Lavender, Chrysanthemums, and Penny Royal is equally effective.</p>
