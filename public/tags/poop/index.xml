      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> <a href="/posts/what-does-raccoon-poop-look-like/">poop</a> look like?�Reptiles such as salamanders lizards and geckos love to hang around the house. You will find their poop on any surface including your bed, sofa set, and wardrobe among other places.
Certainly, these fecal droppings can create a disgusting mess in the house - particularly after a
heavy meal
. Sometimes, it difficult to differentiate lizard poop from that of rodents and birds.
<em>So, how does lizard poop look like? Lizard poop appears as black droppings with a white substance on one end. The white matter shows the presence of uric acid and its excreted together with the solid waste.�</em>
<em>This is because lizards use one opening (cloaca) to excrete solid waste and urine. The size of the droppings vary according to the size and species of the lizard. Related: What Does Leopard Gecko Eat?</em>

<h2 id="what-does-lizard-poop-look-like">What Does Lizard Poop Look Like??</h2>
<h3 id="1-size">1. Size</h3>
<p>If you suspect you have lizards in the house check for black pellet-like droppings about  inch long and 1/8 inch wide. Attached on one end of the poop is the urine crystal which is usually white in color. Thats because lizards poop and pee from the same opening (cloaca).</p>
<h3 id="2-shape">2. Shape</h3>
<p>The droppings might be tapered or rounded at the ends and their size varies with the species and size of lizards. Normally, wild lizards have bigger droppings compared to urban lizards.</p>
<h3 id="3-color">3. Color</h3>
<p>Lizard poop can be easily be confused with poop from snakes, birds or rodents. Similar to lizards these pests, poop and pee through the same opening. Thus, their droppings contain solid matter and solid uric acid. However, the white cap in birds and snake poop covers a larger portion and tend to be more liquid.

<h3 id="where-do-lizards-poop"><strong>Where Do Lizards Poop?</strong></h3>
<p>According to a
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/08/lizards-poop-biggest-rocks-around">research</a>
done at the university of Antwerp, lizards exhibit some similarity in their choice of toilet. In the controlled experiment, 90 lizards were each placed in an enclosure with different sizes of rocks. Surprisingly, 80% of the lizards pooped on the largest rock.
It has been previously indicated that wall lizards communicate with their fecal droppings. Male lizards mark their territories with feces so that other males can keep off. So, defecating on the biggest rock suggested an attempt to make their signals as conspicuous as possible.
Another explanation for this is that lizards spend most of their time on large rocks, to have a good view of possible predators. The research doesnt however conclude on the possible motivation for the observed behavior. But it suggests that lizards leave their poop in conspicuous areas as a sign of communication.</p>
<h3 id="is-lizard-poop-toxic"><strong>Is Lizard Poop Toxic?</strong></h3>
<p>Lizard feces are toxic because they spread zoonotic diseases such as salmonella. They contain certain disease-causing bacteria which can get into your body through ingestion, inhaling or open skin.
With proper hygiene its possible to reduce the risk and prevent infections from lizard droppings. If you have pet lizards, wash your hands with water and soap any time you handle them. Their cages should also be kept clean and free from fecal droppings. Use gloves every time youre cleaning your pets cage.
If you have kids in your home, its not advisable to keep lizards or other reptiles as pets. Thats because you cannot completely restrain kids interaction with the pets.
Other diseases that can be transmitted from lizards to humans include Leptospirosis, botulism and Campylobacteriosis.</p>
<h3 id="lizard-poop-versus-snake-poop"><strong>Lizard Poop versus Snake Poop</strong></h3>
<p><em>Lizard Poop:</em>
The diet of lizards is composed of small insects and arachnid. A few species include plants in their diet. They excrete small pellet-like feces the size of rodent feces.
The size of the droppings depend on the species and size of the lizard. The droppings have a small white portion which is fairly dry compared to those of snake poop.
<em>Snake poop:</em>
Unlike lizard poop, snake poop is quite lose and has no defined shape. The white portion on the end of the poop is more liquid and relatively larger than that in lizard poop.
A snake feeds by swallowing their prey whole. So their poop contains the indigestible remains such as bones, teeth, hooves, hair and scales.

<p>When handling any animal poop always wear gloves to avoid direct contact with disease-causing bacteria.
Scoop out the droppings with a scrapper or pick the droppings with a piece of cloth and dispose them in the trash bin or compost.
Stains left on fabrics and bedding by lizard poop can be cleaned using the following procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a precaution, handle poop stains with a pair of protective gloves.</li>
<li>Soak the garments for at least five hours with a stain remover of your choice. There good stain removers in the market which can also help remove the poop odor.</li>
<li>Using the recommended water temperature for the fabric and an appropriate detergent, wash the garment until the stain disappears.</li>
<li>Use a bleaching agent where necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-remove-lizard-poop-stain-from-carpet"><strong>How to Remove Lizard Poop Stain from Carpet</strong></h3>
<p>To clean your carpet, you can either use commercial enzyme-based stain cleaners or prepare a DIY solution using vinegar and lukewarm water.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-remove-lizard-poop-stains-from-wooden-surfaces"><strong>How to Remove Lizard Poop Stains From Wooden Surfaces</strong></h3>
<p>First scoop out the droppings with a scrapper and dispose the stuff in the trash bin. Fresh poop is easier to remove than old poop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drape the stained area with paper towels to absorb the stain completely.</li>
<li>Now cover the stain with baking soda and allow to settle until morning. This will remove excess moisture and eradicate the stench in the stain.</li>
<li>Clean the area with a wet cloth or vacuum cleaner.</li>
<li>If the stain doesnt disappear completely, clean the area with a cloth that has been soaked in white vinegar.</li>
<li>Stains from old poop require a more effective cleaning agent such as hydrogen peroxide.</li>
<li>Saturate the stain with undiluted hydrogen peroxide. For better results, soak a clean towel with hydrogen peroxide and place it on the stain. Leave it until morning.</li>
<li>Clean the surface with a wet towel until it is dry.</li>
<li>Some stains may discolor you wooden surfaces completely. In this case wood sanding may be necessary. Alternatively you can apply a stain similar to the color of your wooden surface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion**�**</h2>
<p>Lizards can cause discomfort especially when they are in large numbers. Their fecal droppings are potential avenues for diseases such as salmonella.
The situation gets worse if you have other pests like rodents, birds among others. However, its possible to differentiate the types of pests in your house using their fecal droppings.
This makes it easier to trace them and use the correct pest eradication remedy. If youre having trouble identifying the type of pest in your house, its the right time you contacted your local pest exterminator.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raccoons are nocturnal, thus it&rsquo;s difficult to spot them easily during the day. But,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/parasites/baylisascaris/resources/raccoonlatrines.pdf">raccoon poops and urine</a>
smell are key indicators in case of invasion.
**So, what does raccoon <a href="/posts/what-does-lizard-poop-look-like/">poop</a> look like? Well, raccoon poop is brown in color (dark to light brown) and appears like an elongated pinky finger on the ground. **</p>
<ul>
<li>**The poop&rsquo;s size is about 3 to 6 inches long. Raccoon droppings can be piled in a cluster form or slightly scattered within the area. **
<strong>Raccoon poop (fresh) has a strong odor that can be detected from a couple of feet away. Raccoon poop is very contagious as it houses roundworms and bacteria that transmit diseases such as hantavirus and histoplasmosis.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-what-does-raccoon-poop-look-like">Details: What Does Raccoon Poop Look Like?</h2>
<h3 id="1-color">1. Color</h3>
<p>Raccoon poop is usually brown in color (this may vary from light to dark brown, depending on the climatic conditions).</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the poop color is slightly altered by the type of food which the raccoon had eaten previously.
At times, you will notice a black spot on the raccoon droppings or darker brown outer part than the interior. Nevertheless, the poop should never be black or yellow whatsoever.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-smell">2. Smell</h3>
<p>Unlike cat or rat poop, fresh raccoon droppings release a strong unpleasant smell, which can spread over 100 meters away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, the scent increases with freshness and fades as the poop dries out.
You will also note the smell of urine (for fresh raccoon poop) though this may not be as sharp as that of fresh droppings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-shapesize">3. Shape/Size</h3>
<p>Raccoon poop is tubular/cylindrical in shape (like a solid pipe). It appears like an elongated pinky finger on the ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>The diameter size of the rod-like poop ranges between a half to one inch depending on the age of the raccoon (baby or adult raccoon).
Raccoon poop length ranges between 3 to 6 inches - this measurement may change slightly depending on the raccoon age as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-quantity">4. Quantity</h3>
<p>The weight of raccoon poop is a variable, which is estimated between a quarter to one kilogram.</p>
<ul>
<li>The baby raccoon droppings could weigh as low as 5 grams, while the adult raccoon poop could measure far beyond one kilogram.
The variation in the number of raccoon droppings is determined by the availability of food, the health condition of the raccoon (sick raccoon droppings are less in weight), or gender (female raccoon poop weighs more than that of male counterpart).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-distribution">5. Distribution</h3>
<p>Unlike other wild animals like squirrels, raccoon poop is piled/clustered in a specific area within its habitat.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are areas designated by raccoons for excretion purposes only and are treated as latrines where all other members of that raccoon family are expected to release bowels.
Further, raccoon poop breaks at a given length (about 3 to 6 inches) during excretion - it&rsquo;s not a continuous one like in the case of the opossum.</li>
<li>Indeed, you will find that the poop is piled up on top of each broken part.
Nevertheless, in arid areas, raccoon droppings may break/disintegrate (due to heat) and spread out though this may not go beyond a hundred-meter radius.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-locationplace">6. Location/place</h3>
<p>Often, you will find raccoon poop hidden in tall grass, shrubs, untrimmed bushes, lawns, tall flower beds, garbage bins, underground holes in open fields, riversides, or even ponds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The choice of &ldquo;raccoon latrine&rdquo; depends on the climatic condition of the area and the availability of food sources.
NB: When identifying raccoon poop, always have personal protective gears on for your safety.

<p>Raccoon poop is associated with various risks as highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-houses-leptospirosis">1. Houses Leptospirosis</h3>
<p>Leptospirosis is a common bacteria found in raccoon urine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon contact with cut body parts or wounds, the bacteria penetrate the body and cause a fatal kidney infection.
In extreme cases, Leptospirosis causes meningitis, which leads to lethal body somatic cells failure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-causes-giardiasis">2. Causes Giardiasis</h3>
<p>Giardiasis is a severe intestinal infection, which is caused by direct contact with raccoon droppings.
Upon detection, Giardiasis should be treated instantly in order to avoid traces of microorganisms that denature specialized body cells.</p>
<h3 id="3-bear-roundworms">3. Bear Roundworms</h3>
<p>Baylisascaris procyonis (round worms) are borne in raccoon poop and transmitted through direct contact with fecal matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ascariasis is easily transferred through their eggs (inhale), which later find their way to various body organs (intestine).
Usually, roundworms affect eyes, brains, or lungs and cause major damages to the vital organ system leading to death eventually.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-carry-salmonella">4. Carry Salmonella</h3>
<p>Salmonella is a bacteria borne in raccoon droppings, which causes salmonellosis disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you touch raccoon poop, the salmonella bacteria get into your body through wounds or any other openings.
Normally, salmonellosis affects the food ingestion process, which may lead to seizure if not attended to in time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-raccoon-poop">How to Clean Raccoon Poop</h2>
<p>Raccoon poop cleaning/removal process is critical and should be undertaken professionally as highlighted below:</p>

<li>Carefully, use a shovel or an inverted plastic bag when scooping.</li>
<li>Seal the poop bag tight before transporting it to the disposal area</li>
<li>Bury the droppings in a deep hole and cover the top with a sufficient amount of soil</li>
<li>Treat the scooped area with raccoon poop disinfectant chemical - twice of thrice</li>
<li>Wash shovels and gloves (used in the scooping process) thoroughly - to prevent any infection.</li>
<li>For indoor cases, clean the surface with soapy detergents</li>
<li>Clean all protective gears in high-temperature soapy detergents - helps kill any salmonella bacteria in the attire.</li>
<li>Finally, take a warm bath after the entire process

The size and appearance of the droppings vary with the species, age and size of the cockroach. Typically, small species like the German roach and the brown-banded roach leave behind smaller droppings than large species like the oriental or American cockroaches.
The droppings from small the roaches appear as stains or smears. Sometimes it can resemble coarse or ground coffee or black pepper.
Larger roaches leave behind small ridged cylindrical droppings which can be the size of rice grains. Young oriental or American cockroaches also exhibit cylindrical feces but of smaller size.
Rodents such as rats defecate relatively large cylindrical droppings, which differentiate them from roach poop.
Roach droppings tend to have rounded ends, while those of rodents are somehow pointed. Plus, roach droppings have ridges unlike those of rodents.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-look-for-roach-poop"><strong>Where do I Look for Roach Poop?</strong></h2>
<p>Roaches come to your house in search of food and water. Although roaches feed on almost anything, they are mostly attracted to the
food we eat
.
Therefore it is common to find roach droppings near food storage areas.�Roach droppings can be found in large numbers in dark corners or crevices where roaches hide from humans or pets.
Closets, cabinets, behind furniture, drawers, and other hidden areas make charming places for roaches to hide and breed. So, its possible to find large amounts of roach droppings in these areas.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/">Roaches also tend to hide and nest</a>
underneath the mattress because these areas are given fewer cleanups. Roaches can penetrate the crevices in the
bed furniture where they hide
and nest. Thus its possible to find their droppings in these crevices and the floor under the bed.
Other places to look for roach droppings include damp areas such as leaking pipes, under the sink, laundry rooms, and bathroom and so on. Roaches come to these places in search of water.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-roach-poop-smell-like"><strong>What Does Roach Poop Smell Like?</strong></h2>
<p>Just like the roaches themselves, roach poop exhibits a pungent, oily odor. The odor is characteristic of the myriad of ingested food, including dead insects, food debris, garbage, carcasses, rotten flesh, and so on.
Although the
smell
is disgusting to humans, it acts as a means of communication with other cockroaches. This helps roaches keep track of each others trails - as you

<p>Roach poop, with or without an infestation should be taken with seriousness because the situation poses a significant risk to you and your family. Some of the dangers associated with roach poop include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dry roach feces can contaminate the surrounding air with tiny and invisible particles. The particles contain proteins which when inhaled are known to cause allergic reactions and asthma. Children are especially likely to suffer severe asthma attacks due to roaches and roach droppings.</li>
<li>As they search for food and water, roaches will contaminate your food with their feces. You may not even know that your food is contaminated because the feces are quite small and unnoticeable. As such, your food may be infected with salmonella bacteria known to cause gastroenteritis or food poisoning.</li>
<li>Locating and removing the feces prevents more roaches from coming to your house. The droppings contain pheromones that other roaches use as trails to go to your home - use<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-bait/">roach baits</a>to control these house bugs.
