<p>Not all cleaning agents are ideal for cleaning concrete driveways. Unlike other types of floors, concrete contains small holes which conventional cleaners cannot penetrate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thats why you require specialized cleaners meant to penetrate and lift the stains from the surfaces of concrete floors.</li>
<li>Therere many concrete cleaners in the market to choose from. So, you may be lost in choice when searching for the best cleaner for your driveway.
But there are a few important factors you should consider before you make a decision.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-type-of-cleaner">1. Type of cleaner<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-type-of-cleaner">¶</a></h3>
<p>Concrete cleaners can be categorized into two depending on their intended use. They can be either PH cleaners or bacterial cleaners.
a. Bacterial or Enzymatic Cleaners
Bacterial cleaners are recent entrants into the world of cleaning solutions. Also known as oxidation /enzymatic cleaners, these products make use of hungry micro-organisms which feed on a variety of stains.
Notably, bacterial cleaners will be the best choice for cleaning stains such as grease, oil, and another type of hydrocarbons.
Unlike other types of cleaners, bacterial cleaners leave little or no residue on surfaces. Thus, no brushing or further cleaning is required.
The only limitation is that they require repeated use for them to be effective. Also, the cleaning action takes some time compared to the PH cleaners.
b. PH Cleaners
PH cleaners can either be acidic, neutral, or alkaline.
Acidic cleaners are used to remove stains that dissolve in acidic solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the efflorescence caused by hard water can be cleaned using acidic cleaners.</li>
<li>Alkaline solutions are ideal for cleaning stubborn stains such as grease and oil.
The hydrocarbon chains in these substances are broken down to allow for easy removal with a brush or pressure washing.
Neutral PH cleaners are mostly used where the stain is not embedded on the surface.</li>
</ul>
