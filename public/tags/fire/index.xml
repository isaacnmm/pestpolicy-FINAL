by getting the Ortho Orthene fire ant killer that will not only kill the existing ants but also prevent re-infestation in the future.</p>
<p>This contact killer consists of 50% acephate that only takes a few minutes to treat around 162 ant mounds and has a residual effect that lasts up to 6 months.
It is very easy to use for garden owners who just have to pour one tablespoon of Ortho Orthene over the fire ant mound without the need to dissolve it in water. Its deep-reaching formula allows it to reach ants that are packed inside the mound and kills them too.
Pros:</p>

<h3 id="5-best-for-indoor-use-terro-t300-liquid-ant-baits"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HJBKMQ/?tag=p-policy-20">5. Best for Indoor Use: Terro T300 Liquid Ant Baits</a></h3>
<p>Terro Liquid ant baits are the ultimate solution for all your insecurities regarding the safety of having fire ant killers inside your house.
T
he main active ingredient used in this product is borax (5.4%) which is effective in killing the ants but is relatively safe for pets and humans.
This sweet liquid bait attracts indoor ants that then mistake it for food and carry it back to their colonies. Like most bait controls, Terro liquid baits require you to be patient and wait for a little before the results are obvious.
The liquid baits are contained in small semitransparent plastic sacks called bait stations. To be able to use the bait station, you have to simply activate it by breaking off the cap piece and keeping it near the fire ants.
The ants will crawl into these stations where some will drink the liquid and others will take it back to their colonies. Slowly but gradually, the fire ant colonies will get contaminated with the poison and the fire ants will die.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The high-quality design stops the liquid bait from leaking</li>
<li>The packaging prevents humans or pets from direct contact with the bait</li>
<li>It gradually ensures that the fire ant colonies have been destroyed</li>
<li>It is reported to be extremely reliable</li>
<li>It is low in toxicity which makes it safe to use inside the house
Cons:</li>
<li>The liquid bait can spill outside and beyond the target site</li>
<li>It needs to be applied very carefully</li>
<li>The effects are visible after weeks of the application</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope that after knowing how and why the above-mentioned products qualify as the best fire ant killers, it is easier for you to reach a decision.
However, keep in mind that a fire ant killer will only give you optimal protection if you carefully follow the instructions given by the manufacturer and consider its pros and cons.</p>
