<h2 id="considerations-in-best-belt-sander-for-deck">Considerations in Best Belt Sander for Deck</h2>
<h3 id="1-belt-speed-and-belt-grit">1. Belt speed and Belt grit</h3>
<p>The variable speed control feature is one of the most important features if you are looking to work on that deck in the shortest time possible. Whereas low end models lack this feature, you might want to go for a model that allows you to deal with a variety of belt grits giving you more control over the sanding process.

If the engine is incapable of overcoming the resistance, the belt might stall, skip, or slip. If the motor is too powerful for the sander, the belt may wear down rapidly. The recommended sander should have a grit belt range of 80 to 220 grit belts.</p>
<h3 id="2-durability-andmotor">2. Durability and��Motor</h3>
<p>You might want to go for a model whose housing and other critical components are made out of sturdy materials. In particular, the idler wheel, tracking nob, and driver should be highly durable. If youre going for a benchtop model, ensure it has a solid base to attenuate the shock generated during use.
The ideal handheld belt sander motor output should range from 6A to 10A. You might want to go for a model that gives you more output for a relatively low price.</p>
