control the fleas effectively
.
In this article, we will take a detailed look at how these pests reproduce - there are clear signs to show if fleas infest your house or yard.

<h2 id="how-do-fleas-mate-7-quick-sex-life-tips">How Do Fleas Mate? 7 Quick Sex Life Tips</h2>
<p>One of the most notable things about many
fleas
types is that they must feed before
<a href="https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/flea-control/">they mate on pets</a>
.
But the process is not as simple as this. There are certain conditions that the flea needs to mate. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some critical factors in the mating process of a flea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas that live on cats are known to perform the entirety of their essential day-to-day needs (feeding, mating, living, etc.) on their host -control the fleas in the yard.</li>
<li>It has never been observed thatfleas have mated away from their host. This is because the temperature iscritical when the fleasare breeding, and they require a warm environment to mate successfully.</li>
<li>As we mentioned, the fleas require feeding before mating can occur, and this is another reason why they always mate whilst on their host as they can mate directly after receiving a blood meal.

<h2 id="males-and-females">Males And Females</h2>
<p>It has been noted that, in most cases,
fleas that live
on cats are predominantly female. The reason for this is that female flea tend to outlive their male counterparts, and therefore, even though there are equal numbers of males and females born, the females survive longer.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-the-male-and-female-flea">Structure Of The Male And Female Flea</h2>
<p>The male flea is the proud owner of the most complex male genitals known within the animal kingdom. The penis itself is supported by rods that allow for east entry into the female flea.
Their bodies feature a shield on the outer portion to protect the reproductive organs, and underneath this can be found a clasper which is used to attach the male to a female.
The female flea has an area used for storing the sperm of the male, but her reproductive organs are nowhere near as detailed or complex as the male.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-the-males-and-females-find-one-another">How Do The Males And Females Find One Another?</h2>
<p>Of course, to mate, the male and female fleas must locate one another, and it is thought that this is done through the release of chemicals or pheromones given off by the females.
The male is then able to use his antenna to detect these chemicals and locate the female. Once a male has located his chosen female, he will approach her with a vertical antenna, which signals that he wishes to mate.
The pair will connect initially at the head and then on the lower portion of the body. The male will use his antenna and legs to restrain the female during the mating process and will often remain like this until the entire ritual is over.
One of the most interesting points about the mating of fleas is that during the process, the female will continue to feed unless she is not interested, in which case she may kick the male and walk away.

<h2 id="fertility-of-female-fleas">Fertility Of Female Fleas</h2>
<p>Once the mating is over, it is then left to the female to lay her eggs. It is interesting to note that the more a female flea mates, the more fertile she becomes.
A virgin female can lay unfertilized eggs, which is thought to be a step in the evolution of asexual reproduction in these creatures.
The viability of eggs increases by 30% after the first mating, which is helpful information for eradicating
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-come-from/">fleas</a>
from your pet or home. The quicker you can do it, the less fertile the fleas will be, making it easier to tackle these parasites.</p>
<h2 id="how-soon-after-finding-a-host-do-fleas-mate">How Soon After Finding A Host Do Fleas Mate?</h2>
<p>If you are concerned about a flea infestation, one of the key factors to consider is how quickly mating will occur, and the bad news is that it is quite quick.
Once the fleas establish themselves on their host, it is known that mating can begin as quickly as eight hours later. The maximum time is usually around 24-34 hours. Before the fleas can begin mating, they must take a feed, which becomes their priority.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>How do fleas mate? The flea&rsquo;s mating process is somewhat complicated, and yet it is also a fascinating subject - control the bugs with
flea bombs
or foggers.
One of the most important factors to remember is that fleas can begin mating within hours of finding a host and taking a meal.
Therefore, it is essential to maximize your efforts to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-on-clothes-and-bedding/">rid your pet of fleas</a>
as soon as you find them to avoid the females becoming more fertile and producing more eggs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How Do Lizards Mate? Maybe you have pet lizards at home or have seen one and wishes to know how they mate. Do they court like human being before mating? Well, in this article we shall answer the question, How Do Lizards Mate?
*During Mating, the male <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> (vertebrates) clings on the females back and support itself by biting the females neck. Then, the male lizards connects is hemipenes/male organ to the females cloaca (female organ) and pours its sperms that move up the oviduct to fertilize the ova (female egg). *
<em>However, before mating, the male and female may have 1 to 2 months of courtship during the mating season (spring). After fertilization, the lizard (Savannah, monitor, iguana, or Komodo dragon) lays eggs, which hatch into baby lizards in 4 to 8 weeks.�</em>

<h2 id="details-how-do-lizards-mate-and-reproduce"><strong>Details: How Do Lizards Mate and Reproduce?</strong></h2>
<p>Lizards undergo the following steps/stage during mating. Contrary, some viviparous lizards such as the blue-tongue skink and Solomon Island skink give live birth to their baby lizards.</p>
<h2 id="step-1how-lizards-attract-their-mate-for-sex-mating---courtship">Step 1:<strong>How lizards attract their mate for sex (mating - courtship)</strong></h2>
<p>Before mating, lizards court for 1 to 60 days to create a strong friendship/bond and form a royal pair that may last them their entire lifetime. During this time, there are some of things/techniques that lizards (either male or female) use to attract their mate for copulation or coitus. These may include:
<strong>1. Tactile commination�</strong>
Some lizards such as monitor lizards use touch as a way of attracting their mates to sexual engagement. The Komodo dragon likes to lick its female mate to see if its sexually ready or responsive.
The direct touch is used severally by lizards to create a close bond -

.
<strong>2. Auditory calls�</strong>
The lizards use the auditory call to entice the mate they intend to court with. Many lizards may not use this method since the predators may take advantage and catch/trace them using auditory call signals.
However, Tokay Gecko are known to use auditory calls when looking for courting mate. But

<strong>3. Use of visual display�</strong>
The lizards mostly use visual displays such as, swaging of tail, changing of colors, frequent gapping of the mouth, moving of the tongue, special body posture, head bobbing as well as inflation and push-ups to attract its mate for courtship.
Flying lizards and Anoles lizards, males have well-developed and brightly colored throat dewlaps and fans which open and close and use them to attract the female lizards for courtship. This method is most used and pronounced as compared to others.
<strong>4. Chemical Cues�</strong>
The lizards produces a chemical pheromones that when smelled will attract the mate for courtship. Normally, female lizards produces these chemical cues to attract the male lizard for mating purpose.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-mating-process">Step 2**: Mating Process�**</h3>
<p>During mating, the male lizard climbs over the female lizard. Then, it connects its hemipenes into the cloaca of the female lizard and pours the sperms into the cloaca from where the sperms swim up the uterus to the oviduct to fertilize the ova (singular - ovum).
The puring process is not a bumpy liquid but continuous drips. The male lizard must wait until the whole pouring process is completed.
The male lizard usually bites the neck of the female lizard to support itself during coitus/copulation. In addition, the male lizard will produce/secret cellular debris that have scent, which makes the couple be able to locate each other in a colony of lizards. Moreover, this debris prevent the male lizard from sliding during mating.
During mating, the female lizard raises the tail slightly to enable the male access the cloaca (you may see as if lizards are coiling while mating). There is no kissing in lizards. However, lizard species such as Komodo dragon and monitor lizards lick their female mates during copulation/coitus.</p>
<h3 id="step-3after-mating-occurrences">Step 3:<strong>After mating occurrences.</strong></h3>
<p>Once the male lizard mates with female lizard, it leaves the female and go to search for other female (most lizards are polygamous). The female searches for a nice place where it intends to lay the eggs.
This place can be in warm holes, leaves, under the sand, seashores or in caves where predator cant locate them (the eggs have strong eggshells that offer further protection).
Then, the female lizard lays the fertilized eggs in batches may have 1 to 20 eggs. Eastern Bearded Dragon usually lay 5 to 17 per batch. Water Dragon will lay between 6 to 18 eggs per batch while Blue tongue lizard will lay 10 to 20 eggs per batch.
The eggs are left to hatch after 4 to 8 weeks. The female lizards rarely take care of the eggs.�Some lizards such as the blue-tongue skink and Solomon Island skink give birth to young live offspring after 10 weeks.
However, these lizards do not have mammary glands to breastfeed their baby lizards. Baby lizards usually have low life expectancy since they face many predators and less care from the adult lizards.

<h2 id="which-is-the-matingbreeding-season-for-lizards">Which is the Mating/breeding season for lizards</h2>
<p>Normally, lizards prefer to court and mate during the spring season. This is favored by warm temperatures that provides a conducive outdoors bonding for lizards. During this time, the male lizard undergo through spermatogenesis (sperms production) and mates with the female lizard after courtship.
The female lizard will then store the sperms in its oviduct until ova (female egg cells) are produced and mature for fertilization. The warmth in spring makes lizards more sexual active such that, they can mate severally in a given day.
The ability of the female lizard to store sperms in some species makes them easier to carry fertilization even when they are not mating.�Some lizards such as Iguanas and Monitor lizards love mating during summer due to high temperature, which activates the copulation/coitus urge for the mates.
The Asian Water dragon becomes bright red during mating season while North American Lizards become orange skinned when mating season approaches.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-lizards-reproduction-organs-specialized-for-mating-in-lizards">How Are Lizards Reproduction Organs Specialized for Mating in Lizards.</h2>
<p>Lizards, unlike human beings, have special reproduction/sexual organs. The male have hemipenis (plural hemipenes) or penis (tubular) that is used during copulation (sexual intercourse). These organs are sac-like and lack erectile tissues as in human being or other animals.
The testicles and the hemipenes in male lizards are stored inverted inside the body at the back of the tail and are only used during copulation (they are not used for urination or egestion). The testicles of male lizards enlarge during the breeding season (you may notice the bulge part at the back of the lizards tail).
The female lizard has two oviducts, which join to form the cloaca (a special type of female organ). The cloaca is a multi-purpose organ in female lizards as it is used during mating, egestion and urination too.
During mating, the male lizard connects and pours into the cloaca of the female lizard from where the sperms swim to the uterus and up the oviduct to fertilize the ova.
The uterus of the female lizards (especially the viviparous lizards  those that give birth) has large volume that help carry many eggs/baby lizards.
During mating, the cloaca stops completely its other functions i.e. urination and egestion. You can locate the tiny pole at the back of the tail in each sex (male or female lizard) that represents the sexual organ.

<h2 id="do-all-female-lizards-need-to-mate-to-get-fertilized-or-pregnant">Do All Female Lizards Need to Mate to Get Fertilized or Pregnant?</h2>
<p>No. Not all lizards that need mating to lay eggs. Some lizards such as gecko, rock lizards, monitor lizards are parthenogenetic (do no need to mate to lay eggs). These lizard species lay eggs (though not fertilized), which hatch to baby lizards.
However, the young ones from these eggs do not have genes that favor diversity like those from fertilized eggs.�The asexual lizards (parthenogenetic) usually have both chromosomes that are provided by the male sex cell thus helps in grow of the egg to maturity.
Other lizard species such as Komodo lizards are bisexual- they can reproduce sexually or by parthenogenesis. In most cases, the bisexual lizards would prefer mating as it offers the bonding chance that make them create a colony for daily activities or defense purposes.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-babiesoff-springs-do-lizards-hatch">How Many Babies/Off Springs Do Lizards Hatch?</h2>
<p>The number of eggs laid by a give lizard species determines the number of baby lizards that are raised in a given season. After mating, the female lizard lays 1 to 20 eggs per batch in a warm environment.
In a given breeding season, female lizards can lay 2 to 3 batches, which may lead to breeding problem on hatching. 80 to 90 percent of the laid eggs normally hatch to baby lizards in 50 to 57 days.
About 1 to 40 lizards are hatched in a given breeding season from a single female lizard. However, due to large predation in the breeding ground, 60 percent of the population do not survive to maturity. Most of them are eaten away or die due to adverse weather conditions and less parental care.
Species such as Blue tongue lizard can raise between 5 to 18 baby lizards. The Asian water dragon manages 5 to 12 baby lizards while Bearded Dragon can hatch between 15 to 20 young ones.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-baby-lizards-take-to-mature">How Long Does The Baby Lizards Take To Mature?</h2>
<p>Baby lizard takes about 12 months to acquire full maturity. During this time, the baby lizard is fed partially by the adult ones and also engaged in light hunting of food.
At this age, the lizard can carry out reproduction (can mate and lay eggs). The adult lizard then assumes the duties of food gathering (hunting) since its old enough to even have its own shelter/cage.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When mating, the male lizard climbs over the female lizard and introduces its hemipenes (male organ) into the cloaca (female) of the female lizard and pours the sperms that swim to the oviduct where they fertilize the ova (singular ovum).
The male lizard has scary underneath skin with debris, which prevent it from sliding during coitus. The male and female lizard must court before mating begin.</p>
