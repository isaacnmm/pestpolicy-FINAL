<p>Are male or female bernedoodles better?� Well, it depends. Size and personality are the main differentiating factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male Bernedoodles are larger compared to their female counterparts. Consequently, everything about them has dialed up a notch.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://welovedoodles.com/bernedoodle/">characteristics of a Bernedoodle</a>also differ based on their gender. Males tend to be more playful.
If a Bernedoodle is actively running and jumping around, chances are it is a male. They also tend to be quite stubborn when it comes to training.
On the other hand, females are much more docile. They are mild-mannered and take well to training sessions.
Owners tend to get pets that reflect their personalities. So whichever Bernedoodle resonates with you the most should be your pick.

<h2 id="what-are-the-types-of-bernedoodles"><strong>What are the Types of Bernedoodles?</strong></h2>
<p>Bernedoodles come in three major types. They are:</p>
<h3 id="1-tiny"><strong>1. Tiny</strong></h3>
<p>This is the smallest of the Bernedoodles. They weigh between 10 and 24 pounds and grow up to 17 inches.
These dogs are the true definition of pocket-sized. They are harder to handle as pups due to their excitable nature. They become calmer after reaching adulthood.
<strong>2. Miniature</strong>
The miniature Bernedoodle is slightly bigger, standing at 22 inches after maturing.
They can weigh up to 59 pounds. Much like the tiny version, the miniature type is a handful when young.
<strong>3. Standard</strong>
The standard variation is the most commonly seen Bernedoodle. They can reach up to 29 inches and weigh more than 80 pounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>These large dogs are more expensive to groom and feed. They have calm personalities throughout their lives.</li>
<li>As discussed above, male Bernedoodles are bigger in height and weigh more than female ones.
This makes taking care of the male ones a slightly bigger challenge.

<h2 id="how-should-you-feed-a-bernedoodle"><strong>How Should You Feed a Bernedoodle?</strong></h2>
<p>How much your Bernedoodle eats depends on a multitude of factors.
Age, height, weight, type, and gender <a href="/posts/are-leopard-geckos-nocturnal/">are</a> among the main ones. Standard Bernedoodles eat much more than their smaller cousins. Males tend to eat more as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernedoodles are not picky eaters. They will eat almost anything and in large quantities. This is a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, you have a wide variety to choose from because they have little to no preference. Conversely, picking the right kind of food can be daunting.
Here are some pros and cons of the different kinds of food:
<strong>1. Kibble or Dry Food</strong></li>
<li>This is the most common method of feeding</li>
<li>Less expensive and lasts longer</li>
<li>Protects from dental issues</li>
<li>The nutritional standard varies greatly
Kibble is an all-in-one solution but may not be the best for a growing puppy.
<strong>2. Wet Food</strong></li>
<li>This is a great transitional food for the growing puppy</li>
<li>A higher quantity of preservatives and chemicals</li>
<li>Potential to cause dental issues</li>
<li>Prolonged use leads to gastrointestinal problems
<strong>3. Raw and Cooked Food</strong></li>
<li>Higher nutritional value</li>
<li>Variety of choices and flavors</li>
<li>It tends to be expensive (for larger dogs)</li>
<li>Improper feeding can lead to malnutrition
Choosing the right type of food is vital for your Bernedoodle. Research has shown feeding habits correlate directly to their personality development.
Consulting a veterinarian is a good idea as they can create custom diet plans for your Bernedoodle.

<h2 id="feeding-schedule"><strong>Feeding Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>A feeding schedule is necessary to avoid health problems. Obesity among dogs is a common issue as owners typically do not follow a diet plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernedoodle puppies are more physically active, which makes feeding them less of an issue. As they grow up, they tend to get slower and proportionally gain more weight.
Typically, you want to feed puppies three times a day. Grazing should be allowed for up to three months.
After this period, you should maintain a schedule. Dogs older than six months require two big meals daily. Experts recommend having set feeding times.
This will condition your pet to be hungry during those times. Fully matured Bernedoodles may still be hungry after each feeding. In such cases, they may be allowed to graze but keep a close eye on them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-best-grooming-habits-">**What are the Best Grooming Habits? **</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Bernedoodles do not have fur on their bodies. They possess a
lot of hair
but do not shed much.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should wash your pet with shampoo once every month. Since they have curly hair, you may also choose to clip once every two months.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that curly hair requires regular brushing. This also serves as a bonding experience between the two of you.
Clip their nails whenever you feel they are too long. Avoid excessive bathing as it can decrease the shine of their coat.
