<p>When choosing the best shoes for high arches and standing all day its crucial that you pick ones with good arch support. You might opt for those that accommodate orthotics or those with supportive shanks at the outsole. Shanks takes the load off your feet allowing you to flex naturally.</p>

<h3 id="shock-absorption">Shock Absorption<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#shock-absorption">¶</a></h3>
<p>Shoes for high arches and standing all day need good shock absorption that would protect the foot against injuries while relieving pain or discomfort.</p>

<p>People with high arches are likely to experience weak or painful heels. Therefore, when choosing the best shoes for high arches and standing all day ensure you pick ones with more padding at the back of the foot and the insole.</p>
