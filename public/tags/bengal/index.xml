<h2 id="how-does-bengal-roach-spray-work">How Does Bengal Roach Spray Work?</h2>
<p>Bengal roach spray employs some particular dry propellant that allows it to go very deep into crevices and cracks, under your appliances, and behind the walls  these are the places where roaches breed and live.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bengal roach spray irritates the[<a href="/posts/best-roach-bait/">cockroaches</a> and goes ahead to kill cockroach eggs](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-cockroach-eggs/)within">https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-cockroach-eggs/)within</a> an hour. However, the irritation ejects the roaches from their hiding spaces to open areas where they die and get picked up orvacuumed off.</li>
<li>Regular sprays employ some water-based formula requiring direct application on the roaches for maximum effectiveness.</li>
<li>But Bengals key ingredient is permethrin thats non-staining, effective, and odorless, and has a long residue effect  single spraying lasts over two weeks.

<li>Despite that roaches can survive radiation and hold their breath for over half an hour (enhancing survival in the water), Bengal <a href="/posts/best-roach-killer-for-apartments/">roach</a> spray is a great solution.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-use-bengal-roach-spray">When to Use Bengal Roach Spray?</h2>

water - which makes it the appropriate time to kill the bugs
