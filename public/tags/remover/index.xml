<p>The Krud Kutter comes with a patented formulation that can easily penetrate all metal surfaces&rsquo; cavities and chemically dissolve rust.</p>
<p>During the rust removal process, tiny crystals that prevent rust are formed, automatically integrating with the metal surface molecules to form a rust-resistant topcoat.
Any further corrosion will attack the crystals instead of the metal. Once it is fully dry, the surface becomes ready for painting, lubrication, plating, or welding.
Even if you leave the cleaned surface bare, the crystals will prevent any subsequent rusting for as long as one year -
