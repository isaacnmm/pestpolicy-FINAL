<p>Did you know that you can make your own bed bug sprays using essential oils? All you need is an empty spray bottle, some
essential oils
, and water.

<h2 id="rubbing-alcohol-alternatives"><strong>Rubbing alcohol alternatives?�</strong></h2>
<p>How effective is
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-vinegar-kill-bed-bugs/">vinegar in killing bed bugs</a>
? Well,�Vinegar is another natural way to
kill bed bugs directly
on contact but is not always effective as a repellent. Yes, bleach will kill bed bugs. However, it is a chemical so use it sparingly.
Diatomaceous Earth is another natural solution that you can try, which also dehydrates
bed bugs and their eggs
. You will probably find it more effective when combined with other solutions mentioned above - or use
bed bug sprays
alternatively.
Despite that, it is named alcohol, human beings cannot drink it since it has added bitterants.
Mainly, rubbing alcohol is used as a topic antiseptic but also has other home and industrial applications. Rubbing alcohol is created from ethyl alcohol, a mix of ethyl alcohol and poisonous and bitter substances.
However, you must first know the difference between bed bugs (including the
baby bed bugs
) and other insects such as
Ants
.
<strong>You must be wondering, but what is rubbing alcohol?</strong>
Rubbing alcohol is either
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol">ethanol-</a>
based liquids or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol">isopropyl alcohol</a>
(propane-2-ol).
However, isopropyl alcohol is the most popular in the market. You might try different natural solutions until you find one that works  and if all else fails, youll probably have to call the exterminators.
Bed bugs are tiny brown insects that
can very quickly and easily spread
through your home. As the name implies, they are mostly found on
bed mattresses
and frames. But they can also spread throughout your house, infesting every furniture, item, and piece of clothing. While they dont spread disease,
bed bugs do bite
as they feed off the blood, causing a rash in some people. So you really want to get
rid of them fast
!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Weve shown you different natural remedies to kill bed bugs without harsh chemicals. It might take some trial and error to find the right one for you.
However, combining alcohol with other steps such as steaming and vacuuming will likely give you the best results. If all else fails, call in the exterminator.</p>
