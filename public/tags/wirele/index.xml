<p>DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller (DS4) was designed for PS4 and had a strong body build.
DS4 allows you to map mouse functionality to its central touchpad for easy windows navigation. However, you&rsquo;ll download the
<a href="http://ds4windows.com/">unofficial DS4 windows software</a>
.
DualShock 4 is built to support almost everything: it comes with an in-built Move feature, Sixaxis tilt controls, face buttons, and the standard analog sticks.
Despite not being designed for PC, DS4 has grown to become a favorite all-around gamepad for most gaming experts.
It feels strong and reliable despite the additional width when compared to Xbox One gamepad.
It comes with a better Xbox One pad and softer curves that will give you a better gaming experience.
The DualShock 4 is the best PC gaming controller as it combines the progressive evolution of nature and the PlayStation controller familiarity.
<strong>New Sticks and Pad</strong>
Further, DualShock 4 has a better d-pad compared to those on Microsoft Xbox, and thus works great for street fighter gaming on PC. However, you might need to use the input mapper.
It has an excellent analog trigger feel, with the bumpers and triggers producing a great tactile feel.�Its sticks are more sensitive, responsive (at the center), and lighter.
<strong>Concave design�</strong>
DS4 has an excellent concave design to give you a better grip and gaming feel. Also, it has a raised ring near the edge and is thus easier to grip. I found the DualShock 4 to be more sensitive and smoother.
The DualShock 4 adds a front-facing touchpad to its original Sony PlayStation design. Also, it has excellent sticks and triggers. Interestingly, the DualShock 4 controller will work excellently with games such as Steam and Shovel Knight.
With its built-in speaker, light bar, and touchpad, the DS4 Controller will better your gaming experience. Also, if you are a music lover, the Controller has a 3.5mm audio jack just for you.
<strong>DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller Review�</strong>
**Mac or PC connection? **
For Mac or PC connection, you&rsquo;ll need to use a Sony DS4 USB Wireless adapter. You can fix any DS4 worn-out rubber using the GelTabz PS4 &ldquo;thumb grips.&rdquo; It is Bluetooth compatible and has a rechargeable battery.
**Short and fat trigger **
It comes with reworked triggers and buttons, more extended grips, and a rubber body feel. Compared to the triggers in Xbox 360 that are skinny and long, I noted that DS4&rsquo;s triggers are fat and shot but are equally great to use.
Notably, the DualShock 4 triggers will stop with a click when you press them down, which creates a great tactile feel. Also, the Controller is plug-and-play with a USB cable.
<em><strong>Unique Features</strong></em>
Standard Triggers, Micro USB Cable, Parallel Thumbnails, Inset directional pad, Easy to recharge
**Options button - Share, Stream, and Save **
Note that the Start button is renamed as the Options button. Further, you can press the Share button to save a 15 minutes gameplay before the game ends, which you can share the screenshots and video online.
Further, you can press the Share button to stream video games from sites such as Twitch. Also, while playing, you can enable to show your comments and those of your viewers.
The share button in DS4 will allow you to seamlessly share your best moments, live-stream, screenshots, and videos without interrupting the game action.
<strong>Better grip and ergonomics�</strong>
With its improved design and better grip, youll find the DualShock 4 as an excellent alternative to the Xbox One controller.
Sony DualShock 4 feels great in the hands due to its excellent ergonomics with the familiar Sony controller design. With its micro USB cable, and on Windows 10, the gamepad will be plug and play.
You can connect your DS4 to the PC wireless through Bluetooth, with Bluetooth functionality in your PC, or purchase the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KYVLKG2/?tag=p-policy-20">DualShock USB Wireless Adaptor</a>
, which you&rsquo;ll input into the computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since many PC games utilize the ABYX button prompts, you&rsquo;ll need to install the<a href="http://ds4windows.com/">unofficial DS4Windows</a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, all the games supporting the use of controllers will work with the DS4 after installing the unofficial drivers.
DS4 enables extensive LED customization. The�DS4Windows will function effectively and also allow you to use the gamepad&rsquo;s central trackpad like a mouse.

<em>DS4</em>
vs DS3&quot;]
<em>But, what is right in Dualshock 4 (DS4) compared to Dualshock 3 (DS3)?</em>
Dualshock 4 now has a clickable 2-point touchpad. Despite its increased length and breadth, DS4 is more efficient than DS3. There are back LEDs that light in different functions, such as during controller charging.
Also, DS4 has remodeled R1, R2, and L1, L2 buttons, which are even more spread out, which will give you better feedback and access. DS4 also has a .5mm headphone jack at the front section to enable the addition of earphones.
At the center of the navigation keys, joysticks, and D-Pad, the DS4 has a touchpad that will enable multi-finger scrolling and enhance the navigation and pinch to zoom functions. Thus, it is possible to swipe commands in games that require such inputs.�Finally, it is now possible to charge the DualShock 4 when the PS4 is powered off.
However, you need an InputMapper program download for the gamepad to work if you have challenges connecting to the PC.

You can decide to bury or put them at ground level where you want to detect motion.
<strong>Expand-ability</strong>
There are several wireless driveway alarms that can be expanded to incorporate multiple sensors and receivers.</li>
<li>Some systems support one type of sensor and others that support various kinds of sensors.

<p>Sensor Location affects the kind of sensor technology you purchase. For instance, some sensors detect heat and others detect motion.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are fixing your sensor close to a tree with waving branches in a windy location, you may experience many false alarms, especially if using motion-sensing technology.
On the other hand, a passive infrared sensor (PIR) might give you fewer false alarms.</li>

<li>Or would you rather have it see people, animals, or cars? Some sensors can even detect weight. The choice you make depends on your specific alarm needs.
The good thing with a Wireless Driveway system is that it can transmit signals of up to 1000 feet in areas with no physical barriers (like walls or mountains) and approximately 300 feet through walls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there alternative power options for the sensors like a battery or solar charge?
Check the type of batteries youll need to power both the sensors and the receivers. Can the batteries be recharged? How long do they retain their charge?</p>
<h3 id="6-wireless-transmission-range"><strong>6. Wireless Transmission Range</strong></h3>
<p>A wireless transmission distance should be on a straight line with direct visual sight, meaning there should be no physical obstructions like hills, trees, or mountains.</p>
