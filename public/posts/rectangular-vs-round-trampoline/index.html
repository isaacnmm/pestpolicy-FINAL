is never an easy task. Trampolines come in different shapes, sizes, and features.</p>
<p>Most people, especially first time buyers can get overwhelmed in deciding the kind of trampoline to pick. To make the decision easier, I will discuss everything you need to know about Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline.</p>

<h2 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline--details">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline- Details<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline--details">¶</a></h2>
<p>When deciding which trampoline shape you want for your family, its important that you consider the size of your backyard, the ideal trampoline location in the backyard, number of children that would play on the trampoline, and your budget.</p>
<p>Both round and rectangular trampolines are good options worth considering. However, depending on your specific circumstances one might serve you better than the other might.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the next section I will provide all the differences and similarities between the two options. Thus, help you decide which between the two suits you best.</p>
<h2 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline--differences">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline  Differences<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline--differences">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-weight-limitation">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Weight Limitation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-weight-limitation">¶</a></h3>
<p>When buying a trampoline, its important that you check its weight limitation. You would want to consider the number of children that would use it. Also, remember that adults might join the little ones during the jumps.</p>
<p>If both adults and children will use the trampoline, a rectangular one will be the best choice. Nonetheless, a small family can buy the round trampoline.
<strong>Heres A Rough Weight Limit Estimate For Round Trampolines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The weight limit for a 14 to 16-foot round trampoline is about 250400 pounds</li>
<li>A 12FT round trampoline has an approximate weight limit of between 250300 pounds</li>
<li>A 8FT to 10FT round trampoline can hold about 200250 pounds
**Rectangular Trampoline- Weight Limitation **</li>
<li>All rectangular trampolines will hold about 300FT-450FT pounds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-safety">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Safety<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-safety">¶</a></h3>
<p>The rectangular trampoline has a large jumping area that allows you to choose where you want to land. Thus, Landing at the edges might cause injuries with the springs. On the other hand, in a round trampoline the user will only land at the center of the mat. Thus, chances of injuries reduce.</p>
<p>Youll experience a higher bounce in a rectangular trampoline. Hence, if youre a gymnasts or an athlete the rectangular trampoline would be a great choice. It will allow you perform your flips, twirls, and all the tricks you need to practice safely.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, rectangular trampolines might not be the safest for young children. This option encourages higher jumps and dangerous turns that can cause injuries to the little ones. Nonetheless, with adult supervision, a rectangular trampoline would be a great choice.</p>
<p>However, the round trampoline will not give you a higher bounce compared to the rectangular option. The design of the round trampoline doesnt support a higher jump at the edges like in the rectangular option. Thus, all the jumping takes place at the center in the round trampoline.</p>
<p>The low jumping height and the center jump makes round trampoline a safer option for children. Without getting to the edges, children cant come across springs that might hurt them. The low height jump will not allow dangerous maneuvers.</p>

<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-safety-net-enclosure">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Safety Net Enclosure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-safety-net-enclosure">¶</a></h3>
<p>Weather you choose a round or rectangular trampoline, the safety of the jumpers should be a priority. Therefore, both of these options must have a safety net enclosure system.</p>
<p>The net protects the jumpers from falling off the trampoline, thus prevent life threatening injuries.</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-bounce-quality">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Bounce Quality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-bounce-quality">¶</a></h3>
<p>Youll agree with me that the bounce quality of a trampoline goes a long way in determining the level of fun and activities a user can do.</p>
<p>Well, between Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline, which gives a better bounce? Ill say a rectangular trampoline gives a better and higher bounce. It has a large surface area that translates to a bigger jumping area.</p>
<p>A jumper can bounce up higher with a lot of ease while on a rectangular trampoline.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a round trampoline delivers a consistent bounce and the jumper remains at the center. Jumps directed towards the edges might not be as powerful compared to the rectangular option. The center jump in round trampolines promotes even weight distribution</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-usage">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Usage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-usage">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most athletes and gymnasts prefer rectangular trampoline for their training. Therefore, if you or your child wants to practice some gymnastics a rectangular option would be a great choice.</p>
<p>A rectangular trampoline delivers higher jumping altitudes and excellent shock absorption.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a round trampoline is ideal for recreational fun at the backyard. Unlike the rectangular options, the round trampolines dont have a higher weight limit. Hence, they are perfect for children and toddlers.</p>
<p>Therefore, think about the usage of your trampoline before doing a purchase. The intended trampoline use will determine the shape you choose.</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-performance">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Performance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-performance">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rectangle trampolines can improve the performance of gymnasts and athletics. The long, spacious, rectangular shape provides a reliable area to perform all the tricks and twirls.</p>
<p>Most professional jumpers have invested in professional-grade rectangular trampolines to enhance their skills. These trampolines can hold over 350lbs and have a huge landing space.</p>
<p>On the other hand, round trampoline have only one landing spot at the center. The weight limit for round trampoline is around 200-300lbs. Hence, they dont meet the exception of most professional athletic training needs. Their bounce is also not as powerful as that of a rectangular trampoline.</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-location">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Location<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-location">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before making a purchase, decide on the ideal trampoline location within your backyard. The available space will play a crucial in deciding between a round trampoline vs. rectangular trampoline.</p>
<p>Round trampolines have a dimension that ranges between 8ft to 15ft while rectangular trampolines can vary from 10ft, 7ft to 10ft.</p>
<p>Both rectangular and circular trampolines may take up more backyard space depending on their sizes. However, Rectangle trampolines may take up more space than round trampolines. The rectangular shaped trampoline will fit perfectly in a corner while round trampoline might need a more centered space to fit the complete round diameter.</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-price">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-price">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rectangle trampolines are costly than round trampolines. Rectangle trampolines are expensive to manufacture. They require additional springs, a stronger frame, and a reliable mat that can withstand force from all directions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, round trampolines are strong because of the circular design frame. This design is less costly to manufacture, hence, the lower cost.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#faqs">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-is-a-circular-or-rectangle-trampoline-better">1. Is a Circular or Rectangle Trampoline Better?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-is-a-circular-or-rectangle-trampoline-better">¶</a></h3>
<p>Well, it depends! If youre buying a trampoline for young children a circular one will be much better. However, if the children are a bit older a rectangular one will be great. Overall, a rectangular trampoline is the best option for gymnastics training. It can accommodate multiple people at once and it has a higher weight limit.</p>
<p>A rectangular trampoline has different landing spots for a more effective bounce. The circular trampoline has only one landing spot; at the center.</p>
<h3 id="2-why-are-rectangular-trampolines-more-expensive-than-round-trampolines">2. Why Are Rectangular Trampolines More Expensive Than Round Trampolines?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-why-are-rectangular-trampolines-more-expensive-than-round-trampolines">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rectangular Trampolines are More Expensive than Round Trampolines because of their shape, hence need for additional support. Rectangular trampoline also takes up additional springs and materials, which makes the production cost high, hence, the high purchase cost.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Round trampoline are strong because of their circular shape. They are also relatively easier and low cost to manufacture. Thus, the reduced purchase price.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-size-trampoline-is-best-for-flips">3. What size Trampoline is Best for Flips?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-what-size-trampoline-is-best-for-flips">¶</a></h3>
<p>The best trampoline for flips are rectangular shaped trampolines. They are bigger in size and they have a huge jumping surface. Thus, they are the best for gymnastics training. The bounce in a rectangular trampoline is of a higher quality. Its also more consistent across the whole jumping surface.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you were looking to compare Rectangular vs. round trampoline, I hope that this guide has been helpful.</p>
<p>Both the rectangular and round trampolines are great options that you might want to consider. However, its important that you establish why and for who. Once youve answered that you can make a correct decision.</p>
<p>Generally, if youre looking for kids trampoline you can choose any of the round trampolines weve reviewed. However, it youre more advanced and want to improve your jumping or gymnastics tricks pick any of the rectangle options Ive reviewed.</p>
