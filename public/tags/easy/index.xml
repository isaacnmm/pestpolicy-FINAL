      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are having trouble with your tent not being as quiet as you wish then do not threaten as I know some amazing ideas which will help reduce the noise - soundproof a tent.</p>
<p>Noise-canceling Headphones - They do what it says in the name, they cancel out noise and are a great alternative to earplugs especially if you find something on your ear quite uncomfortable.
These headphones can be quite expensive but in my opinion are worth it and You can purchase them in various designs which are not to like. Read Also:

<h2 id="soundproof-a-tent">Soundproof a Tent</h2>
<h3 id="1-carpeting">1. Carpeting</h3>
<p>One of the cheaper end easiest ways to soundproof would be to lay carpeting down, thick carpets work best absorbing the bass frequencies which travel through the ground.</p>
<h3 id="2-moving-blankets">2. Moving Blankets</h3>
<p>These�blankets are known to be great for absorbing sound and they are not too�expensive either. All you will need to do is hang them in your tent against the�walls and they will act as a sound barrier.

<h3 id="3-acoustic-barriers">3. Acoustic Barriers</h3>
<p>This material is used in recording studios granting it a great material to use. It can be on the more expensive side but I believe it is worth every penny.
When purchasing the material companies size them to room size in a house or studio so you may have to cut the material down to the size of your tent.</p>
<h3 id="4-building-a-structure">4. Building a Structure</h3>
<p>This�tip is aimed more for those who will be living in a tent for at least a few�days and more as building and placing a temporary structure can still take up a�lot of time.
You will need to build and assemble a wooden frame around your tent and attach materials that can insulate sound onto the wooden beans. Read Also:

<h3 id="5-destructive-interference">5. Destructive interference</h3>
<p>The bases of this theory are about using the sound waves from the source to counteract that of another. If you use a speaker and point it to the direction in which the sounds are coming from your sound waves should in effect stop the other noises from reaching your tent.
The only downfall to this is that you will need to have noise in order to council out the other noise and depending on the frequencies and volumes it may not always work. Read Also:

<h3 id="6-curtains">6. Curtains</h3>
<p>There�are some great curtains on the market which are thick and designed to help block�out sound and light.
You could always purchase your desired curtains and hang�them in your tent having them act as a sound barrier.</p>
<h3 id="7-white-noise-machines">7. White Noise Machines</h3>
<p>For a quick and easier solution, you could always try a white noise machine. These machines are designed to do one thing and one thing only, to create white noise.
The White noise acts as a barrier for any outside noises giving you an opportunity of peaceful sleep. Read Also:

<h3 id="8-earplugs">8. Earplugs</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a solution that is cheap, takes no the to set up, easy to use, lightweight, and can be even carried on a small bag than I would suggest the simplicity of earplugs.
