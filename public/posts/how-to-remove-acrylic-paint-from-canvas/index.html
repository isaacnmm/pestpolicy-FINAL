acrylic paint
from canvas becomes challenging, especially when the paint has dried out. How you can clean paint spots or the entire canvas? Which method works best? Is the washing machine safe?</p>
<p><em>So, here&rsquo;s how to remove acrylic paint from the canvas; by either using denatured alcohol/isopropyl alcohol, mineral spirits, ammonia, turpentine, or acetone/nail polish.�</em>
<em>These solvents clean both wet and dry acrylic paint effectively if the right procedure is followed. You can effectively carry out optional cleaning methods such as spot cleaning, stripping/full canvas cleaning, and final cleaning without any problem.�</em>
<em>Alternatively, you can use commercially available products such as Dumond Paint remover, �Grandma&rsquo;s Secret GS7001, or Wegner spray paint remover. But you will need to check on the material specifications and match them with the best paint remover.�</em></p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-remove-acrylic-paint-from-canvas">Details: How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Canvas<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#details-how-to-remove-acrylic-paint-from-canvas">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="a-denature-alcohol-or-isopropyl-alcohol">a. Denature Alcohol or Isopropyl alcohol<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-denature-alcohol-or-isopropyl-alcohol">¶</a></h3>
<p>Dilute one liter of denatured alcohol with two liters of water (1:2 ratio). Using a sponge, rub the surface with acrylic paint gently. This solvent will remove wet
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAo1gfNIhXw">acrylic paint</a>
instantly upon contact.
For dry acrylic paint, you will need to quench the surface before stripping.�Denatured alcohol contains strong, active agents (ethyl 5%) that break down the paint molecular bond into a thick paint viscous fluid, which is easier to clean.
Beside, denatured alcohol penetrates the canvas without affecting the material fabric. For a thicker layer of acrylic paint, isopropyl alcohol is suitable. Further, you will need to use a concentrated solvent to improve the bond-breaking affinity during action time.
Notably, denature alcohol irritates the skin and nasal cavity; thus, you should wear protective gear when cleaning. See Also:

<h3 id="b-mineral-spirit">b. Mineral spirit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#b-mineral-spirit">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mineral spirit is an organic solvent that works best for dry acrylic paint. The unique chemical formulation that comes with mineral spirit is self-activation and acts instantly upon contact.
You will need to dilute mineral spirit slightly when applying over a thin acrylic paint layer. However, for a thicker acrylic paint layer, a higher mineral spirit concentration is needed for a complete breakdown of paint molecular bonds.
Further, apply acrylic gesso to prime the dry canvas for quick quenching and easier stripping. Mineral spirit is poisonous when swallow and should therefore be stored away from kids and pets.

<h3 id="c-ammonia">c. Ammonia<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#c-ammonia">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mix a cup of ammonia with three cups of clean water. Using a sponge, smear the acrylic painted area (spot). Leave it for 5 minutes to quench (for dry paint) before stripping.
In case you want to clean the entire canvas, you will need to soak it (canvas) in an ammonium solution before stripping.
Wet paint is easily cleaned using a piece of cloth or sponge, while dry acrylic paint needs a primer before the solvent application. A paintbrush is required to clean the surface after the quenching process is complete.
Remember, ammonia emits poisonous gases that may choke or irritate the respiratory system. The solvent cause skin burn or irritation too.

<h3 id="d-turpentine">d. Turpentine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#d-turpentine">¶</a></h3>
<p>Apply turpentine over the acrylic painted canvas and leave it for 6 minutes. Then, wash using soapy detergents until the paint is entirely cleaned.
The turpentine has strong, active agents, which helps in the breakdown of acrylic paint molecular bonds on contact. The high affinity of the solvent gives it instant action power for both wet and dry acrylic paint.
Turpentine is best when used over spot paint than complete stripping. After removing paint, you will need to clean the canvas with soap to eliminate the turpentine residue and acrylic resin that is denatured.
Turpentine has a deep unpleasant scent; therefore, you should wear a respirator and hand gloves during application.</p>
<h3 id="e-acetone">e. Acetone<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#e-acetone">¶</a></h3>
<p>Acetone is a resilient acrylic paint remover that features a complex chemical structure, which is self-activating upon application. The solvent penetrates thick acrylic paint in a couple of seconds and will not affect the canvas during paint removal if the right concentration is maintained.
You will need to mix one liter of acetone in a basic and soak your acrylic painted canvas for 3 to 6 minutes. Then, wash the canvas with soapy detergent before rinsing to dry.
Excess concentration of acetone may deface the canvas  it is necessary to carry out a drop test experiment before you start removing paint to ascertain acetone efficiency.
Notably, acetone irritates both skin and nasal cavity. It is poisonous when swallowed.</p>

<h3 id="a-spot-cleaning">a. Spot Cleaning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-spot-cleaning">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prepare acrylic cleaning solvent and put it in a bottle or spray can. Gently, spray or rub over the acrylic painted area on the canvas. Leave to quench fo0r 5 to 10 minutes (for thick layers) before stripping or wiping the stain.
Alternatively, you can dip the section with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-acrylic-paint-for-professional-artists/">acrylic paint for professional artists</a>
in a paint remover and scrape off using a knife or scalpel.
You must be very precise when carrying out spot cleaning since the paint remover may affect the marginal areas. Further, you should rinse the spot area with soap and clean water to eliminate acrylic paint remover residuals.</p>
<h3 id="b-stripping-or-full-canvas-cleaning">b. Stripping or Full Canvas Cleaning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#b-stripping-or-full-canvas-cleaning">¶</a></h3>
<p>To carry out the entire canvas stripping, you will need a large basin with acrylic paint remover (prepared compound). Ensure the solvent is in the right concentration before soaking the canvas for 30 minutes.
Wash the canvas with a paintbrush to remove the quenched layer. Repeat the procedure until the acrylic paint layer is entirely removed.
Transfer the canvas into a basin with soap detergent and wash out the paint remover residual before drying under the sun.
NB: When cleaning, avoid direct contact since most acrylic paint removers irritate the skin upon contact (wear hand gloves).</p>
<h3 id="c-final-cleaning">c. Final Cleaning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#c-final-cleaning">¶</a></h3>
<p>Final cleaning is carried out after the complete removal of acrylic paint has happened. This process is put in place to eliminate the paint remover residuals and acquire an excellent finish.
You will need to clean the canvas (after stripping acrylic paint) using soapy detergent and clean water. Rub the canvas with the paintbrush thoroughly to remove traces that may be stuck within the fabrics.
Eventually, rinse the canvas with plenty of clean water before drying. The pressure cleaner works best in the final finish process. See Also:

<p>While the acrylic paint removal process can be enjoyable, it may lead to fatal accidents or death if safety is not considered.
First, most acrylic paint removers are flammable, and thus fire may result if precautions are not adhered to.
Therefore, before you begin the paint removal process, ensure that you follow the safety rule and precautions highlighted below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Never inhale any solvent as a way of testing concentration  ammonia is highly poisonous.</li>
<li>Wear facemask, eye protection, and hand gloves when mixing and cleaning acrylic paint from the canvas. This act boosts your safety.</li>
<li>Please do not attempt to mix two or more solvents in the name of improving their action affinity. This may lead to an explosion or destroy the canvas.</li>
<li>Ensure your room or space is well ventilated when removing acrylic paint from the canvas. Usually, acrylic paint removers like denatured alcohol, ammonia, turpentine, etc. fill the room and may choke you to death if inhaled. Besides, the humid concentration may trigger a fire.</li>
<li>Never use acrylic paint removers near a fireplace  most of them are flammable, eg., isopropyl alcohol.</li>
<li>Keep acrylic paint removers away from pets and children  they are poisonous when swallowed eg. ammonia, turpentine, etc.</li>
<li>Always read the labels f any commercial acrylic paint remover and use it for the recommended surfaces.</li>
<li>It would help if you carried out a drop test experiment before commencing the process of acrylic paint removal.
NB: Seek immediate medical attention if you swallow any other solvent indicated in this article. If you get into skin contact with any solvent, wash the area with plenty of cold water.
