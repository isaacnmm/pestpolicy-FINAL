<strong>Avoid Shoes with Heels</strong>
Some running shoes have high and big soles, which are unnecessary for a guy who is tall. �Average size soles are better. You might even go minimalist and youll more ground control. Therefore, when doing your shoe shopping look closely at each picture. Look at the heels; ask yourself if you can maneuver through the running terrain with ease.

Dark colors have a way of concealing attributes that you might not want other people to concentrate on for long. For instance, if its your wide feet, you may opt for darker shoes as opposed to white or other shiny colors. The same goes for clothes.

Being tall comes with its own challenges. Its crucial that you make choices that will make your life easier. When it comes to running shoes ensure you choose comfortable running shoes. Some of the comfort features to consider include breathability, durable rubber outsole, removable sock liner, and spacious toe box or forefoot.</p>
