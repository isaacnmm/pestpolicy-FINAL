<h2 id="details-how-lambda-cyhalothrin-is-used-for-pest-control">Details: How Lambda-Cyhalothrin Is Used For Pest Control</h2>
<p>As described earlier lambda-cyhalothrin is classified as a pyrethroid (synthetic one) meaning that it is a replica of pyrethrum (natural) that comes from a chrysanthemum flower.</p>
<ul>

Further exterminators love Lambda-cyhalothrin since it has a longer-lasting residue effect and so it is adopted as an active ingredient in many bug control products.</li>
<li>Physically, lambda-cyhalothrin comes in a mild odor, beige when in solid form, but it&rsquo;s mainly colorless.</li>

<ul>
<li>The synthetic pyrethroid is described as being dual-action in nature because it can kill fleas and other pests when they ingest or touch the insecticide.
As a pyrethroid, the lambda-cyhalothrin will exterminate targeted fleas and insects by compromising and disrupting their central nervous system.</li>
<li>Hence the fleas or pests&rsquo; nerve cells will get excited and this will lead to paralysis - this means that is inside won&rsquo;t be able to feed or undertake normal body functions which result in starvation and death.
Also because lambda-cyhalothrin has a long residue effect plus it&rsquo;s carried on the pest body, it will be spread over many surfaces and possibly kill the whole bug colony.</li>
<li>The pesticide is classified as a versatile formulation and you can get it in various forms including rodenticides, gel baits, and concentrates.
You can broadcast the insecticide or apply it as a barrier pest treatment around the house or different structures to kill bugs that are on ornamental plants, shrubs, and landscapes.</li>
<li>Lambda-cyhalothrin will start working immediately once ingested or on contact causing a quick knock-down and death of the flea or other targeted pests.
The chemical will works to poison the flea&rsquo;s central nervous system which results in paralysis and finally death.
The synthetic pesticide is compatible with many fungicides and insecticides and thus you can apply it alongside different products for pest control but still sustain its effectiveness and potency.
