<h3 id="1-ibanez-talman-tcy10-acoustic-electric-guitar-black"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004MM8P3Q/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Ibanez Talman TCY10 Acoustic-Electric Guitar Black</a></h3>
<p>Talman TCY10 is a quality acoustic-electric guitar with a double-cutaway design - Width at Nut: 43mm (1.69 inches). It has a beautiful body - spruce top plus mahogany sides and back.</p>
<p>Talman TCY10 is a durable small-hand acoustic guitar that has an excellent weight-to-strength ratio. Further, for additional reliability, the manufacturer included yet X bracing top. Check these
cheap acoustic guitars
.
The guitar&rsquo;s rosewood 20-fret fingerboard is supported by a mahogany neck. Also, the die-cast tuners on the neck are very factional and beautiful - with an ergonomic body &amp; light materials.
On comfort, Talman TCY10 cutaway provides enough comfort just like with the single-cutaway guitars. You easily use all the fingers to hold the necks foundation and reach the last frets.
On adjustability, this one is very convenient since you can use the chrome (die-cast) tuners to regulate the strings. Further, it&rsquo;ll be easy to take out Talman TCY10&rsquo;s Ibanez Advantage bridge pins.
The double-cutaway design significantly improves the sound quality of this Talman TCY10. It makes the acoustic guitar more resonant but also reduces its bass.
Further, the spruce top plus mahogany sides and back will add bright or warm tones plus extra resonance to the guitar&rsquo;s sound - I consider it harmonic-sounding.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has an AEQ-2T built-in preamp (+ a tuner) for more adjustability and adjustable strings to prevent buzzing.</li>
<li>It is great for intermediate and beginning guitarists with small hands.</li>

Taylor Academy 12e offers resonant and bright trebles, thanks to Taylors spruce top, with great projection. I found the low action very great all over its ebony board.
It&rsquo;s greatly nuanced and detailed at low volume - which will work great for softer players. Its high-mids are pronounced and will create a great choral quality combined with its treble resonance.
On compatibility, this guitar will be great for stage performances (with
mics
) and private practice - excellent budget student guitar with simple playability.
It&rsquo;s not overly plastic-like or too brittle and that 12 oclock tone-setting proved great in solo fingerpicking. It produced a pretty, deep, and bright unplugged tone great for fingerpicking and open chords.
