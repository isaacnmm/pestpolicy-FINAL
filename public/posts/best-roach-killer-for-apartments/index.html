<li>So, what&rsquo;s the best way to get rid of roaches in an apartment? - including for American, Oriental, or German Roaches? Let&rsquo;s find out!
Well, you can try both
DIY roach control/)
or use the below effective ready-to-use roach killers.

Here&rsquo;s how to get rid of roaches in an apartment permanently - you should choose the cockroach killer depending on where the roaches in your house are hiding.
However, you might require more than just one kind of roach killer for a large apartment or a smaller house.</p>
<ul>
<li>While you might enjoy catching some roaches roaming around the house, it is no secret that there is a whole colony hiding at some location in your residence.</li>
<li>However, spraying insecticides will kill the roaches only on contact. Therefore, you should target the roaches in the areas they breed and live, making Bait Strips, Gels, and Combat baits highly effective in roach elimination.
After creating a nest and accessing enough food and water, the
roach population will increase rapidly
.
Therefore, you will only see the roaches when they are looking for food, and water, when they are migrating to a new nest when their population has grown too large, or they are escaping from insecticides.</li>
<li>Roaches taste the food and other substances using their feet. German roaches love light Karo Syrup, brown sugar, protein carbohydrates, and sucrose.
However, when you mix sodium borate or boric acid, food-grade
Diatomaceous Earth
baits; ensure to keep them out of reach of children and pets.
Maybe you&rsquo;re wondering,
should I use roach bombs
, or maybe
boric acid roach killer
?
Well, in this article, I&rsquo;ve reviewed some highly effective and
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/health/child.html">safe</a>
roach
killers that&rsquo;ll help your kill those roaches in the house.

What do professionals use to kill roaches? Harris Boric Acid contains 40% boric acid and 1% lure. It has a straw attached to the top, which makes it easy to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>For regular-sized kitchens, this powder can last for about a year.</li>
<li>Therefore, you can pour the acid in the places that would be in general challenging to reach, such as cracks and crevices.
The manufacturer notes that this formula will kill the roaches within 72 hours after the first contact - which is fast action time.
Despite having a higher price tag than other roach killers, this powder roach killer has a lure that will help you get rid of the roaches faster.</li>
<li>Check thefull review for Harris Boric Acid Roach Powder.
The roaches carry the killer powder on their bodies to the nest and help eliminate the whole roach population.
Pro Tip: But, good
waste disposal and food storage away from
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/">roach nests</a>
will be your best defense against roaches.

DuPont Advion cockroach gel bait contains (1) a
bait to attract roaches and (2
) indoxacarb, causing a secondary kill effect on roaches like
American and German cockroaches
.</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains carboxylate, which is super lethal to roaches but safe forpets.</li>
<li>So,plunge the gel from syringes onto basements, cabinets, baseboards, and kitchen countertops.
However, t
ake care if you&rsquo;re using the roach gel on planes and boats, including areas such as trashcans or baseboards.
Advion&rsquo;s active ingredients will change to new molecules inside the roaches bodies and thus wont harm other useful insects like ladybugs.</li>
<li>But Advion gel is great for outdoor and indoor applications, including holes or cracks.</li>
<li>The roach bait has a long residue effect.
Also, the syringe allows you to drop the roach bait into small crevices and cracks. Luckily, the secondary kill effect allows the roach bait to kill both the visible roaches and those in hiding.
The Good:</li>
<li>Long action range - 4 bait spots can attract roaches within 10 feet</li>
<li>Secondary kill effect (1 poisoned roach can infect over 35 others)</li>
<li>Safe for food handling areas and hospitals</li>
<li>Ease to apply compared to roach sprays
The Bad:</li>
<li>Can dry up when applied to surfaces with constant airflow</li>
<li>Labor intensive

Syngenta 383920-Advion, with 2.15% Imidacloprid as its active ingredient, is specially designed for roaches - the best roach killer indoors.
Imidacloprid will cause a secondary
kill effect
on the stubborn roaches in your apartment.
Equally, just like with the Advion gel, you&rsquo;ll require to plunge the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-bait/">roach bait</a>
(about a quarter inch in diameter) on crevices on the skirting boards, floors, and walls.
Imidacloprid will disrupt the roaches&rsquo; nervous system and equally block its neuronal pathways, leaving
fatal effects on bugs
. This &ldquo;best roach killer&rdquo; by Bayer CropScience leaves no lousy smell behind.
I recommend Syngenta 383920-Advion gel bait, too, for application in indoor and outdoor spaces.
However, you&rsquo;ll have to reapply the gel every three months and only apply it to areas away from kids and pets.
The Good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe for food-handling areas in addition to indoor and outdoor spaces.</li>
<li>Quick knockdown effect (24 hours)</li>
<li>Has eleven roach attractants
The Bad:</li>
<li>Only for German Roaches - Brown-Banded Cockroach</li>
</ul>

Place the roach baits in areas where roaches frequent, mix peanut butter and boric acid to make a trap cake for roaches, pour diatomaceous earth in areas where roaches will be moving, and
remove all water sources or clogs
in the apartment.

In addition to killing roaches in the apartment,
Ortho Home Defense will also help you eliminate those bugs
off your perimeter walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, this roach killer is also longer-lasting and fast-acting, which means that it kills on contact.</li>
<li>Therefore, if you need a roach solution that you can use for defense attacks, the Ortho Home Defense will be great for going around your house or apartment.
But, for a massive roach infestation, you can start with applying the formula inside and under refrigerators, sinks, cabinets, or baseboards.
Create a lethal roach barrier with this formula in areas such as garages, crawlspaces, door-frames, and windows.
However, this roach formula is poisonous, and thus, you must avoid spraying in areas frequented by pets or kids.
But use this roach formula in floor areas that wont be covered by carpets.
It has the non-staining capability; it&rsquo;s rain-resistant and has no odor in addition to being quick to
kill roaches and other insects such as spiders
.
Luckily, the barrier youve created will be active for a couple of months (about 12 months), eliminating even other insects such as spiders.</li>

Set the discrete Combat Roach
Bait Stations
in your house to act as a virtual shield.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ingredients are highly lethal to roaches and start killing roaches from day one for up to 12 months.
Do you experience regular infestation by small cockroaches? Well, shun the many insecticide cans and opt for a more discrete, effective, and compact solution  this
combat Max 12
.
This roach killer solution will be great if your home has a regular infestation of small cockroaches. With this trap, you wont have to keep many insecticides in the house.
Highlights: Ease of use, budget-friendly, highly effective for a long time, and discreet usage. But what is this trap really?
Its made up of black discs that a homeowner can place in concealed locations such as under the bed, behind your toilet, under the fridge, or in drawers or cabinets.</li>
<li>Every package comes with 18 bait stations that can last you even about a year controlling roaches in your house.
As noted in the bait station name, these roach killers will be active in
how to get rid of roaches in apartments naturally
for about 12 months.
Therefore, exterminators consider this roach bait to be one of the longest-lasting roach killing solutions available on the market today.
This bait station&rsquo;s key advantages are that its both durable and cheap, and thus consumers consider them as great value for their money.</li>
<li>I noted that after getting the bait stations to various house locations, I experienced a sudden reduction in the roach population.
The roaches will eat the Fipronil and transport them back to their nests, which will not kill just themselves but other roaches in the colony.
Since the roaches carry the insecticide to their nests, this bait station will help kill even the cockroaches you cant see and cant reach with spraying.
One of a few of the roaches will feed on the bait station and spread the love to their counterparts who were left at home in areas like under huge appliances or sinks.</li>
<li>Therefore, to kill a large roach population in your apartment, this Combat Max 12-Month is our top recommendation.
But,
<a href="https://www.entm.purdue.edu/ants/pubs/18.pdf">Indoxacarb</a>
and Imidacloprid are great ingredients as they&rsquo;ll trigger a secondary killing.

Roach Motel 61009 roach trap will be great for moderate roach infestations  killing both cockroaches and various crawling insects - among the best cockroach killer.</p>
<ul>
<li>This trap (unlike the Raid Ant &amp; Roach spray above) can kill even the roaches that youve not even seen.</li>
<li>Roaches will check-in and won&rsquo;t ever get the chance to check out.</li>
<li>Using a strong adhesive (syrupy bait), the Roach Motel 61009 trap will get hold of the roaches on contact  but has some slight odor.
Therefore, itll be a great alternative to using pesticides or poisons in roach killers. Itll be functional for roughly 2-4 months.
The adhesive has some attractants for the cockroaches. However, avoid keeping the trap in areas with dirt and dust as it might cover the syrupy bait, which will significantly reduce its effectiveness.</li>
<li>Some roach exterminators noted that this roach trap is highly effective for all roach types and sizes.</li>
<li>But, you might still require to employ contact roach killers such as those with Raid Ant &amp; Roach Spray.
I noted that this Roach Motel 61009 roach bait would work for kitchen areas (like cabinets or cupboards) and food areas because it has no poisons.
However, keep pets and children away from this bait as they might be unable to remove themselves from the sticky setup.
This Black Flag Roach Motel 61009 will clean a roach infestation and wont leave carcasses spread all over the house like the roach sprays.
As noted above, the roach trap employs a sticky and sweetly smelling formula that will attract the roaches to the created cardboard box.
