      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, can fleas <a href="/posts/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/">live</a> in carpets? For pet owners, fleas are an unfortunate part of having animals in the home, and from time to time, you may notice an infestation on your pet - maybe you&rsquo;ve tried

You may be surprised to learn that fleas can survive in a carpet for 2-3 months. That being said, without a host, they will be unable to breed, and here&rsquo;s why;</p>
<ul>
<li>A femaleflea must take her first feed from a hostto be able to lay her eggs.</li>
<li>Depending on how much blood the female flea can draw from her host will depend on how many eggs she can; you can expect an average female to lay up to 50 eggs in the hours.</li>
<li>The eggs are laid directly onto the host animal, and as they move around, these eggs will fall out of the fur and wherever the land will be where they develop. A carpet is a perfect location for this.</li>
<li>Once the eggs hatch and the larvae become fully developed, they attach themselves to a hand to repeat the cycle.</li>
<li>If you have treated your pet for fleas and have not tackled your carpet, you can be sure that the fleas will continue to inhabit your floor as well as making their way back onto your pet to breed once more.

      <description>Flea bites on humans</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flea bites on humans-bite-humans/)
from cat fleas, dog fleas, rat fleas cause irritation, itching, pain, and distress - they&rsquo;ll bite calves, ankles, lower legs, and feet.
But are flea bites on the human scalp common? Can these pests create a permanent residence in your hair? So,
<em>can fleas <a href="/posts/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/">live</a> in human hair?�</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In summary, when you sleep with a pet, fleas can temporarily hide in dense or full frizzy human hair (like Remy human hair). This is common when they can&rsquo;t find their preferred hosts like cats or dogs.�</em></li>
<li><em>While female fleas have lower fertility inside the human hair, human blood is not preferred by fleas. Thus you won&rsquo;t find flea eggs laid�or developing to other stages in the flea cycle.�</em>
<em>However, chigoe or human fleas (found in tropical areas) will prefer human hosts. Human fleas will burrow into the human skin, suck blood, and lay eggs in their numbers. See the flea spray.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Flea Spray&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-can-fleas-live-in-human-hair-7-quick-tips">Details: Can Fleas Live in Human Hair? (7 Quick Tips)</h2>
<p>Usually,
fleas won&rsquo;t stay or live in human
hair. But when humans sleep with pets (including cats and dogs), the fleas may jump off, at night, onto the human hair and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/">clothes</a>
.
The
fleas jump onto the human
scalp, where they&rsquo;ll feed on your blood - a good blood meal despite not being like the pet&rsquo;s blood meal.</p>
<p>Pet&rsquo;s blood meal allows the female
fleas to lay eggs
, and they hatch into the larvae, pupae, before progressing into adults, and thus exterminators concentrate on killing fleas on pets.
So, you can
control fleas in your yard
or apartment using vacuum cleaning, laundering, and thoroughly washing the pet bedding and clothes.
So, if the pet sleeps on your bed, the fleas may jump from the bed and land on the floor or carpets - try some of these
best flea carpet powder</p>
<ul>
<li>including targeting flea eggs and larvae.
Fleas will be dislodged from their pet hosts during pet-grooming with tools like
flea combs for cats
and
dog flea combs
. Also,
flea gets dislodged when the cats
or dogs groom themselves.
Fleas will mainly hop, hide, and
<a href="http://ijpa.tums.ac.ir/index.php/ijpa/article/view/61">bite humans (warm-blooded mammal) 2 to 7 times</a>
immediately; it emerges from the flea cocoon because they urgently need a blood meal and a host.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXX0W8HEJ7I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXX0W8HEJ7I</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-jump-into-the-human-hair">How Do Fleas Jump into the Human Hair?</h2>
<p>Fleas have long hind legs shaped from jumping - about 13 inches horizontally and
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10962162">7 inches vertically</a>
, which is the record coming only second to frog-hoppers.
However, for the fleas to jump onto your head and hence the human hair - you&rsquo;d require holding the cat or dog near the head or sleeping around where the
bugs hide
.
Therefore, despite that fleas can jump high both vertically (about 7 inches) and horizontally, they can&rsquo;t get to the head (and human hair) of a regular height human being from the ground.</p>
<p>The regular flea&rsquo;s
jump being 6 inches will only get the bug
to the ankle of an adult (and standing) human being. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll find most
flea bites are clustered
around the ankles.
Although fleas can
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24923246?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">crawl to good hiding places</a>
, they&rsquo;ll not usually climb up from the human ankles to the pubic hair or even the head hair.</p>
<p>Conclusion? Fleas will only get and hide in your human
hair if you sleep or lay around flea-infested pets
, including cats or dogs. This may also happen when you let flea-infested pets lay on your bed.</p>
<h2 id="signs-that-you-have-fleas-in-your-hair">Signs That You Have Fleas in Your Hair?</h2>
<h3 id="1-allergic-reactions">1. Allergic Reactions</h3>
<p>Some human beings are allergic (anaphylaxis) to flea-bites because their immune system tends to overreact, releasing excessive histamine. Signs include breathing issues, nausea, and swelling.
Humans may also experience hair loss, crusts (scabs), pustules (pus bumps), papules (bumps), and erythema (redness). The head may also become painful and sore due to flea bites -
<a href="https://www.banfield.com/pet-healthcare/additional-resources/article-library/parasites/fleas/flea-allergy-dermatitis-treatment-options">but the flea allergy is treatable</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="3red-bumps">3.�Red Bumps</h3>
<p>When fleas settle in your hair and bite your scalp, you may notice some red bumps. A unique identifying feature is that the red dots are clustered together.
Besides, these red-clustered bumps are the same ones you&rsquo;ll find around your feet and ankles - but will happen on the head or scalp if you sleep near flea-infested cats or dogs.</p>
<h3 id="3-intense-itchiness">3. Intense Itchiness</h3>
<p>Fleas
bites on your head could also cause
intense itching that also comes with major skin irritation. Severe cases would result in skin infection, skin reddening, and hair loss.</p>
<p>However, the head ditch&rsquo;s intensity from the
flea bites in the human
hair varies from one person to another. This may be related to how allergic humans are to flea bites.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-fleas-in-human-hair">How to Treat Fleas in Human Hair?</h2>
<h3 id="1-wash-with-shampoo">1. Wash with Shampoo</h3>
<p>Wash your hair with your regular
shampoo to dislodge the fleas
from your head. For this process, you&rsquo;ll need to rub the shampoo on the hair roots and scalp gently.
Equally important is that you should get a way of catching or holding the fleas that may jump off your head and hair as you&rsquo;re doing the shampoo washing.</p>
<h3 id="2-remove-flea-eggs">2. Remove Flea Eggs</h3>
<p>Sometimes fleas may even leave their eggs (
can be confused with dandruff
) on your hair, and thus you must eliminate them. The eggs will mainly be off-white or translucent in color and oval-shaped, looking like salt grains.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s also critical to flea treat the hair and the environment or yards around your house -
flea bombs
can help with a massive infestation.
I would recommend using warm water plus
baking soda</p>
<ul>
<li>that you&rsquo;ll spray on your hair.
Another remedy would be using
dish soap to kill the fleas for pets</li>
<li>particularly the lemon-scented models. However, avoid dish soap for cleaning your hair, head, or scalp. Rinse and dry the hair.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-flea-shampoo-with-tea-tree-oil">3. Flea Shampoo with Tea-Tree Oil</h3>
<p>Further, I recommend you wash your head and hair using
tea tree oil
plus your regular shampoo to eliminate the fleas. However, you must use the tea tree oil in its diluted type.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s challenging to get the correct and safe measurement for tea tree oil, and thus, it would be helpful to purchase the shampoo with tea tree oil that&rsquo;s ready to use.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rarely do
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-live/">fleas live</a>
in human hair but never say never. But when these fleas get into your hair - and
bite your skin
, they&rsquo;ll cause itching, red bumps, and allergic reactions.
However, human blood isn&rsquo;t the preferred blood meal for fleas, and thus the insects won&rsquo;t lay eggs on the human hair - this is attributed to lowered fertility levels caused by poor diet.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flea eggs and pupae can remain dormant for a prolonged lying under carpets, pet fur, or clothes lying on the floor. But, cats &amp; dogs - which are warm-blooded are their preferred hosts.
Also, fleas may host tapeworms and spread diseases like Lyme diseases. But
<em>, can fleas <a href="/posts/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/">live</a> on clothes?�</em>
<strong>The short answer is, No!</strong>
Cat
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/">fleas can&rsquo;t live on hair</a>
and clothes.
Fleas stay on humans
for only about�7.5 minutes as they suck�blood.
If you disrupt them while sucking blood, the fleas will hide in the seams of your clothes -
for better flea control
. But, sometimes, the
fleas can hide in clothes
for about 24 hours if they can&rsquo;t figure their way out - as they continue sucking human blood.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Fleas Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-can-fleas-live-on-clothes-fleas-and-flea-bites">Details: Can Fleas Live on Clothes? Fleas and Flea Bites</h2>
<h3 id="1-adult-fleas-live-on-cats--dogs-their-hosts">1. Adult Fleas live on Cats &amp; Dogs (their Hosts)</h3>
<p>Cat Fleas (being permanent ectoparasites)
live on their hosts
(mainly cats and dogs)-� and they&rsquo;ll not favor biting human beings. They mostly bite, reproduce, and live off the blood from the warm-blooded hosts without leaving.
But, you can get pupa and eggs hiding in clothing (like winter coats) that�you don&rsquo;t wash regularly.�Thus, you might want to
kill the fleas in a dryer
as the heat and detergents will help in the process.</p>
<h3 id="2-human-beings-arent-fleas-favored-hosts">2. Human beings arent fleas&rsquo; favored Hosts</h3>
<p>Flea bites in humans
are only�incidental compared to those on dogs and cats. Reasons?&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Human beings have no hair(cats and dogs have fur) required by fleas to hide from prying human eyes.</li>
<li>Also, typically,fleas will not reproduce from feeding humanblood.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fleas-bite-humans-beings-and-jump-off">3. Fleas Bite humans beings and Jump Off</h3>
<p>As noted above,
fleas will suck blood on human
beings and jump off to a more suitable�host.
Fleas won&rsquo;t bite
through your clothes.�Hence, the fleas will crawl to an exposed
skin area where they&rsquo;ll make�2-3 bites
before jumping off.
Any interruption will make the flea hide under your clothes for a short time - possibly for a maximum of 24 hours. Fleas won&rsquo;t bite through your clothes. Therefore, if they&rsquo;re trapped in your clothes,
fleas will continue biting and feeding
on the exposed skin.</p>
<h2 id="flea-larvae-wont-live-in-clothes">Flea Larvae Won&rsquo;t Live in Clothes.</h2>
<p>Flea larvae
won&rsquo;t live on cats or dogs. Still, they will mainly be in the carpets ( digging deep into carpet fibers), protected and dark environments like the porches,� underneath decks, attics, and crawl spaces.
Therefore, fleas will largely escape to areas that have a w amount of lighting. For example, the fleas can hide under clothes that are left lying on the floor or hide in seams of clothes/ fabrics to escape being killed by humans or by insecticides such as sprays and
flea bombs
.</p>
<h3 id="1fleas-larvae-hatch-on-their-hosts">1.�Fleas larvae hatch on their hosts</h3>
<p>Flea larvae will hatch from their fleas eggs
while still on their hosts, such as dogs and cats. However, flea larvae don&rsquo;t live on the hosts but will fall off to the environment
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-carpets/">in areas such as carpet</a>
fibers when the cat or dog is walking around your house.
The
fleas&rsquo; eggs
will behave like any round ball that will roll off any surface. Therefore, when the cat or dog rises and shales its body, the
flea eggs
will fall off to the surrounding surfaces in their environment.
Further, when the pet is in its sleeping area, the
flea eggs
will fall off to the bedding, where they&rsquo;ll hatch into larvae and grow.</p>
<h3 id="2larvae-exhibitnegative-phototaxic">2.�Larvae exhibit�negative phototaxic</h3>
<p>Flea larvae will hatch within 2-7 days after the females adult fleas lay the eggs. However, the larvae will tend to hide from any bright light because they have negative phototaxic.
Therefore, the flea larvae will hide deep inside carpet fibers, crevices, and cracks, which implies that they won&rsquo;t favor living in clothes. Use
flea carpet powder
. Also, the larvae will eat
flea dirt
and organic debris.
Flea dirt
is the dried blood excreted by adult fleas after they suck blood from various hosts such as dogs and cats. Also, larvae practice cannibalism, where they&rsquo;ll eat the sickly or injured fleas.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>So, on whether�can no-see-ums <a href="/posts/how-long-do-fleas-live-on-humans/">live</a> in my hair; NO, the no-see-ums or biting midges won&rsquo;t live in hair but may hide temporarily or get tangled shortly.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs will be<a href="https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/insects/bitingmidge.html">attracted by the CO2</a>released by animals and humans when exhaling. The biting midges will clearly lay their eggs and occupy moist soil.
No See Ums mainly in areas with high humidity and will populate a given location rapidly. They will live mainly around bogs, marshes, streams, and ponds.
For starters; no see ums are also known, by different people and regions, as punky, punkie, citrus, sand gnats,
sandflea
, or sandfly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-no-see-ums-live-in-my-hair">Can No-See-Ums Live in My Hair?</h2>
<p>When I was in Hawaii on vacation, no-see-ums tangled into my daughter&rsquo;s hair. We had to change her hairstyle into a gelled and short one as advised that it&rsquo;s best to avoid these bugs.
Therefore, walking through or sleeping in some wooded areas may allow the no-see-ums to jump onto your hair as their pets will be hiding in saturated or decomposing logs, algae, and mosses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pests will be attracted to or by carbon dioxide or light and thus lighting torches through the wood may make you vulnerable to gnats within your clothes and hair.</li>
<li>No see ums may be described as<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-no-see-ums-live-in-my-hair/">some tiny biting midges</a>looking like flies as they&rsquo;ll bite humans to leave an itchy feeling.
Despite that these bugs (insects) aren&rsquo;t invisible, they are small almost equal to the size of lint or some grain of dirt.</li>
<li>The insects go through the eggs, next larvae, then pupae, and finally adult stages - requiring about 2 to 6 weeks to attain full maturity.
Further, ensure to protect your pets including from the no see ums by spraying them with some eucalyptus or tea tree oil, especially on their
flea collar
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-no-see-ums-like-on-my-hair">What are the No See Ums Like on My Hair?</h2>
<p>On how to recognize these no see ums on my hair; well, these bugs are tiny measuring about 1 to 3 mm in their length.
On color, these bugs look grayish to reddish especially when they&rsquo;ve fed on blood. Therefore, if your hair is white or gray, you might find it challenging to see the pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the no see um species will have dark-patterns wings making them look grayish.
The mouthparts of these pests have some sheath and 4 cutting blades that&rsquo;ll help them dig into your skin or scalp - which could inflict massive pain.</li>
<li>So, ultimately, you may see some small red spots on your skin or scalp and hair when the pest has sucked blood from your body.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-no-see-ums-need-human-blood-to-reproduce">Will No See Ums need human Blood to Reproduce?</h2>
<p>On the feeding and reproduction habits of the biting midgets, the pest mainly feeds on nectar and plant sap.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the female no see ums require proteins to achieve effective eggs production and will thus they&rsquo;ll suck blood from vertebrates and small insects.
But the male no see ums won&rsquo;t be attracted to those vertebrates mainly so since their mouthparts arent adapted for biting either humans or other animals.
However, the female biting midges such as the Culicoides will also suck blood from amphibians, reptiles, birds, and also mammals. They&rsquo;re being attracted to the co2 released by the animals exhaling.</li>
<li>Further, some no see ums species like the Ceratopogonidae are considered predators and will thus capture and kill insect larvae, small worms, and protozoa.
Other no see um species will feed on organic matter, algae, fungi, and bacteria. The Leptoconops kertszi may disperse and bite humans up to 10 miles from the place that larvae developed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-bites-from-no-see-ums-on-the-head-and-skin">How to Treat Bites from No See Ums on the Head and Skin?</h2>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve noticed some no see ums on your hair, head, or skin, it&rsquo;s important to know how to deal with bug bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>As noted above, the male no see ums mainly feed on plant matter and nectar while the females will need come proteins to effectively lay eggs.
The skin bites will leave some sizable welt on the human scalp or skin - these welts may measure around 1 inch.
Treatment of these bites from no see ums will require that you wash the welt or wounds using some warm water &amp; soap.</li>
<li>The treatment will help reduce the pain and irritation while also averting further skin infection on your skin or head.
However, if the irritation continues further after you&rsquo;ve washed effectively, I recommend you apply some analgesic cream or cortisone. Further, talk to an expert doctor to handle the bites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-control-these-no-see-ums">How to Control these No See Ums?</h2>
<p>Controlling no see ums and their larvae too is considered a challenging task but the C. sonorensis species may prove easier to take out.
You can control the development of no see ums larvae by changing the bank form of those waste-water ponds, reducing leakage of troughs, and periodically changing the level of water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using insecticides to control no see ums may give you temporary success� - such as when you use the chemicals in the evenings, especially in the Gulf Coast or Atlantic Coast.
I would, however, recommend installing door and window screens that have small mesh sizes to control the no see ums in your spaces and hence prevent them from tangling in your hair.
In addition, if you&rsquo;ll be in the woods or camping, I approve the use of tents that are fitted with durable midge screens - but these must also have small-sized mesh screens.</li>
<li>But as an alternative, you may use clothes prayed with permethrin, DEET (diethytoluamide) to achieve temporary protection from the no see ums.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No see ums won&rsquo;t bite through your clothing or fabric like socks and thus having such covers on your hair or skin will afford extra protection from these pests.
Further, no see ums will not live in your hair but they hide there temporarily especially when you walk through some damp or forested area.
Using
citronella may help you
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-no-see-ums-repellent/">repel those no see ums</a>
from your hair and skin - but using DIY sprays such as eucalyptus or tea tree oil will be more effective - plus a
nalgesic cream or cortisone.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas are tiny, pesky insects that can cause discomfort to both pets and humans. While fleas are commonly associated with pets like dogs and cats, they can also infest human hosts. Understanding how long fleas can <a href="/posts/can-fleas-live-in-carpets/">live</a> on humans is important for preventing bites and controlling infestations. Lets explore the lifespan of fleas on humans and how you can deal with them effectively.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-do-fleas-live-on-humans">How Long Do Fleas Live on Humans?</h2>
<p>Fleas do not typically live on humans for long periods of time. While they may bite humans to feed on blood, they prefer to stay on the fur of animals, particularly pets. However, fleas can still be a nuisance for humans, and understanding their behavior can help in managing an infestation.</p>
<h3 id="the-flea-life-cycle">The Flea Life Cycle</h3>
<p>To better understand how long fleas live on humans, its important to first understand their life cycle. The flea life cycle consists of four stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Egg:**Fleas lay eggs on their hosts, and these eggs fall off into the environment.</li>
<li>**Larva:**The eggs hatch into larvae that feed on organic matter, including flea feces, which contain undigested blood.</li>
<li>**Pupa:**After feeding, larvae turn into pupae, where they will remain until they mature into adult fleas.</li>
<li>**Adult:**Adult fleas are the ones that feed on blood and lay eggs, continuing the cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-long-fleas-live-on-humans">How Long Fleas Live on Humans</h3>
<p>Adult fleas generally do not stay on humans for an extended period. When a flea jumps onto a human, it may stay for a short time to feed. Typically, fleas remain on humans for
<strong>a few hours to a few days</strong>
at most, depending on whether they can find a suitable environment to continue feeding. They prefer to stay on animals where they can access fur, which provides protection and warmth.
Fleas will often leave a human host once they have finished feeding. If they cannot find a pet or animal to host them, they will jump off and search for a more suitable environment.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-remove-fleas-from-humans">How to Remove Fleas from Humans</h3>
<p>If you suspect that fleas have bitten you or are infesting your body, its important to act quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Shower Immediately:**Washing with soap and water will help remove fleas from your skin.</li>
<li>**Use Flea Treatment:**Topical flea treatments or flea repellents can be applied to prevent further bites.</li>
<li>**Clean Your Environment:**Fleas may have laid eggs in your living space. Wash your bedding, clothes, and vacuum frequently to eliminate flea eggs and larvae.</li>
<li>**Check Your Pets:**If you have pets, ensure they are treated with flea prevention treatments, as they are the main source of the infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-fleas-breed-on-humans">Do Fleas Breed on Humans?</h3>
<p>No, fleas do not breed on humans. They may bite and feed, but they lay their eggs on the ground or on animal hosts. Fleas are not capable of reproducing on human skin or in human hair, and the adult fleas you encounter will eventually leave if no suitable host is available.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-flea-infestations-on-humans">Preventing Flea Infestations on Humans</h3>
<p>Preventing fleas from living on humans requires addressing the source of the infestation. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Regularly Treat Pets:**Use flea treatments or preventive medications on your pets to prevent fleas from infesting them and transferring to humans.</li>
<li>**Maintain Clean Living Spaces:**Clean your home regularly, especially areas where your pets spend a lot of time, such as their bedding or favorite lounging spots.</li>
<li>**Protective Clothing:**If you are around areas with a flea infestation, wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants can help keep fleas away from your skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fleas are not likely to live on humans for extended periods, but their bites can be annoying and uncomfortable. They prefer animal hosts but will jump onto humans to feed when necessary. By maintaining a clean environment, treating your pets, and using flea repellents, you can minimize the risk of flea infestations on humans. If you notice signs of flea bites or an infestation, take immediate action to eliminate the fleas and prevent further discomfort.</p>

      <description>Gnats are restless two-winged flies commonly found in residential and commercial establishments.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gnats are restless two-winged flies commonly found in residential and commercial establishments.</p>
<p>How long do gnats live?
<strong>The simple answer is: The average lifespan of Gnats is 7-21 days. This will depend on several factors like food sources, temperature, habitat, and available moisture.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="different-gnat-species---how-long-do-gnats-live">Different <a href="/posts/best-gnat-repellent/">Gnat</a> species - How Long Do Gnats <a href="/posts/best-streaming-devices-for-live-tv/">Live</a>?</h2>
<p>Examples of flies that fit the above description include fungus gnats, fruit flies, black flies, phorid flies, eye gnats, and biting midges. Read on and learn more!</p>
<h3 id="1-fruit-flies">1. Fruit flies</h3>
<p>A fruit fly can live for 20-25 days and takes up to three weeks to complete the life cycle. This will depend on the environment and the available food. A female fruit fly is ready to mate 2 days after becoming an adult. Once the life cycle is complete, the new adults are ready to mate again after three days to begin a new generation.</p>
<h3 id="2-fungus-gnats">2. Fungus gnats</h3>
<p>These flies live in watered plants and have a lifespan of 14-17 days. The larvae stage feed on plants roots. About 3 days after the female lays eggs, they hatch and the larva emerges.</p>
<h3 id="3-eye-gnats">3. Eye gnats</h3>
<p>These gnats like areas with organic matter and well-drained soils. They feed on perspiration, fluids associated with the eyes, and open wounds. Eye gnats can live for 11 days to three weeks.</p>
<h3 id="4-black-flies">4. Black flies</h3>
<p>These flies are also known as Turkey or buffalo gnats. They bite livestock, wildlife, and humans. The female lays up to 450 eggs on running water. During the larvae stage, black flies feed on small organisms in the water. Finally, the pupae stage takes 2-6 days. When the flies mature, they will feed on blood and nectar. The whole life cycle can take up to 4 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="4-biting-midges">4. Biting midges</h3>
<p>Mature midges can live for 3-4 weeks. Unlike the other species, the females lay 25-100 eggs. The larvae stage takes two weeks while the pupa stage takes 2-3 days.</p>
<h3 id="5-phorid-flies">5. Phorid flies</h3>
<p>These flies are common in sewer lines and leaky pipes. The larvae feed on the organic matter found in drains. Furthermore, the female lays up to 500 eggs in a lifetime. And depending on the habitat, an adult can live for 11-22 days.</p>
<h2 id="factors-that-contribute-to-the-longevity-of-gnats">Factors that contribute to the longevity of gnats</h2>
<p>Gnats thrive in well-watered areas like residential potted plants and plants within commercial malls. However, these flies have to go through a complete metamorphosis - egg, larva, pupae, and adult.</p>
<p>Adults dont eat unless they want to lay eggs. Since the most active stage of gnats is larva, they must have enough food or they will die. Its worth mentioning that dragonflies are their main predator. Lets look at the factors that contribute to the longevity of gnats.</p>
<h3 id="1-moisture">1. Moisture</h3>
<p>Gnats live in an environment with sufficient amount of water and humidity. Such places include garbage cans, over-watered plants, under the sink, leaky pipes, around window vents, etc. Youll rarely find them in moist areas.</p>
<h3 id="2-food-source">2. Food source</h3>
<p>If youre worried why gnats are always inside your house, you should check for organic materials. These flies like to feed on mold, moss, compost, and fungus. You can spot them in your potting soil where they feed on decaying leaves and roots.</p>
<h3 id="can-cold-temperatures-kill-gnats">Can cold temperatures kill gnats?</h3>
<p>A cold environment wont
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-gnats/">kill gnats</a>
but will stop them from breeding. Below 60 degrees F, these flies experience a sharp decline in lifespan. Generally, the ideal temperature for a healthy life cycle is 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h2 id="ways-to-get-rid-of-gnats-from-your-home">Ways to get rid of gnats from your home</h2>
<p>Before you take any remedial measures, you should identify the gnats. These are tiny flies with long legs and thin wings. The eggs are hardly visible while the larvae are legless and about -inch long. Here are the best methods to get rid of gnats.</p>
<h3 id="1-kill-the-larvae-and-adults">1. Kill the larvae and adults</h3>
<p>Dispose of infested fruits/vegetables and hang sticky fly traps. Alternatively, you can use apple cider vinegar as a homemade remedy. Just put undiluted ACV in a jar and wait for the gnats to come in.</p>
<p>When they crawl into the jar, close it and dump after 2-3 days. Repeat the process until you cannot see any more gnats.</p>
<h3 id="2-eliminate-the-potential-breeding-ground">2. Eliminate the potential breeding ground</h3>
<p>Since gnats love watery indoor plants, you should remove the decayed parts. For phorid flies, fix the leaky pipes and fill the crevices where water can get trapped.</p>
<p>Dont forget to take the trash out as often as possible. Finally, after you water the plants dont forget to drain the excess water from the pot.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Gnats have a short life of 7-21 days depending on the species. While their longevity is not very impressive, they reproduce very fast.</p>
<p>A female can lay up to 450 eggs which take 4-30 days to hatch. This means that for every fly that dies, there will be hundreds waiting to replace it.</p>

<h2 id="how-long-do-squirrels-live"><strong>How Long Do Squirrels Live?</strong></h2>
<p>The life span of a <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-attack-humans/">squirrel</a> is dependent on its species and the predisposing factors.�For instance, squirrels in captivity live longer than those that live in the wild. The life span of the squirrels in the wild is shorter than those that live in captivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squirrels have predators like hawks, dogs among other carnivores in the wild. They barely survive even two years of their life. In case this happens, most of these squirrels can live between 6-12 years on average.</li>
<li>Squirrels can be categorized into 3 species which include flying squirrels, ground and tree squirrels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-ground-squirrels-">**1. Ground squirrels **</h3>
<p>Ground squirrels&rsquo;�life span varies from 2-4 years. Female squirrels live longer with a life span of 4 years while male squirrels live up to 2 years. This is according to the research carried out on California ground squirrels.</p>
<h3 id="2-american-red-squirrel-">**2. American red squirrel **</h3>
<p>The average life span of an American red squirrel is 5 years. Though this is not the case with most squirrels and 25% will live beyond one year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike ground squirrels, male red squirrels live longer than female ones.</li>
<li>It takes about 2-4 years for this squirrel to attain its maturity. But, in captivity, their life span can go up to 8 years.
The oldest living red squirrel was recorded to be 10 years.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-fox-squirrels-">**3. Fox squirrels **</h3>
<p>They are popularly known as eastern fox squirrels. They are mostly found in North America and are known for their distinct color of rich and chest brown.</p>
<ul>
<li>They have a lifespan of 18 years while living as wild squirrels. Females have a longer lifespan than males. A female can live up to 13 years of age while a male can live up to 8 years of age.</li>
<li>However, most of these squirrels will barely live up to maturity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-southern-flying-squirrel-">**4. Southern flying squirrel **</h3>
<p>These are the only flying squirrels in North America. They have an average life span of 3-5 years.
Although the oldest recorded squirrel was 19 years, most flying squirrels will live up to 10 years when in confinement.</p>
<h3 id="5-black-squirrels-">**5. Black Squirrels **</h3>
<p>Black squirrels and the eastern grey squirrels belong to the same species with the only difference being the amount of melanin. The black species has more melanin than the fox grey species.
If in the wild, this species can live up to 6 years but this can increase up to 18 years when in captivity.

<h3 id="6-eastern-grey-squirrels-">**6. Eastern Grey Squirrels **</h3>
<p>This is a common squirrel in the Midwest. They have a lifespan of 12-24 years. The oldest recorded grey squirrel was 20 years.</p>
<h2 id="factors-that-affect-the-life-span-of-squirrels-">**Factors That Affect the Life Span of Squirrels **</h2>
<p>If you are keeping a squirrel as a pet, there are different factors that can lower or raise the life span of any squirrel. Below is an outline.</p>
<h3 id="1-pest-and-diseases-">**�1. Pest and diseases **</h3>
<p>Squirrels like any other animals are prone to pests and diseases which if not treated, can lead to death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squirrels are very much prone to viral diseases and the most common viral disease is squirrel pox. It is transmitted by insect bites which later turn into a tumor in some squirrels. In others, this virus can lead to skin ulcers, lesions, and scabs.</li>
<li>There are some other squirrels like the European red squirrel who are so vulnerable that they can even die from the infection. However, there are also those squirrels like the grey squirrel that are resistant to the virus.
The most common pests are ticks and
fleas
. There are also parasites that you are likely to see in squirrels-such are flesh fly that lays its larvae on the ground squirrel. These larvae penetrate the squirrels skin and continue feeding on the body tissues of the squirrel.</li>
<li>In this case, the squirrel can only survive for 5-6 days if not treated.</li>
<li>Other parasites are single-celled coccidia which is found in the digestive system. Though its not fatal, it affects can lead to health deterioration of the squirrel.
Also, they can be attacked by nematodes and flatworms.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-predators-">**2. Predators **</h3>
<p>In the food chain, squirrels are prey to many animals and carnivorous birds. The most common predators are hawks and owls. Their preference for squirrels makes them the number one predators.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other predators include foxes, weasels, skunks, rattle, and black snakes. Unlike other predators, snakes prefer feeding on the young squirrels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-squirrels-in-town-">**3. Squirrels in town **</h3>
<p>Though there are not many predators in the urban areas, squirrels are exposed to all sorts of dangers including being hit by cars, attack by dogs among others.</p>
<ul>
<li>The attacks on the squirrels are less but only skillful and the well-camouflaged squirrels can survive in the urban set-up.
The grey squirrels do very well in the adapted urban set-up as compared to other types of squirrels due to their color.

</ul>
<h3 id="4-loss-of-eyesight-">**4. Loss of eyesight **</h3>
<p>When squirrels become older, they develop cataracts and have a high likelihood of losing vision.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is very dangerous because most of them depend on that to easily spot their predators and run away from danger. Poor eyesight makes them a soft target and an easy way for them to die.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-loss-of-teeth-">**5. Loss of teeth **</h3>
<p>Squirrels are rodents who greatly use their incisors in gnawing and eat. These incisors are sharp and continually grows throughout a squirrels life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anytime the scissor is broken, damaged, or lost this means inability by the squirrel to feed which can lead to death through starvation.</li>
<li>Some squirrels may also suffer a condition called malocclusion where it has misaligned incisors-these affects their feeding in a great way. The good thing is that this condition can be corrected and the squirrels lead a normal life.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>How long do squirrels live? This will totally depend on the predisposing factors and also the species of the squirrel.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is also good to note that, most squirrels in captivity live longer than those in the wild. Most probably, a lot of squirrels have a longer life span if they survive the first and the second year of their life.
Besides all these factors that lead to a shorter lifespan, it is good to be nice to the squirrels and other animals in your garden. If you have spotted squirrels frequently in your garden, maybe you need to consider doing a feeding area for them.</li>

<h2 id="details-how-long-do-ticks-live-on-humans">Details: How Long Do Ticks Live on Humans?</h2>
<p>Ticks will bite humans to suck their blood but will also cause irritation and leave them with red skin around the bite area.
Unfortunately, ticks can also transmit different diseases to dogs and also to humans.
But will the ticks fall off from humans on their own?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, yes, if the tick remains undisturbed (either mechanically or through chemicals), it will only fall off from your skin (within a few days to weeks) once it is fed with blood to its fill.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-ticks-feeding-process">1. Tick&rsquo;s Feeding Process</h3>
<p>Unlike stinging insects like flies and mosquitoes, ticks will bite and remain attached to the human skin for anywhere between hours to weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, ticks will mainly stay in one place for a long time as they suck their hosts&rsquo; (either humans or animals) blood.
Ticks are amazing crawlers and climbers but they can&rsquo;t jump.
So, the pest (ticks) will wait for a suitable host on some tall grass or plant from where they will crawl or climb onto the human being or animal.</li>
<li>Once the tick lands on the animal or human being, it will get an inconspicuous location on the animal&rsquo;s body where it will settle and suck blood.
In humans, ticks will mainly bite and suck blood around an area with a crevice such as a groin or the underarm.
In animals such as dogs, ticks will target and invade locations such as between toes and the ears.
On the tick&rsquo;s feeding mechanism, these organisms will bite their host (animal or human being) and insert a &rsquo;tube&rsquo; that they will use to suck blood.
Additionally, there are tick species that will generate a &lsquo;glue&rsquo; (sticky liquid) that attaches them to their host during the feeding process.</li>
<li>Other tick species have tiny hooks to enable them to remain attached to their hosts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-feeding-to-its-fill">2. Feeding to its Fill</h3>
<p>Ticks suck blood from the host at a slow rate and so these pests can remain in one place for hours up to about 3 weeks.
During the feeding process, the ticks will suck blood from human beings but they also secrete their saliva and inject it into your bloodstream.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, if the tick has an infection or disease, it will inject it into your bloodstream together with the saliva causing an illness in the host
So, how long the tick will remain on its host will depend on its species and life stage. For example, tick nymphs tend to fall off from humans in a short time compared to adult ticks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-the-ticks-die-once-they-bite-me">Will the Ticks Die Once they Bite Me?</h2>
<p>Ticks can live for 1+ years after taking a blood meal from their hosts.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the tick will eventually die if you can&rsquo;t get another blood meal from its last time of feeding.
However, it&rsquo;s incorrect to state that the tick will die once it falls off from the human body - it definitely has a long grace period to survive and I wait for another suitable host.</li>
<li>Most tick species will bite humans and attach themselves there, sucking blood.</li>
<li>They will also inject their saliva into the human bloodstream - this saliva may be carrying disease-causing organisms.
Some people say that disease transmission from ticks to humans mainly happens at the end of the feeding period when the animal gets full.

<h2 id="how-to-find-and-remove-ticks-from-humans">How to find and remove ticks from humans</h2>
<p>Detecting ticks can be a challenging task for most hosts (including humans and dogs) - and this is not just because the kids have small bodies.
The reason is that, just like fleas and bed bugs, ticks inject an anesthetic into the host&rsquo;s body and thus they&rsquo;re able to feed for longer without being detected or felt.</p>
<ul>
<li>The anesthetic allows the host not to feel pain and thus the tick remains undetected.
If the tick remains for a longer time on the human being, there is a likelihood of it transmitting diseases such as Lyme.
For example, deer ticks are known to start transmitting their infections and diseases to their hosts after around 36 hours of sucking blood.
Once you find the tick that is stuck in your body, grab and remove the pest using tweezers and ensure to get very close to the skin.</li>
<li>Next, drop the tick into some rubbing alcohol to exterminate these pests.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-signs-of-tick-bites-on-humans">What are the signs of tick bites on humans?</h2>
<p>A tick bite may transmit diseases to pets and humans or trigger allergic reactions - 10 diseases may turn out deadly or dangerous.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the outdoor spaces, ticks will live in leaf piles, shrubs, trees, and grass.
Ticks will be adapted to pets and humans - they can jump between these two easily.
The arachnids are small (eight-legged) and blood-sucking pests have colors ranging from black, reddish-brown, or brown.
(CDC)
notes that ticks attack the body of pets and humans, especially in locations that are moist and warm such as the hair, groin, and armpits.
Most tick bites tend to generate more sentences but for people that are allergic, you can experience some of these signs;</li>
<li>breathlessness when the tick allergy is severe</li>
<li>blisters</li>
<li>burning sensation</li>
<li>Rashes</li>
<li>Swelling and pain

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in this article, my aim was to outline (in detail) how long a tick will remain on your skin before falling off.
Yes, ticks will fall off from the human body once it&rsquo;s done sucking blood (feeding to their fill). Ticks feed for about 3 to 4 days but this time may increase up to 3 weeks when the insects are engorged.
So, it will be better if you notice (and remove) the tick from your body earlier to reduce the chances of it injecting diseases (such as Lyme disease) and infections into your body through its saliva.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ve discussed how to trap raccoons. Check these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/raccoon-facts/">racoon facts</a>
.</p>
<p>Caution: But check with the local authorities if raccoon trapping is legal or how to do it humanely.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-trap-raccoons">How to Trap Raccoons</h2>
<h3 id="step-1select-a-raccoon-trap">**Step 1:�**Select a Raccoon Trap</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.esf.edu/aec/adks/mammals/raccoon.htm">Raccoons</a>
are adaptive wild animals. They host pests like roundworms and spread rabies, and will forage in your garbage bins. Killing or hunting raccoons is illegal in some states.</p>
<p>You can trap and then relocate them. Raccoon traps are a humane way to remove these fur-bearing wild animals.</p>
<p>Exterminators recommend getting raccoon traps that are either extra-large or large-sizes (with its length measuring roughly 32 to 42 inches).</p>
<p>Raccoon traps will come with 1 or 2 doors  from which youll select the one that serves your specific purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-Door Trap Model</strong>: This model is a favorite among raccoon exterminators and provides superior level of protection on the trap bait. Allows faster and simple enter/ trapping of the raccoons and other wild animals.</li>
<li><strong>Two-door Trap Model</strong>: Allows double entry allowance and thus provides improved raccoon catch rate. Also, since its a see-through traps, the raccoons will be calmed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-decide-on-the-trap-placement-location">Step 2: Decide on the Trap Placement Location</h3>
<p>First, set up the trap around areas that you&rsquo;ve seen raccoons frequent or where there is evidence of their damage. Place the raccoon trap on a flat surface.</p>
<p>I had tried trapping some raccoons (around a creek that had animals tracks, near barns/ houses) for about a month but they kept eloping me.�However, raccoons will generally love location such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mulch beds</li>
<li>Attics</li>
<li>Woodpiles</li>
<li>Hollow Trees</li>
<li>Porches</li>
<li>Along walls</li>
<li>Below structures</li>
<li>Fence lines</li>
<li>Sheds

<h3 id="step-3-bait-the-racoon-trap">Step 3: Bait The Racoon Trap</h3>
<p>I noted great success with using trap baits like penut butter, marshmellows, sardines, cat food, fish oil spray, and vanilla. Ensure you put wool at the bottom as it&rsquo;ll hold the scent of the liquid for longer.</p>
<p>Raccoons, like most wild animals, definitely love sweet snacks and food such as watermelon and marshmallows.</p>
<p>However, keenly place the bait in the right position of your raccoon trap. This should be in a location thatll allow the raccoon to fully enter the trap.</p>
<p>Notably, some nasty wild animals like raccoons may knock over the trap as they target to steal your hard sourced bait. Further, place a brick or weight on the trap  this will secure the trap is safe.</p>

<h3 id="step-4finally-set-the-raccoon-trap">Step 4:�Finally, Set the Raccoon Trap</h3>
<p>Now, its now that you keenly set the traps door or doors in the raccoon traps ready to trap the nasty wild rodents. Do this keenly on a flat or even surface.</p>
<p>Check the trap usage instruction in the manual for different requirements. After setting the trap, now, its time to test-drive the trigger-and-close systems through pressing down the provided trigger plate.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re setting the trap in hard surfaces such as concrete, first lay down a protective surface like plywood to protect the animal&rsquo;s paws when attempting to dig its way out of the tar.</p>

<h3 id="1-open-trap-doors-only-at-night-raccoons-are-nocturnals"><strong>1. Open Trap Doors only at Night (Raccoons are Nocturnals)</strong></h3>
<p>Raccoons are very cunning wild animals (rodents for that matter). Therefore, recent
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74116.html">research</a>
shows that the back of the raccoon trap must be covered using a half-inch wire mesh to ensure that the raccoon wont steal the bait from outside the trap.</p>
<p>Definitely, the rodents will attempt to get the bait via the trap bars. However, because raccoons are nocturnal, you should only open the traps during the night. This&rsquo;ll prevent the trap catching animals such as cats or rats.</p>
<h3 id="2place-bait-trap-leading-to-trap-door">**2.�**Place Bait Trap leading to Trap Door</h3>
<p>Next, place the bait in a manner that itll leave a trail that leads to your raccoon trap. For example, one piece of the raccoon bait must be positioned around the raccoon trail.</p>
<p>Also, you can place it around places food was located. This will trap the raccoon as it attempts to get back to where it ate the food last time.� But first, ensure you remove the food.</p>
<h2 id="3-practices-for-humana-raccoon-trapping">3. Practices for Humana Raccoon Trapping</h2>
<p>For human treatment of the Raccoons, you
<a href="http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/nuisance/trapping.html">should</a>
put 1-2 tennis balls in the raccoon traps and thus allow the large rodents to release its frustration and energy. Further, for the smaller animal, you can offer some piece of wood.</p>

<h3 id="4-put-on-gloves">4. Put on Gloves</h3>
<p>Notably, since raccoons have some sensitive nose, youll need to put on some gloves when youre setting up the rodent trap.�Further, was the new raccoon traps using vinegar and water as this will eliminate animals oils.</p>
<p>Further, was the new racoon traps using vinegar and water as this will eliminate animals oils. Next, create a mist around the raccoon trap using a spray of aromatic vegetation (or fir needles) and water  this will help conceal the smell of human beings.</p>
<h3 id="5-fix-the-racoon-cage-securely">5. Fix the Racoon Cage Securely</h3>
<p>Lastly, by any possible way, ensure you fix the raccoon cage securely. But why? Well, raccoons are relatively heavy  weighting anything from 5-25 kg.</p>
<p>Therefore, with some simple manoeuvres, the wild animals can flip the cage and flee. Further, fixing the cage properly avoid cases where the raccoon would tilt the cage and easily pick the bait.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the classic cut Christmas tree holds a special place in many hearts, a growing number of people are opting for a more sustainable and ultimately rewarding holiday tradition: the <a href="/posts/best-streaming-devices-for-live-tv/">live</a> Christmas tree. Unlike their cut counterparts, a live tree, typically sold with its root ball intact (balled and burlapped), can bring festive cheer indoors for a short period and then be planted outdoors to continue growing, providing beauty and environmental benefits for years to come.</p>
<p>Choosing a live tree offers a unique connection to nature and a powerful lesson in sustainability. However, <a href="/posts/the-complete-guide-to-caring-for-a-cobalt-blue-tarantula/">caring</a> for a live tree is distinctly different from caring for a cut tree. It requires careful consideration of the tree&rsquo;s needs before, during, and after its time indoors, ensuring its survival and successful transplantation. This guide will walk you through the essential steps for selecting a healthy live Christmas tree, caring for it indoors, and successfully planting it in your yard, turning a temporary holiday decoration into a lasting green legacy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="choosing-a-live-tree">Choosing a Live Tree</h2>
<p>Selecting the right live tree is the first critical step to ensure its survival and your enjoyment.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose the Right Species for Your Climate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Native or Well-Adapted Species:</strong> This is the most crucial factor for long-term survival. Select a tree species that is native to your region or known to thrive in your specific climate zone and soil conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Common Live Christmas Tree Species in the US (Temperate Climates):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colorado Blue Spruce (<em>Picea pungens</em>):</strong> Known for its striking blue-green needles, pyramidal shape, and good cold hardiness.</li>
<li><strong>White Pine (<em>Pinus strobus</em>):</strong> Soft needles, good form, and relatively fast growth.</li>
<li><strong>Scotch Pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>):</strong> Hardy, dense, and holds its needles well.</li>
<li><strong>Fraser Fir (<em>Abies fraseri</em>):</strong> Excellent needle retention, but can be more sensitive to transplant shock in certain regions.</li>
<li><strong>Norway Spruce (<em>Picea abies</em>):</strong> Fast-growing with attractive pendulous branches, but can be susceptible to spider mites indoors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consider Local Conditions (e.g., Nairobi, Kenya):</strong> In a climate like Nairobi, traditional temperate Christmas tree species (Firs, Spruces) would not thrive long-term outdoors. If you&rsquo;re seeking a &ldquo;live Christmas tree&rdquo; experience here, you would need to choose a local evergreen species that can be grown in a large pot and then planted out, such as certain varieties of <strong>Pencil Cedar (Juniperus procera)</strong>, which is native and often grown for timber or ornamentals, or other locally adapted conifers/evergreens that can be pruned for shape. The principles of minimizing indoor time and careful acclimatization remain vital.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess the Tree&rsquo;s Health:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vibrant Color:</strong> Look for healthy, green (or blue-green, depending on species) needles without significant yellowing or browning.</li>
<li><strong>Needle Retention:</strong> Gently pull on a few needles. They should remain firmly attached.</li>
<li><strong>Moist Root Ball:</strong> Check that the root ball (balled and burlapped, or in a pot) is intact and moist, not dry or crumbling. The burlapping should be tight and secure.</li>
<li><strong>No Pests or Diseases:</strong> Inspect the needles and branches for any signs of insects, webs, or fungal growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Size Matters (for Indoor and Outdoor Space):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indoor Fit:</strong> Measure your ceiling height and available floor space, remembering that the root ball and stand will add to the overall height and width.</li>
<li><strong>Outdoor Growth:</strong> Research the mature size of the chosen tree species. Ensure you have adequate space in your yard for its eventual mature height and spread, and consider its proximity to structures, power lines, and other plants. A small live tree (1.5-2 meters / 5-7 feet tall) is generally more successful for transplanting than a very large one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buy from a Reputable Nursery:</strong> Purchase from a nursery that specializes in trees and shrubs. They can provide expert advice on species selection for your area, proper care, and planting instructions. Avoid purchasing from temporary roadside vendors who may not have knowledge of the tree&rsquo;s health or species.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="bringing-a-tree-indoors">Bringing a Tree Indoors</h2>
<p>Live trees are sensitive to sudden changes in temperature and humidity. A gradual transition is key.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Acclimatization Period (Crucial):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outdoor Transition:</strong> Before bringing the tree into your warm home, place it in an unheated garage, shed, or sheltered porch for 3-7 days. This allows it to slowly adjust to warmer temperatures.</li>
<li><strong>Indoor Stay:</strong> Limit the tree&rsquo;s time indoors to <strong>no more than 7-10 days</strong> (ideally 5-7 days). The longer it stays in a warm, dry environment, the more likely it is to break dormancy and suffer transplant shock when moved back outside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare the Root Ball:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protect Surfaces:</strong> Place the tree in a sturdy, watertight tub or a large plastic saucer to catch any drainage and protect your flooring.</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Remove Burlap/Container (Yet):</strong> Keep the burlap or container around the root ball. If burlapped, you can loosen the top of the burlap or cut away any twine around the trunk, but leave the majority of it intact to protect the roots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose the Right Location Indoors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coolest Spot:</strong> Place the tree in the coolest possible spot in your home, away from heat sources like fireplaces, radiators, heating vents, or direct sunlight from large windows.</li>
<li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Consider using a humidifier near the tree to increase ambient humidity, compensating for the dry indoor air.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="caring-for-a-live-tree">Caring for a Live Tree</h2>
<p>Proper care while indoors is vital for the tree&rsquo;s survival.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Watering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep the Root Ball Moist:</strong> This is the most important care step. Check the moisture level of the root ball daily by feeling the soil.</li>
<li><strong>Water Thoroughly:</strong> When the top few inches feel dry, water slowly and deeply until water drains from the bottom. Do not let the root ball dry out completely.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Overwatering:</strong> Ensure the tub or saucer is emptied so the tree isn&rsquo;t sitting in standing water, which can lead to root rot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decorating:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lightweight Ornaments:</strong> Use lightweight decorations that won&rsquo;t stress the branches.</li>
<li><strong>LED Lights:</strong> Opt for LED Christmas lights, as they produce very little heat, minimizing the risk of drying out the needles or damaging the tree. Avoid older, hotter incandescent lights.</li>
<li><strong>No Artificial Snow/Spray:</strong> Do not apply artificial snow or chemical sprays to the tree, as these can harm the foliage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring Health:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep an eye on needle color and firmness. Any significant browning or needle drop indicates stress.</li>
<li>Check for pests, though a short indoor stay usually prevents major infestations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="planting-a-tree">Planting a Tree</h2>
<p>Preparing for planting <em>before</em> you bring the tree indoors is ideal, especially in colder climates.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare the Planting Site (Before First Frost/Ground Freeze):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dig the Hole:</strong> Dig a hole that is two to three times wider than the root ball, and slightly shallower than the root ball&rsquo;s height. This allows roots to spread easily into loose soil.</li>
<li><strong>Save the Soil:</strong> Keep the excavated soil loose and covered (e.g., in a wheelbarrow or on a tarp in an unheated garage) to prevent it from freezing solid.</li>
<li><strong>Consider Drainage:</strong> Choose a well-drained location. Avoid low spots where water might collect.</li>
<li><strong>Mulch the Hole:</strong> If planting in frozen ground isn&rsquo;t an issue (like Nairobi), you can prepare the hole closer to planting time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acclimatization for Planting (Crucial):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reverse Transition:</strong> After its indoor stay, move the tree back to the unheated garage, shed, or sheltered porch for another 3-7 days. This allows it to re-acclimatize to colder outdoor temperatures before direct planting, preventing shock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planting Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove Burlap/Container:</strong> Gently remove any plastic container. If balled and burlapped, remove the outer twine and pull back the top of the burlap from the root ball. For untreated burlap, you can leave it at the bottom of the hole as it will decompose, but ensure any synthetic twine or wire cages are completely removed as they will not decompose and can girdle roots.</li>
<li><strong>Place the Tree:</strong> Position the tree in the center of the hole. The top of the root ball should be slightly above ground level.</li>
<li><strong>Backfill:</strong> Gently backfill the hole with the excavated soil, breaking up any clumps. Do not add amendments like compost to the backfill, as this can create a &ldquo;bathtub&rdquo; effect.</li>
<li><strong>Water Thoroughly:</strong> Water deeply to settle the soil and eliminate air pockets.</li>
<li><strong>Mulch:</strong> Apply a 5-10 cm (2-4 inch) layer of organic mulch (wood chips, shredded bark) over the entire planting area, keeping it a few inches away from the trunk. This helps retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Stake (If Needed):</strong> If the tree is in a windy location or is top-heavy, use stakes for the first year to prevent movement, but ensure they don&rsquo;t girdle the trunk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="further-information">Further Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consult Local Extension Offices/Nurseries:</strong> For specific advice on tree species suitable for your local climate and soil conditions, contact your local university extension office or a reputable nursery.</li>
<li><strong>Arborist Consultation:</strong> If you&rsquo;re unsure about planting location, soil, or tree health, consult a certified arborist.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>A live Christmas tree offers a beautiful way to celebrate the holidays while contributing to a greener planet. While it requires more careful planning and maintenance than a cut tree, the reward of seeing your holiday centerpiece thrive in your yard for years to come is unparalleled. By diligently following the steps for selection, indoor care, and proper planting, you can establish a living symbol of your holiday spirit that grows along with your family, enriching your landscape and leaving a positive environmental legacy.</p>

<strong>Bed</strong></li>
<li>Can
fleas live
in the bed? Yes, fleas will live under the comfort of the warm environment created in the bed by sheets and duvets. Further, adult female fleas may lay eggs inside the mattress and deposit some
flea dirt
that&rsquo;ll be
eaten by flea larvae
.
Only the larval and
eggs stages of the fleas
will be living in the house. So,
vacuum thoroughly to kill fleas
and wash the pet&rsquo;s bedding with hot water to prevent the eggs and larvae from growing further.
Beds will provide an excellent
hiding space for fleas
. Most pet owners may not adequately take care of their beds, but you can
purchase the best dog beds</li>
<li>as this will allow the dog to sleep on their own.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to clean the pet bedding for the pest-infested pets, plus check the crevices and cracks that&rsquo;ll be around your house.

<p><strong>Carpet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How long will
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/">fleas live</a>
on the carpet? Once
flea eggs are laid.
, they&rsquo;ll fall onto the carpet. With the right humidity (high is best) - the eggs will hatch within two days - 2 weeks.
Cats and
dogs are the ways that fleas
will move around the house and yard.
Fleas and their eggs will drop
on the rugs or carpets&rsquo; fibers - where they&rsquo;ll hide, feed, and grow.
Once the eggs hatch, you&rsquo;ll notice that the flea larvae are blind and will hide into the darker and deeper sides of the furniture or carpet - hence you&rsquo;ll require regular house inspection and cleaning.
The fleas hiding in the carpet fibers will eat food debris plus other organic matter. The flea pupae will emerge in the next 1-3 weeks - with the unfavorable condition, and thee pupae will remain in their cocoons even up to several years.
But flea pupae are enclosed in cocoons and have a glue-like substance allowing them to stick on walls, furniture, or carpet. Thus, cocoons won&rsquo;t be removed by vacuuming or sweeping.
Also,
flea pupae will only come
out of their cocoons when they sense high amounts of carbon dioxide, vibrations, or body heat - these alert them that their potential host (cats or dogs) is near.</li>

<h2 id="4-where-fleas-live-in-yard">4. Where Fleas Live in Yard?</h2>
<p><em>Fleas originate from wildlife and hide in the protected and shady outdoors spaces - particularly under leaf and grass piles - leaving flea eggs and flea larvae. Adult fleas will jump onto humans and pets to get into the indoor spaces.�</em>
Do fleas live in the grass? The
bugs will hide and live
in tall grass or some wood piles in your yard. So, ensure you
flea treat the yard using the spray
.
So, you&rsquo;ll mainly find fleas hiding in the dark, moist, and humid areas of the yard as they suck human blood or eat other organic waste.
These yard areas will include moist regions, outdoor furniture (check rugs and cushions), garage or shed, food debris, woodpiles, weeds -
effective weed killers
and shrubs, and tall grass.</p>
<h2 id="5-can-fleas-live-on-humans"><strong>5. Can Fleas Live On Humans?�</strong></h2>
<p>The regular
cat and dog fleas prefer pets
(cats or dogs) since they&rsquo;ll hide in their furry coat. Compared to pets,
human bodies are hairless, and hence fleas
won&rsquo;t attach and hide quickly.
Regardless of a massive flea infestation in the home, it&rsquo;s possible to avoid
flea bites
by controlling or killing adults, pupae, larvae, and flea eggs.
Flea may live on the pet&rsquo;s body for days since they provide a suitable blood meal. But
fleas will bite the human&rsquo;s
lower extremities, particularly the ankles and ankles - bites may lead to allergies.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s clear that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/">fleas will live</a>
on pet hosts, in the house (carpet or mattress) and the yard, besides wildlife. I recommend you use the integrated flea
