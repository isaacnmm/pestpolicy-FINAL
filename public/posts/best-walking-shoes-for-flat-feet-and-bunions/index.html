<p>Consider the following factors</p>
<h3 id="the-upper-section">The Upper Section<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-upper-section">¶</a></h3>
<p>When picking the best walking shoes for flat feet and bunions its crucial that you pay close attention to the uppers.</p>
<p>Chose walking shoes with flexible and soft uppers. Such uppers will not cause discomfort or pressure points on top of your foot or the toes.</p>
<p>Youll also want to choose shoes with wide toe boxes that would allow natural splaying of the toes as your walk. A tight forefoot can cause painful bunions since it has limited space, hence toes dont have enough room to breathe.</p>
<h3 id="orthotics">Orthotics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#orthotics">¶</a></h3>
<p>You should choose shoes with extra depth design that accommodate orthotics. Orthotics provide additional comfort and support for flat feet or any other foot issue.</p>
<p>Shoes with soft interior linings are a plus for bunion suffers. The soft linings prevent friction or any kind of foot irritation.</p>
<h3 id="the-outsole-unit">The Outsole Unit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-outsole-unit">¶</a></h3>
<p>When choosing best walking shoes for flat feet and bunions the durability of the outsole should be on your mind. A durable outsole will provide a longer wear period. The outsole should also offer underfoot protection and reliable traction on various surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="cushioning">Cushioning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cushioning">¶</a></h3>
<p>The footbed should provide good cushioning that delivers a pleasant underfoot experience. The midsole of the shoe should also offer reliable shock absorption and cushion painful feet or toes against hard impact.</p>
<p>Consider midsole units that feature DNA technologies or EVA form. These reliable cushioning components would protect the wearer against hard impact.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>When choosing the best walking shoes for flat feet and bunions its crucial that you look for shoes with wide toe box, arch support, cushioning, and stability. These factors will help provide support to your flat feet while soothing the painful bunions.</p>
<p>Luckily, all the reviewed shoes above have all these features, and choosing either of them will benefit your problematic feet.</p>
