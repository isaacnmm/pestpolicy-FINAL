<h2 id="bees-vs-wasps-vs-hornets---7-key-differences">Bees vs. Wasps vs. Hornets - 7 Key Differences?</h2>
<p>Well, wasps (non-furry insects) are carnivores, while bees are furry and will east flower pollen to produce honey. Check these
sprays for yellow jackets.</p>
<h3 id="1-color">**1. **<strong>Color�</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
The color of bees can range between yellow and black, depending on the species. But
<a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/honey-bee-anatomy">honey bees share different traits</a>
with various bugs.
For instance, honey bees have a golden-yellow color with a characteristic brown band. Bumblebees are tan in color with yellow or orange coloration. Bees have 3 pairs of legs - and thus may be considered like
<a href="http://www.reachoutmichigan.org/funexperiments/agesubject/lessons/insect.html">insects</a>
.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps come in a myriad of colors. There are over
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/group/wasps/">30,000 different wasps</a>
. Stinging wasps have bright colors that serve as a warning to intruders. For example, the yellow and black color on yellow jackets indicates they have the ability to sting.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Usually, hornets will appear to be black and white. However, the European hornet is brown with either orange or yellow markings. The yellow hornet is yellow and black in color.</p>
<h3 id="2-body-appearance">**2. **<strong>Body Appearance</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Bees have three body parts, just like other insects  Head, thorax, and abdomen. The part connecting the abdomen and thorax is thicker in bees than in both wasps and hornets. Bees come in different sizes depending on the species. Bumblebees are wider and hairy, while honeybees are small in girth and less hairy.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
A wasps body is segmented into three parts with a characteristic thin waistline, distinguishing them from either bees or hornets. They have a slim body, which is less hairy compared to bees.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are close relatives of wasps, although they emerge from different species. They have a larger body and a thicker waist when compared to wasps.
<a href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/housing/pubs/pests/bees.pdf">Hornets look very similar to wasps</a></p>
<ul>
<li>notice their elongated and thin body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-nesting-habits">**3. **<strong>Nesting Habits</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Although all bees live in colonies, their nesting habits vary from one species to another. Honeybees make their nests in voids found on walls or tree hollows. A typical honeybee colony can hold up to 10,000 bees.
On the other hand, bumblebees live in underground burrows, especially those abandoned by burrowing animals. They live in colonies of hundreds of bees.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps build nests using a paper-like substance, which they give out after chewing wood fiber. These nests appear as open-end hexagonal cells similar to honeycombs.
Wasp nests can be found under sheltered building eaves, tree branches, open pipes, and in places like garage and attics. The location of nests depends on the wasp species. While mud daubers prefer building nests in higher areas,
<a href="http://naturemappingfoundation.org/natmap/facts/yellow_jacket_712.html">yellow jackets</a>
will build nests on the ground.
Wasp nest can be as small as a golf ball and grow to as large as football or even bigger. Enormous nests of up to 15000 wasps have been found in Alabama.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/hornet-nest-removal/">Hornet removal</a>
appear as paper-like substances with a grayish color. However, unlike the bee and wasp nests, they are oval-shaped. They construct their nests overhanging from higher places like trees, chimneys, outside buildings, poles, etc.
A hornet nest starts as a small piece but can grow to the size of a basketball.

<h3 id="4-diet-and-feeding">**4. **<strong>Diet and Feeding</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
A bees diet mainly entails pollen and nectar. Since they crave sweet food, they also feed on sweet juices such as those found in fruits and soft drinks. Thats why you might see bees hovering around during your outdoor parties or treats.
The worker bees do the work of collecting nectar and pollen and bringing it to the nests for the rest of the colony.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps forage for their food among invertebrates such as flies, spiders, ants, caterpillars, and other small insects. Some are omnivorous and will feed on honeydew, nectar, and fallen fruits.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are omnivorous  they feed on sugary plant foods such as tree sap and rotting fruits. Theyre also predators of small insects such as flies, among others.</p>
<h3 id="5-aggressiveness">**5. **<strong>Aggressiveness</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Bees are less aggressive than both wasps and hornets - but
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353869">can sting</a>
. Bees will not sting you unless they feel threatened or when defending their nests. But unlike wasps and hornets, they have barbed stingers which bite only once.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps are more aggressive than bees but not as aggressive as hornets. Like others in the Vespidae family, they can sting several times, each time withdrawing their stinger from the victim.
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/wasp-sting">Wasps may also sting</a>
-�they usually sting when provoked or defending their nests.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are very quick at stinging. They will sting at the slightest provocation. They belong to the Vespidae family, whose stingers are not barbed. That means they can sting several times because of the ability to withdraw their stinger.
A hornet sting inflicts a lot of pain and can sometimes lead to fatal allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>
<h3 id="6-nest-behavior">**6. **<strong>Nest Behavior</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
A bee nest consists of the queen, female workers, and the male drones. The queen lays eggs while the drones do the work of mating with the queen. Female workers are responsible for housekeeping, gathering food, protection, and feeding larvae.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Most of the wasp species live a solitary life. In this case, mature females dig or construct nests near food sources to live and lay eggs. A few species exhibit a social behavior where they live as a community. These include yellow jackets and paper wasps.
A colony of social wasps mainly entails the queen and the female workers. Males leave the hive immediately after mating and die due to dehydration. Mating occurs in summer, where the females hibernate only to start new colonies in spring. New males for the next mating season emerge from the unfertilized eggs.
Female workers are tasked with all communal work, including gathering food, housekeeping, feeding the larvae, and protecting the colony.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
At the center of a hornet hive is the queen, whose sole function is to lay eggs for reproduction. The seemingly few males in the nest only do mating and will die soon after mating.
Female hornets perform daily communal jobs such as getting food, building the nest, protection, and feeding the larvae.

<h3 id="locate-the-nest"><strong>Locate the Nest</strong></h3>
<p>If you have been stung several times or suspect you have stinging insects, begin by investigating whether theres a nest around. Common areas where stinging insects construct nests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tree branches</li>
<li>Stacked wood</li>
<li>Utility or fence poles</li>
<li>Anything hollow, including pipes and wood</li>
<li>Underneath the roof awnings or canopy</li>
<li>Underground burrows</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identify-the-insect"><strong>Identify the Insect</strong></h3>
<p>It is important to know which of the three stinging insects youre dealing with. Thats because not all of them pose a threat to your family. For instance, a bee nest in the garden can be left out since it doesnt pose a big threat. Bees are not only less provocative but are also useful in pollinating flowering plants in the compound.
The above comparison will help you identify the insects with ease. In case you have difficulties in identification, you can contact an expert. Correct identification enables you to
effectively get rid of termites
and stinging insects from your home.</p>
<h3 id="treat-and-remove-the-nest"><strong>Treat and Remove the Nest</strong></h3>
<p>Treating or removing stinging insects is a very delicate process. If not done carefully, you might end up with painful stings or serious allergic reactions. If youre dealing with aggressive species, its advisable to call a professional exterminator to do the work.
However, if youre confident to handle the situation by yourself, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>If youre not sure about your reaction to stings, get an allergy test from your doctor. Do not continue with the removal of the test is positive. Call an exterminator.</li>
<li>Whether youre an expert or a novice in removing stinging insects, ensure you wear protective clothing. Wear long pants, boots, a long-sleeved hoodie, gloves, protective glasses, a scarf, and a heart.</li>
<li>In case of an emergency, you need someone to give you first aid. So ensure theres someone to do that. Also, plan an escape route in case the mission fails.</li>
<li>Nowspray the ant nest with an insecticideof your choice. Be sure to get one that is labeled wasps, bees, or hornets. Also, ensure the product you get is a jet spray. This allows you to spray nests that are more than 10 feet high. The best time to remove these insects is after dusk or at dawn.</li>
<li>Best results will be achieved if you spray a solid jet directly into the nest entrance and any other opening.</li>
<li>If the nest is in a high place, dont stay directly below the nest. You might sustain stings from falling insects.</li>
<li>After spraying, stay away from the area for one day. Afterward, you can remove and discard the nest if therere no signs of insect activity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Differences between bees vs. wasps vs. hornets? You cant be at peace when you have aggressive stinging insects around your home. Its even worse when you dont know exactly which of the stinging insect is disturbing you.
This guide comes in handy to help you correctly identify bees, wasps, and hornets. Correct identification is the most important step when dealing with stinging insects. It allows you to understand the threat and embark on proper eradication remedies.</p>

<h2 id="identification">Identification</h2>
<h3 id="carpenter-bees">Carpenter bees</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees are black and large bees and come during the end of spring and start of summer. The name carpenter bees, also known as wood bees, was created due to the bees practice of wood-boring to create nests for their young ones.
There exist many species of carpenter bees. However, Xylocopa Virginia (L.) is the most common species, yellow and black in color and an inch long. Further, carpenter bees are described as solitary bees. Every female tunnel into the wood to create its nest.
**Male carpenter bees: Do not sting **
The male carpenter bees hover around the house, searching for mates and good paces to create their nests. Also, they are very aggressive and hover around people moving near their nests.
However, since they have no stingers, male carpenter bees are harmless. Notably, females have black face while males have yellow faces.
<strong>Female carpenter bees: have stingers.</strong>
On the other hand, female carpenter bees have stingers and are quite harmful. However, the females are less aggressive and will only attack in self-defense when molested. Also, the females have dense black hairs blush in the hind legs.</p>
<h3 id="bumblebees">Bumblebees</h3>
<p>The whole body of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee">bumblebees</a>
is covered with hairs. It is also critical to note that the female bumblebees&rsquo; body has yellow hair patches on their upper abdomen. Further, bumblebees socially live in underground nests.
Female bumblebees cannot sting continuously. Further, they will only attack you or your animal&rsquo;s attack when disturbed. Despite that, the stings can be painful; it is not dangerous unless it is around the neck or head or for people who have an allergic reaction to bee venom.
The bumblebee is in the genus Bombus. There are more than 250 species and mainly live in higher altitudes. It has a round body covered in a pile
<em>�</em>
(long branched setae) of soft hair.</p>
<h2 id="indications">Indications</h2>
<h3 id="carpenter-bees-1">Carpenter Bees</h3>
<p>The following conditions will indicate the possible presence of carpenter bees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sawdust piles under perfectly drilled and circular holes in the house.</li>
<li>Large, yellow, black, and shiny bees that hover over your head in the home.</li>
<li>Moldy, yellow, or fan-shaped stains on the sides of a structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bumblebees-1">Bumblebees</h3>
<p>Bumblebees
mainly nest below the ground
(in or under refuse dumps, debris, or soil). Mi9anly, the bees acquire their food from flowers. Despite that, they also create honey; they store it in a minimal amount and thus not commercially viable.
Bumblebees are helpful pollinators to some plant species but not as effective as the honey bees for commercial plant pollination.</p>
<h2 id="nesting-habits">Nesting habits</h2>
<p>Although carpenter bee vs. bumblebee has similar appearances, they have different nesting habits.
For example, bumblebees prefer nesting in the ground while the carpenter bees tend to tunnel in wood to lay eggs there. They prefer weathered, bare of unpainted softwoods, particularly cypress and redwood.
Except for the new queens in the colony, all the other bumblebee colonies perish at the end of fall. The remaining queens thus ensure continuity of the species by laying eggs in spring.</p>
<h2 id="control-carpenter-bee-and-bumblebee">Control carpenter bee and bumblebee</h2>
<h2 id="carpenter-bee">Carpenter Bee</h2>
<p>Do you have wood, particularly softwood, that is not painted or without stains? If yes, carpenter bees could be well attracted to your premises.
To prevent carpenter bees from attacking your structures, ensure to stain, paint or treat the wood. Since the bees love softwoods, always use hardwood to build your structures to prevent them from creating their nests.
Further, examine if any wood had been attacked previously attacked by the carpenter bees as they are highly likely to be struck.
Even though wood preservatives and stains are considered less effective in preventing carpenter bees, they offer some repellency levels. Also, close the garages to prevent the carpenter bees from creating nests.
You can use liquid sprays having synthetic pyrethroid, chlorpyrifos (Dursban), and carbaryl (Sevin) on wood to prevent an
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-carpenter-bees-bite/">attack from the carpenter bees</a>
. Ensure to repeat the treatment process after two weeks.
Also, you can use insecticidal dust to treat wood tunnel openings. After treatment, approximately one week later, close the entrance hole using a wooden piece of wood.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-bumblebees">How to get rid of bumblebees</h2>
<p>Bumble Bee can be described as beneficial insects. However, they can be dangerous, depending on where their nests are located. To control bumblebees, you should use both
chemical and non-chemical control methods
.</p>
<h3 id="chemical-treatment">Chemical treatment</h3>
<p>Since timing is important for the control of bumblebees, note the bumblebee nest&rsquo;s location when it is still day time. At night or early evening, or early morning before dawn, treat the nest with the appropriate insecticides to maximize effectiveness.
Treating the nests during day time can reach very few bees as most are active and busy outside the nest. Remember to wear protective clothing such as a bee veil. �You can use D-Force HPX or D-Force HPX to kill the bees. Also, you can apply D Fence Dust around or inside the nest.
Use insecticides containing resmethrin or pyrethrins to knock- down the bumblebees. Also, you can use the dust of sprays that contain carbaryl (Sevin). After treatment, close the bumblebee hole with soil.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While <a href="/posts/compare-carpenter-bee-vs-bumblebee/">carpenter</a> bees do not bite humans, they can cause damage to wooden structures. The bees burrow into wood to create their nests, which can lead to structural damage if left unchecked. Over time, repeated nesting activity can weaken wood, especially in areas like decks, eaves, and siding.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-prevent-carpenter-bee-infestations">How to Prevent Carpenter <a href="/posts/hornet-bees-and-wasp-removal-tacoma/">Bee</a> Infestations</h3>
<p>To prevent carpenter bees from nesting in your home or garden, consider the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Seal Wooden Surfaces:**Ensure that wood around your home is sealed properly. Carpenter bees are attracted to untreated wood, so applying a coat of paint or varnish can deter them from drilling.</li>
<li>**Use Bee Traps:**Specialized carpenter bee traps can help reduce the number of bees around your property.</li>
<li>**Regular Inspections:**Regularly inspect your wooden structures for signs of carpenter bee activity. Look for round holes and sawdust-like material near wood surfaces.</li>
<li>**Natural Repellents:**Some natural repellents, like citrus or essential oils, can be used to discourage carpenter bees from nesting in certain areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees are typically harmless to humans and do not bite. While their nesting behavior can cause damage to wood, they are not aggressive and will only sting if provoked. Taking preventive measures, such as sealing wood and using repellents, can help avoid infestations and minimize the risk of damage.</p>

<p>Our team is experienced in handling various types of stinging insects, ensuring effective and humane solutions. Heres a brief overview of the common stinging insects in Tacoma and how we can help:</p>
<h4 id="1-yellow-jacket">1. Yellow Jacket</h4>
<p>Yellow jackets are aggressive wasps known for their distinctive black and yellow markings. They build paper-like nests, often in hidden locations like wall cavities or underground.</p>
<ul>
<li>These insects undergo complete metamorphosis, starting from an egg to a larva, pupa, and finally, an adult. A colony is typically established in spring and can grow throughout the summer.
Our experts locate and safely remove yellow jacket nests, reducing the risk of stings and infestations. We use environmentally-friendly methods to ensure the safety of your family and pets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-honey-bees">2. Honey Bees</h4>
<p>Honey bees are essential pollinators with a fuzzy appearance and yellow and brown stripes. They usually nest in hollow trees, beehives, or wall cavities. Honey bees have a complex social structure, with a queen, workers, and drones.</p>
<ul>
<li>The queen lays eggs, which develop into larvae, pupae, and adults. Colonies can survive for several years.
We prioritize the safe relocation of honey bee colonies to protect these crucial pollinators. Our team collaborates with local beekeepers to ensure the bees are relocated to a suitable habitat.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-bumble-bees">3. Bumble Bees</h4>
<p>Bumble bees are large, fuzzy insects with black and yellow coloring. They are less aggressive and usually nest in the ground, often in abandoned rodent burrows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bumble bees form small colonies, typically with a single queen. The lifecycle includes egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. Colonies die off in late fall, with only the new queens hibernating.
We provide safe removal and relocation services for bumble bee nests. Our team ensures that these beneficial insects are preserved and relocated to an appropriate environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-paper-wasp">4. Paper Wasp</h4>
<p>Paper wasps are slender with long legs, and they have a brownish color with yellow markings. They build open, umbrella-shaped nests made from chewed wood fibers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper wasps follow a similar lifecycle to other wasps, starting from eggs laid by the queen. The colony grows throughout the summer and dies off in late fall.
We identify and safely remove paper wasp nests to prevent stings and property damage. Our techniques ensure that nests are effectively removed, reducing the likelihood of re-infestation.</li>
