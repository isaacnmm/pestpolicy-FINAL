<h4 id="identifying-common-ant-species-in-federal-way">Identifying Common Ant Species in Federal Way</h4>
<ol>

<li><strong>Pavement Ants</strong>: These ants are light brown to black and typically nest under pavement, sidewalks, and building foundations. They often enter homes through cracks and are attracted to greasy and sweet foods.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="prevention-tips-for-federal-way-homeowners">Prevention Tips for Federal Way Homeowners</h4>
<p>Preventing an ant infestation is the first step in effective ant <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-bellingham/">control</a>. Here are some practical tips for homeowners in Federal Way:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintain Cleanliness</strong>: Keep your kitchen clean by wiping down countertops, sweeping floors, and promptly cleaning up spills and crumbs. Store food in airtight containers and regularly take out the trash.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Entry Points</strong>: Inspect your homes exterior for cracks and gaps in walls, windows, doors, and the foundation. Seal any potential entry points to prevent <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-puyallup/">ants</a> from entering your home.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Moisture Sources</strong>: Fix leaky pipes, faucets, and roofs to reduce moisture that attracts ants. Ensure that your homes gutters and downspouts are functioning properly to direct water away from the foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Trim Vegetation</strong>: Keep trees and shrubs trimmed away from the house to prevent ants from using them as bridges to enter your home. Remove any debris and wood piles from around the foundation.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="diy-ant-control-solutions">DIY Ant Control Solutions</h4>
<p>If you notice signs of ant activity in your home, these DIY methods can help control the problem before it becomes an infestation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bait Stations</strong>: Use commercial ant bait stations to attract and kill ants. Place bait stations near ant trails and entry points. The ants will carry the bait back to their nest, effectively eliminating the colony.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Repellents</strong>: Use natural repellents such as vinegar, lemon juice, or essential oils like peppermint and tea tree oil. Spray these solutions along ant trails and entry points to deter ants.</li>
<li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth</strong>: Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth around ant entry points and along ant trails. This powdery substance is non-toxic to humans and pets but lethal to ants, causing them to dehydrate and die.</li>
<li><strong>Borax and Sugar Solution</strong>: Mix borax with sugar and water to create a homemade ant bait. Place the solution in shallow containers near ant trails. The sugar attracts the ants, while the borax kills them.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="when-to-call-a-professional-in-federal-way">When to Call a Professional in Federal Way</h4>
