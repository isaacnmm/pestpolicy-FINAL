need a primer? Well, No! Valspar won&rsquo;t need a primer - it is simple to clear any blemishes with comfortable touch up in your kitchen and bathroom cabinets.</p>
<p>On effectiveness, Valspar Cabinet is suitable for furniture cabinets and will be comfortable to touch up if there are chips, blemishes, or scuffs -
only sand
and apply the paint.
I recommend using
satin, gloss, or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-for-kitchen-cabinets/">semi-gloss paints</a>
for your kitchen cabinets - but avoid using
Matte. Valspar Signature is resistant to stains, spills, and scratches - it&rsquo;s also
mildew resistant
.
So, below I&rsquo;ve shared how the Valspar Cabinet-Enamel Paint will be an excellent tool for reviving the outlook of your different home projects, including on
trim and baseboards
.</p>
<h2 id="details-valspar-cabinet-paint">Details: Valspar Cabinet Paint</h2>
<p>Painting your cabinet is different from the
regular wall painting
since this type of cabinet painting project requires having a
quality product
.
The cabinet paint must be solid to effectively withstand abuse such as food or liquid splashes and repeated touching - Valspar Cabinet also comes at a
budget-friendly price
.</p>
<h3 id="1-latex-based-paint">1. Latex-Based paint</h3>
<p>The
latex-based paint
(Valspar Cabinet Enamel) is suitable and recommended for cabinet painting - but you must know that the product is a latex-oil hybrid.
The oil features in the paint will create that smooth and streak-free surface on your cabinets. Valspar Cabinet Paint does not include excessive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound">volatile organic content</a>
(VOC).
Besides, with the Valspar paint, cleaning will be comfortable even with no turpentine. Get some soap and water for easy cleaning - and hence the paint offers great surface wash-ability and durability.</p>
<h3 id="2-has-glosser-like-features">2. Has Glosser-like Features</h3>
<p>With the Valspar Cabinet Enamel, you&rsquo;ll get the glosser-like properties on your surfaces, and hence you won&rsquo;t require to
sand the wood before painting
.
Notably, the enamel Valspar paints won&rsquo;t have that rock-hard finish, and thus no grains will appear - this is mainly because the oil property will generate that glossy finish.
The Valspar paint tends to dry plus cure but won&rsquo;t lead to environmental issues or yellowing on your cabinets in the
<a href="https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/room-ideas/g25950227/master-bathroom-ideas/">master bathroom remodeling</a>
.
Besides, Valspar&rsquo;s latex feature makes the paint firmly adhere to your cabinet
smooth finishes
, mainly if you&rsquo;re working on some old finish - which reduces peeling, scratching, and chipping.</p>
<h3 id="3-has-non-yellowing-properties-and-mild-smell">3. Has Non-Yellowing Properties and Mild Smell</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to paint with this Valspar on your old finishes. The paint will also leave no brush marks following the brushing process
streak-free
due to the oil and latex features.
The Valspar Cabinet Paint comes with non-yellowing features - and this prevents yellow patches from appearing on the cabinet paints after you&rsquo;ve painted.
Compared to oil-based paints, the Valspar Cabinet Paint has a less mild odor. Therefore, you won&rsquo;t require to put on a nose mask - but you may need
safety glasses
.
You&rsquo;ll not get allergies that result from strong-odor paints, and thus you&rsquo;ll be safe - great for
baby cribs

<h3 id="3-produces-a-professional-cabinet-finish">3. Produces a Professional Cabinet Finish</h3>
<p>The Valspar Paint offers that great professional finish considering your unique painting technique. You may need to use sprayers, rollers, or
paint with edging brushes
.
Besides, with the Valspar Paint, you won&rsquo;t require to use a primer -ï¿½ but for
priming, before your painting
, you might need to avoid
chalk paint
.
You will result in poor finishing if you don&rsquo;t prime the surfaces as it would lead to stain-bleeding via the paint. The surfaces, using Valspar, won&rsquo;t require sanding or priming.</p>
