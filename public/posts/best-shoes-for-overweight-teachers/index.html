<p>Motion Control technology in shoes for heavy or obese walkers is very crucial, as most heavy people tend to overpronate. Ensure you choose a shoe that has motion control technology, as it will provide you with needed stability for more stable and balanced walks.</p>
<p>Motion control reduces rearfoot movement ensuring you have a controlled motion. Choose shoes with firmer midsole construction. This type of design delivers excellent medial support while minimizing overpronation.</p>
<h3 id="comfort">Comfort<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#comfort">¶</a></h3>
<p>When choosing the best shoes for overweight teachers ensure you consider your comfort. Avoid high-heeled, flip-flops, and narrow or ill-fitting shoes. Since youll be walking or standing the whole day ensure you buy shoes are breathable. Those that allow fresh air into the shoe</p>
<p>Further, ensure you choose shoes with a spacious toe box or interior. Ample interior and toe box space provide your foot enough room to move naturally. Padded tongue and the collar ensure extra comfort and support.</p>
