<p>ASICS launched its fuzeX collection featuring
**FuzeGEL, its innovative and **
responsive cushioning system, a combination of their older GEL technology with traditional EVA. Available for both men and women.</p>
<p>Fuzex is appropriate for indoor and outdoor running: being low profile and very light. In addition, the design and cushioning system graduate it to the supinator&rsquo;s shoes.
Coming with a 6mm heel drop, the shoe is excellent for fast runners. It allows a smooth transition that would be favorable for forefoot, mid-foot, and heel strikers. (1) Fuzex Lyte (2) Discover Fuzex
However, if you need additional cushioning in your Asics for the Supination, check the below shoes, and you&rsquo;ll love the protection provided to your foot. (1) Gel-Cumulus 18 (2) Gel-Sendai 3 (3) DynaFlyte (4) Gel Nimbus 18.
You&rsquo;ll benefit from neutral padded shoes such as the supination or underpronation shoes: you won&rsquo;t require medical stability, and thus motion control shoes won&rsquo;t be your fit.
The supination shoe brands will come enough cushioning/ padding to allow your foot to remain highly natural and roll enough to the end of your stride.

Brooks Glycerin 14 will provide appropriate cushioning to help in the foot supination. Its platform pad will help with the shoe fit and function while the crash pad will assist in absorbing various shocks on your foot while you are walking.
I noted that the shoe&rsquo;s midsole tapped at its toe region (with the Omega-Flex Grooves) and hence gave me a smooth journey while transitioning from its foot-strike to the toe-off.</p>
<h3 id="5-brooks-ghost-9-synthetic-fabric-and-synthetic"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CLG6K15/?tag=p-policy-20">5. Brooks Ghost 9 Synthetic, Fabric and Synthetic</a></h3>
<p>After reviewing the Brooks Glycerin 14 for Supination, I&rsquo;ll now analyze Brooks Ghost 9.</p>
<p>In various standards, Brooks Ghost 9 falls very close to the above-reviewed shoes as an appropriate shoe for Supination.</p>
<p>Brooks Ghost 9 has a neutral support system and has appropriately energized foam that&rsquo;ll help absorb various shocks that come up when you are walking or running.
This will maintain your feet in an aligned position and thus prevent any supination &amp; under-pronation.
Its contoured midsole will maintain your foot in a stable position due to correct cushioning and alignment. Brooks Ghost 9 has a substantially padded footbed to give your top comfort. Also, its collar and tongue are padded and soft to provide an impressive grip near your ankle.

Its IMEVA midsole eliminates any complications from your way and makes the shoe durable too. I would describe the New Balance 510v3&rsquo;s midsole as flexible, contouring, and firm.
To maintain top balance, New Balance installed a midsole (IM ethylene-vinyl acetate) in the New Balance 510v3. It tops among supination shoes with excellent comfort and alignment. Finally, the ABZORB technology will offer support against any shock which enters your shoe.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Therefore, it is crucial that you consider the most respected Supination or under-pronation shoes&rsquo; manufactures for various walking and running shoes.
