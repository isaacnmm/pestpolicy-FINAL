Amongst ant species include:</p>
<h3 id="v-carpenter-ants">v� Carpenter Ants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-carpenter-ants">¶</a></h3>
<p>Carpenter ants bore into wood and nest in it. Although their perforation can not be counted as feeding on the wood, they eject it in the form of extra-fine sawdust which you can notice from outside their hideaways.</p>
<h3 id="v-pharaoh-ants-and-house-ants">v� Pharaoh Ants and House Ants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-pharaoh-ants-and-house-ants">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pharaoh ants are mainly brown in color and target sugary substances and meat. However, you shouldnt confuse them with the odorous house ant, which also picks on food and water.
You can tell if you are dealing with odorous house ants if you perceive a rotten coconut smell upon crushing the ants.
In addition, you should notice these ants roaming about countertops, dining areas, and the kitchen closets too.</p>
<h3 id="v-fire-ants">v� Fire Ants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-fire-ants">¶</a></h3>
<p>Famed for their painful sting, fire ants are reddish-brown and pose great dangers to children, pets, and even adults.
Fire ants are attracted to warm conditions and moisture, and they are common around food scraps. You can easily spot them around scattered food or kitchen garbage within your home, or when it rains.</p>
<h3 id="iii-the-location">iii. The Location<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#iii-the-location">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ideally, the location attracts transport costs above normal service rating. Expect an extra charger if your ant exterminator is outsourced from very far.
Further, outdoor areas attract a lesser fee because of their ease of access, and in fact; a short time is spent since the professional is free to deploy stronger outdoor control measures.
On the contrary, the exterminator encounters huge barriers when dealing with indoor treatments, which trigger extra charges. Some of the hindrances that may disrupt the streamlined work of the technician include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presence of children playing, or pets</li>
<li>Uncovered and used or dirty utensils in the infested area such as in the kitchen</li>
<li>Inaccessible walls, corners, crevices, and electrical equipment</li>
<li>Disorganized or muddled areas
Understand that the longer the time an exterminator takes in your place, the more cost you expect to pay for that service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iv-method-selected">iv. Method Selected<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#iv-method-selected">¶</a></h3>
<p>In some selected scenarios, an exterminating company may inspect the infested location and resolve to use some special method, technique, or machinery aside from the ordinary ones like home make ant killers.
For example, professionals may charge 500 dollars to use specialized equipment to deal with a specific species of ants in your home, such as the carpenter ants.
Alternatively, you may pay 200 dollars in case you go for the chemical method.</p>
<h3 id="v-the-frequency-of-control-service">v. The Frequency of Control Service<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#v-the-frequency-of-control-service">¶</a></h3>
<p>You will pay less per visit to ant-infested if you contact the same exterminator for every control service for future inspection.
For instance, when you engage the exterminator on three-month regular service visits, youll realize that it will cost you less than 1/2 of the corresponding charge for a one-time treatment. Instead of paying $500 dollars for a visit, you will actually end up paying 250 dollars.
Assuming you opt for a yearly plan, you will be shocked your monthly charges will be as low as $50- $70. The benefit of such long-term contracts is that they cover a variety of pests and not just one kind. Common pests that may be covered in these agreements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ants</li>
<li>Spiders</li>
<li>Scorpions</li>
<li>Cockroaches</li>
<li>Other crawling bugs

<p>The process of ant removal follows two distinct steps, which are:</p>
<h3 id="i-inspection">I. Inspection<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-inspection">¶</a></h3>
<p>At this stage, the expert pays you a visit for your home inspection. This inspection visit serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finding out and verifying the ant problem. The expert will also inspect to confirm whether indeed what you see are ants and not termites or any other pests.</li>
<li>Generating a proper action plan. Having done the inspection, the exterminator then comes up with the appropriate course of action that will most effectively solve the ant issue. This often involves identifying the origin of the said ant colonies and determining which method to be deployed in order to eradicate the ants.</li>
<li>Point of sales and clarification. Some companies use the inspection as a means to promote their exterminator services. However, it is not as ridiculous as it seems, since they will have a first assessed infestation.</li>
<li>Then, they will propose products or services that are going to help you eliminate the ants. You can as questions or seek clarification were necessary at this point in time.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="-iiactual-ant-treatment">**�� II.**Actual Ant Treatment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-iiactual-ant-treatment">¶</a></h3>
<p>Based on the findings of the inspection, the professional selects a suitable treatment method. This decision depends on ant infestation level, the location, square footage, and also the type of ants.
For outdoor infestation, the expert may use residual repellant insecticide. The Exterminator may opt to use ant baits and traps for in-house applications as well.
To tackle ants in crevices and cracks, the best exterminator experts use earth-based borates coupled with insecticide dust.
Some companies will even recommend sanitation measures for you to ensure long-term control of the insects.
The basis, and certainly your guiding principle, is for you to understand that a licensed professional can better handle the ant problem.

<p>Ants are classified as non-disease vectors  they bear no disease in them. This makes ants harmless in disease transfer to humans.
However, it has been established that close to 5 percent of the overall U.S population can suffer allergic reactions due to ant stings.
Ant stings vary from minor to severe and sometimes can be fatal if not attended to immediately.
Red imported fire ants have the most severe stings, which often trigger welts and non-life-threatening skin dermatitis that last longer, and up to 14 days.
Note: Ants can be extremely dangerous to pets such as dogs due to their fluffy nature.</p>

<p>Although treatment methods are efficient and all, it is always wise to prevent the ant problem from reoccurring. This is done in either of the following ways:</p>
<h3 id="a-practicing-proper-sanitation-measures-such-as">a. Practicing proper sanitation measures such as:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-practicing-proper-sanitation-measures-such-as">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning all soda and sugary spills immediately</li>
<li>Proper and prompt refrigeration of leftover food</li>
<li>Covering all trash receptacles</li>
<li>Sealing food containers that may attractants</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-sealing-pipe-entries">b. Sealing pipe entries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#b-sealing-pipe-entries">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flooring pipes are susceptible to ants due to their moisture - seal all pipes with steel wool.</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying Caulk on Doors and windows. Ants can access your house through narrow openings, be it on your window sills or on door jams. One sure way to keep ants from crawling into your abode is to smear silicone caulk on door and window drafts.</li>
<li>Sealing electrical outlet plates. Ants often find a way into your residence through electrical outlets - ensure that they are tightly fastened. Alternatively, you can seal them using transparent caulking.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>In summary, on how much does an ant exterminator cost, professionals rely on factors such as square footage, the location of ant infestation, level of infestation, and the type of ant species in the area.
The actual ant&rsquo;s elimination cost varies, it may drop as low as 50 Dollars. Alternatively, you may be forced to pay up to 1000 dollars or more for the service, especially when an infestation is on large scale.
Having a professional exterminator is highly recommended in order to avoid future infestation. You can also acquire a yearly inspection contract from pest experts, which is a wise way of dealing with other pests in your place too.
Remember to go for the best ant elimination method; one which is budget-friendly and environmentally safe.</p>
