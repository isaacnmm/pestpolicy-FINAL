, you can consider factors like effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and environmental impact.</p>
<p>Selecting the right product requires understanding the specific needs of your situation to effectively control the squirrel population without causing undue harm to non-target animals or the environment.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<p><strong>1. Safety�</strong>
Safety is paramount when choosing a poison, especially if you have pets or children. Anticoagulants, such as like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0071D0DAG/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Tomcat All-Weather Bait Chunx</strong></a>
contain Warfarin, which is effective against squirrels but has a known antidote, Vitamin K1, making it a safer option for use around pets.</p>
<p>Anticoagulants work by preventing blood from clotting, leading to internal bleeding and eventual death in squirrels.�Additionally, products containing zinc phosphide, like
<em>Bonide Mole and Gopher Bait</em>
, are effective but must be used with extreme caution as they are highly toxic and have no antidote.
<strong>2. Effectiveness�</strong>
Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004HFHB60/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Kaput Rat &amp; Mouse Bait</strong></a>
, are known for their high efficacy in eliminating squirrels quickly. The active ingredient in these pellets is Brodifacoum, a potent anticoagulant that causes internal bleeding in rodents, leading to death.</p>
<p>This product is particularly effective in reducing large squirrel populations swiftly, making it a go-to option for many -

<em>RatX</em>
stand out. RatX is made from natural ingredients and is designed to be non-toxic to birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>This product works by dehydrating the squirrel after ingestion, leading to death without the risk of secondary poisoning to predators or scavengers.
<strong>5. Cost-Effectiveness�</strong>
For those looking for a budget-friendly option,
<em>Tomcat All-Weather Bait Chunx</em>
offers a cost-effective solution.</p>
<p>These bait chunks are long-lasting and can withstand harsh weather conditions, providing continuous control over squirrel populations without frequent replacements. Their durability and lower cost per application make them a practical choice for managing squirrel issues over time.</p>
<p>Rat poisons that contain zinc phosphide can also be cost-effective, but they require careful application due to their high toxicity and potential environmental hazards.

      <description>Summertime in many parts of the World including the United States such as in Washington, D.C., largely experiences an upsurge of squirrels -</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summertime in many parts of the World including the United States such as in Washington, D.C., largely experiences an upsurge of squirrels -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-squirrels-live/">they live longer too</a>
.
Well, squirrels are comparatively cute and most of us may get attracted to them. In fact, we argue that squirrels are not like lions, bears, or wolves. But do squirrels attack humans?
<em>In brief, Yes, squirrels will attack humans whenever they feel threatened - their powerful bites may bring dangerous diseases. So, if you love watching or feeding squirrels in the backyard, you must keep some safe distance.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, if there are squirrels around your house or backyard, you&rsquo;ll need to hire professional <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-carry-ticks/">squirrel</a> control - these will help with inspection and control of the squirrel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-do-squirrels-attack-humans">Details: Do Squirrels Attack Humans?</h2>
<p>Despite being cute animals, squirrels are equally territorial and competitive mammals. Therefore, the males and females will compete for territories while building nests during fall.
Further, in winter, the squirrel&rsquo;s food is scarce and thus the animals must hide this resource from their rival squirrels. Therefore, the competition causes increased aggressiveness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, during such times squirrels will also attack humans since they can&rsquo;t stand having their babies or food being taken away from them.
Any human who gets near such as an aggressive squirrel may appear like a threat to these wild animals and thus it&rsquo;ll launch its self-defense for survival.</li>
<li>Therefore, I advise getting to some safe distance from the squirrels since they may seriously harm you or your pets.
Notably, squirrels have strong and sharp teeth that&rsquo;ll chew through soft metal, plastic, and wood. So, a bite on the human body may leave the person needing some stitches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-of-infection-from-squirrel-bites">Risk of Infection from Squirrel Bites?</h2>
<p>Squirrels have dirty claws as they use them largely for many of their daily hunting or attacking activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Injuries on humans caused by squirrel claws may bring diseases such as Plague, Salmonellosis, Tularemia, and Leptospirosis - these spread largely via feces and saliva.
Further, squirrels may also carry parasites such as fleas and ticks - but you may use
flea spray for the backyard</li>
<li>and these may cause diseases such as Encephalitis and Lyme disease.</li>
<li>Squirrels will not just attack humans while in the open yards, but may also follow you to the house or also give you a run in the attic as they seek nesting places.
For the attic, the squirrels will get into that space by clawing or chewing through roof gaps, chimneys, plumbing vents, and roof vents.</li>
<li>The animals will nest inside the attic around the insulation - where they destroy it or smear it with its body waste.
Such damage in damage by the squirrels will expose your roof to different environmental elements while also increasing your energy costs.</li>
<li>Besides, the squirrels will chew house elements like the electrical wires while also causing an attraction to pests like raccoons.

</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-we-do-when-a-squirrel-gets-inside"><strong>What Should We Do When a Squirrel Gets Inside?�</strong></h2>
<p>If a squirrel lands on your property, especially in the attic, you must take quick remedies to avoid further attacks on humans and pets. I recommend you;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use vinegar: Soak some rags into cider vinegar and place these around the door of the attic or at your fireplace.</li>
<li>Make noise: When the squirrel is already in the chimney or attic, make massive noises to help scare the animal away from your property.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu-q47fM020">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu-q47fM020</a>
Further, for any squirrel that is threatening to attack humans or is inside your property - consider hiring some professional remover and don&rsquo;t get overly close to the animals to avoid injury.</li>
<li>The pest control and removal experts will definitely understand the behavior of squirrels as compared to most of us.</li>
<li>Thus, the experts will remove the animals without hurting anyone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-keep-squirrels-off-your-humans-and-our-homes">Why Keep Squirrels Off Your Humans and Our Homes?</h2>
<p>Wild animals including squirrels can sometimes be unpredictable. The animals will become overly aggressive and attack humans if they feel threatened.
More squirrels in the backyard increase the likelihood of some of them chewing their way to your house, chimney, or also in the houses&rsquo; attic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, squirrels may drop their wet or dry body waste in the yard or in the house - these may pose a hazard to the pets and humans too.
As noted above, the squirrels may eat through electrical wires and hence may lead to a power outage, fires, and economic losses around the house.
Chewing or gnawing on plumbing works and pipes by the squirrels may lead to breakages and water leakages in the house or the backyard.</li>
<li>Squirrels will come from the wild environment and will thus carry bugs and parasites such as mites, ticks, and fleas -humans may get ear mites from dogs?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-removesquirrels">How to Remove�Squirrels</h2>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re not ready to allow the squirrels to leave your surrounding on their own or if they&rsquo;re attacking humans, then you need to adopt appropriate removal methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>A one-way squirrels exclusion door will work well in removing the animals since once they get out of the home or yard, they won&rsquo;t easily get back and attack humans.</li>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-yard/">Live-trapping of these squirrels</a>will help easily and humanely remove these animals from our spaces. For example, one may use cage traps in spaces such as holes and attics.</li>
<li>Further, after you&rsquo;ve trapped or caught the animals from the attic, you&rsquo;ll require to seal all the entry points that the squirrels used to access the spaces.</li>
<li>Despite that some DIY squirrel-control chemicals exist in the stotes, experts do not recommend these remedies as they may be dangerous to people and pets, especially when applied carelessly or incorrectly.
However, all in all, the best technique to use in getting rid of those squirrels is to use expert wildlife control and removal professionals.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, on whether squirrels will attack humans; I answer to the affirmative that if provoked and they feel endangered squirrels will attack humans and pets equally in the house or in the backyard.</p>

get rid of fleas at your home
if you don&rsquo;t know where they are coming from. So, really, do squirrels <a href="/posts/can-humans-carry-fleas-from-one-home-to-another/">carry</a> fleas?</p>
<p>Wildlife, particularly rodents can easily deposit
eggs or larvae around your yard
which brings a host of challenges for humans.
<strong>To answer this question, YES - squirrels carry fleas. The pests and their eggs can be dropped from the <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-carry-ticks/">squirrel</a>&rsquo;s fur and fall off on your garden</strong>
**, lawn, or yard as the rodent walks through. **
<strong>Fleas jump and attach themselves to their hosts, humans, and animals alike including squirrels. The fleas&rsquo; eggs or larvae that fall off can infest your property when they hatch into adulthood.�</strong>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/pcfleas.htm">Fleas are a type of parasite</a>and live on the body of an animal, including squirrels!</li>
<li>As these flea parasites feed off blood from their host, they can cause some serious health consequences for animals or people who come in contact with them.
If you have observed your pet scratching or grooming themselves excessively, they may be reacting to a flea infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-dogs-get-fleas-from-squirrels">Can Dogs Get Fleas from Squirrels?</h2>
<p>Squirrels can carry fleas. When squirrels come around areas where there are homes, then fleas can jump onto any domesticated pets with ease, which leads to a potential flea infestation.</p>
<p>That being said, you may not need to worry about a flea infestation if your pet never leaves the room.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, when your pet does go outside for an excursion they are well-groomed andtreated with anti-flea preventative measuresbeforehand.
Dogs sometimes come into contact with their fleas-carrying squirrels. The fleas will jump onto the dog hoping for a chance at consuming dog blood or getting a hiding place in the dog&rsquo;s fur</li>
<li>Occasionally, dogs will encounter fleas that have already been riding around on a squirrel and jump onto the new canine friend to find yet another host animal in which to dine.
You might be very careful when it comes to prevention, but there are several ways your dog could still get fleas even if you don&rsquo;t suspect anything.</li>
</ul>
<ol>

<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-fleas-on-pet-squirrels">How Do You Get Rid of Fleas on Pet Squirrels?</h2>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t anyone turn down orphaned squirrels at my practice with Nicole, our manager? I had a good time last night.</p>
<p>Okay, now it&rsquo;s breakfast on the table. My god there are fleas all over her head and back! Whoa, there is a squirrel under that stainless steel table!</p>
<ul>
<li>**Fleas are dangerous parasites that cause severe itching and most importantly, they spread diseases such as plague on humans and pets. But, fleas infestations are treatable and equally preventable. **</li>
<li><strong>Considering the mass epidemic of fleas in recent years, this is good news to everyone. Who would want their pets living with fleas? Theres none! Every animal-loving person will be glad about it.</strong>
So, how do you get rid of fleas on the squirrel?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-bathing-your-pet-squirrels">1. Bathing your Pet Squirrels</h3>
<p>Bathing your Pet Squirrels for fleas is important as it helps to keep the pet clean and healthy.</p>
<p>Bathing your pet squirrels can be tricky, but with a few pointers, you will find that bathing them isn&rsquo;t too bad after all.</p>
<p>The first thing to do before washing any type of animal is to check if the animal has any signs of irritation or infection in their skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are signs that show an outbreak then it would be best not to bathe them at this time because they could worsen the condition.
After checking out for these signs the next step is getting everything set up; fill up a sink or tub with lukewarm water about three inches deep (hot water can burn their skin), and then you will need to gather a washcloth, shampoo (for animals) or dish soap.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with the soap, some people like adding a few drops of lavender oil for an added scent; this is also where you would want to add your pet&rsquo;s favorite type of conditioner if they have any allergies or extra sensitivities.</p>
<p>Now that everything is set up it is time to get them in! It may take some persuading but eventually, most pets figure out how good bath time feels.</p>
<p>Once they are inside put on gloves so as not to irritate their sensitive skin, and start washing using gentle strokes from head-to-toe while making sure all spots are clean including under the chin, in and around the eyes, armpits, genitals.</p>
<p>Remember: Bathe them once a week for fleas!</p>
<h3 id="2-use-flea-sprays-and-shampoos">2. Use Flea Sprays and Shampoos</h3>
<p>Spraying your home with an insecticide can also help keep fleas away from your pet squirrels.</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug spray or shampoo can keep fleas away from squirrels!. Use a spray or shampoo that works for animals.</li>
<li>Insecticide sprays work best, but if you don&rsquo;t want to use them because of the smell, try using pyrethrin-based shampoos.
Hartz spray is specifically designed to kill fleas on contact and last 7 days. However, care should be taken when applying the product around sensitive areas of the body like the nose or eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a flea spray and shampoo. They come in many forms, including liquid sprays and shampoos. You can purchase them online or in stores.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply the chemicals on your pet to kill fleas on contact, and they last for days longer than any other treatment option you might try at home without professional help.</li>
<li>The most common cause of infestation is from hopping outside onto an area where another animal was before them; animals regularly groom themselves which act as a distribution center when they come across
Another flea treatment is Capstar for Dogs. The oral tablet is designed to kill adult fleas and can be used on squirrels, dogs, cats, puppies, or kittens that are at least four pounds of weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flea treatments include Advantage for Cats and Kittens which contains an ingredient called Imidacloprid with another product containing Permethrin - the latter being more effective but not safe around children under six years old as it may irritate their skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another kind of treatment available nowadays is a topical solution like Frontline, a liquid application given once every month; there&rsquo;s also Hartz Ultraguard Plus in both acollar form (long-term)orfleas drop (short term).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remove-wild-squirrels-to-eliminate-fleas">Remove Wild Squirrels to eliminate Fleas</h2>
<p>Did you know that wild squirrels carry fleas and that
they attack humans too
? These pests can get into your home and make it miserable.</p>
<p>The best way to protect yourself from them is by removing their food source, which is the nuts they collect in trees.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need a ladder or tall tree trunk for this project, but once you&rsquo;re up on top of a roof or somewhere close to one, start knocking down all of their nut-laden branches so they fall onto the ground below.</p>
<p>Afterward, leave an empty dish with water where those fallen nuts were collected to encourage them back into the trees instead of around your house!</p>
<p>Wild squirrels are difficult to get rid of, but poisoning them is inhumane and illegal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best way to discourage them from entering your property is through exclusion and trapping with live traps that they have time to enter before snapping closed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-use-a-bait-trap-for-squirrel">1. Use a Bait Trap for squirrel</h3>
<p>There are many different bait traps for squirrels today. To
catch your squirrel
, set the humane trap by smearing peanut butter just inside the opening.</p>
<p>Bait traps are typically used to catch squirrels, but these animals can be very crafty. Its important to follow a few simple guidelines if you plan on using this type of trap successfully.</p>
<p>Set the trap on the ground and leave it to wait. The bait should be a peanut butter sandwich or some other type of sugary food, squirrels love these things.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are three alternative foods that you can use as bait to catch a squirrel: sticky candies, dried food, and nuts.
Bait traps are a safe, humane way to trap and remove squirrels. They have many advantages over other methods of trapping: no chemicals or poisons that can harm the environment; non-lethal capturing without harming the animal in any way.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best bait for use with a bait trap is peanut butter, nuts, bread crumbs, raw bacon (although its not recommended), sunflower seeds, raisins, or fruit cake.</p>
<p>The type of food you choose should be something familiar to your target species and must contain some amount of sugar as well as oil content so that it wont dry out too quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may need more than one type if there are more than one species around because they will

<h3 id="2-frighten-squirrels-using-light-or-loud-noises">2. Frighten Squirrels Using Light or Loud Noises</h3>
<p>To scare off squirrels you are facing in your house, try using light or loud noises.</p>
<p>Light deterrents:</p>
<p>Use light in your yard to scare off squirrels by installing motion-activated lights that can be turned on and off.</p>
<p>For some, this is a temporary fix since the squirrel may come back when it becomes dark outside again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bright light is also a valuable method for deterring squirrels. Set up an exterior light in the room where these infestations occur and leave it on all day and night.
But you can also use solar-powered spotlights with photocell timers or constant LED lighting for added security against nighttime intruders of all sorts; try using infrared bulbs as well if they are sensitive to visible light frequencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loud Sound deterrents:</p>
<p>Use noise generators such as ultrasonic sound devices, sirens, bells, or recordings of natural predators like coyote howls or actual predator calls to deter squirrels from coming too close.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, these should only be used indoors or in enclosed areas like a porch or breezeway where they will not affect neighbors.
The most reliable way to scare a squirrel is with loud noises or sudden movements.</li>
<li>You can also scare them by throwing things, rolling some nuts around outside, or knocking pans together under the tree they live in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-catch-squirrels-with-a-blanket">3. Catch Squirrels with a Blanket</h3>
<p>This might sound like a joke, but it&rsquo;s not. A blanket is a great way to catch squirrels. Its an affordable option and it&rsquo;s pretty easy for anyone with some basic DIY skills.</p>
<p>If they have an area that they sleep in or eat at all day, this is probably their safe zone; most likely because no one else has ever bothered them before.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, find the spot where they are hiding out - it will usually be near their food stash or favorite place to eat in your yard.</li>
<li>Once you&rsquo;ve found the spot try setting up some type of netting (blanket) over it (a tarp would work).
This blanket approach is cost-effective and easy for nearly anyone to implement.</li>
</ul>
<p>If youve found a squirrel that is not able to move, try this trick. Put on heavy gloves so they don&rsquo;t scratch you, and hold the blanket in front of you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk slowly towards the animal to corner them, making sure not to startle them.</li>
<li>Now, drop the blanket fast and try to get them before they run away.
Be gentle when rolling the squirrel in the blanket to avoid hurting them by tightening it too much.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-relocate-the-baby-squirrels">4. Relocate the Baby Squirrels</h3>
<p>If a squirrel with babies has entered your home, you can relocate her and her offspring by removing them from the premises.</p>
<ul>
<li>The professional will place the mother squirrel and her babies in a box or cage for relocation.
There are a few things to consider before trapping squirrels. You will need to ensure that you have the proper equipment, and it is important not to trap too many at one time;</li>
<li>Otherwise, they could be aggressive towards each other or become overcrowded, putting them at risk for various illnesses.
Relocating the baby squirrels will help control fleas in your yard because the mother squirrel will take them away from the site of their former home.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want more information on removing critters from your property, please contact us!</p>
<ul>
<li>We can make sure that any rodent removal is done by professionals who know how to handle these animals with care and respect.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-squirrels-get-along-with-dogs">Do squirrels get along with dogs?</h2>
<p>Yes, squirrels will get along easily with dogs but this may vary with the dog breed as some are more friendly. Some dog breeds may even kill the pet squirrels.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, you can keep dogs and squirrels in the same yard although some breeds of dogs will not get along with them.
Squirrels typically feed on nuts, seeds, and plants. However, they are omnivores so if faced with starvation they will eat other things too such as meat from dead animals or even garbage.</li>
<li>They have been known to raid bird nests for eggs which are not unusual behavior when it comes to mammals of their size.</li>
<li>This presents a problem though because many dogs also enjoy raiding bird nests for the same reason - in fact, some breeds are bred specifically to hunt small game!
Dogs that live near wooded areas might occasionally see squirrels running up trees where there&rsquo;s food at the top, but most often these encounters end badly for either party involved (especially for the squirrel!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Dog owners should be careful about letting their pets chase or scare away any squirrels that come near their homes, as this can lead to squirrels being fearful of humans and running away when they see them.</p>
<p>When you have a squirrel and a dog at the same home, it&rsquo;s important to always monitor their interaction. Dogs can transmit fleas to both dogs and squirrels (and vice versa) - if there are any fleas present in your pet&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<ul>
<li>To avoid either of them getting infested with parasites from each other, consider bathing both more often than you usually would.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-squirrel-fleas-live-on-humans">Can squirrel fleas live on humans?</h2>
<p>Can fleas live on humans?�No, the fleas will not live on humans for more than 24 hours. They usually bite people around the ankles and lower legs (feet) but later jump off to a suitable host or pet bed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that a human could get fleas by handling pets, which are often infected with them, then touching their face without washing hands first.</p>
<p>While it is unlikely to happen if you find yourself in this situation be sure to wash your clothes immediately and take a bath as soon as possible so you can stop any potential spread of disease-carrying parasites.</p>
<h2 id="what-other-problems-do-squirrels-cause">What Other Problems Do Squirrels Cause?</h2>
<p>Squirrels will chew on the insulation and wiring in buildings, potentially causing a fire or other damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can make nests inside attics and cause black mold to grow from their droppings.</li>
<li>A squirrel may also gain access to your home through a pet door or open window vent.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-endoparasites">1. Endoparasites</h3>
<p>Squirrels can be a carrier of fleas, ticks, and other parasites.</p>
<p>A squirrel may also carry bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli on their fur from the environment they inhabit which it can transmit to humans when touched or if its droppings come in contact with human food.</p>
<p>This is why people are advised not to touch wild animals because you never know what diseases they could have or if the animal has rabies that might attack any sudden movements by humans.</p>
<p>Coccidia that is carried by squirrels, for example, can also be passed to cats and dogs. This poses a problem because of the significant impact internal parasites have on their health.</p>
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;re already cute enough without adding more reasons for us to want them around!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-chasing-pets">2. Chasing Pets</h3>
<p>Despite their cute appearance, squirrels can be a nuisance to homeowners.</p>
<ul>
<li>They love climbing up and down trees and houses (spending time in attics), they make noise all day long, the food they eat is not always safe for humans to consume, and then there&rsquo;s chasing pets!
If you have cats or other small animals as house pets like birdcages outside your home where squirrels are frequently seen running around at night-time it may be worth limiting their activity during daytime hours so that they don&rsquo;t get chased away by these pests.</li>
<li>With squirrels causing significant problems for the populations of cats and dogs in many places, certain precautions should be taken.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-transmit-diseases">3. Transmit Diseases</h3>
<p>Pets can be in contact with wildlife and contract different infections, which is why we must be careful. For example, when squirrels come into contact with pets, they
spread rabies to them
.</p>
<p>Another disease that squirrels will transmit to your cars and dogs is Leptospirosis from contaminated urine or water.</p>
<p>With Leptospirosis, the dog may experience kidney or liver failure. Dogs may also contract respiratory tract infections, eye infections, and reproductive disorders.</p>
<p>There can also be parasites such as roundworms, tapeworms, and ticks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squirrels are a public health concern that we need to deal with on more than one level. The best way to do so is by trapping them! It&rsquo;s the humane thing to do.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Squirrels as a species can carry fleas and diseases that may infect human beings. They are also the culprit when our pets get lost, often because of dogs chasing them or getting chased themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>When we encounter these problems with squirrels, it is important to use caution in order not to be bitten by one or pass on an infection.
I hope this post has been informative for you and helped shed light on how to approach dealing with fleas on squirrels.</li>

<h2 id="how-long-do-squirrels-live"><strong>How Long Do Squirrels Live?</strong></h2>
<p>The life span of a <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-attack-humans/">squirrel</a> is dependent on its species and the predisposing factors.�For instance, squirrels in captivity live longer than those that live in the wild. The life span of the squirrels in the wild is shorter than those that live in captivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squirrels have predators like hawks, dogs among other carnivores in the wild. They barely survive even two years of their life. In case this happens, most of these squirrels can live between 6-12 years on average.</li>
<li>Squirrels can be categorized into 3 species which include flying squirrels, ground and tree squirrels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-ground-squirrels-">**1. Ground squirrels **</h3>
<p>Ground squirrels&rsquo;�life span varies from 2-4 years. Female squirrels live longer with a life span of 4 years while male squirrels live up to 2 years. This is according to the research carried out on California ground squirrels.</p>
<h3 id="2-american-red-squirrel-">**2. American red squirrel **</h3>
<p>The average life span of an American red squirrel is 5 years. Though this is not the case with most squirrels and 25% will live beyond one year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike ground squirrels, male red squirrels live longer than female ones.</li>
<li>It takes about 2-4 years for this squirrel to attain its maturity. But, in captivity, their life span can go up to 8 years.
The oldest living red squirrel was recorded to be 10 years.

<p>They are popularly known as eastern fox squirrels. They are mostly found in North America and are known for their distinct color of rich and chest brown.</p>
<ul>
<li>They have a lifespan of 18 years while living as wild squirrels. Females have a longer lifespan than males. A female can live up to 13 years of age while a male can live up to 8 years of age.</li>
<li>However, most of these squirrels will barely live up to maturity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-southern-flying-squirrel-">**4. Southern flying squirrel **</h3>
<p>These are the only flying squirrels in North America. They have an average life span of 3-5 years.
Although the oldest recorded squirrel was 19 years, most flying squirrels will live up to 10 years when in confinement.</p>
<h3 id="5-black-squirrels-">**5. Black Squirrels **</h3>
<p>Black squirrels and the eastern grey squirrels belong to the same species with the only difference being the amount of melanin. The black species has more melanin than the fox grey species.
If in the wild, this species can live up to 6 years but this can increase up to 18 years when in captivity.

<h2 id="factors-that-affect-the-life-span-of-squirrels-">**Factors That Affect the Life Span of Squirrels **</h2>
<p>If you are keeping a squirrel as a pet, there are different factors that can lower or raise the life span of any squirrel. Below is an outline.</p>
<h3 id="1-pest-and-diseases-">**�1. Pest and diseases **</h3>
<p>Squirrels like any other animals are prone to pests and diseases which if not treated, can lead to death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squirrels are very much prone to viral diseases and the most common viral disease is squirrel pox. It is transmitted by insect bites which later turn into a tumor in some squirrels. In others, this virus can lead to skin ulcers, lesions, and scabs.</li>
<li>There are some other squirrels like the European red squirrel who are so vulnerable that they can even die from the infection. However, there are also those squirrels like the grey squirrel that are resistant to the virus.
The most common pests are ticks and
fleas
. There are also parasites that you are likely to see in squirrels-such are flesh fly that lays its larvae on the ground squirrel. These larvae penetrate the squirrels skin and continue feeding on the body tissues of the squirrel.</li>
<li>In this case, the squirrel can only survive for 5-6 days if not treated.</li>
<li>Other parasites are single-celled coccidia which is found in the digestive system. Though its not fatal, it affects can lead to health deterioration of the squirrel.

<h2 id="how-to-scare-away-squirrels">How to Scare Away Squirrels</h2>
<p><strong>1. Squirrel Exclusion Collars</strong>
<em>Want to scare the squirrels?�</em>
Scaring the squirrel can be an effective and proactive approach for the exclusion of squirrels. One of the things that really scare out these squirrels is the collar typically made up of sharp metal.
These collars are positioned around the trees, poles, and bird feeders. When this animal tries to
climb up the pole
, it finds it extremely difficult to climb a smooth metal disk. Not only is it difficult to climb up, but it also injures the squirrels, perhaps the reason for their fright.
<strong>2. Usage of chemicals</strong>
As science has evolved, different kinds of chemicals have been explored and used to clear the place from squirrels; at
times, chemicals can be damaging for squirrels also, which aids in creating a fear factor in these species&rsquo; minds.
Attics are dry, warm, and mostly uninhabited. Thus, it makes it an ideal place for squirrels to settle down, build a place for them, a nest, store food, and try to be protected from other enemies outside.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-attic">How to Get Rid Of Squirrels in the Attic</h2>
<p><strong>1. Close Attic Entry Points</strong>
The basic thing to protect an attic from squirrels is to close all possible and visible entry, and exit points squirrels can utilize.
Make sure you use nails and a hammer to seal all such spots. Please dont give them an easy access point to come over and live and build.
<strong>2. Use of mothballs</strong>
Usage of mothballs has gained acceptance and popularity in the ear past, as they have proven themselves enormously useful when it comes to getting rid of squirrels.
Mothballs are made up of naphthalene balls, which is the chief element in driving out these species. The cost of this method is very affordable, hence the grown usage.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-roof-space">How to Get Rid Of Squirrels In Roof Space</h2>
<p>These days, squirrels are regarded as the peskiest of the pests, mainly due to their tenacity coupled with their devastating fretting and chewing on woodwork.
The two options that have proven themselves most effective are Exclusion and Trapping.
Upon removing squirrels, you must sot let them these species come again to your home.
You must carry out repairs and make sure you animal-proof your property, and consequently, more of this creature will come in to replace their evicted numbers.

<strong>1. Cage Traps</strong>
An evergreen method of catching squirrels is to trap them in cages. This method has remained a useful option ever since its inception.

pets like dogs and cats
