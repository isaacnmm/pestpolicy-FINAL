<h2 id="buyers-guide---best-drain-snake"><strong>Buyers Guide - Best Drain Snake�</strong></h2>
<p>When shopping for a drain snake, it is common for many customers to become overwhelmed by the many varieties that the market has to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is worth noting that price does not always go with quality. So, be keen not to be fooled by shopkeepers who present the pricey products as the best in quality and performance.</li>
<li>Also, different customers may be interested in different features of a product.
So what you see as the qualifying factor in a product may not be the qualifying factor for another customer. Thus, I find it important to share some of the most important factors to consider when buying a drain snake.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considerationswhen-buying-a-drain-snake">Considerations**�when buying a drain snake**</h2>
<p><strong>1. Cable Length</strong>
Drain cleaners come with varying cable lengths. So, depending on the span of your clogs, the ideal cable should be able to reach them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, your cable length will be determined by theplace you livein. Typically, people who live in a single storied house will require a drain unit with a least 25 ft cable, such as Ridgid 41408.
A 25 ft cable will not be the ideal cable for cleaning a bathroom drain on the second floor. You need a unit with at least 25 ft cable length.
<strong>2. Diameter</strong>
A drain snake should slide freely through the drain piping to reach the clogs. That means the diameter of the cable should always be smaller than that of the drain piping.
Experts usually recommend a difference of at least  to 1 between the snake diameter and the pipe diameter.�If you dont know the pipe diameter, go for a small diameter.
<strong>3. Auger Mechanism</strong>
Every snake needs a means of spinning the cable through the drain. Turning of the cable is what makes it possible to negotiate curves and penetrate clogs.
Avoid units that lack an auger mechanism. The auger mechanism you opt for should be reliable. Otherwise, you might spend a lot of time unclogging your drain or even retrieving the cable from the drain.
<strong>4. Head Type</strong>
Drain cleaners come with either fixed or interchangeable heads. If you opt for a snake with a fixed head, choose one that will tackle your most frequent clogs.
In the case of interchangeable heads, choose those that are easy to change. Below are the most common types of head types used for drain snakes.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Screw head</strong>: Also known as coil head, this type of head allows you to pull the blockage. This is a powerful head for removing blockages such as paper towels and other related products.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting head</strong>: A cutting head is the most preferred head for blockages that require cutting. Most professional plumbers prefer this type of cable head.</li>
<li>**Fixed Head:**This type of head is fixed on the cable and cannot be changed.</li>
<li><strong>Interchangeable Head</strong>: When a drain snake comes with an interchangeable head, it provides you with a way of leveraging different heads to cater to different types of clogs. The good thing is that they are easy to change and do not require special tools to change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-drain-snakes"><strong>How to use the Drain Snakes�</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
We&rsquo;ll take the plumber&rsquo;s snake. Next, I&rsquo;ve loosened the thumbscrew, as this will allow me to pull out the snake.
<strong>2.</strong>
Next, we&rsquo;ll pull out the snake and start pushing it into the drainpipe that&rsquo;s clogged. Continue with this process until you meet so relatively high resistance. This resistance means that you&rsquo;ve reached the drain blockage or a bend in the pipe. Check
flea foggers
.
<strong>3.</strong>
But you need to be about 6 inches from the pipe opening. Once I meet some resistance, I&rsquo;ll tighten up the thumbscrew. Now, I&rsquo;ll spin the auger bit, and it&rsquo;ll drill through the blockage. To do this, I&rsquo;ll hold the handle while pushing forward.
<strong>4.</strong>
Now, hold at the end and loosen the nut, pull out the drain snake more, tighten the nut again and repeat the process to drill through more of the drain blockage.
<strong>5.</strong>
When you feel that you&rsquo;ve drilled through most of the blockage, loosen the thumb screen and pull back the drain snake.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to drain clogs of all types, a drain snake would be an ideal solution rather than paying for a plumber&rsquo;s services be.
And although there are various drain snakes out there, not all of them are suitable for your type of drain clog.
So, it is recommended that you access your kind of drain clog to determine the suitable drain snake for you.
Always go for a drain snake that fits into your drain pipes. Oversize drain snakes will not do a good job or, even worse, will end up damaging your pipes.</p>

<h3 id="1-tips-for-repelling-snakes">1. Tips for Repelling Snakes</h3>
<p>Though the products mentioned above work to repel snakes and keep them from invading your yard for some time, there are directions to be followed.</p>
<p>To get started, you have to ensure that you cut grass and clear the clutter. That way, you will have an easy time targeting the areas used by snakes to find their way into your house.</p>
<p>You should check the label of products and follow the directions provided by the manufacturing company. You will learn that some of them require a lot of water, while some come application-ready.</p>
<p>Since some repellents might contain harmful chemicals, make sure to put on protective garments while applying them.</p>
<h3 id="2-does-lime-keep-snakes-away">2. Does Lime Keep Snakes Away?</h3>
<p>Many have been taught to use lime to keep snakes off their turf. However, there is no scientific proof to back this claim.</p>
<p>You might have been told that by putting lime around your property, you will prevent snakes from entering your compound.�Though this might sound a great idea, lime does nothing to prevent snakes from entering your home.</p>
<p>Also, you need to understand that instead, lime is a substance that can be dangerous to your loved ones and pets. It has been reported that lime causes severe skin burn, which is why you should avoid it.</p>
<h3 id="3-does-salt-keep-snakes-away">3. Does salt keep snakes away?</h3>
<p>Many studies have been conducted to confirm whether salt could be used to keep snakes away from home. It is accurate to state that nothing has been found to work.</p>
<p>Instead, the products that contain salt are formulated with other chemicals that might harm your health.�It is essential to consider using methods that have been studied and proven to work.</p>
<p>If anything, snakes do not feed on salt, which is why you cant feed them salt to kill them. Also, salt does not dehydrate snakes, so they will just walk through it and invade your home.</p>
<p>If your property is snake-infested, consider using any of the methods mentioned on this list, and you will be safe.</p>
<h3 id="4-do-mothballs-repel-snakes">4. Do Mothballs repel snakes?</h3>
<p>There is no way you can use mothballs to repel snakes. There is nothing special about mothballs that can make them keep snakes from invading your property.</p>
<p>You need to know that mothballs are a kind of poison and might cause severe damage to your red blood cells. Therefore, you should not even think about using them to control snakes in your home. Worse still, mothballs are known to cause liver failure.</p>
<p>Instead, if you apply mothballs in your garden, you will not do any harm to snakes, but end up poisoning the land. Snakes are dangerous animals, and if you are going to control them, you should use a reliable method.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many types of snake repellents on the market. As a potential buyer, you need to check that a given repellent has effective ingredients that will not harm you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>The other things to look for include price, and ease-of-use. Look for reliable dealers who are known to supply genuine products so that you get value for your money.</p>

Snake Repellents -
Encountering a snake in your home can be a traumatizing experience. Plus, they pose a great danger to your family and your pets and should, therefore, be kept as far away as possible.
Some repellents could have toxic chemicals such as malignant and carcinogens Naphthalene, as outlined by the
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/naphthalene.pdf">EPA</a>
that produces phthalic anhydride. These are the four best snake
repellent for the yard
that has been proven actually to work. They are also quite affordable and easy to use.</p>

What&rsquo;s a Snake Repellent? -
A�Snake repellent is either a
<a href="http://www.wildlifeanimalcontrol.com/homemade-snake.html">natural</a>
, chemical-based (naphthalene) or sonic product created to stop snakes from getting in
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/pest/snake.html">spaces such as yards or houses</a>
. Most of them will contain a repellent ingredient, an adjuvant, and an inert carrier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eugenol,�clove oil, and�cinnamon oil are also great natural snake repellents if sprayed directly on the snakes. Historically,<em>Styrax</em>trees&rsquo; resin was burned for the same purpose of chasing off�poisonous snakes.</li>
<li>What Is in a snake repellent? -The active ingredients in most�chemical-based snake repellents are either (1)<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top">Naphthalene</a>, (2) Sulfur, or (3) both. Naphthalene is also the ingredient in the good old mothballs that&rsquo;ll irritate the snakes&rsquo; receptors.
Naphthalene is a chemical that has an unpleasant smell for snakes and will damage the reptile&rsquo;s retinal system and nerves. It&rsquo;s mainly extracted from the walnut trees (the black type). Natural best snake repellents are
created from�essential oils
like clove, peppermint, castor, and cinnamon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-dr-t"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042XAOJI/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Dr. T&rsquo;s 28 lb. Snake-A-Way Snake Repelling Granules</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0042XAOJI&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Dr.Ts Snake Repellent granule is an EPA-registered granular snake repellent that effectively repels both poisonous and non-poisonous snakes from your home.
This formula contains a powerful combination of 28 percent Sulfur and 7 percent
<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top">Naphthalene</a>
, which creates an unpleasant odor.
When poured around the garden or yard, any snake that attempts to go near the granule is repelled by the pungent smell. By disrupting the snakes sensory reception, the snake slithers away in search of fresh air.
The odor lasts for about 2-3 months, after which you can reapply when it becomes faint. Dr.Ts Nature Snake Repellent is an affordable solution for homeowners dealing with a serious snake infestation. It comes in a 4.3 pounds container.
And given that it has a 91 percent repellency for garter and rattlesnakes, it wont disappoint you in the fight against these dangerous reptiles. See these

According to the manufacturer, this�best snake repellent can offer protection up to 500 sq ft. This will help you deter snakes from accessing areas around your house, flowerbed, garden, garage, cabin, barns, and more.
The product contains a powerful blend of ingredients that temporarily disrupts the reptiles sensory receptors, making it hard for it to smell its prey. The reaction causes it to slither away from your home in search of fresh air.
To use it, attach a garden hose to the bottle (comes with a hose-end) and spray the solution all around your property. However, avoid applying the mixture direct on crops and plants intended for consumption.
Otherwise, when used correctly, its entirely safe for humans, pets, and plants. Its also very affordable. The only disadvantage is that you have to reapply the solution after heavy rains for continued effectiveness.</p>

Next up is this
Snake Defense repellent that&rsquo;ll repel both

This

It&rsquo;ll easily repel the snakes that roam around your house or the fenced area for about 3 months.
But, a notable limitation of this snake repellent is that, compared to the granules repellents, it&rsquo;ll evaporate at a faster rate since it&rsquo;s a liquid. Luckily, it leaves no mess, it&rsquo;s easy to apply, and will snake treat a large lawn area effectively.

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B07P73PNVJ&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Unlike all the snake repellents weve reviewed, the VENSMILE Solar-Powered snake repellent does not use chemicals. Instead, it uses electric shock to scare/repel moles, snakes, and gophers away.
The snake repellent comes in the form of spikes that are strategically placed in targeted areas. The spikes are continuously charged by the built-in solar panels to produce enough electric shock to scare away snakes.
When charged for about 4 hours, the spikes can last for five days. The best snake repellent is waterproof, easy to use, and long-lasting.
The spikes work by emitting penetrating vibration pulses when placed on the ground. Every 55 seconds, the spikes produce powerful vibrations and flashing red light, which irritates the pests, causing them to run off.
Even better, the spikes provide extensive shock coverage and operate in a circular pattern, usually about 100 ft in diameter. This means that for a 1-acre piece of land, youll need to use at least 6 VenSmile spikes.</p>
<h2 id="chemical-snake-repellents">Chemical Snake Repellents</h2>
<p><strong>1. Mothballs</strong>
-�Mothballs are generally accepted by homeowners for repelling snakes. However, their effectiveness has been proven to be higher in repelling�silverfish and�moths compared to snakes. In addition to being less effective against snakes,�Mothballs also contain�neurotoxins that can be toxic to kids and pets.
<strong>2. Sulphur�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If used alone (even in the powdered form), sulfur is highly ineffective in repelling snakes. However, sulfur will work great when combined with naphthalene. For instance, Snake-A-Way combines 7% naphthalene and 28% sulfur to control even rattle and garter snakes.
The chemical snake repellents are created to produce a pungent smell that will be harsh on the snakes. The snakes&rsquo; mouthparts (
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/26/4/433/266106">vomeronasal organs</a>
), as opposed to their nose or nostrils, will sense the smell of the odor particles that the reptile picks up with its tongues.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>What about sonic repellents? Well, these types of snake repellents will produce sounds with a frequency that only the snakes will detect (and not human beings).
The key to note is that the unique frequency sound is both irritating and unpleasant to the snakes, and thus, the reptiles will move away from that area.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-terrariums-for-snakes"><strong>How to Choose the Best Terrariums for Snakes</strong></h2>
<p>A pet snake wont serve its purpose if it is not housed properly. A good terrarium should not only give you a good display of your pet but also provide a comfortable environment for the reptile.
In this guide, Ill take you through some important factors to consider when searching for the right enclosure for your snake.
<strong>The Size of the Terrarium</strong>
Snake pets come in different sizes and species. Some species are more active than others, meaning they exhibit a lot of movement inside a cage. Therefore, when selecting a cage, consider the length of your snake and its activity level.
You can choose a cage that is at least  of the snakes length. However, these criteria may not apply when you add too many accessories to enhance the cage&rsquo;s beauty. In this case, you should consider a cage that is longer than the snake.
<strong>Ventilation</strong>
Just like humans, snakes need to breathe correctly for their survival. Therefore, a good snake cage should allow air to get in and out. Most of the cages have meshed screens on their top for ventilation and lighting.
Some have additional vents on their sides and near the door to increase airflow in and out of the cage.
<strong>Heating and Lighting</strong>
Snakes thrive well when provided with an environment that mimics their natural habitat. Right temperature and lighting are essential parameters for the survival and comfort of your snake.
Therefore, ensure that the cage comes with a means for heating and lighting. You might need a thermometer to monitor the temperature in the cage to maintain the optimum temperature.
<strong>Security</strong>
You cant risk losing your adorable pet. Its both painful and a waste of money. So, you should ensure you get a secure terrarium with no possible escape routes for your pet. If the snake gets out of the cage, it may run into the bush, get trampled on the floor, or get
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">killed by your dog</a>
or cat.
It also ensures that your cage comes with a reliable lock to prevent your kid&rsquo;s or pets&rsquo; accidental opening.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Like other pets, snake pets should be taken care of to have a quality life. And apart from diet, they require an excellent terrarium that blends their natural habitat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your typical terrarium will essentially be determined by your budget and the size of the snake.</li>
<li>Other factors to consider include ventilation, security, and the ability to regulate temperature and humidity.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Encountering a <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">snake</a>, especially a long, dark one, can be an unnerving experience for many homeowners. While the immediate reaction might be fear, it&rsquo;s important to remember that many &ldquo;<a href="/posts/black-gutters-on-brick-house-ideas/">black</a> snakes&rdquo; commonly found in gardens are non-venomous and actually beneficial to the ecosystem. These reptiles play a crucial role in controlling populations of rodents and other pests, making them valuable allies rather than threats. However, knowing how to identify them, understanding their behavior, and taking appropriate safety measures are key to ensuring a peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>In regions like Kenya, where a diverse array of snake species exists, identifying a &ldquo;black snake&rdquo; can be more complex, as several species might fit this description, some of which could be venomous. This guide will focus on general principles for dealing with black snakes, emphasizing identification, safety, and humane deterrence, providing a framework for managing encounters around your home and garden responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-black-snakes---a-local-context">Identifying &ldquo;Black Snakes&rdquo; - A Local Context</h2>
<p>When someone refers to a &ldquo;black snake,&rdquo; they often have a specific non-venomous species in mind, such as the Eastern Ratsnake (<em>Pantherophis obsoletus</em>) or Black Racer (<em>Coluber constrictor</em>) in North America. These are common and harmless. However, in Kenya, &ldquo;black snake&rdquo; can refer to a wider range of species, and accurate identification is paramount.</p>
<p>Here are general characteristics to observe, but always consult local wildlife experts for definitive identification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size and Build:</strong> Black snakes can range from slender to robust. Note the length and thickness.</li>
<li><strong>Scales:</strong> Are they glossy or dull? Smooth or keeled (ridged)?</li>
<li><strong>Head Shape:</strong> Triangular or oval? Is the head distinct from the neck? (Note: While often cited, head shape alone is not a definitive indicator of venomousness, as many non-venomous snakes can flatten their heads when threatened).</li>
<li><strong>Pupils:</strong> Round or slit? (Round pupils are generally, but not exclusively, associated with non-venomous snakes).</li>
<li><strong>Behavior:</strong> How does it move? Is it aggressive, or does it try to escape? Does it rattle its tail (even if it doesn&rsquo;t have a rattle)? Does it coil in a striking posture?</li>
<li><strong>Markings:</strong> Even if predominantly black, look for subtle patterns, bands, or specks of other colors, especially on the underside or when scales separate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note for Kenya:</strong> Several common &ldquo;black&rdquo; or very dark snakes in Kenya include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black Mamba (<em>Dendroaspis polylepis</em>):</strong> Highly venomous. Long, slender, active, often arboreal. Mouth lining is dark.</li>
<li><strong>Cobra species (e.g., Black-necked Spitting Cobra, Forest Cobra):</strong> Can be very dark or black. Venomous. May rear up and spread a hood when threatened.</li>
<li><strong>House Snakes (<em>Boaedon fuliginosus</em> or <em>lineatus</em>):</strong> Common, non-venomous, nocturnal. Often dark brown to black, can have iridescent sheen. Slender. Beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>Mole Snakes (<em>Pseudaspis cana</em>):</strong> Can be uniform black, non-venomous but will hiss and strike defensively. Robust body. Excellent rodent control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Always assume a dark-colored snake in Kenya could be venomous unless you are 100% certain of its identification as a harmless species. Err on the side of caution.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-snakes-are-in-your-garden">Why Snakes Are In Your Garden</h2>
<p>Snakes are attracted to areas that provide:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Food Sources:</strong> Rodents (mice, rats), frogs, lizards, insects, and sometimes bird eggs. If you have a rodent problem, you&rsquo;re likely to attract snakes.</li>
<li><strong>Shelter:</strong> Tall grass, dense shrubs, rock piles, woodpiles, compost heaps, leaf litter, debris, foundations, and cracks in structures offer hiding spots from predators and extreme weather.</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Bird baths, leaky faucets, ponds, or even consistently damp areas.</li>
<li><strong>Warmth/Coolth:</strong> Paved areas and rocks can provide warmth for basking, while shady spots or burrows offer refuge from heat.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="safety-precautions-when-encountering-a-snake">Safety Precautions When Encountering a Snake</h2>
<p>Your safety and the snake&rsquo;s well-being are paramount.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do Not Approach or Provoke:</strong> Give the snake plenty of space. Do not attempt to touch, pick up, or harass it. Most bites occur when people try to handle or kill snakes.</li>
<li><strong>Remain Calm:</strong> Sudden movements can startle a snake. If you discover a snake nearby, freeze, then slowly back away.</li>
<li><strong>Identify if Possible (from a safe distance):</strong> Use binoculars if necessary. Note its size, color, patterns, and behavior. <strong>Do not get close for identification.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Assume Venomous (especially in Kenya):</strong> If you are unsure of the species, treat it as potentially venomous.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Pets and Children Away:</strong> Ensure curious pets and children do not approach the snake.</li>
<li><strong>Call for Professional Help:</strong> If the snake is in a dangerous location (e.g., inside your house, in a high-traffic area, or you suspect it&rsquo;s venomous) and you are uncomfortable dealing with it, contact:
<ul>
<li>Local wildlife removal services.</li>
<li>Snake rescue organizations.</li>
<li>Your local KWS (Kenya Wildlife Service) office or a registered snake handler if in Kenya.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Attempt to Kill:</strong> Killing snakes is often illegal, dangerous, and unnecessary. Many species are protected, and you risk a bite.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dealing-with-non-venomous-black-snakes">Dealing with Non-Venomous Black Snakes</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re certain the snake is non-venomous and it&rsquo;s in an undesirable location:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Leave It Alone:</strong> Often, if left undisturbed, the snake will move on its own within a few hours.</li>
<li><strong>Gentle Encouragement:</strong> For snakes on a patio or walkway, you can gently spray it with a garden hose from a distance to encourage it to move away. Alternatively, use a long broom or rake to gently nudge it towards a safe exit point.</li>
<li><strong>Provide an Escape Route:</strong> Ensure it has a clear path to nearby cover (e.g., a bush, tall grass).</li>
<li><strong>Capture and Relocate (with extreme caution, only if knowledgeable):</strong> If you are experienced and comfortable, you can use a long stick and a bucket or a specialized snake hook to gently scoop the snake into a container and release it in a suitable, remote location away from homes. This is generally best left to professionals.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="preventing-snakes-in-your-yard-and-garden">Preventing Snakes in Your Yard and Garden</h2>
<p>The best way to deal with snakes is to make your property less inviting to them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eliminate Food Sources:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rodent Control:</strong> Implement effective rodent control strategies. Seal entry points into your home, keep pet food secure, clear fallen fruit, and manage garbage. This is the single most effective deterrent.</li>
<li><strong>Insect Control:</strong> Manage insect populations, especially grubs and slugs, if they are abundant and attracting snakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Remove Shelter and Hiding Spots:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mow Lawns Regularly:</strong> Keep grass short, especially near foundations and outbuildings.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Debris:</strong> Remove piles of rocks, logs, firewood, leaf litter, and construction debris. Store firewood on racks elevated off the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Trim Landscaping:</strong> Keep shrubs and bushes trimmed, especially those close to the ground or house.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Entry Points:</strong> Seal cracks and crevices in your home&rsquo;s foundation, around pipes, and under doors. Use snake-proof mesh over vents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Manage Water Sources:</strong> Fix leaky faucets, remove standing water, and consider modifying bird baths to be less appealing to snakes (e.g., raised, with steep sides).</li>
<li><strong>Physical Barriers (for specific areas):</strong>
<ul>
<li>For highly sensitive areas (e.g., children&rsquo;s play areas, chicken coops), consider installing snake fencing. This is typically a fine-mesh hardware cloth or similar material, buried at least 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) deep and extending 60-90 cm (2-3 feet) high, with the top few inches angled outwards to prevent climbing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Predator Awareness:</strong> Encourage natural predators of snakes, such as birds of prey, if appropriate for your area.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Encountering a black snake in your home or garden can be startling, but it&rsquo;s crucial to react calmly and responsibly. While some black snakes, particularly in regions like Kenya, can be venomous, many are harmless and even beneficial pest controllers. Prioritize safety by never approaching or provoking a snake you cannot definitively identify as non-venomous. Focus on making your yard less appealing to snakes by eliminating their food sources and hiding spots. By understanding snake behavior and implementing preventative measures, you can create a safer environment for both your family and these fascinating, often misunderstood, creatures. If ever in doubt, or if a snake is in a dangerous location, always contact a local wildlife professional for safe and humane removal.</p>

**Well, the question here is, Do Snakes Have Feelings? The direct answer is YES! Snakes have feelings (just like other reptiles) that generate varying emotional reaction. **
<strong>Snake can feel hungry, it can get angered (sad), it can generate fear, it can be happy or respond to touch. The response to these feelings may be more aggressive or calm according to the type snake you are dealing with.</strong>

<h2 id="details-do-snakes-have-feelings">Details: Do Snakes Have Feelings?</h2>
<p>Various scientific researchers have proven that snake have feelings. The can show hunger, anger, happiness, fear or respond to touch. However, most snakes show varying emotional reactions towards some of these feelings.</p>
<h3 id="1-anger-feelings"><strong>1. Anger feelings</strong></h3>
<p>Often, most snakes when angered, they react by biting. They would rebel their enemies by threatening to bite them or spiting their poisonous/venomous saliva. �This defensive reaction is brought by sadness feelings that has materialized/accumulated in them.</p>
<p>Snakes generate anger because of life stresses, hunger and reproduction occurrences. When each of these causes of anger materializes, they make snakes to respond with mixed negative reactions that may harm other snakes, pets or humans.</p>
<p>Importantly, the snake that has anger feelings usually shows calmness, does not seem to move about, frequently , turn its eyes from its hideout, raises it head and back (python) or pushes its tongue back and forth severally.</p>
<p>Angered snake will suddenly attack you on approach and retreat or escape.</p>
<h3 id="2-hunger-feelings"><strong>2. Hunger Feelings.</strong></h3>
<p>Snakes shows the hunger feelings by flicking out their tongues regularly. They will keep moving about in their cage (possibly looking for food). Normally, snakes will tend to be rebellious and angry when hungry. When hungry, snakes will tend to resist their owner and even attack any visitor in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Contrary, snakes that are fully fed remain calm. They do not move about in their cage a lot (though some may move to stretch their bodies and bask under the sun). Snakes in full stomach tend to be friendlier to the owner and visitors too.</p>
<h3 id="3-fear">3. Fear</h3>
<p>Snakes often generate fear. Mostly, fear glows when snakes detect attack from its assailant. The reaction may be by attacking the enemy (using its venom) or escaping by lateral undulation.</p>
<p>The snake is believed to have senses that enables them to detect any attack (this is pronounced in the black mamba species). It will often notice you before reach to kill it.</p>
<p>Snakes use their thermal vision, color and smell to located their enemies and prey.</p>
<h3 id="4-touch-feeling-response"><strong>4. Touch Feeling Response.</strong></h3>
<p>Most Snake negatively if you try to reach and pick them by hands. Some snake like anaconda or python will bite you on touch.</p>
<p>All snake species respond immediately to touch. These cold-blooded reptiles will detect your touch instantly using thermal receptors in their skin.</p>
<p>Though snakes can be held by hands after training/bonding, most of them are not comfortable (they tend to coil out of your hands once held).</p>
<h2 id="can-snakes-feel-love">Can Snakes Feel Love?</h2>
<p>No! Unlike human beings, snakes do not have any intellectual capacity and capability to feel love or get affectionate. Snakes can get friendly with the owner, but they may not generate any love feelings towards him/her.</p>
<p>Normally, the snake feels the connective care of a creature (owner) that is not threatening and that which will offer care. Snake owners tend to think that snakes are affectionate when they coil around them  this is usually not the truth, snakes have no capability. The love instinct, which is emotionally connected, does not exists in snakes at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, snakes do not show love to other pets either. The relationship between snakes and their mates doesnt last for long after reproduction activity is done  this tells why snake can mate anywhere it meets the female.</p>
<h2 id="can-snake-be-petted">Can Snake be Petted?</h2>
<p>You can pet a snake. This may not be that easy at first. However, snakes will get free when they realize that you are not a threat or source of food. As the owner, you must maintain a continuous care for your snakes to create that close bond with them.</p>
<p>Importantly, you must involve a vet for regular check on it emotional reactions, the venomous content and level of human-pet freedom gained.</p>
<p>Though you can pet snakes, it is not always assured that petted snakes will respond positively to you (owners) or other humans. You therefore need to check on the feelings and emotional conditions of your snakes before interacting with them.</p>
<h2 id="do-snakes-have-a-personality">Do Snakes Have A Personality?</h2>
<p>Scientific researches shows that snakes have a certain level of personalities that can be assigned to them. They are able to associate with human beings and shows clearly their preference. When a snake is not comfortable with a given condition or feed, it react differently.</p>
<p>You will find that various species of snakes live differently in their cage or nest  it is not possible for different snake species to live in the same cage (they may fight).</p>
<p>Snakes such as anaconda, black mamba and python are associated with strong personalities as compared to green snakes.</p>
<h2 id="can-snakes-be-friendly">Can Snakes be Friendly?</h2>
<p>Normally, snakes are known to be dangerous and venomous reptiles. Naturally, snakes are friendly to human  only that they feel threated in presence of humans who tend to kill them.</p>
<p>Snakes love to stay in homes than in forest or bushes. Research shows that many snakes have been found in bed sleeping next to human without harming them.</p>
<p>This shows that most snake are friendly if assured of their life security. The idea of training the snakes has even made snakes become friendlier with humans and pets without negative reactions.</p>
<p>King snake and ball pythons are the friendliest snakes for any beginners. Make sure you do not annoy the snake as it may turn aggressive.</p>
<h2 id="can-snake-be-tamed">Can Snake Be Tamed</h2>
<p>Unlike Dogs and cat, snakes cannot be tamed or domesticated to serve various activities in their cage. Even though they are partially friendly, they will remain and die as wild reptiles full of reactive feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>You cannot leave your kid with wild snakes such as boa, anaconda, python or black mamba  they may get violent kill the child.</p>
<p>There is no single successful snake taming that has been carried out in the universe  most attempt have only made snakes friendlier to human beings than before.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Snakes, like human beings, have feelings of anger/sadness, hunger, happiness, pain, fear and can response to touch. Snakes are not friendly to human at first and will react by defending themselves or escaping in case they spot you.</p>
<p>However, continuous bonding through feeding of snakes make them friendlier. It is important to note that snakes cannot be tamed and will remain wild throughout their life. You should therefore asses their feelings before attending them.</p>
