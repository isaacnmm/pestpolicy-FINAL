<p>1.

, or dirt to ensure a smooth sanding surface.
2.
<strong>Choose the Right Sander</strong>
For deck sanding, consider using a random orbital sander or a belt sander. These types of sanders are effective at removing old finishes and smoothing out imperfections on wood surfaces.
3.
<strong>Safety First</strong>
Always wear appropriate protective gear, including safety goggles and a dust mask, to shield yourself from dust and debris generated during sanding.
4.
<strong>Begin Sanding</strong>
Start sanding the deck boards, following the wood grain in long, smooth strokes. Apply even pressure on the sander to achieve consistent results.
5.
<strong>Address Troublesome Areas</strong>
Pay extra attention to any stubborn stains or imperfections. You may need to spend additional time on these areas to ensure they are properly sanded.
6.
<strong>Switch Sandpaper Grits</strong>
Start with coarser grit sandpaper, such as 60 or 80 grit, to remove the old finish and any rough spots. Once the surface is even and smooth, switch to a finer grit, like 120 or 150, for a finer finish.
7.
<strong>Clean the Deck</strong>
After sanding, use a broom or vacuum to remove dust and debris from the deck.
8.
<strong>Apply a Finish</strong>
Once the deck is thoroughly cleaned, you can apply a new finish, such as stain or sealant, to protect and enhance the wood.
