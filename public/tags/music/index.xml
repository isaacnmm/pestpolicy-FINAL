<h2 id="considerations-in-choosing-the-best-camera-for-music-videos-">**Considerations in Choosing the Best Camera for Music Videos **</h2>
<p>**1. Camera Sensor and **
<strong>Autofocus</strong>
The performance of a camera will highly depend on the type and size of the sensor. Of course, higher pixels combined with the large-sized sensor results in better resolution. Thats because they can capture more details in an instance compared to those with low resolution.
The advantage of high resolution is that it allows you to crop your images without diminishing their quality. So, you should consider the camera sensor configuration depending on your desired level of resolution.
Autofocus, usually written as the AF system, is a technology that is gaining a lot of popularity in camera making technologies. AF system enables you to focus on the targeted scene with better accuracy.
**2. Viewfinder and **
<strong>Image Stabilization</strong>
Sometimes, its common to concentrate on the cameras pixels and forget the viewfinder. A viewfinder allows you to select and capture the intended details only. In this, you choose the subject using a frame.
An adequate viewfinder will capture only the selected features and block everything outside the frame. So, when choosing your camera to ensure it comes with a viewfinder sufficient to ensure you get the desired results.
This is a technology built into a mirrorless camera or lens to help reduce blurs that occur due to camera motion. It works by automatically adjusting the position of the camera lens to compensate for the tilt and pan induced by a shaky camera. Thus, you can shoot videos while holding the camera with your hands and still get high-quality images.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>To get many YouTube subscribers, you require a camera with a larger sensor, interchangeable lenses, fast Auto-focus speed, &amp; better depth of field/focus for
different music video shots
.
Its never easy to choose the best camera for shooting music videos. Cameras come in different qualities, ease-of-use, robustness, and budget. Most of the high-end cameras come at higher prices because of their premium build and superb performance.
However, therere middle-level cameras that will give you quality performance with a little pinch in your pocket. Whichever your choice, ensure what youre getting matches the quality of music videos you want to produce.</p>

(DAWs) and handle multiple tracks with minimal pops and clicks.</p>
<p><em>But, is MacBook Air good for music production? Yes,�MacBook Air use an Intel i7 2.2GHz dual-core processor, and its thus a powerful laptop in the music production and live music tasks due to its fast speed. You can boost the i7 up to 3.2GHz to boost performance.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>As a second choice in studio recording, audio-processing &amp; mixing tasks, I recommend the Apple 15 inch MacBook Pro as the best laptop for music production.�</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1macbook-pro-retina-mid-2015---my-top-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DF43SY3/?tag=p-policy-20">1.MacBook Pro Retina Mid-2015 - My Top Pick</a></h2>
<p>This MacBook Pro is also the best laptop for music production in addition to being the
Top Mac
. For music production, ignore MacBook Pro (13&quot; Retina, Touch Bar).</p>
<dl>
<dt>I do home-recording demos running 31-40 tracks and 2-5 Plugins, &amp; 6-8 VST Instruments. This quad-core i7 MacBook Pro stopped my track freezing, and its 16GB RAM easily runs huge sample Instruments. It</dt>
<dt>works with m</dt>
<dt>ost DAWs, MIDI controllers, &amp; audio interfaces.</dt>
<dt><em>Here are its qualifying features</em></dt>
<dd>It has Core-Audio support, quiet keyboard (forget the noisy butterfly keys - in the newer models), has pre-installed audio packages (like Garageband DAW and Logic Pro X), HDMI,
*FaceTime HD camera, *
and full-sized USB Ports (USB 2.0 &amp; USB 3.0). Installing Logic DAW can enhance music production.
For extra memory bandwidth, the MacBook Pro comes with a 128 MB (Crystalwell) installed DRAM for your
CPU
. Its graphics processor (Intel Iris Pro 5200) will share memory (1 GB) with your system to allow the proper operation of its graphics. It has enough power to proved the resources to handle the symphonic synth or sample plugins - particularly when creating huge symphony-epic soundtracks.
Side Note
*: Factmag notes that faster MacBook Pro 2018 (processor and SSD - read &amp; write) won&rsquo;t considerably enhance your music production (despite having better specs than MacBook Pro 2015). It has overheating issues - since everyone is demanding more processing power and a very thin laptop. It has fewer USB ports - thus, you&rsquo;ll want a dongle or USB-C hubs. *
*MagSafe is gone - take care on stage. *
Verdict: MacBook Pro Retina 2015 satisfies most of the music production needs - becoming the best <a href="/posts/best-laptop-for-video-editing/">laptops</a> for recording music and

Compared to Apple laptops, this Dell&rsquo;s XPS 15 (among the thinnest 15 inch PC) will give you comparable performance in the studio but at a lower budget.
I love it for its top performance and style while running the DAWs for music production with a lovely ease. To handle multiple tasks and tracks, it has a 16GB RAM and an 8th Generation processor (Intel Core i7), which will quickly run the XFer&rsquo;s Serum.
With Dell XPS 15&rsquo;s touchscreen, you can make fast adjustments on tracks or quickly shift between music timelines - while still adding records to the production workflow. I loved its Ultra HD InfinityEdge display that is bright and has thin bezels for a lighter view.

Luckily, the laptop is lightweight as it&rsquo;s below 3 pounds, which is excellent for on-the-go/traveling music recording or mixing. Its capacitive touchscreen allows gestures and is multi-touch.
Using my Ableton Live, I quickly did Real-time audio processing from multiple digital audio streaming. Razer Blade working on Windows OS will be an excellent option for making music and DJing (with Traktor or Serato). Its touchpad has multi-finger functionality but comes with a plastic shallow click feel. Further, the Dolby Digital speakers (stereo) will send the sound up.
For your studio work, the Razor Blade Stealth comes with an HDMI 2.0 out Port, USB-C Ports (1), and USB 3.0 Ports (3). Thus it&rsquo;s possible to connect your music-making accessories and gear readily. Its backlit keyboard has substantially spaced keys (and with the excellent color theme  the green-on-black).</p>
