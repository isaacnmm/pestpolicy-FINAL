<strong>sealer for pressure-treated wood?</strong></p>
<h3 id="2-paint-canister-feed-type">2. Paint canister feed type</h3>
<p>The paint canister can either feature a gravity or conventional feed design. Gravity feeds are preferred because they are conveniently attached in an upside-down position.
Thus, they use less air pressure than siphon-feed designs by leveraging gravity to offer you a more atomized spray jet. The latter designs feed is attached to the spray gun&rsquo;s bottom and works by utilizing air pressure to release the fluid.</p>
<h3 id="3-nozzle-size-and-air-compressor">3. Nozzle size and Air compressor</h3>
<p>The ideal nozzle size highly depends on the type of paint you intend to use. You require nozzles with relatively larger holes if you are dealing with heavier paints, such as primers.
On the other hand, thinner paint coatings and overcoats require smaller jets for even coverage across the surface. This feature creates pressurized air to allow it to eject paint through the jet.
Hence, regularly cleaning and maintaining the spray gun is the key to ensuring you maintain the right pressure for all your automotive painting needs. The features to look for include the cubic feet per minute rating (CFM), pounds per square inch (PSI), and tank size.</p>
<h3 id="4-ease-of-cleaning-and-maintenance">4. Ease of cleaning and maintenance</h3>
<p>You might want to paint canisters with non-stick designs that allow for cleaning it easily with thinners.
Aluminum alloy designs are preferred for easy to wash and dry capabilities. Your ideal pick should also be resistant to corrosion.</p>
