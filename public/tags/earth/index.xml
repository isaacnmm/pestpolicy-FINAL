      <description>A comprehensive, real-talk guide comparing Diatomaceous Earth (DE) and Borax for fleas. As a pet owner, here&amp;#39;s my experience on which powder is safer and more effective for your home.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You saw it, didn&rsquo;t you? That tiny black speck that jumped. Maybe it was on your ankle, or maybe you saw it on your pet’s white fur. That single moment sends a wave of dread through any homeowner, and it leads to the same frantic, late-night internet search: &ldquo;how to get rid of fleas FAST.&rdquo; That search will inevitably lead you to two popular DIY solutions: white powders that promise to end the infestation in your carpets. One of them is likely the familiar box of <span style="color:red;">[20 Mule Team <a href="/posts/borax-flea-killer/">Borax</a>](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000R4L32E/?tag=p-policy-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000R4L32E/?tag=p-policy-20</a>)</span> from the laundry aisle, a product you&rsquo;ve seen for years.</p>
<p>The other contender is a powder you may have heard of but don&rsquo;t know as well, called <span style="color:red;">[Food-Grade Diatomaceous <a href="/posts/diatomaceous-earth/">Earth</a>](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harris-Diatomaceous-Earth-Powder-Duster/dp/B072J8Z28F?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=f7253eb7f0f22c7858d1c74cbccc18e7&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">https://www.amazon.com/Harris-Diatomaceous-Earth-Powder-Duster/dp/B072J8Z28F?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=f7253eb7f0f22c7858d1c74cbccc18e7&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl</a>)</span>. Both are inexpensive, and countless forums and articles claim they’re the secret to winning the war against fleas. On the surface, they seem interchangeable. But they are not. As someone who has navigated the stress of a flea infestation with pets in the house, I can tell you that the difference between these two powders is profound. It’s not just about what works—it’s about what’s safe for the family you’re trying to protect.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-real-enemy-why-fleas-are-so-hard-to-kill">Understanding the Real Enemy: Why Fleas Are So Hard to Kill</h3>
<p>Before we even talk about powders, you have to understand that the adult fleas you see are only about 5% of the total problem. The other 95% of the infestation is hiding in your carpets, furniture, and pet bedding as eggs, larvae, and pupae. This is why a single treatment rarely works; you have to break the entire life cycle. Any effective solution must address not only the biting adults but also the next generation waiting to emerge.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-diatomaceous-earth-the-natural-assassin">What is Diatomaceous Earth? The Natural Assassin</h3>
<p>The easiest way to picture Diatomaceous Earth (DE) is as microscopic, jagged fossils. It’s a natural powder made from the fossilized remains of tiny aquatic organisms called diatoms. While it feels soft like flour to us, on a microscopic level, it’s incredibly sharp and abrasive. This is its secret weapon. DE is a <em>mechanical</em> killer, not a chemical one. It doesn’t poison fleas. Instead, when a flea walks through the powder, the sharp particles physically scrape away the waxy, protective outer layer of its exoskeleton. This process fatally dehydrates the flea, killing it from the outside in. Because this is a physical attack, fleas can&rsquo;t develop a resistance to it like they can with chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>The most important thing you need to know is that you <strong>must</strong> use <strong>food-grade DE</strong>. This grade is mined from freshwater sources and is purified to be safe for mammals. It&rsquo;s so safe, in fact, that it’s often used as a health supplement and in animal feed to control internal parasites. This is the powder you want in your home. (Do not confuse it with &ldquo;pool-grade&rdquo; DE, which is chemically treated and dangerous to inhale).</p>
<h3 id="what-is-borax-the-common-household-chemical">What is Borax? The Common Household Chemical</h3>
<p>You probably have Borax in your laundry room right now. It’s a naturally occurring mineral salt, and there’s no question that it is an effective insecticide. Borax works as both a desiccant (like DE) and, more potently, as a stomach poison. As fleas move through a treated carpet, the small crystals get stuck to their bodies. When they groom themselves, they ingest the Borax, which shreds their insides and kills them. It’s brutally effective.</p>
<p>However—and for me, this is the deal-breaker—<strong>Borax is toxic if ingested by pets or children.</strong> If your dog or cat licks the powder from their paws or grooms it out of their fur after walking on a treated carpet, they can suffer from skin irritation, digestive distress, vomiting, and in severe cases, even more serious health consequences.</p>
<h3 id="the-verdict-for-pet-owners-its-not-even-a-debate">The Verdict: For Pet Owners, It’s Not Even a Debate</h3>
<p>When I weigh the options, the choice becomes crystal clear. Why would I introduce a known toxin into my home to solve one problem, only to create a potential health emergency for my pet? It&rsquo;s a risk I&rsquo;m not willing to take.</p>
<p>For any household with pets or small children, <strong>food-grade Diatomaceous Earth is the only responsible choice.</strong> It&rsquo;s just as effective at killing fleas over time, but it comes without the scary risks. The peace of mind you get from knowing your pets are safe while you treat your home is worth everything.</p>
<h3 id="my-complete-step-by-step-battle-plan-for-using-de">My Complete Step-by-Step Battle Plan for Using DE</h3>
<p>Just sprinkling some powder around won&rsquo;t cut it. You need a strategy. Here is the exact method I use to successfully eradicate fleas.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: The All-Important Prep Work</strong>
Before you even open the bag of DE, you have to prepare the environment. Start by treating your pet with a veterinarian-approved flea treatment. Then, wash all of your pet&rsquo;s bedding, blankets, and any washable fabrics in hot water. Finally, you need to vacuum. Vacuum everything—carpets, rugs, sofas, chairs, and especially the corners and edges of rooms. This not only sucks up some of the existing fleas and eggs but the vibration also encourages the dormant pupae to hatch, exposing the new adult fleas to the treatment you&rsquo;re about to lay down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: The Application</strong>
Now it&rsquo;s time to apply the DE. I highly recommend wearing a simple dust mask for this part, as the fine powder can be irritating if you breathe it in. You want to apply a <strong>light, even dusting</strong>, not a thick pile. A heavy application can actually deter fleas from walking through it. Use a powder duster for a fine mist, or simply use your hand to gently shake it over your carpets and furniture. Make sure to get it along baseboards, under cushions, and into all the dark, hidden places where fleas love to hide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: The Waiting Game</strong>
This is the hardest part: patience. DE does not kill instantly. You need to leave the powder down for at least <strong>48 to 72 hours</strong>. This gives the fleas ample time to move through the powder and begin the dehydration process. During this time, it’s best to limit activity in the treated rooms if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: The Final Clean-Up</strong>
After a few days, it&rsquo;s time to vacuum again. Use a vacuum with a good filter and go over all the treated areas thoroughly. This will remove the DE along with the dead fleas. Immediately after you finish, take the vacuum canister or bag outside to empty it into a sealed garbage bag. You don&rsquo;t want any survivors crawling back out of your vacuum.</p>
<p>Because new fleas can continue to hatch for a couple of weeks, you should <strong>repeat this entire process once a week for at least two to three weeks.</strong> This persistence is the key to breaking the life cycle completely.</p>
<p>For a reliable and safe product, I always point people towards something like the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harris-Diatomaceous-Earth-Powder-Duster/dp/B072J8Z28F?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=f7253eb7f0f22c7858d1c74cbccc18e7&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Harris Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth with Duster</a></strong>. It&rsquo;s an effective tool in your arsenal that lets you fight back against fleas without compromising the safety of your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diatomaceous earth, anyone? You probably were searching for remedies to the roach infestation in your home or a solution to fleas that have become a nuisance to your pet and stumbled on
Diatomaceous <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/degen.html">earth</a>
.
And now you are wondering what this Diatomaceous earth is. This article is going to lay down all the facts about Diatomaceous earth and its benefits.
<strong>Definition:</strong>
Diatomaceous earth is a naturally occurring siliceous sedimentary rock made from fossilized tiny aquatic organisms. These tiny organisms are called diatoms, and they contain shells of single-cell hard-shelled algae-like water plants. Diatomaceous easily crumbles to form a white to an off-white fine powder.

<h2 id="diatomaceous-earth---uses-side-effects-interactions">Diatomaceous Earth - Uses, Side Effects, Interactions</h2>
<p>This powder leaves a dusty effect on your hands.</p>
<ol>
<li>**Other names:**DE, diatomite. Read Also:Does Diatomaceous Earth Kill Bed Bugs?</li>
<li>**Size:**The particle size of the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-dogs/">diatomaceous earth</a>ranges from 10 micrometers to 200 micrometers.</li>
<li>**Formation:**Diatomaceous earth is formed by accumulating diatoms in the sediments of oceans, rivers, and lakes.</li>
<li>**Composition: **The major component in the diatomaceous earth is Silica. It takes 85%. Others are Sodium-5%, Magnesium-3%, Iron-2%.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="silica">Silica</h2>
<p>Silica is among the most abundant elements on the earth. It accounts for 27.7% of the earths crust. It is the second most abundant element in the universe after oxygen.
Silicon is found in Silica. It does not exist in its pure form. Instead, it reacts with oxygen forming Silicon dioxide.
Silicon dioxide has two naturally occurring forms, namely crystalline silicon dioxide and amorphous silicon dioxide.</p>
<h2 id="chemical-formulasio2">**Chemical formula:**SiO2.</h2>
<h3 id="1-crystalline-silicon-dioxide">1. Crystalline Silicon dioxide</h3>
<p>It is mostly found in sand, quartz, and emerald, amongst others. Breathing crystalline silicon dioxide causes silicosis, lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory problems.
<strong>Appearance: �</strong>
crystalline Silicon dioxide is transparent to gray odorless powder.
It has an irritating effect on the skin and eyes once it is in contact with you.</p>
<h3 id="2-amorphous-silicon-dioxide">2. Amorphous Silicon dioxide</h3>
<p>Amorphous means without shape. The structure of amorphous silicon dioxide is loose and without shape.
Also called Silica gel is a powdery form of Silicon dioxide. It is highly adsorbent, i.e., it can remove material such as water, ammonia, and other gases from the air. Most Diatomaceous earth is made up of amorphous silicon dioxide.
Breathing amorphous does not cause any severe health issues in your respiratory tract.</p>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earth-food-grade-vs-filter-grade-diatomaceous-earth">Diatomaceous earth Food grade� vs. Filter grade diatomaceous earth</h2>
<p>Diatomaceous earth has two main forms, namely food grade diatomaceous earth and filter grade diatomaceous earth.
Food grade diatomaceous earth has been approved for human and pet consumption, while filter grade diatomaceous earth is used for water filtration and dynamite production.
Food grade diatomaceous earth is also used as a pesticide and an insecticide. When ingested by either you or your pets, it kills worms. Food grade diatomaceous earth gets rid of fleas, roaches, bugs,
ants, and any other insects that may bug
you.
The major difference between the two is the amount of crystalline silica content. Food grade diatomaceous earth contains less than 1% crystalline silica content. Filter grade diatomaceous earth has 60-70 % crystalline silica content.
The difference is caused by how the two forms of diatomaceous earth are treated. Pool grade is treated with very high temperatures (Calcined), which turns the silicon dioxide into crystalline silica.
The other difference is in the amount of heavy metal content. It must not contain more than 10mg/kg of arsenic for food grade diatomaceous grade and no more than 10mg/kg of lead.</p>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earthbenefits">Diatomaceous Earth<strong>Benefits</strong></h2>
<p>The following are some of the benefits of using diatomaceous earth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-toxic
DE has no chemical composition in it. Using it is hence safe for you, your pet, and the environment.</li>
<li>Promotes stronger teeth, bones, ligaments, and joints.
Silica is a paramount element in the formation of strong teeth, bones, ligaments, and joints. The silica in food grade diatomaceous earth helps in strengthening teeth, bones, ligaments, and joints.</li>
<li>Detoxification and removal of heavy metals as well as strengthening your digestive system.
Food grade diatomaceous earth works like a natural detoxifier. It kills parasites, worms, dangerous micro-organisms, and viruses in the body. Food grade diatomaceous earth also cleanses the intestines and digestive tract.
Silica from the diatomaceous earth soaks several heavy metals and other toxins, eliminating them from the body cleaning the blood.</li>
<li>Helps Clean and Protect Skin, Nails, and Teeth-DE has naturalabrasive qualities and killsparasites and hence is used in many tubes of toothpaste, skin products.</li>
<li>Helps maintain low cholesterol levels in the body hence improving heart health</li>
<li>Using diatomaceous earth in your house results in a cleaner house free from bugs, insects, and viruses.</li>
<li>Aids in purifying water</li>
<li>Promotes better hair growth and skin health. Read Also:<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-cats/">Diatomaceous Earth for Fleas on Cats</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earthuses">Diatomaceous earth<strong>Uses</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-garden-pest-killer">1. Garden pest killer</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous earth is a suitable pesticide to kill unwanted pests in the garden. It is effective, pocket-friendly, and not toxic to the plants and you.</p>
<h3 id="2-stain-remover">2. Stain Remover</h3>
<p>Due to its abrasive qualities, diatomaceous earth acts on stains pretty well, removing them all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toothpaste and skin products.
Diatomaceous earth is used in the production of toothpaste and skincare products.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-health-supplement">3. Health supplement</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous earth contains vital elements that assist in bone, ligament, digestive tract improvement, and cleaning the blood. Those minerals also help in nail, skin, and hair development.
Feeding yourself and your pet with diatomaceous food (Food grade) could lead to those and many more health benefits.</p>
<h3 id="4-pest-and-insect-control">4. Pest and insect control</h3>
<p>If you look at diatomaceous earth under a microscope, you will realize it has sharp edges. Its action is purely mechanical. In controlling pests and insects, Diatomaceous earth cuts the protective outer shell (Exoskeleton for insects). This leads to dehydration, and subsequently, the pests/insects die.</p>
<h3 id="5-water-filtration">5. Water Filtration</h3>
<p>Filter grade Diatomaceous earth is used to filter
water and other fluids to kill viruses
and�bacteria and remove heavy metal toxins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chicken feed and other animals
Feeding your chickens with Diatomaceous earth leads to the production of stronger eggs. This is attributed to calcium from the diatomaceous earth.
For other animals, Diatomaceous earth kills parasites and pests.</li>
<li>Composite Plie
Putting diatomaceous earth in your compost pile eliminates pests and odors. It does not affect worms that are useful for the compost.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Deodorant to remove body odors
Diatomaceous earth has an ability to absorb odor and is hence used in making deodorants.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="products-that-contain-diatomaceous-earth">Products that contain diatomaceous earth?</h2>
<p>Diatomaceous earth is contained mostly in dust/wettable powders &amp; pressurized liquids, skincare products, kinds of toothpaste, foods &amp; beverages, medicines, rubbers, and Paints &amp; water filters.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pest Control</li>
<li>Diatomaceous Earth Ants
Among the organic
methods to control
ants is the use of diatomaceous earth. Diatomaceous Earth is as effective as the other chemical remedies. Its advantage is that it is not toxic and safe even for any children playing around your home.
There are two ways of getting rid of ants using
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas/">Diatomaceous Earth</a>
. The dry and wet method.
<strong>Requirements:</strong></li>
<li>Pest grade Diatomaceous Earth</li>
<li>The applicator of your own choice
Dry application method</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Step 1- Identify areas where you have seen ants crawling and spot any places that might be the ants&rsquo; entry points; if*�the ants are moving across a large flat area, use the wet application. If the ants are moving along edges, cracks, baseboards, and window sills, use the dry application method.�*</li>
<li>Step 2- Use a duster to apply Diatomaceous Earth to the edges, behind baseboards, and other places you will find hard to reach. Use a flour sifter to apply to larger problem areas, and remember to apply to the windows and doors where you have spotted ants.</li>
<li>Step 3- Once you apply Diatomaceous Earth to the affected parts, ants will want to find alternative routes and paths to watch out for them. Apply Diatomaceous Earth to the new paths. Clean off the areas you applied Diatomaceous Earth after a month as you pay more focus on entry spots for the ants to prevent future entry.
Wet application method</li>
<li>Step 1-Identify the areas where you might have seen ants crawling and spot the entry points where the ants are passing through as they enter your house. In this method, wet applications, the ants are moving across large flat areas.</li>
<li>Step 2- Fill a spray bottle with the Diatomaceous Earth mixture to target larger areas such as walls where you spotted ants. This method works when the water evaporates.</li>
<li>Step 3- Take note of alternative routes taken by theants after sprayingand spray again. Clean off the applied surfaces after some time as focusing more on entry spots for the ants to prevent future entry.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-diatomaceous-earthroaches">1. Diatomaceous Earth<strong>Roaches</strong></h2>
<p>Roaches are a nuisance in the home. From the smell they cause to the scares to the infections they can cause, these insects are a real menace. Of the organic methods available, Diatomaceous Earth is actually the most effective method.� Better still, its a natural method hence no toxicity ensuring safety for you and your family.
The following are the steps to be followed when using Diatomaceous Earth to eliminate roaches in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1- Clean Ensure your house is clean. Vacuum all places; food remains should be disposed of, behind furniture. Cleanliness is itself enough remedy for roaches.</li>
<li>Step 2- Ensure that all areas are for the application of Diatomaceous Earth are dry. Diatomaceous Earth is more effective when dry, and the surface is dry. Seal any cracks that may leak any water or moisture.</li>
<li>Step 3- Apply Diatomaceous Earth to any places you have spotted roaches. Apply using an applicator of your choice. Apply where roaches hide, sleep, and where food is dropped the most.</li>
<li>Step 4-Apply Diatomaceous Earth around your house, paying more attention to cracks or entrances along with doors and window sills.</li>
<li>Step 5- Leave the Diatomaceous Earth as long as the infestation continues. In any case, the Diatomaceous Earth gets washed away, apply it again. Once the roaches are completely eradicated, please clean up the Diatomaceous Earth or leave it as a prevention measure against future infestations.
After 2-3 weeks, the roach infestation should be over.
In fact, studies have revealed that diatomaceous earth is key to the development of strong bones in wildlife.
In the case of plants, diatomaceous earth has no negative effect on them. It is used as a garden pest killer to kill unwanted pests. It is also used as a soil additive, and it helps plants retain water and nutrients.
Diatomaceous earth also helps preserve foods, mostly grains, due to its ability to absorb moisture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="are-children-more-sensitive-to-diatomaceous-earth-than-adults">Are children more sensitive to diatomaceous earth than adults?</h3>
<p>Children are more vulnerable and sensitive when it comes to pesticides compared to adults. When it comes to diatomaceous earth, kids are more sensitive compared to adults. Once they inhale Diatomaceous earth, kids react by shaving irritations.</p>
<h3 id="diatomaceous-earth-oncancer">Diatomaceous Earth on<strong>Cancer</strong></h3>
<p>As earlier discussed, exposure to crystalline silicon dioxide causes an increase in the number of lung cases. In a study of workers exposed to crystalline silicon dioxide, there were increased cases of lung cancer.
In another study, some mice were left to breathe diatomaceous earth rich in crystalline silicon dioxide for one hour each day for a whole year. The results showed an increase in lung cancers among mice.
However, amorphous silicon dioxide was not associated with any cases of lung cancer.</p>
<h3 id="eating-diatomaceous-earth">Eating Diatomaceous earth</h3>
<p>Among the various diatomaceous earth grades, only food grade diatomaceous earth is suitable for consumption by man and pets. This is because it has less than 1 % crystalline silica.
Always check with your doctor or veterinarian for the recommended amounts you should take. Ensure you are
eating food
grade diatomaceous earth and not any other type as they are dangerous for consumption.</p>
<h3 id="breathing-diatomaceous-earth">Breathing Diatomaceous earth</h3>
<p>When inhaled, diatomaceous earth irritates the nose, nasal passages, and lungs. In case you inhale a large amount of DE, you may experience coughs and breathe shortness. Amorphous Diatomaceous Earth is, however, rapidly eliminated from the lungs.
Crystalline Diatomaceous Earth has smaller particles and may accumulate in lung tissue and lymph nodes. Inhaling crystalline silica can cause inflammation and scarring of your lungs, known as silicosis, chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory problems.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Diatomaceous earth has many benefits and uses across the house and industries and is hence recommended.
If you have respiratory problems, you are advised to wear protective gear. You should find diatomaceous earth at any store near you.</p>

      <description>Diatomaceous Earth (DE)</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diatomaceous Earth (DE)
is an effective and equally safe way to kill various pests and insects, including fleas and bed bugs.
DE is made up of tiny fossilized remains of diatoms (a form of algae). DE won&rsquo;t kill fleas immediately, like the contact killers, but its benefits far outweigh the expected wait time.</p>
<p>When crushed, Diatomaceous <a href="/posts/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-dogs/">Earth</a> powder has sharp edges (microscopic) safe for you and your pets but is fatal on pests like fleas. The razor-sharp edges in DE will break the
fleas&rsquo; exoskeletons and kill
them through dehydration.
In this post, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use
Diatomaceous Earth
for fleas&rsquo; extermination safely. But you can click here to check out how to use
DE.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Fleas Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what"><strong>What&rsquo;s Diatomaceous Earth? How Does It Work?�</strong></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Definition</strong></dt>
<dd>Diatomaceous Earth is a soft (powdered) sedimentary rock discovered by a farmer in the 1830s initially thought to be limestone. DE is made up of fossil diatoms, which are hard-shelled algae from different water plants.
DE powder has tiny, razor-sharp edges (if checked through a microscopic) that&rsquo;ll quickly shred or break the fleas&rsquo; exoskeletons and its inner organs, which is definitely fatal.
<em><strong>Sidenote</strong>: These characteristics have afforded Diatomaceous Earth various applications in mild abrasion, mechanical insect repelling, and filtration (charcoal filters).�</em>
If inhaled, the small razor-like diatoms in Diatomaceous Earth will damage the
flea&rsquo;s respiratory system and kill
the bug. Fortunately, DE works through mechanical action, and thus fleas won&rsquo;t develop resistance like they do with chemical flea killers.
DE will also dehydrate and
kill other insects such as fleas
, aphids,� lice, ticks, mites, roaches, ants, bed bugs, and various garden pests. Diatomaceous Earth is suitable for controlling adult and
larvae fleas
in dry or indoor spaces like pet bedding or houses.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-des-action-last">How Long Does the DE&rsquo;s Action Last?</h2>
<p>According to a report by National Geographic,
fleas coming
into contact with the Diatomaceous Earth powder will die within 4-12 hours.
But you&rsquo;ll need to leave the DE powder on the surfaces (yard, floors, or carpets) for 24 hours before you
vacuum to make sure that the bugs
have died.
Diatomaceous Earth will be effective against fleas for three weeks in your yard, provided it&rsquo;s not wetted by rain or sprinkler water. Hence, reapply DE in 2-3 weeks since the fleas usually have an egg-laying cycle of about 1-3 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your Diatomaceous Earth powder dry, or it&rsquo;ll lose its power. Thus, you must not expose the DE to rain or sprinkler water when flea treating your porches, gardens, or yards.</li>
<li>For wet grounds or in the rainy season, useflea sprayswith<a href="https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/ent-6003/">pyrethroids</a>like esfenvalerate and esfenvalerate or other IGR pyriproxifen.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-step-by-step">Using Diatomaceous Earth for Fleas (Step By Step)</h2>
<p>Only use &ldquo;food-grade&rdquo; Diatomaceous Earth since it has no added chemicals that would otherwise poison your kids and pets.�DE used for charcoal filters or swimming pool has carcinogenic ingredients. But, many of the
pest control
DE options are crystalline in nature.

ON PPEs - For safety purposes, when applying the diatomaceous earth, put on your gardening gloves to avoid drying or dehydrating the skin. Wear a protective dust mask to prevent inhaling diatomaceous earth as this would damage your mucous membranes in the nose and mouth.
**Step 2: **
Thoroughly Vacuum the
carpet and your indoor spaces to be flea
treated before you sprinkle the DE.
**Step 3: **
To
kill all the adult fleas
, their eggs, and flea larvae - allow the diatomaceous earth powder to sit on the indoor floors and carpets for a minimum of 3-4 days before you vacuum.
**Step 4: **
Finally, reapply the diatomaceous earth powder each week for one month and ensure you vacuum only after 3-4 days.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-diatomaceous-earth-in-flea-control">Benefits of Diatomaceous Earth in Flea Control</h2>
<p>The benefits of using Diatomaceous earth in
flea control
are:
(1)
Reducing inflammation, enhancing the pet&rsquo;s skeletal system, (1) R
educing or preventing the pest burden, and enhancing the pet&rsquo;s coat and skin.
Well, let&rsquo;s discuss the benefits!</p>
<ol>
<li>Food grade or organic Diatomaceous earth in its powder form can be sprinkled onto yourcat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s coat/ fur to kill and prevent fleainfestations. Only apply the DE along the pet&rsquo;s backbone while avoiding getting it into your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s eyes.</li>
<li>Besides working great onpets like cats and dogs, Diatomaceous earth can also control lice, mites, and fleas on livestock like sheep, cows, pigs, goats, and birds.</li>
<li>DE works through mechanical operation, and thus flea and household pets can&rsquo;t develop immunity against it as it happens with the chemical flea killers.</li>
<li>Besides being an organic flea control solution that both effective andsafe for pets, Diatomaceous earth is also safe for humans and their kids.</li>
<li>Luckily, you&rsquo;ll quickly find DE in most pest control outlets in your locality or on the giant e-commerce websites online for quick delivery.</li>
<li>As a side note, DE will also be great in de-worming or for humans in preventing hip problems and other joint pains.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-diatomaceous-earth-safe-for-my-family">Is Diatomaceous Earth Safe for My Family?</h2>
<p>First, is Diatomaceous earth carcinogenicity? Well, NO! According to
<a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1999-04-05">OSHA</a>
, Diatomaceous earth is classified as a Group 3 carcinogen, and thus its no carcinogenicity to human beings.
But is DE harmful to humans? Not, if it&rsquo;s
food-grade
DE. This kind of DE will have anything below
2% crystalline silica, which is considered safe for humans.
On the flip side, inhaling the Diatomaceous earth will hurt the human lungs for a long time. Therefore,
Food-grade DE will be safe for eating, and
cosmetic
**use **
hut will scar the human lungs if inhaled.
Therefore, can you use
Diatomaceous earth to
kill fleas
in your indoor spaces? Yes, DE will be great to use indoors in killing fleas,
ants, or roaches. However, it&rsquo;s advisable not to sleep around the
treated spaces as you might inhale the DE.</p>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-in-yards">Diatomaceous Earth for fleas in Yards</h2>
<p>For yards and other outdoor spaces,
flea treatment
efforts should essentially concentrate on areas where flea larvae are mainly found. The areas include shady places, shrubbery or decks, cat/ dog bedding areas, and crawl spaces.
I was experiencing a problem with fleas in our garden. It seemed no matter my efforts; the fleas would still keep coming back. I had sprayed some over-the-counter solutions and permethrin, but I was playing a falling battle. Luckily, diatomaceous earth came into the picture to save my face against embarrassment from the fleas and ants.
So, use Diatomaceous earth to kill fleas in your deck and yard effectively. You&rsquo;ll need to sprinkle the Diatomaceous earth powder in the yard and around the house, particularly in places where the cats and dogs stay mainly.
<strong>Caution</strong>
:�Diatomaceous earth will be less effective when wet - either due to rains or just yard irrigation and watering. Therefore, DE will be more active on�concrete,�gravel, or�bare ground. Besides, you&rsquo;ll need to reapply the�Diatomaceous earth after watering the yard or following the�rains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle a handful of the Diatomaceous earth powder into the yard and let the dust drip into the flea-infested places.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use a�dust spreader that will increase your efficiency and speed or applying the�Diatomaceous earth.</li>
<li>If the prevalent weather is dry (for the next ten days), you can mix the Diatomaceous earth with water - the DE mixture will change topowder within the next one week and killthe fleas.
DE,�like any other dust, is poisonous if inhaled in large quantities. Also,�DE&rsquo;s sharp edges can harm the soft tissues in your lungs and throat. Therefore, use�safety goggles and�dust-filtering masks when handling or applying diatomaceous earth for fleas.
Despite that diatomaceous earth is not a quick-action flea solution, it&rsquo;s highly effective on heavily infested areas by fleas and fleas larvae, such as pet bedding and house.
How to locate the flea-infested yard areas
To quickly find the flea-infested areas in your yard, wear some knee-high and white socks, and stand at one location in the backyard. If fleas are in the areas you&rsquo;re standing, you&rsquo;ll see the Persky pests jumping onto your white socks.
However, massive flea infestation will be concentrated on a few critical areas instead of being in the whole yard. But yard areas that received a lot of foot traffic or extended direct sunlight won&rsquo;t experience massive flea infestations.
On the contrary, secluded and shaded areas are more prone to massive flea infestations. For example, such fields include�kennels,�doghouses, and places that dogs or cats take a rest in your yard or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-cats">Diatomaceous Earth for Fleas on Cats</h2>
<p>As a natural and thus safe flea control solution,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-cats/">Diatomaceous earth (DE) is excellent for cats</a>
. Therefore, follow the below-outlined
steps to control fleas
in cats using Diatomaceous earth.</p>
<h3 id="1check-the-flea-prone-areas">1.<strong>Check The Flea-prone areas�</strong></h3>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to identify the areas in your house and backyard that are highly prone to flea infestation - particularly places where the cat tends to spend a lot of its time.
Suspect areas include their loved�rug or�pillow, the�cat tree,�kennel, or bed. Therefore, pay special attention to the outlined regions when you&rsquo;re applying the�diatomaceous earth.</p>
<h3 id="2-vacuum-cats-sleeping-areas">2. Vacuum Cat&rsquo;s sleeping areas</h3>
<p>Next up, clean and vacuum the cat&rsquo;s sleeping things and places such as the pillow, rugs. And kennel - particularly areas where the cats mainly rest. I recommend you use a shop vac instead of the regular vacuum, as the latter would burn its motor since DE will be hard on it.
Vacuuming will assist in gathering all the fleas eggs that could be dropped in the areas. This is particularly helpful as it&rsquo;ll remove the flea eggs that the diatomaceous earth can&rsquo;t kill until the time they become a flea larva with a relatively soft exoskeleton.
<strong>3. Pour the Diatomaceous Earth�</strong>
Next up, it&rsquo;s time that you now pour the diatomaceous earth into the cat&rsquo;s resting places. I would suggest you use DE spreaders, a� tied-off sock, or a sieve. The areas to concentrate on include the cat bedding.
However, ensure that you apply the�diatomaceous earth only on the relatively dry areas as it&rsquo;ll ensure that the powder is more effective against fleas attacking your act. Also, allow the�DE to settle on the application area for about 14 days.</p>
<h3 id="4-flea-comb-your-cat">4. Flea Comb your cat</h3>
<p>Sadly so, some
fleas might survive the above harsh treatment
. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll require to
flea comb your cat
, guaranteeing that any remaining fleas are exposed, and you can now kill them using a spray or shampoo.
Ensure that the
fleas you get off the cat
fur won&rsquo;t escape. Also, repeat the
flea combing
process a couple of times a week. To clean up this diatomaceous earth, use the shop vac, some wet towels, and filterless vacuums.</p>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-dogs">Diatomaceous Earth for Fleas on Dogs</h2>
<p>You can use�Diatomaceous earth (DE) to prevent or control the number of
fleas that could be biting
your dog. Luckily, as noted above, DE is both
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-dogs/">safe and effective against fleas to use on your lovely dog</a>
. Check the flea control steps you can take on your dog using�Diatomaceous earth.</p>
<h3 id="1-consider-areas-where-your-dog-rests">1. Consider areas where your Dog rests</h3>
<p>First things first, you&rsquo;ll need to consider the places where your dog will spend its time in the house or even in the yard.
Like cats, dogs will spend their time in places such as rugs, pillows, kennels, or beds. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll have known the places you&rsquo;ll concentrate on your application of diatomaceous earth.</p>
<h3 id="2-vacuum-the-dogs-sleeping-areas">2. Vacuum the Dog&rsquo;s sleeping areas</h3>
<p>Next, vacuum the dogs sleeping and resting area, the pillow, rug, and kennels. The process will allow you to gather all the
flea eggs
that are scattered around these areas.
This is because diatomaceous earth wont readily kill the
flea eggs than the larvae
and adult flea stages as it has a protective cover.</p>
<h3 id="3-sprinkle-the-diatomaceous-earth">3. Sprinkle the Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Now, onto the main process using our diatomaceous earth. Just like when we were considering cats above, you may use a DE applicator, tied-off sock, or a simple sieve to spread the diatomaceous earth on the identified places.
The places to concentrate on are�blankets or pet beds  but this must be done with the powder in its dry form to achieve the highest level of effectiveness.
Finally, allow the Diatomaceous Earth powder to stand on the sprinkled areas for about 2-3 weeks to kill all the adult
fleas and their larvae
.</p>
<h3 id="4-flea-shampoo-your-dog">4. Flea Shampoo your Dog</h3>
<p>Allow the dog to play around the areas sprinkled with the diatomaceous earth. This allows any remaining
fleas and their larvae to jump on the dog
as they seek more blood to survive and reproduce.
Use a suitable
dog flea shampoo
, bathe the dog clean to remove and kill all the bugging fleas on the pet. Also, you can use moisturizing shampoo or soap-free to rejuvenate the pets skin. This is important because diatomaceous earth will tend to dry the dogs skin.
Finally, you should
flea comb your dog
to ensure that you eject any of the remaining fleas on the pets fur. Also, ensure you vacuum the house spaces clean in several weeks. For this process, use the shop vac type of vacuum cleaner because it wont burn its motor quickly.</p>

<p>Besides being used as food for cats, DE is also used to eliminate fleas. The following are the
steps to be followed
when using DE to eliminate fleas from your cat.
<strong>Step 1</strong>
Identify the areas your cat likes spending its time the most. Those areas will be the places youll need to focus most when applying DE. Such places could be its favorite couch, the carpet, or even the pillow.
<strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum those places where your cat likes to hang out the most. By this, you will collect any eggs that have not hatched. DE does not affect the eggs and will wait for them to hatch, so it acts.
<strong>Step 3</strong></li>
<li>Sprinkle the areas with DE. Always ensure that the surfaces are dry since damp conditions reduce the effectiveness of DE. You can use an applicator of your choice.�Leave the DE on the surfaces for some weeks.
<strong>Step 4-</strong>
Let your cat roam around the places you have applied DE for some days and then bathe it. Ensure that you use a soap-free moisturizing shampoo.
**Step 5- **
Chances are the
fleas that will not survive
the bath, vacuuming, and DE application.
Comb your cats fur using a flea comb to ascertain that no flea has been left. Do that for several days.
<strong>Step 6-</strong>
Vacuum those places you had applied to DE. The recommended vacuum cleaner is the shop vac since DE might ruin the traditional filtered vacuums.</li>

<h2 id="usingdiatomaceous-earth-for-dogs"><strong>Using�Diatomaceous Earth for Dogs</strong></h2>
<p>Apart from using DE as food, it can be sprinkled to
kill fleas
and other insects and parasites.
For application to dogs, these are the required ingredients: Diatomaceous earth (DE), neem, and Yarrow. All the ingredients should be dry for maximum effectiveness.
These are the steps to be followed.
**Step 1 - **
Identify areas where you will apply the diatomaceous earth. You should identify where your pets spend most of their time. This might be its kernel, the carpet.
<strong>Step 2 -</strong>
Vacuum the areas where your pet
resides or hangs out the most. This might be its kernel, your carpet.
This is done to capture any
fleas and flea eggs
that may be around.�It is important to note that DE has no effect on
flea eggs
and will wait for them to hatch, so it acts on them.
**Step 3 - **
Apply DE to the area. After vacuuming, sprinkle the DE on carpets, floors, beddings once a week for 30 days.
Ensure the surfaces where you are applying are dry. Leave the sprinkled DE for several weeks before vacuuming it.
**Step 4 - **
Let your dog roam around the areas with DE for a few days, then bathe it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since bathing dogs dries their skin, so does DE; ensure that you use a soap-free moisturizing shampoo.
**Step 5 - **
There are high chances that most fleas will be eradicated after the bath, vacuuming, and use of DE.</li>
<li>You can use aflea comb on your dogfor several days to ascertain that none was left.
**Step 6 - **
Vacuum the areas where you had sprinkled the DE. The recommended vacuum cleaner is the shop vac- a professional grade.</li>
<li>Vacuuming will ensurethat you have collected any remaining fleas with their eggs, larvae, and pupae.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Apart from being ingested to kill internal worms, diatomaceous can be sprinkled to ensure the flea&rsquo;s menace is eradicated.
This is a very recommendable method since no chemicals are in use, making it safe for the pet (dog), you, and the environment.</p>
