<p>On the other hand, the propel trampolines provide a 30 day registration period. You need to register your propel
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-backyard-trampolines/">trampoline</a>
within 30 days.</p>
<p>The registration allows the company to contact you in case of any issue with the product purchased. If it has been discontinued or been recalled the company can give you a replacement. Propel doesnt declare clearly on their website about the warranty.</p>

<p>Propel Vs. Skywalker Trampoline comes with different extra accessories to provide additional play activities. The skywalker trampolines include a basketball loop and hook.</p>

<h3 id="propel-vs-skywalker-trampoline-available-options">Propel Vs. Skywalker Trampoline Available Options</h3>

<p>The propel trampolines are available in different sizes ranging from 7ft to 15ft. while the available shapes are round and rectangular. The propel website has a rectangular option that measures12ft by 8ft.</p>
<p>Conversely, Skywalker trampolines provide an array of options. They are available in different shapes including square, rectangle, oval, and round. The Skywalker Round trampolines sizes range from 7.5ft to 16ft.ï¿½ The largest Skywalker rectangular offering measures 10ft by 17ft.</p>
<p>Although the propel trampolines are available in different color options the sizes are color-coded. This means the customer doesnt have the luxury of choosing the trampoline color.</p>
