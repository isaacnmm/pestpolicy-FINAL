      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drier regions of the Midwest and Southwest have a &ldquo;flea season&rdquo; in some months of the year. But in balmy states such as Florida, fleas are highly active and reproduce throughout the year.
So, its no brainer that one reader asked: Can cats get fleas in the winter regardless of my region?
<strong>The simple answer is YES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>But, cats have lower chances of getting fleas during winter since fleas remain dormant in this season. However, the warm environment in the house (due to central heating) allows
fleas to stay
active even during the cold season and thus attack cats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="warm-blooded-hosts-cats-in-winter">Warm-blooded hosts (Cats) in Winter</h2>
<p><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jsilver/Silverman%20et%20al%202581.pdf">Silverman</a>
states that snow (freezing temperatures - over a long time) will kill all fleas&rsquo; life stages. But adult
fleas will live in the warm-blooded hosts
. During winter, fleas will have longer life cycles.
As part of your general flea control in your home, it&rsquo;s essential to flea treat your cat (and other pets) even during winter. Ensure to treat all the pet bedding and toys inside and outside the house, mainly using vet-approved flea control solutions.
Notably, flea treating the cats will prevent diseases such as anemia caused by severe blood loss (from flea bites) and skin problems. However, as noted earlier, fleas will have a longer life cycle during winter. Therefore, it&rsquo;s critical to be vigilant in the bug control efforts.</p>
<h2 id="temperature">Temperature</h2>
<p>Fleas show top activity
and reproduction at temperatures between 70-85 degrees range.
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.621.743&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Michael Dryden</a>
states that fleas will die when the temperature falls under 30.2 degrees Fahrenheit for over five consecutive days.
The optimum temperature for fleas is 70-85 degrees Fahrenheit. However, fleas can also live in warmer or cooler temperatures. Notably, most fleas will be seen between May and September, which are summer and spring.
If the temperature drops below the freezing point for some consecutive days, the adult fleas will not survive. But the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/">flea eggs</a>
, the larvae, and pupa would not die during the cold winter weather. However, the fleas pre-adult stages would remain dormant during winter and begin serious activity when the temperature rises.</p>
<h2 id="humidity">Humidity</h2>
<p>Fleas will thrive at a 70 percent humidity level. Moisture is critical for fleas&rsquo; survival because it helps the eggs to hatch and the other stages to grow over the flea life cycle. Fleas will develop, hatch, and survive at temperatures only at a temperature at or above 13C (55.4F).
Flea pre-adult stages will not survive when the Relative humidity drops below 50%. Therefore, the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-look-like/">fleas larvae</a>
will opt to hide under the�carpet fibers,�moist and�dark places.</p>
<h2 id="flea-treating-your-cat-during-winter"><strong>Flea treating your cat during winter</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Here are the steps to follow while treating fleas (killing or preventing) on your cat.�</strong>
1.
<em>Bathe your cat using an anti-flea shampoo</em>
. Ensure you bathe the cats head, under the body, legs, and tail tool. When your feline friend is all dried  now using the topical anti-flea drop such as Advantage or Frontline on the neck region, specifically on areas that the cat cannot lick.
Repeat this process 1-2 times every six weeks. However, change the shampoo and flea drop brands each time since the flea may grow resistant to the chemicals. You can also flea treat your house using suitable flea foggers.
2.
<em>Vacuum your house,</em>
including paced under the bed, carpet, and sofa - and clean the drain. The first
vacuuming event will clean
about 60 percent of the fleas. However, continue vacuuming your house for one week to clan all the critter, adult fleas, eggs, and larvae. Notably, vacuuming creates strong vibrations that will eject both the adult and the pre-adult fleas from their hiding places and cocoons, respectively.
3. Get a suitable floor cleaner and mop floors in the house. Notably, choose a floor cleaner that the most pungent smell  this will repel the fleas. However, ensure take care of the cleaner you decide if there are small children (maybe those babies) in the house.
4. Clean clothing, bedding, and pillow covers in the washing machine (with a strong detergent) and dryer. Ensure that the washing machine&rsquo;s water must have a temperature of over 55 degrees centigrade. Further, if youve been allowing your cat to your bed, wash all the bedding.
5.�Utilize a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-comb-for-cats/">flea comb</a>
to remove the flea eggs and flea adults. However, ensure to target the belly, forehead, and neck since thats where many fleas will exist. Ensure to have a basin (half-full) of water with a detergent such as a dishwasher soap where youll drown the fleas - or also use the electronic flea combs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, spray the cat beddings under the carpet and coach using a suitable flea insecticide every two weeks. Use a flea collar on your cat for prevention purposes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One often-overlooked benefit of gutter guards is their potential role in deterring pests, particularly rodents, from gaining access to your home. <a href="/posts/5-signs-you-need-new-gutters/">Gutters</a>, especially when clogged with debris, can become attractive highways and nesting sites for mice, rats, squirrels, and other unwanted critters seeking shelter, food, or entry points into your attic or walls. The question then arises: <strong>Can rodents <a href="/posts/can-cats-get-fleas-in-the-winter/">get</a> past your gutter guards?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is, unfortunately, &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo; While well-designed and properly installed gutter guards can be a significant deterrent, not all guards offer the same level of protection. Some types can indeed be breached by determined rodents, while others are highly effective barriers. Understanding the different types of gutter guards and their pest-proofing capabilities is crucial for comprehensive home protection.</p>
<p>This article will explore the damage rodents can inflict, how various gutter guards fare against them, and what factors to consider when choosing a system that truly helps keep these pests out.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-much-damage-can-rodents-do-to-your-home">How Much Damage Can Rodents Do to Your Home?</h2>
<p>Rodents are more than just a nuisance; they can cause extensive and costly damage to your home:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structural Damage:</strong> Rodents constantly gnaw to keep their teeth sharp and short. They can chew through wood, plastic pipes, electrical wires, and even soft metals, compromising structural integrity and creating fire hazards.</li>
<li><strong>Contamination:</strong> They carry and transmit numerous diseases (e.g., Hantavirus, Salmonella, Leptospirosis) through their urine, feces, and saliva, contaminating food preparation surfaces and insulation.</li>
<li><strong>Insulation Damage:</strong> Rodents nest in insulation, compacting it, contaminating it with waste, and reducing its effectiveness, leading to higher energy bills.</li>
<li><strong>Foul Odors:</strong> Urine and droppings leave persistent, unpleasant odors throughout your home.</li>
<li><strong>Noise Disturbances:</strong> Squeaking, scratching, and scurrying sounds in walls and attics can be highly disruptive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gutters, especially when clogged with damp leaves and twigs, provide an ideal, sheltered habitat for rodents, often directly leading to attic spaces via fascia gaps or soffit vents.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-do-gutter-guards-protect-against-rodents">How Do Gutter Guards Protect Against Rodents?</h2>
<p>Gutter guards protect against rodents primarily by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eliminating Shelter and Nesting Sites:</strong> Clogged gutters are perfect rodent habitats. They offer concealment, nesting materials (leaves, twigs), and often standing water. By keeping gutters clear, guards remove these attractions.</li>
<li><strong>Blocking Access Points:</strong> Certain types of gutter guards, particularly those that create a continuous, sealed barrier over the gutter opening, can prevent rodents from using the gutter as a highway to vulnerable areas like the roofline, soffits, and attic vents.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, not all gutter guards are equally effective at providing this pest barrier.</p>
<h3 id="effectiveness-of-gutter-guard-types-against-rodents">Effectiveness of Gutter Guard Types Against Rodents:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Micro-Mesh Gutter Guards (Highly Effective):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How They Work:</strong> Feature a very fine stainless steel mesh with tiny holes (often less than 500 microns). This mesh is typically installed with a rigid aluminum frame that screws or snaps securely onto the gutter lip, and often tucks under the first row of shingles.</li>
<li><strong>Rodent Protection:</strong> <strong>Excellent.</strong> The ultra-fine, strong mesh is too small for even the smallest mice to squeeze through, and the metal construction prevents gnawing. When properly installed and sealed at all seams and end caps, they create a formidable barrier, denying entry from the gutter line into the home.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> LeafFilter, HomeCraft, All American Gutter Protection, MasterShield, Raptor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perforated Metal Gutter Guards (Good, but with caveats):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How They Work:</strong> Solid metal (aluminum) sheets with punched holes or slots.</li>
<li><strong>Rodent Protection:</strong> <strong>Good for larger rodents, but potentially vulnerable to mice.</strong> The metal prevents chewing, but the perforations might be just large enough for very small or young mice to squeeze through. Squirrels and rats are generally deterred. Proper securing is essential to prevent lifting.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Various solid aluminum covers with holes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Screen Gutter Guards (Vulnerable):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How They Work:</strong> Basic mesh screens, often made of plastic or thin aluminum, that sit over or snap into the gutter.</li>
<li><strong>Rodent Protection:</strong> <strong>Poor to Moderate.</strong> The mesh is often too large for small rodents to be consistently blocked. Thin plastic screens can be chewed through relatively easily. Flimsy metal screens can be bent or dislodged by determined pests. They primarily block large debris, not small rodents.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Amerimax, EZ-Quick, plastic roll-out screens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brush Gutter Guards (Limited Effectiveness):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How They Work:</strong> Cylindrical brushes inserted into the gutter.</li>
<li><strong>Rodent Protection:</strong> <strong>Limited.</strong> While they fill the gutter, a determined mouse or squirrel can often burrow through the bristles or push them aside to create a pathway. They don&rsquo;t create a sealed barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> GutterBrush.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foam Gutter Guards (Highly Vulnerable):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How They Work:</strong> Porous foam inserts that fill the gutter.</li>
<li><strong>Rodent Protection:</strong> <strong>Very Poor.</strong> Rodents, especially mice and squirrels, can easily chew through foam to create nests or pathways. The soft material offers virtually no resistance. They can even attract nesting activity due to the sheltered environment.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> GutterStuff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-gutter-guards">What Are the Pros and Cons of Gutter Guards?</h2>
<p><strong>Pros (General):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced Gutter Cleaning:</strong> The primary benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Prevents Clogs:</strong> Ensures proper water flow.</li>
<li><strong>Protects Home Structure:</strong> Prevents water damage to foundation, fascia, soffits.</li>
<li><strong>Pest Deterrent:</strong> High-quality guards, especially micro-mesh, can block rodents and insects.</li>
<li><strong>Prevents Ice Dams:</strong> By keeping gutters clear, they reduce conditions that contribute to ice dam formation.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Safety:</strong> Reduces the need for dangerous ladder work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons (General):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upfront Cost:</strong> Quality systems can be expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Not 100% Maintenance-Free:</strong> Some debris may accumulate on top, requiring occasional clearing.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Overshooting:</strong> If guards get excessively dirty or are poorly designed/installed.</li>
<li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Some types are more visible than others.</li>
<li><strong>Installation Quality:</strong> Poor installation can lead to gaps or damaged roof components.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-gutter-guard-system-for-rodent-protection">Choosing the Right Gutter Guard System for Rodent Protection</h2>
<p>If rodent deterrence is a key concern (and it should be for any homeowner!), focus on these factors when choosing gutter guards:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Material: Go Metal, Go Strong:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stainless Steel Micro-Mesh:</strong> This is your best defense. It&rsquo;s too fine for even small rodents to pass through and too strong for them to chew.</li>
<li><strong>Aluminum Frame:</strong> Ensures the overall structure of the guard is robust and cannot be easily bent or chewed by larger rodents like rats or squirrels. Avoid plastic frames if rodent protection is paramount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mesh Size: The Finer, The Better:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for mesh openings that are too small for a mouse to fit through. This generally means a micro-mesh design with openings of 500 microns (0.5 mm) or smaller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Installation: No Gaps, No Entry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The guard must be securely fastened to the gutter and, ideally, extend under the first row of roof shingles (without voiding your roof warranty) to create a continuous, sealed barrier.</li>
<li>Professional installation is often recommended for maximum security, as installers are trained to seal off all potential entry points, including end caps and seams, using appropriate fasteners and sealants. Any small gap or loose section is an invitation for a determined rodent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Coverage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The guard should cover the entire length of your gutters, not just downspout openings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A robust guard that won&rsquo;t warp, bend, or crack under environmental stress (heat, cold, ice) will maintain its rodent-proofing integrity over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>While no single solution offers absolute, foolproof pest control, <strong>high-quality metal micro-mesh gutter guards are a highly effective line of defense against rodents and other pests using your gutters as an access point or nesting site.</strong> They work by eliminating attractive habitats (clogged gutters) and by creating a physical barrier that is too small for entry and too strong to chew through.</p>
<p>If deterring rodents is a significant concern for your home, prioritize gutter guard systems with fine stainless steel mesh and robust aluminum frames that are professionally or meticulously installed to ensure a tight, continuous seal. This strategic investment not only protects your home from water damage but also adds a crucial layer of defense against unwanted furry intruders.</p>

<ul>
<li>This will upset you. Fruit flies will make your house look messy and unkempt.
<em>Maybe you have even tried to remove the attractants of these fruit flies without succeeding? In this article, I&rsquo;ve discussed the top fruit fly traps you can DIY.�</em>
<em>Homemade fruit fly traps may include vinegar (apple cider vinegar - that also kills fleas�or white vinegar), using old wine or beer bottle, fruits/fruits peel jar, dish soap, banana jar, red wine trick, paper cone &amp; old/rotten fruits and heated milk/sugar &amp;pepper.�</em>

<h2 id="get-rid-of-fruit-flies-with-a-homemade-fruit-fly-trap">Get Rid of Fruit Flies With a Homemade Fruit Fly Trap</h2>
<h3 id="1-vinegar-trap-apple-cider-vinegar-or-white-vinegar">1. Vinegar Trap (apple cider vinegar or white vinegar)</h3>
<p>Vinegar trap is my best homemade Trap that will trap over 70% of fruit flies in your house or compound.
You will need to have the following requirements: vinegar (either apple cider or white vinegar), a glass jar or bottle with a narrow entrance (20 cm to 30 cm depth), a piece of cellophane, or polythene paper, and a rubber band.
Once these are in place, carry out the following procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pour 10 to 30 ml of vinegar in either glass or bottle gently.</li>
<li>Tilt the container slightly and shake to ensure some vinegar sticks on the wall.</li>
<li>Close/seal the glass or bottle (for the container, it&rsquo;s not necessary to seal always) with cellophane or polythene paper. Then tighten with the rubber band.</li>
<li>Using a sharp narrow device, make a few tiny holes on the cellophane or polythene paper.</li>
<li>Place the vinegar trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
You will require to make two or three vinegar traps in case the swam of the fruit flies is large.</li>
<li>This Trap&rsquo;s principle is that vinegar emits an attractive scent that lures the fruit flies into the bottle or glass).</li>
<li>Once the fruit flies enter the container (through the tiny holes), they cannot come out (they get trapped inside).
Apple cider vinegar is more potent than white vinegar due to nectary spices added to it. You will require to empty the Trap after every 2 to 3 days. Check these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fly-trap/">commercial fly traps</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-old-wine-or-beer-bottle-trap">2. Old wine or beer bottle Trap</h3>
<p>A bottle of old wine or beer can be used as a fruit fly trap since the old fermented wine or beer releases a scent that attracts the fruit flies.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will require to leave your wine/beer bottle after use for 1 to 7 days (to allow wine/beer leftovers to ferment).</li>
<li>Then, seal the bottle with cellophane or nylon/polythene paper.</li>
<li>Poke few beautiful holes on the paper with a tiny sharp object.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
The fruit flies attracted by the fermented scent will be trapped inside the bottle. You can even leave the bottle without sealing (though this may not catch 100% of the fruit flies that get in  some may manage to escape).
Alternatively, you can ferment wine or beer (leave 10ml of wine/beer in an open jar for five days).</li>
<li>Pour it into a bottle (Trap) and shake well to ensure it sticks on the wall before setting the Trap in the area manifested with fruit flies.</li>
<li>You will need to empty the wine trap daily by rinsing the trapped fruit flies.
Avoid
placing the Trap in the living
room since it may pull some fruit flies around (even if it&rsquo;s in the corridor or kitchen, the scent is strong enough to attract fruit flies).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fruitsfruits-peel-jar-trap">3. Fruits/fruits peel jar Trap</h3>
<p>Fruit jar fruit fly trap is made up of many fruit types cut and put together in a jar. To make one at home, you will need to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut into small pieces of various fruits such as mangoes, oranges, sugarcane, pawpaw, avocado, watermelon, etc. Place them in a basin or glass jar.</li>
<li>Seal the basin/jar with cellophane or polythene/cling paper colorless (this enables the fruit flies and owner to view inside).</li>
<li>Poke the seal with a tiny sharp object to create a path for fruit flies to get in and also fermenting scent to leave the jar/basic.</li>
<li>Place the inappropriate Trap place near fruit flies infestation (kitchen, compound/field).
When ripe fruits begin to rot, they release a sharp scent that can attract fruit flies over 20 feet away.
They will enter the jar and get trapped there. Therefore, you will not need to put too many pieces in a given jar for economic purposes.
Alternatively, you can place the peels from fruits such as mangoes, bananas, pawpaw, avocadoes, or potatoes in a jar, seal, and poke tiny holes.
These peels begin fermenting in a day and emitting a scent that attracts fruit flies in the vicinity. After a substantial amount of fruit flies are trapped, it is necessary to empty the Trap and fill it with fresh fruits/peels.

</ul>
<h3 id="4-dish-soap-trap">4. Dish soap Trap</h3>
<p>You can use
dish soap
to clean utensils, kitchen, sinks, and showers to make a homemade fruit fly trap. The fragrance and diethanolamine chemicals act as attractants of fruit flies into the Trap.
To make a homemade dish soap fruit fly trap, you will need to follow the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect/fetch available dish soap and place it in a glass jar/container (diameter of 20  30 cm and a depth of 30  40 cm).</li>
<li>Add some little water to dilute it slightly (ensure you form a sticky and viscous substance that will help stick the fruit flies).</li>
<li>Seal the glass jar with colorless polythene or cellophane and poke tiny holes on it.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near a fruit fly&rsquo;s manifested areas.
The working principle in this Trap is using a sticking mechanism. Once the attracted fruit flies land/step on the sticky, viscous dish soap, they will get stuck/trapped and die there.
Normally, the Trap may take 3 to 7 days to trap a substantial number of fruit fries. The attractant smell will intensify as days go by due to the fermentation process.
It is not advisable to hold long trapped fruit flies as they may decompose, thus messing with the Trap. You will, therefore, require to empty the Trap after every 5 to 8 days of use.
In such a case, you can scoop the top layer of the dish soap and top up the remainder with a fresh one, or else you replace the entire decoy (dish soap).
Alternatively, you can spice your dish soap trap with some vinegar or ripe fruits to boost the bait&rsquo;s attraction strength. This is usually in a cold area where low temperatures highly inhibit scent diffusion.

</ul>
<h3 id="5-banana-jar-trap">5. Banana jar Trap</h3>
<p>Banana jar trap is one of its own kind, an independent fruit fly trap that doesn&rsquo;t require any spicing attractant (apple cider or fragrance) for quality performance.
A ripen banana emits a sharp scent that pulls fruit flies over 20 to 30 feet away. Carry out the following to create your homemade banana trap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peel the well-ripen bananas (1 to 3 pieces) and cut them into small sizes (about 2inches).</li>
<li>Put the banana slices into a clear glass jar or container (at least 15 cm deep).</li>
<li>Seal the jar with colorless polythene paper or cellophane.</li>
<li>Poke tiny holes on the seal to allow the fruit flies in and expel the banana scent into the vicinity.</li>
<li>Place your banana trap near a fruit flies infested area.
The attracted fruit flies will get in and get trapped (they won&rsquo;t be able to fly out). This Trap can also be used in the living room without interfering with the comfort of the occupants.
Empty the Trap after every 2 to 3 days of use. This Trap may be uneconomical if you spend more bananas (stick to a minimum of one or two per Trap).
Alternatively, you can slice the banana peels and repeat the same procedure above.
However, the peels may take slightly longer to rot and release an attractant smell. When banana peels decompose, they may emit an unpleasant odor and leave a dirty spell in your jar (though they are useful too).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-red-wine-trick-trap">6. Red wine trick Trap</h3>
<p>Red wine is known to emit an attractant smell that pulls fruit flies from the packaged/crate. Therefore, you can make a red wine trick fruit fly trap by carrying out the following step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle little red wine on the red wine bottle (closed/not used).</li>
<li>Place the bottle in a colorless glass jar (about 30 to 50 cm deep).</li>
<li>Seal the container with colorless polythene paper or cellophane and poke the tiny holes on the seal.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pour any red wine at the bottom of the jar or container.</li>
<li>Place your Red wine trick trap near fruit flies infested area or living room.
Once the fruit flies are attracted to the glass jar or container, they tend to cling to the red wine bottle as they try to get into the feast on the sweet scent (trick).
The smell released by red wine is strong enough to attract fruit flies over 40 feet away.
Once a large number of Fruit flies have accumulated on the red wine bottle wall, seal the glass jar once more (to close the holes) to suffocate the trapped fruit flies for 1 to 4 hours.</li>
<li>Then, empty the jar by rubbing off the dead fruit flies stuck on the red wine bottle&rsquo;s wall.</li>
<li>The advantage of this fruit fly trap is that you can re-use the red wine bottle before drinking the content (red wine).
It can also be used in the living room without disturbance to occupants (the fruit flies always flew in and get trapped  no external movement).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-paper-cone--oldrotten-fruits-trap">7. Paper cone &amp; old/rotten fruits Trap</h3>
<p>To make a paper cone &amp; old/rotten fruits Trap, you will need a white/purple/pink pain-writing pad, a Glass jar (60 cm depth and 20 cm diameter), and old or rotten fruits. Carry the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the old fruits (could be rotting avocado, oranges, pineapples, grapes, mangoes, or pawpaw) in a colorless glass jar.</li>
<li>Make a cone (with a narrow opening at one of its ends) using plain paper and place it on a glass jar/container.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
This trap work by preventing fruit flies from getting out once they flew in. The colorless glass jar (help in observation) and rotting/fermenting smell pulls fruit flies into the Trap through the entrance (cone opening).</li>
<li>The cone&rsquo;s conical shape prevents the fruit flies from flying back once in (hence trapping them).</li>
<li>This Trap is not suitable for the living room.
Though it can be used in the kitchen, it&rsquo;s supposed to be kept in an enclosed place (the rotting old fruits smell is not pleasant). The Trap
is best suited for outdoors
and near decomposing materials, near the bins or flowerbeds.
Empty the Trap after every two to 4 days to reduce the adverse effect of rotting fruits on the surroundings.

<h3 id="8-heated-milk-sugar--pepper-trap">8. Heated Milk/ Sugar &amp; Pepper Trap</h3>
<p>In this kind of Trap, you will require to have milk (powder or liquid form), black/red peppers (around five pieces), sugar (a quarter kilogram), and a glass jar or basin (depth 30cm and 50cm diameter - approximate).
Follow this procedure to come up with a trap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 80ml of milk (add water if you are using milk powder) with sugar and heat for 3 to 7 minutes while stirring until the entire sugar dissolves.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into the glass jar and shake to allow it to stick to the container&rsquo;s sidewall.</li>
<li>Grind the pepper, sprinkle in the mixture and stir for a few seconds.</li>
<li>Make sure the milk foams form a sticky top layer.</li>
<li>Set the Trap near the fruit flies infected area. In case the infestation is massive, make two or three of these traps.
The sugar acts as a spice, which, when mixed with milk, will emit an attractive scent that pulls the fruit flies into the Trap. The milk has a sticky substance that traps and drowns fruit flies on landing/stepping. The pepper will emit a spicy scent that poisons the surface of the milk-making fruit flies to fall faster. This Trap should not be kept near the kids (pepper emission will make one shed tears).
You will need to empty the Trap after 4 to 6 days by pouring the entire mixture. Though expensive, heated milk/sugar &amp; pepper trap can kill many fruit flies (it may eradicate the whole colony of fruit flies with a subsequent number of times).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/best-dog-backpack-carrier-for-hiking/">Fleas</a> are a harsh pest when they attack your pets including dogs and cats. The bloodsuckers (fleas) will bite the dogs, causing irritation, scratching, pain, and even diseases. But how do dogs get fleas?
<strong>In brief, dogs may get fleas from places such as the backyard, the park,�</strong>
<strong>Pet facilities,�</strong>
<strong>or when they come into contact with animals such as wildlife and pets. Outdoor animals that may bring fleas to dogs include foxes, raccoons, deer, rabbits, opossum, skunks, squirrels, ferrets, birds, and rodents.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-how-do-dogs-get-fleas">Details: How Do Dogs Get Fleas?</h2>
<h3 id="1-dogs-can-get-fleas-from-wild-animals">1. Dogs Can Get Fleas From Wild Animals</h3>
<p>Despite that, you may be keeping your dogs in a domesticated way and they&rsquo;re the only pets using the yard, fleas may still jump onto them from wild critters like rabbits, deer, and
squirrels
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogs could pick up those fleas when they come into contact with various wild animals; this is because they&rsquo;re sociable animals that&rsquo;ll move around the yards, parks, or even come near various pets.
You&rsquo;ll notice that dogs will wander in areas where wild animals that carry fleas are equally frequent. In the backyard or during their daily walk dogs will get into contact with animals such as
deer, raccoons, rodents, squirrels, rabbits, and birds.
Thus as the dogs take social activities, they may contact fleas via contact with the wild animals. Notably, fleas will jump onto dogs or humans and get carried to other locations where they&rsquo;ll build up their colony.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="preventing-dogs-from-getting-fleas-and-ticks-from-wild-animals">Preventing Dogs from Getting Fleas and Ticks from Wild Animals</h4>
<p>To prevent fleas from jumping onto dogs from the wild animals, it&rsquo;s important to hinder the wildlife from getting into your backyard or garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>While at it, ensure to remove all objects or things that may attract the wild animals such as seeds, nuts, and other dogs.
Further, remove garbage and garbage bins from your backyard as they could attract wildlife. For example, removing garbage may help prevent the coming of hungry
raccoons and foxes - this could have brought fleas to your dogs.
However, dogs may still socialize with various wildlife and other pets -which implies that the most critical control of fleas will be using an effective and regular flea treatment.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-contact-with-domestic-animals">2. Contact with Domestic Animals</h3>
<p>Flea-infested domestic animals and pets may also pose a risk to making dogs get fleas. For example, dogs may also get fleas through contact with feral animals and other domestic pets such as cats.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;d note that Ctenocephalides canis (<a href="/posts/best-dog-beds/">dog</a> fleas) may not just attack and suck blood from cats but could also jump onto and bite dogs and their puppies.
Fleas have back legs that are very strong that&rsquo;ll allow them to jump onto the tail or body of the dog from other domestic pets that are in the house or backyard.
Dogs will also get fleas from grass - fleas will jump onto the dog and suck its blood - and then they&rsquo;ll jump off back to the grass waiting for other hosts.</li>
<li>You may notice that the dog is spending hours scratching themselves around the yard - maybe after picking those fleas from the grass or other pets.
However, humans too may pick fleas from the yard and the bugs will jump onto your pant legs, socks, and shoes - and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-carry-fleas-from-one-home-to-another/">you&rsquo;ll carry fleas to your house</a>
.
Unfortunately, fleas could also get into your house in different ways and develop into a colony to finally attack your dogs. For example, fleas could into the house by
hitching pets and clothes worn by humans or even climbing onto mice - they&rsquo;ll come in and lay many eggs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="preventing-dogs-from-getting-fleas-and-ticks-from-pets-and-house">Preventing Dogs from Getting Fleas and Ticks from Pets and House</h4>
<p>You can prevent the fleas from hitting your pets and your house by adopting effective flea treatment for your
furry friends and the home area.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if there is a mice or rodent problem in the house, you may require to take up appropriate control for these animals from the home.
Wash and flea treat the pet bedding - washing should be done at 50 degrees Celsius as this will be appropriate to exterminate the flea eggs and also the adult fleas.
Also, I recommend that you vacuum the carpets and other such flooring materials to remove all the flea stages - and ultimately dispose of that dangerous vacuum bag.</li>
<li>I also advise you to steam clean the floor and carpet to help kill those flea larvae.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3pet-service-facilities">3.<strong>Pet Service facilities�</strong></h2>
<p>Dogs may also get flea some pets&rsquo; facilities; these may include
boarding kennels, grooming facilities, and dog&rsquo;s daycare facilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, dogs may stick fleas from these facilities even with the strict flea-free regulations and rules being adhered to strictly.
For example, dogs may also get fleas from the facilities of the pet groomer - fleas may hike the pet and come reproduce fast in your house, pet house, or yard.</li>
<li>In addition, fleas could also have jumped onto the groomer&rsquo;s clothes and gear that have become flea-infected.
So, ensure that the service provider in the pet care facility adheres strictly to all pest prevention
protocols as this may guarantee that the dog is protected from fleas.
Further, check how the pet service facility responds or helps whenever a bug infection is found in any other pets that are attended there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="treating-dogs-from-fleas--treatment">Treating Dogs From Fleas -<strong>Treatment</strong></h2>
<p>Treating the dogs and the surrounding off fleas will be an appropriate step to undertake for prevention and control of those blood-suckers.</p>
<ul>
<li>An appropriate and initial step that you must take is to flea-treat the dog using a suitable flea shampoo - especially one that&rsquo;s prescribed for the age of your dog.
Use a flea comb that is fine-toothed for dogs that have long hair as this will help remove the fleas, their eggs, and also flea dirt from the fur.</li>
<li>Additional flea treatment that you may use must be approved or prescribed by the veterinarian - and these must control all fleas in various life stages including larvae and adult fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Summers come with heat and many fleas - which might land on your dog. We&rsquo;ve outlined that dogs may get fleas from various places including the wildlife, backyard, other pets, the house, or the pet care facilities if appropriate flea-control measures are not adopted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect the dog&rsquo;s tail, underbelly, and fur for the presence of any adult fleas - check with your vet for appropriate and great flea control techniques to use on your dog.
Cheers!</li>
