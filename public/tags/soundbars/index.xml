<p>Yamaha YAS-209BL will also give you quality and excellent sound thanks to its many packed features. The versatile soundbar does great work in balancing power and detail.</p>
<p>I would note that Yamaha YAS-209BL includes extra features like Amazon Alexa that&rsquo;s inbuilt and also voice assistance - a great soundbar for the money. The entry-level Yamaha YAS-209 bar produces a great sound profile while its subwoofer will give you great bass.
This YAS-209BL beats the YAS-207both on the features and versatility like the in-built Amazon Alex great for working with the 4K television. Besides, right &amp; left channels but its virtual surround will assist in projecting the surround sound.
The soundbar will support HDR10 but it sadly lacks Dolby Vision HDR. But it generates a significantly impressive sound for the budget-friendly device. Also, the in-built Alexa is a plus besides the excellent controls for an even sleeker design compared to the Yamaha YAS-207.

The 5.1.2 soundbar provides adequate surround-sound plus bass for music and video entertainment. You&rsquo;ll require RCA-terminated cables to connect the soundbar to the subwoofer but you&rsquo;ll also require some power cord unless you&rsquo;ll use batteries.
However, the soundbar&rsquo;s overhead effect will require a reflective and flat ceiling surface at up to 12 feet above your speakers. Thus, this soundbar won&rsquo;t work well with non-reflective, drop ceilings, and angled ceilings - particularly when they&rsquo;re above the recommended height.
Further, the speakers have Dolby Atmos and hence with the right conditions in your room, a 20-degree angle will allow the sound to readily bounce off your ceiling to your position. But you&rsquo;ll get both high value and high-tech soundbar in this VIZIO SB36512-F6.

<h2 id="roku-smart-soundbar-review">Roku Smart Soundbar Review</h2>
<p>This is a quality and decent bar with limited trade-offs to ensure a more minimalistic appeal. For instance, it lacks buttons and thus losing the remote which is inconvenient.</p>
<h3 id="1-superior-design">1. Superior Design</h3>
<p>Compared to previous
Roku Speakers, this Roku Smart Soundbar will link with any TV but pairing with your TV would result in redundancy since both have in-built Roku.
This
Roku Smart Soundbar has a plastic build and sleek design plus you&rsquo;ll love the rounded ends looking much like the Bowers &amp; Wilkins Panorama.
Further,
Soundbar is tall measuring about 32.2 inches in width and 2.8 inches in height. Also, you&rsquo;ll love its beautiful front that&rsquo;s cloth-wrapped plus the LED light.
Further, under the
Soundbar grill, you&rsquo;ll find 4 2.5 inch drivers that are full-range. However, the Soundbar has no power button or controls - you&rsquo;ll require a remote controller.</p>
<h3 id="2-connectivity">2. Connectivity</h3>
<p>So, you might get into problems if you misplace the remote for the
Roku Smart Soundbar. But there might be an escape route with the Roku phone application or the remote finder for your Roku Ultra.
Further, at the bar&rsquo;s rear end, you&rsquo;ll find a USB port, optical port, and an HDMI
ARC and screw holes for wall-mounting. It&rsquo;s compatible with �Spotify Connect and Bluetooth.

No input switching with this
Roku Smart Soundbar since it&rsquo;s designed for HDMI connection. Further, you can&rsquo;t
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/soundbar-optical-vs-hdmi/">manually switch to the optical audio</a>
. If the HDMI port is used, the optical won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<h3 id="3-set-up-and-control">3. Set up and Control</h3>
<p>I noted that the
Roku Smart Soundbar is quite easy to set up and doesn&rsquo;t require specific applications such as the Yamaha apps. Notably, the Roku system in this soundbar will readily guide you through the various steps in a few minutes.
However, installing the wireless Roku speakers might take a bit longer since you&rsquo;d require to plug &amp; unplug the power before full registration. Also, there could be a problem with lip-synching�and you&rsquo;ll need to solve it using Vizio TV ( M series).
Besides, the start soundbar has an excellent voice remote that&rsquo;ll allow you to voice search once you hit the middle button. Also, the remote has an allowance for volume adjustment on its side. The Roku app will allow you to use the Roku&rsquo;s headphone like the

<h2 id="soundbar-optical-vs-hdmi---differences">Soundbar Optical Vs HDMI - Differences?</h2>
<p>Considering the digital-audio basics, both the optical and HDMI cables will pass your digital-audio between 2 devices. you won&rsquo;t have a difference either on Dolby digital plus other multi-channel audio.
However, a notable difference is your HDMI cables will give you higher-resolution audio that comprises the format you&rsquo;ll find in DTS HD Master and Dolby TrueHD audio.
On the other hand, Fiber optic can&rsquo;t transmit similar kinds of high-resolution formats of sound. Further, HDMI will also transmit video signals plus quality sound.
Therefore, HDMI is a great choice when you want to deal with lesser cables. However, consider if your different devices have the HDMI option or even its an older receiver.
Also, if you&rsquo;ve already connected different inputs to the TV and you only require the audio to a

<h3 id="1construction">1.�Construction</h3>
<p>HDMI cables are mainly made from Copper - it reduces interference occurrence and its equally less costly. But fiber optics are the key component making your Optical cables.
Being tiny glass (fiber optics), they won&rsquo;t transmit electricity but will be great for passing light signals - but they&rsquo;re expensive. Also, Optical cables will have less interference.
In addition, the fiber optics are covered by a dark sheath that&rsquo;ll bar other light sources, and hence they won&rsquo;t enter to interfere with the signal.

<h3 id="2length">2.�Length</h3>
<p>For most of use, your cable&rsquo;s length might not play a major role in the quality of your digital-audio transmission. However, some users may require long cables for various media rooms.

<ul>
<li>However, take about 10 meters of the optical cables and this will work just okay but some users still go up to 30 meters.
HDMI - HDMI connections have stricter length limitations compared to what you&rsquo;ll find with the optic cable.
So, for HDMI, only go for a maximum of 5 meters or you&rsquo;ll get poor quality sound transmission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3audio">3.�Audio</h3>
<p>On audio support, HDMI will work great with a format like DTS HD, TrueHD formats, and Dolby Digital Plus.
But the optical cables will support any surround sound that has a maximum of 5.1 channels.
Most TV programming will be broadcast using surround sound but there are also some Blu-ray discs that provide pimped sound quality.
Therefore, for Blu-ray content watching, I would say you consider HDMI as opposed to taking the fiber optical cables.
