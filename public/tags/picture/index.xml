<dt>itching feeling in me</dt>
<dd>does my dog have fleas? Or is it just unfounded fear?
Since I acquired my dog pet: my fluffy king, I have had numerous challenges. Some of them include feed selection,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-dogs/">flea medication selection</a>
, and safety.
However, none of the above challenges with my dog has been
disturbing as seeing fleas
running on my pet. I tried numerous flea treatments, but the fleas always came back.

<h2 id="how-to-check-for-fleas-7-steps-with-pictures">How to Check for Fleas? 7 Steps (with Pictures)</h2>
<p>To check for dog fleas on your pet, you will require the following tools; a
flea�comb
,
soaped water
, and a white kitchen�paper.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-a-visual-check-on-your-dog"><strong>Step #1: Conduct a visual check on your dog</strong></h3>
<p>Despite that flea are small in body size, it is possible to catch a bug&rsquo;s glimpse
when jumping
from one place to another. You might not see it on the first day you check, but if you are keen enough, you will finally set an eye on some of them.
The fleas are brown and appear fat when they have sucked blood from you or your pets. They will
also jump rapidly
to avoid being caught or escape harsh conditions such as water, chemicals, and hot objects.
However, if you see your dog scratching, it is time you should already consider the best flea control techniques.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-flea-comb-youth-dog"><strong>Step #2: Flea Comb youth dog</strong></h3>
<p>Upon careful consideration, you can order a
flea comb
to undertake this exercise. Run the
flea comb
through the dogs fur or coat.
Ensure to put
adequate pressure on the flea comb
to touch the dogs skin smoothly. Check if the flea comb has picked some adult fleas or flea�dirt�(flea droppings or fleas).�Drown any fleas that you catch using soapy water.
Flea droppings are mainly comma-shaped, and when placed on the wet kitchen paper, they leave a red ring, signifying blood from the flea.

<strong>Next, some details on the flea life cycle �</strong>
This will help you understand why fleas have always come back and how you can wittingly get ahead of the coming fleas generation.
<strong>The flea life cycle is divided into four stages:</strong>
<strong>- Eggs:</strong>
One adult
flea can lay about 40 eggs
each day. Female
fleas lay eggs
24-36 hours after they take the first blood meal (flea bite). The eggs are visible to a naked eye and look pearly white, and are oval.
<strong>- Larvae</strong>
the larvae stage lasts from 5-12 days. Fleas have 3 larval stages.
<strong>- Pupa</strong>
Flea has 4 pupa stages: This is a highly protect phase of the fleas and may last up to 210 days.
<strong>- Pre-emergent adults</strong>
This stage is also referred to as the waiting stage. Notably, fleas in this stage emerge as adults if stimulated by heat, carbon dioxide, pressure, and vibration.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-target-the-entire-flea-life-cycle">**Step #3: **<strong>Target the Entire Flea Life Cycle</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe youll require using a combination of
flea treatment
options to eliminate the bugs from your home.
To effectively control the fleas, youll need to keep your dog indoors for 2 weeks after treating him, the kernel, and his bedding. However, you can still walk with him but avoid the lawns to avoid re-infestation.
After treating the
dog and house for fleas
, continue vacuuming the floors. Vacuuming will help eject the
flea eggs and larvae
from their cocoons and thus be reached by the insecticide.

<h2 id="what-do-dog-fleas-look-like-and-does-my-dog-have-some">What do dog fleas look like, and does my dog have some?</h2>
<p>Dog fleas are small brown insects that attack dogs and cats, and other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite being small in body size, dog fleas can be seen using naked eyes. Also,fleas jump and hop from one hostto another with their strong legs.</li>
<li>Therefore, I must have been getting it wrong as the flea treatments only provided short-lived solutions.</li>
<li>Over the years, I have learned the need to have the right information about fleas&rsquo;signs and symptomson my dog and the useful products for controlling the bugs.</li>
<li>**Surely:�**You would like to learn from my experience; rather than yours! I have learned how to manage my cat and the pest that affects it the hard way.</li>
<li>Therefore, read on to learn the various signs, symptoms,recommended treatments, and safety precautions to take while considering fleas on your dog.
<strong>So, how do you free your dog from fleas?�</strong>
After a careful analysis of expert veterinary information combined with the vast experience with dealing with my dogs, in this guide,
<strong>I will aim to answer the following questions:�</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-do-fleas-keep-coming-back">Why do fleas keep coming back?</h1>
<p>Fleas thrive excellently in warm summer months and wet spring months but may appear at any time. However, after the flea appears in your residence, getting rid of them will be a daunting task.
While you start on the journey to fight fleas in your residence and on your dog, fleas have a particular advantage that makes them very hardy. Here the particular flea advantages:
<strong>Biological advantages</strong>
Flea has very back legs with significant muscle powers. The powerful legs enable the pest to jump about 1 foot vertically and 4-5 feet horizontally. These biological features allow the flea to navigate from one host to another and hide from different insect control mechanisms.
<strong>Advanced and long life cycle</strong>
Female
fleas lay many eggs
, about 30 eggs, in a day, and thus have a high reproduction rate. The eggs are also tiny and can thus hide on your dog or in cracks, crevices, and carpets. The eggs&rsquo; lightweight allows the dog to carry them around your house and fall off in different locations in your residence.
Flea eggs hatch within
one week, which could delay waiting for the right conditions. After hatching, the eggs turn into larvae.
The
flea larvae
create cocoons, and they move into them to grow into pupae, which takes about 1 week. However, fleas in the cocoon can survive for 6 months if they are not favorable to become adults. Also, a female flea can survive for about 1.5 years.
<strong>Fleas have good hiding</strong>
abilities.
For each flea that you spot in your facility, there could be other hundreds hiding in different locations such as under carpets and cracks. The
fleas that are hiding
could be in different developmental stages: larvae, eggs, and cocoons.
Therefore, it would be helpful to use products such as the
best fogger for fleas
in your home when there is a major infestation.
A flea can survive without feeding.
**Surprisingly! **
Fleas are capable of surviving for a long time without feeding. For example, after one blood feeding, the flea can survive for one month.
Various insect controlling chemicals such as
sprays
and foggers are good at fighting adult fleas. However, I recommend that you use
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A755Q3O/?tag=p-policy-20">natural pest control concentrate</a>
to kill fleas in all their developmental stages.</p>
<h2 id="prevent-flea-re-infestation-on-your-dog">Prevent flea re-infestation on your dog?</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-control-fleas-outside-the-house"><strong>Step #1: Control Fleas outside the house</strong></h3>
<p>Do you have a lawn outside your house? That should be your first concern while you are aiming to
prevent flea infestation
on your dog. Lawns form an excellent residence for fleas, their eggs, and larvae.
Fleas love living
in the grass, and from there, they can hop and jump onto any animal, including you and your dog, that passes on the lawn.
Therefore, you should cut the grass short to enable heat from the sun to get to the roots. Such a condition would make the fleas uncomfortable, and thus fleas would not hide there.
Also, you can sprinkle
Diatomaceous Earth
(DE) on the lawn. The
Diatomaceous Earth
would break the fleas skins, absorb its moisture and thus kill them. Further, sprinkle the powder in the pets house and around your house.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-treat-you-dog-to-fleas"><strong>Step #2: Treat you Dog to fleas</strong></h3>
<p>After tackling the fleas from outside your house, it is now time to
kill or prevent any fleas
that would like to make your dog their host.
There are many products available to
treat fleas on your dog and cats
. Ensure to read online buyer reviews and talk to your vet to learn the best practices
for flea
prevention and control.
Despite that you might consider
cats and dogs
as almost equals, it is critical to note that some dog flea treatment chemicals can harm your cat. Therefore, please consult with your vet, read label instructions, and adhere to them!</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-flea-treat-my-indoor-dogs"><strong>Do I Need To Flea Treat My Indoor Dogs?</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the that your pets are always indoors, fleas will attack it like any other roaming pet. Notably, fleas, like any other insects, will jump into your dogs kernel at any time, and thus, you need to take safety control measures.
Many wild animals such as foxes, squirrels, and even rats may
carry fleas
. Also, wild and outdoor cats carry fleas, and when they pass near your homestead, they
drop the fleas
, their eggs, and larvae. Then, the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/">fleas jump onto any human</a>
being or animal to reach your indoor dog.
If there are some critters in your house, then they can carry fleas to the indoor dog. Despite that you may not set eyes on the mice, they could drop the fleas and their eggs in the house. The eggs would hatch and attach themselves to another host, the indoor cat or dog.
Also, since fleas love warm atmospheres, they will jump on your clothes when you walk around your yard and drop into the house to attack your dog.
<strong>Therefore:�</strong>
[thrive_text_block color=&ldquo;note&rdquo; headline=&quot;] Despite that your dog is always indoors, they can get fleas through various methods that include the fleas jumping into their kernel or being carried by a host to the house. Some of the hosts could include mice, wild cats, and human beings. [/thrive_text_block]
It is important to install various flea prevention methods to safeguard your dog from flea infestation. Treat your indoor dog and cat as often as you would treat any pet roaming around your yard.</p>

<p>Ensure you control fleas when it is most critical before a major infestation occurs. For example, you should note that the flea problem will be worst in the warm-weather months while tick will hit you more in spring and summer.
Therefore, in addition to controlling the fleas on an all-year-round basis, you should have extra precautionary flea control measures for the seasons that the fleas execute their major infestation.</p>
<h3 id="2-consult-your-vet"><strong>#2: Consult your Vet</strong></h3>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you trying to determine if we have bed bugs in the house? First, I&rsquo;ll narrate a personal experience I had eight months ago.
I had just come back from our vacation - I was into 1 Vrbo and two hotels - which I had thoroughly inspected with no signs of bed bugs.
However, the next day, spots appeared on my daughter&rsquo;s arms and legs - as shown in the picture. I was worried - probably just like you are.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
So, in this post, I&rsquo;ll outline different pictures of bed bug bites that&rsquo;ll help you determine if bed bugs have bitten you.

<p>The bites are usually found on the body parts that are
exposed to the bed bugs
while you sleep. These could be the neck, hands, shoulders, legs, arms, and face. Though not the usual case,
bed bug bites
are usually found in small groups.</p>
<p>In the bitten area, they might be linear or in the form of a zigzag. If you see small, raised, or flat spots that might become itchily inflamed or blistered, then you might be a
victim of a bed bug bite
.
The type and time of reaction depend on the type of
skin and the number of bites
from the insects. Some people get skin reactions long after the bites, while some call it almost immediately.
The fact is that reactions dont occur immediately you receive a bite. It could take from a few minutes to one week. This is also the time that your body starts to manifest the bite symptoms. When they pierce the skin to suck blood,
bed bugs inject with their saliva
, an anti-coagulant.

<h2 id="symptoms-of-bed-bug-bite-bite-identification">Symptoms of Bed Bug Bite-Bite Identification</h2>
<p>Some people will develop itching, and some will develop red welts or swelling the following day after receiving the bite. Still, other people will not show any signs of bites several days after the event.</p>
<p>Moreover, some people dont react to the bed bug bites; neither do they have any marks after getting bitten. This means the problem will go totally unnoticed.
Compared to bites of other insects, the
bed bug bites will always appear
in grouped, small red marks on the areas that have been bitten.
In the beginning, the victim will encounter a slight burning sensation. This is followed by itchiness, and then the area might turn red and or swell slightly. The duration for the symptoms to appear varies among individuals.
The red bumps formed after the bites are known as wheals or papules. If the biting was extreme, the swellings might turn into skin inflammations that look like blisters.</p>

Sleep deprivation is another
problem caused by bed bugs

Due to the quick
spread of bed bugs
at home, living in a house infested with some might be stressful and frustrating. If you live in a stressful condition for a long period, you will end up with emotional anxiety, hence reducing your work productivity.
From emotional anxiety, you might develop unhealthy behaviors such as excessive smoking and drinking that might impact your immune system.

<p>Baby
bed bugs will hatch from eggs
(theyre pinhead-sized) and grow to be adults in only one month. But these insects will require a dry and warm environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bug eggs (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/bed-bugs-appearance-and-life-cycle">nymphs</a>) are visible using your naked eye - theyre colored translucent (when freshly hatching) to whitish-yellow/ brownish as they continue feeding.</li>
<li>After hatching from the eggs, baby Cimex lectularius quickly hunts for a good blood meal. Without a blood meal, the bugs wont develop to their next stage.
Despite that they can endure days even up to 1 month devoid of feeding, the bugs can feed even once daily while also casting their skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bed bug larvae measure about a millimeter when they are born, and they tend to be pale white, which makes them blend readily with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can see blood inside a nymph babies body after it has had its generous blood meal.
Youll notice that these bugs look anything like a small swollen balloon. To treat these bed bugs infestations,

<p>Well, for a small bed bug infestation, could be just one female whos mated and shes in a package or your home - and thats all theyll require.
The bed bug needs to feed on blood to nourish the eggs shed produce.</p>
<h3 id="3-pictures-of-bed-bug-eggs-theyre-oval--white">3. Pictures of Bed bug Eggs (Theyre Oval &amp; White)</h3>
<p>Females will lay about
250 eggs over their lifetime
, which is about 2-4 months.
The oval and white eggs are 1/16 inches in length - something like the rice grain - and youll mainly find them in crevices and cracks.</p>
<p>The eggs have round ends with an elongated and oval-shaped body.</p>
<ul>
<li>The eggs are attached to a glue-type substance thatll render them challenging to remove or move.</li>
<li>But the eggs have a wet spot look - you can use a flashlight plus a magnifying lens to search for them.
Theyll hatch into babies in about 6-10 days.

<h3 id="3-males-vs-female-bed-bugs">3. Males vs. Female Bed Bugs</h3>
<p>The main
difference between females vs. male bed bugs
is that they have a rounded abdomen while the males have a pointed abdomen.

<dt><em>Females</em></dt>
<dd>Female
bed bugs will only lay eggs
if they mate with their male counterparts - they need the males sperm. Females have a
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/2/2/151">hemocoel</a></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>an empty abdominal space to store their eggs.</li>
<li>After mating, the females will store sperm from the males and even draw from it to create mature eggs multiple times.
Besides sperms, female bed bugs require a
bed bug blood meal
before creating and laying their eggs.
<em>Males</em>
: Male dont produce eggs, and they lack ovaries. Males will break through the females shell, aim at the abdomen (its tiny dark spot) to deposit their sperms in the hemocoel.
The sperms
spread via the blood of the female bed bugs
until it reaches the ovaries - in what we term traumatic insemination.
**Bed Bug Patterns **</li>
<li>Female and male bed bugs have stripes patterns that move right to the left. They use this system to allow abdominal expansion when feeding on blood.</li>
<li>However, the females will show a small ridge at the back near its tail - the exact hemocoel location.</li>
<li>Therefore, youll notice that the stripes will look somehow curved as they cross this ridge on their back.
<strong>Bed Bug Skin Color</strong></li>
<li>Definitely, it&rsquo;s possible to
see through the bed bugs&rsquo;
skin despite brown hair. So, weve noted that females and males hold (based on their functions) internal organs differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, you can see the hemocoel and ovaries in the female bed bugs.
Further, you can see a dark area on the females abdomen (at its back) - which we noted is its hemocoel.</p>
<h3 id="4-bed-bugs-engorged-with-blood">4. Bed Bugs Engorged with Blood</h3>
<p>Bed bugs will mainly feed on blood meals during the night - this is when sleeping humans release carbon dioxide that tends to attract these bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 5 to 10 minutes, the Cimex lectularius will be fully engorged with your blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bugs will also suck blood from different warm-blooded hosts despite being feasting on human blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>But for heavily-infested places, bed bugs will also feed take their blood meal in the daytime.</li>
<li>One hollow tube will inject anesthetics (saliva-looking liquid) into the human skin, making the area numb.
The other hollow tube will draw the hosts blood. The bugs will hide for about 5 to 10 days; theyll digest the blood, mate, and lay eggs during the time.

<p>Female Cimex lectularius will lay their eggs in crevices and cracks, particularly on the edges of your bed frames, box springs, and mattresses.</p>
<p>The pest will also occupy crevices and cracks - hiding in bed rails, headboards, empty bed stands, mattresses tufts or folds, and spring soils. Youll see cast skins, fecal stains, and even eggs.</p>
<p>First, to control these bugs, stay off the home, change your bedding, and clean up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check reddish or rusty stains on mattresses and bedsheets from the pests that may have been crushed.</li>
<li>Check for nymphs and their skins (colored pale-yellow) or the dark spots mainly caused by Cimex lectularius poop.
Further, examine the clothing and under crevices.</li>
