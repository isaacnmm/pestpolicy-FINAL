  <div class="post-content"><p>Really, what do flea eggs look like? Well, for anyone whos been
bitten by a bed bug
, you can be sure some tiny flea eggs are lurking around to hatch  either from your cat or dogs.
<em>But to control flea eggs, you must effectively know their physical appearance and places where theyre hidden  including differences between flea eggs and flea dirt.�</em>
*In summary, <a href="/posts/flea-eggs-vs-dandruff/">fleas</a> eggs are tiny specs (0.5 lengths by 0.25 mm width), rounded-oval shape, with a flexible-chorion and softshell. *
<em>Adult females fleas produce eggs 1 to 2 days after taking a full blood meal and mating. <a href="/posts/how-long-do-flea-eggs-take-to-hatch/">Flea</a> eggs will be laid on a host like cats or dogs, but they&rsquo;ll fall off shortly (within hours).�</em>

<h2 id="flea-eggs---what-do-flea-eggs-look-like">Flea Eggs - What Do Flea Eggs Look Like?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#flea-eggs---what-do-flea-eggs-look-like">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-size---how-big-is-flea-eggs">1. Size - How big is Flea Eggs?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-size---how-big-is-flea-eggs">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flea eggs, particularly
cat flea eggs
, measure about 0.25 millimeters in width and 0.5 millimeters in length. Despite that, you can see the eggs with your unaided human eye - particularly when in clusters, these creatures are tiny in body size.
In the house,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flea-eggs-vs-dandruff/">flea eggs will be found</a>
in pets&rsquo; visits, feed, sleep, and rest. Also, the immature fleas will grow inside carpets - use
flea carpet powder to control
.
You can control
adult fleas
using
powders
,
dawn dish soap
. Below are additional pointers for flea eggs that may be in your house (or
fleas human hair
), yard, or on the pet.
Flea eggs are microscopic creatures thatll look like the grain of salt. Notably, a single grain of salt dropped on some of the ground may be difficult to notice or find. They are microscopic and thus will only be seen when theyre in clusters.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0W5eeUqcQQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0W5eeUqcQQ</a></p>
<h3 id="2color---what-color-are-flea-eggs">2.�Color - What Color Are Flea Eggs?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2color---what-color-are-flea-eggs">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flea eggs are off-white because of their flexible-chorion and soft shell  it may mistake the flea egg for a grain of salt
of dirt while on the ground.
The oval-shaped eggs may also be mistaken for the color of human dry skin thats whitish and rough due to lack of oiling. However, the identity of the fleas eggs may only be fully verified with a microscope.
For this process, youll position the flea eggs on some dark paper before looking at it through a magnifying glass or microscope lens. Notice whether the object is oval-shaped, plus characteristically off-white or white  if so, this could be flea eggs.</p>
<h3 id="3-shape">3. Shape<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-shape">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flea eggs take the shape of an oval but elongate object that also has two rounded ends. Further, the viable flea eggs will have its surface being smooth and lacks indentations.
However, the insecticide-sprayed or non-viable flea eggs look collapsed and dimpled. Despite that, youll find the eggs dry. Theyre at first sticky and wet when laid.
So,
flea eggs are oval and clear
(off -white) tiny specs in the shape and size of sand or salt grains. However, the eggs mainly exist in the 20s as a cluster and will mostly be seen in the pets sleeping area and rarely on the cats or dogs fur.
**But, can you see flea eggs? **
<em>Fleas eggs can be seen with the naked human eye, but they&rsquo;re significantly small. Therefore, it would help to look around when you suspect a flea infestation in your space.</em>
However, if you&rsquo;re inspecting the pet&rsquo;s fur, or bedding, or thick carpet, it would be challenging to see the flea eggs with your naked eggs - so use a magnifying glass.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-fleas-lay-eggs">Where Do Fleas Lay Eggs?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#where-do-fleas-lay-eggs">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-pet-hosts---cats-and-dogs">1. Pet Hosts - Cat&rsquo;s and Dogs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-pet-hosts---cats-and-dogs">¶</a></h3>
<p>In summary, fleas mainly lay their eggs directly on their host - including pets like the
dog&rsquo;s hip area and the cat&rsquo;s
neck area. Also, adult fleas are mostly permanent ectoparasites
on their hosts
.
You&rsquo;ll mainly find the flea eggs on regions that are generally less groomed - mainly when you don&rsquo;t
use the cat flea comb
frequently.</p>
<h3 id="2-falling-off-their-host">2. Falling off their Host<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-falling-off-their-host">¶</a></h3>
<p>Generally, dry flea eggs are not sticky, and thus they&rsquo;ll easily fall off from the host&rsquo;s fur and body even before you embark on grooming your pet.
Notably, about 58 percent of the
cat flea
eggs will have fallen off from the pets (cats and dogs) in 2 hours after they&rsquo;re laid. Over 3/4 of the flea eggs will have fallen off within 8 hours.
However, if the
pet&rsquo;s hair
is long or isn&rsquo;t well-groomed, some flea eggs will remain hidden in the thick fiber - mainly if the hair is dirty and dense.
Further, the
flea bites cause server irritation and scratching</p>
<ul>
<li>this process makes it easier for the dirt and eggs to fall off from the cats or dogs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-outdoors-and-indoor-environment">a. Outdoors and Indoor Environment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-outdoors-and-indoor-environment">¶</a></h4>
<p>The eggs that are dislodged from the host will fall into either the
outdoor and indoor
environment. Notably, these eggs will fall off where the pets will be sleeping or walking into.
Therefore, the movement of the host will influence the spaces where the eggs will be distributed. But most of them will be lying around the feeding, resting, and sleeping areas of the pets.</p>
<h4 id="bhumid-and-warm-micro-climate">b.�Humid and Warm Micro-climate<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bhumid-and-warm-micro-climate">¶</a></h4>
<p>Under unfavorable humidity and temperature, fleas eggs tend to desiccate very fast. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll mainly find viable and live eggs around areas with humid and warm micro-climates.
The RH should be anywhere above 50%, while the �Ambient temperature needs to be in the range of 11C to 39C to enable the eggs&rsquo; survival.</p>
<h3 id="3-carpeted-rooms">3. Carpeted Rooms<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-carpeted-rooms">¶</a></h3>
<p>The fleas will thus be clustered and hidden in the
carpet
. So, below are the areas where flea eggs lay their eggs in the house, apartment, or yard.
The carpet canopy will protect the
flea larvae
and eggs from insecticides, vacuuming, airflow, and sunlight while also holding food for the flea larvae.
The eggs will mainly incubate in upholstery, cushions, pet bedding, floor-board cracks, rugs, and carpeting. However, they may also incubate on wooden floors or carpeted areas.</p>
<h3 id="4-yard-and-lawns">4. Yard and Lawns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-yard-and-lawns">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is critical to note that fleas rarely survive the harsh and sun-flooded outdoor spaces. Further, suitable places for the eggs to survive need shade and wind-shaded plus an RH of over 46%.
Flea eggs incubation zones in the yard include crawl spaces, gardens,
flower beds
, cat shelters, and dog houses. These places must be devoid of hot sun rays and excessive wind.</p>
<h2 id="flea-eggs-vs-flea-dirt">Flea Eggs vs. Flea Dirt<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#flea-eggs-vs-flea-dirt">¶</a></h2>
<p>Flea dirt is an outcome of significant flea infestations, making it confused for clustered flea eggs. However, flea dirt will crumble readily, and it is dark-colored.
You can
differentiate flea dirt by placing
the &ldquo;dirt drops&rdquo; on some white canvas, adding some water drops, and checking if it&rsquo;ll turn reddish - this is a sign of digested host blood.
So, compared to rec, moving flea eggs, it&rsquo;s easy to clean up flea dirt - simply
vacuuming the clothes
, bedding, and carpets. However, flea eggs would require insecticides like
foggers for fleas
.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-for-flea-eggs-to-hatch">How Long Does It Take for Flea Eggs to Hatch?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-long-does-it-take-for-flea-eggs-to-hatch">¶</a></h2>
<p>Flea eggs will hatch in 1 week (from 2 days) to 2 weeks - with the right
environmental conditions are the correct
relative humidity and temperature. Flea eggs are roughly half of the whole adult flea population.
Notably, with high humidity and warmer temperatures, the flea eggs would hatch faster. They&rsquo;ll quickly progress to other
life stages
, including larvae, flea pupa, and adult fleas.
The eggs will be found in batches - on batch having 20 eggs clustered together. Notably, each adult female eggs will lay about 40 eggs each day to more than 1,200 eggs in its lifetime.
After hatching, the eggs grow into
larvae that&rsquo;ll eat flea
dirt. The larvae will develop their cocoon in 1-3 weeks so that it now grows to its pupae stage.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-flea-eggs">How to Kill Flea Eggs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-kill-flea-eggs">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-washing-or-laundering">1. Washing or Laundering<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-washing-or-laundering">¶</a></h3>
<p>Washing or laundering the pet&rsquo;s
bedding and blankets
using hot water helps exterminate the flea eggs. Further, you&rsquo;ll need to wash all the stuffed animals and pet toys.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to wash up the bedding and clothes since pets will drop their eggs there once the eggs shell becomes dry or when you use a
flea comb
.
Washing machines can hence assist in
killing the flea infestation
. However, I would also recommend using dawn dish soap plus the hot water.
Finally, kill the flea eggs by bathing the cat or dog with some
flea killing shampoo
plus warm water. The shampoo contains insecticides and Insect growth regulators that&rsquo;ll kill adult,
baby
, and flea eggs.</p>
<h3 id="2-vacuuming">2. Vacuuming<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-vacuuming">¶</a></h3>
<p>Vacuuming will
kill flea eggs
and the larvae, too - equally by keeping your home tidy and clean. Also, you must vacuum under rugs and carpeted areas.
Vacuuming on the hidden areas allows a quicker sucking on flea cocoons, larvae, and eggs. Equally, flea frequently hates disruption by blowers or vibrations and hence will prevent flea growth.
Vacuuming will suck up the eggs in carpets and other fabrics. This will be incredibly helpful for indoor pets, spending most of their time on furniture, bed, or couch.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aKUWodbSQE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aKUWodbSQE</a></p>
<h3 id="3-grooming-with-flea-combs">3. Grooming with Flea Combs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-grooming-with-flea-combs">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flea combs for cats
or dogs will help eject the eggs (or their clusters) from the pet&rsquo;s fur. Therefore, ensure you run the combs thoroughly in the pet&rsquo;s fur without injuring their skin.
On the flip side,
flea combs
must not be used on the pet when they&rsquo;re in the yard - and if so, you&rsquo;ll need later to use an effective flea spray for the yard.
Insecticides must contain IGRs (Insect Growth Regulators) as they&rsquo;ll help cut short the reproduction of the bugs. This prevents the fleas in each stage from progressing to their next life cycle stage.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>Flea eggs
live in some limited places
. Notably, the bugs will only move from the regular hosts when the host dies.
The eggs won&rsquo;t stick on the fur and hence will fall off within an hour. Vacuum, launder the pet bedding, use effective insect growth regulators.</p>
