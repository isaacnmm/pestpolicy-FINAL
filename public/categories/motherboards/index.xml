<h3 id="1-laptop-combos-story">1. Laptop combos story</h3>
<p>Despite their exponential growth in popularity, not all laptop-tablet combos are made equal or match up perfectly to either their laptop or tablet counterparts.
Dont get me wrong here: Nothing trumps having the best of both worlds at your fingertips, but laptop-tablet combos can be rather clunky as tablet replacements or too slow and weak for today&rsquo;s laptops.</p>
<ul>
<li>While some come with all the trending designer-centric embellishments, some are totally lacking on that front.</li>
<li>That is why you really need to spend some time going over the available options and do an excellent job at comparison-shopping before putting your money down.
Some of the undesirable aspects that characterize some laptop-tablet combo options on the market when compared to either laptops or tablets include:
Pros:</li>
<li>Insufficient and in-expandable RAM</li>
<li>Rigid viewing angle</li>
<li>Lower Processor speeds</li>
<li>Overheating
Cons:</li>
<li>Too heavy</li>
<li>Compromised functionality</li>
<li>Too big
?
Lets get one thing clear:�You need to understand the terminology used to refer to options on the market before you can isolate the best laptop-tablet combo for your needs.</li>
<li>Though often used interchangeably, the terms hybrid and convertible refer to two distinct designs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-hybrid">2. Hybrid</h3>
<p>A hybrid (also known as detachable-hybrid) is generally a laptop that features a removable screen.
In such a scenario, the screen typically has full computing capabilities and its own power source to ensure that it continues to function even while detached from the chassis and keyboard or dock.</p>
<h3 id="3-convertible">3. Convertible</h3>
<p>A convertible (also known as convertible-hybrid) is some form of transformer as it can be folded back to transform from being a laptop into a handheld rectangular tablet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some feature a keyboard that can be easily flipped behind the screen. This design is best for you if you wish to have the keyboard with you at all times.
Consider the intended use -�Whatever your intended use of the product, some of the basic desirable traits in the best laptop-tablet combos include more battery power, processing speed, and less weight.
It goes without saying that the processor speed and the size of the RAM are important points that must appeal to the intended use of the product.</li>
<li>Apart from issues to do with the specific specs of the options on your shortlist, you also have to consider the aesthetic appeal.</li>
<li>The best-selling laptop-tablet combos are gifted with some of the sleekest and most vibrant designs and colors to choose from.
There are also a few subtle and not-so-subtle design differences that you have to consider, such as whether you want to go for one with a detachable screen or a 360-degree hinge.
We understand: Sifting through the myriad options to find the best match for your requirement, whether general use, business, gaming, school, or any combination thereof, is a task easier said than done.</li>
<li>Hope this piece on some of the best laptop-tablet combos available today goes a long way in helping you zero in on the best pick.</li>
<li>However, neither seems able to withstand the rampaging advancements driven by<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10447310801920524?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">ever-changing and increasing customer demands and tastes</a>.
To make your shopping easier, list all the desirable specs and make a decision on whether you want to go for a fully-detachable option or a convertible.
Dont let the details confuse you like the specs of all convertibles and detachable follow the same format as those of standard laptops.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are shopping on a budget, also offers used options that are still in mint and near-mint condition at heavily discounted prices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the product page of your Best Laptop Tablet Combo and check below the main product name and customer reviews for used and refurbished options.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite that the RAM, graphics card, and processor will directly affect YOUR PCs performance, a motherboard will influence the gadgets you can install and run on your computer.
Motherboard performance, in addition to the
Wireless PC Controller
quality, will affect your gaming experience. This post will assist you to choose your ultimate motherboard for the great gaming PC you need to build.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-choose-a-motherboard">Step by Step Guide on How To Choose A Motherboard</h2>
<p>For example, Hardware fitting, a key aspect to consider while building your gaming PC is dependent on your motherboard structure and technology.</p>
<h3 id="1-form-factor">1. Form Factor</h3>
<p>A motherboards
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_form_factor">form factor</a>
denotes ITS numbers and layout of connectors, ports, and mounting holes, kind of power supply, dimensions, and shape.
For example, the standard form factors require that the motherboard parts are fitting over varied technology groups and vendors.
Therefore, consider the type of case youll be using for the motherboard to decide on the one to purchase. Check Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-motherboard-for-i5-7600k/">i5 7600k motherboard</a>
.
However, if you already have a case that you require to employ in the PC build, then determine the motherboard specifications, one with a similar form factor, which will fit into it.
Most current computers employ the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroATX">ATX</a></p>
<ul>
<li>(microATX form factor) or the full ATX (ATX form factor)*
.
You should note that the microATX mobos are fitting with both the ATX case and the microATX case. However, your ATX will only be fitting with the ATX case.
However, be keen to note the nonstandard features of motherboards that will not fit into any of the other cases.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-processor-sockettype">2. Processor Socket�type</h3>
<p>A Processor socket, in the current mobos, is the part that connects your motherboard and the processor.
If youve been keen on the CPU interiors, your processor comes with many pins that will fit into the processor socket and the corresponding holes.
<em>Notably:�</em>
Most processor sockets today employ the ZIF lever in safeguarding your processor in its socket.
So, how do you know your processor socket type? Its easy to see the processor socket by determining the motherboard records and instructions.
Therefore, view the model number of the motherboard over the internet, on the socket (first eject the processor cooler), or by running the diagnostic utility tools.
Yes! In considering the Intel Socket 775, youll note that the manufacture reversed the female socket and the male processor outline by placing the holes in the processor while the pins are placed in the socket.
But is there an exception? Determine the processor that will fit into the

.</p>
<h3 id="3-operating-system-appropriate">3. Operating system appropriate</h3>
<p>Maybe you need to use the motherboard to run UNIX, BSD or Linux, or other operating systems other than Windows?
Then, you should consider the motherboards fitting with such other operating systems.
In this case, check the motherboards instructions or guide or the manufactures website to know its fitting status.

<h3 id="4-ram-support">4. RAM support</h3>
<p>RAM is an important part of your CPU build. Despite that the processor directly affects the CPU functioning, the RAM enhances its operations.
Considerably, DDR3 is a favorable RAM you can get and youll need to ensure it is supported by your selected motherboard. Notably, DDR4 RAM will come with 240-Pin Connectors while DDR4 will utilize 288-Pin Connectors.
Further, you must consider the form factor as itll determine the number of RAM slots available on the motherboard. Also, check whether the motherboard supports dual channel DDR that enables you to increase the PCs performance for gaming.
For instance, many motherboards can currently support the 4GB RAM, and DDR2 rising as very common due to its low cost and good speed.

<h3 id="5-storage-and-sata-support">5. Storage and SATA support</h3>
<p>Probably you already know that SATA outdoes IDE on both compactness, price, and transfer speeds. However, SATA has not fully outdone IDE and thus many motherboards will have both connections.
Therefore, if youll be moving the drives to your build, then make sure that the motherboard supports both the IDE and SATA connections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, most notebooks and motherboards will come with M.2 that provides a small form factors and quick transfer rates.</li>
<li>However, if your motherboard will not support SATA (at least for your old motherboard) you can use the commercially available SATA expansion cards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-chipset-support">6. Chipset support</h3>
<p>Note that youll not replace the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset">chipset</a>
(your PCs administrative assistant) on your motherboard at any time and thus you have to get your motherboard selection right the first time.
Notably, the
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/chipsets.html">chipset</a>
will affect the kind of memory, PCI/AGP Express, and processors that your motherboard will support and the kind.
Further, the CPU chipset will influence the type of networking, video, audio, Serial ATA, and USB 2.0 you may be used.</p>
<h3 id="7-expansion-slots">7. Expansion Slots.</h3>
<p>You must consider if the motherboards expansion slots will support Firewire or it has adequate for present and upcoming needs.
Further, how many USB slots will you require and how many are available? PCI Express (PCIe) and PCI are the popular expansion systems available.
