<p><em>But, is MacBook Air good for music production? Yes,�MacBook Air use an Intel i7 2.2GHz dual-core processor, and its thus a powerful laptop in the music production and live music tasks due to its fast speed. You can boost the i7 up to 3.2GHz to boost performance.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>As a second choice in studio recording, audio-processing &amp; mixing tasks, I recommend the Apple 15 inch MacBook Pro as the best laptop for music production.�</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1macbook-pro-retina-mid-2015---my-top-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DF43SY3/?tag=p-policy-20">1.MacBook Pro Retina Mid-2015 - My Top Pick</a></h2>
<p>This MacBook Pro is also the best laptop for music production in addition to being the
Top Mac
. For music production, ignore MacBook Pro (13&quot; Retina, Touch Bar).</p>
<dl>
<dt>I do home-recording demos running 31-40 tracks and 2-5 Plugins, &amp; 6-8 VST Instruments. This quad-core i7 MacBook Pro stopped my track freezing, and its 16GB RAM easily runs huge sample Instruments. It</dt>
<dt>works with m</dt>
<dt>ost DAWs, MIDI controllers, &amp; audio interfaces.</dt>
<dt><em>Here are its qualifying features</em></dt>
<dd>It has Core-Audio support, quiet keyboard (forget the noisy butterfly keys - in the newer models), has pre-installed audio packages (like Garageband DAW and Logic Pro X), HDMI,
*FaceTime HD camera, *
and full-sized USB Ports (USB 2.0 &amp; USB 3.0). Installing Logic DAW can enhance music production.
For extra memory bandwidth, the MacBook Pro comes with a 128 MB (Crystalwell) installed DRAM for your
CPU
. Its graphics processor (Intel Iris Pro 5200) will share memory (1 GB) with your system to allow the proper operation of its graphics. It has enough power to proved the resources to handle the symphonic synth or sample plugins - particularly when creating huge symphony-epic soundtracks.
Side Note
*: Factmag notes that faster MacBook Pro 2018 (processor and SSD - read &amp; write) won&rsquo;t considerably enhance your music production (despite having better specs than MacBook Pro 2015). It has overheating issues - since everyone is demanding more processing power and a very thin laptop. It has fewer USB ports - thus, you&rsquo;ll want a dongle or USB-C hubs. *
*MagSafe is gone - take care on stage. *
Verdict: MacBook Pro Retina 2015 satisfies most of the music production needs - becoming the best <a href="/posts/best-laptop-for-video-editing/">laptops</a> for recording music and

<p>As a windows kind of music producer, you&rsquo; love the Dell XPS 15! It merges an SSD drive and the powerful quad-core i7 processor (Intel) for fast production.</p>
<p>As the best windows laptop for music production, it has InfinityEdge technology, it&rsquo;s durable &amp; light (for on-the-go music making).
Compared to Apple laptops, this Dell&rsquo;s XPS 15 (among the thinnest 15 inch PC) will give you comparable performance in the studio but at a lower budget.
I love it for its top performance and style while running the DAWs for music production with a lovely ease. To handle multiple tasks and tracks, it has a 16GB RAM and an 8th Generation processor (Intel Core i7), which will quickly run the XFer&rsquo;s Serum.
With Dell XPS 15&rsquo;s touchscreen, you can make fast adjustments on tracks or quickly shift between music timelines - while still adding records to the production workflow. I loved its Ultra HD InfinityEdge display that is bright and has thin bezels for a lighter view.

<p>**Processor **
CPU (simply Processor) is the single most critical factor for music production on your laptop. However, clock speed needs to be your first priority (and not the number of cores) notwithstanding that you can still use many threads and cores.</p>
<p>For example, mixer tracks must not be linked as it would also mix their effects and instruments. Therefore, split the instruments to many channels. Further, get an Intel i5 processor or quad-core processor with high clock speed.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-your-best-fl-studio-laptops">Choosing your Best FL studio Laptops</h2>
<p>**1. SSD or HDD? Hard Drive &amp; Connection Ports **
I noted that SSD drives ( 1 TB SSD would be optimum) are more effective compared to HDD drives in music production. This is particularly helpful when running VSTs or load samples. However, you should note that the speed of your hard drive does not throttle the functioning of the FL Studio.
**2. ASIO Drivers Support and RAM **
For effective communication between the sound card and your FL Studio DAW, the ASIO drivers are very critical elements. However, as a pro music producer, you might require to purchase some audio interface (external).
I would say that a 16GB RAM would be adequate for handling the FL studio DAW, particularly if you&rsquo;re running many sample-based instruments.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>However, make sure your laptop comes with extra free RAM slots to allow future RAM upgrade - but add RAM in pairs all the time. Laptops have CL9-11 RAM. Hence,

I tested this MacBook Pro&rsquo;s low-latency performance using Ableton Live in Pro Tools and stand-alone with excellent results. It has pro ports - (4) 40Gb Thunderbolt 3 that also act as USBC connections.
Despite that, the 16-inch screen can&rsquo;t compare to the 27-inch in iMac Pro, MacBook Pro is significantly better than most Macs when it comes to less software clustering for music production.

<h3 id="4-apple-macbook-air-13-inch-retina-display---latest-model"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WRY8H/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch Retina display - Latest Model)</a></h3>
<p>The MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air for Music Production debate came up lately on an
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5855044">apple discussion</a>
. It has Thunderbolt 3 ports, a Retina display, a new trackpad and keyboard, and a modern Intel processor. Apple has maintained the 12 hours battery life, which is great for music production while traveling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to the old MacBook Air, this laptop has achieved a 30% upgrade on its Graphics performance.</li>
<li>It has a 128GB SSD storage to take 1 GB/sec and 2 GB/sec in write and read speeds, respectively. This is blazing fast for a laptop its size.
MacBook Air Retina display comes with a 2560x1600 resolution (with DCI-P3 color gamut). This is four times better compared to the older MacBook Air. It has black bezels, lighter (2.75 pounds), and thinner  just about the size of the MacBook Pro. It has Touch ID, which provides the real ESC key and Function keys. The T2 processor allows audio processing, disk encryption, secure booting.
MacBook Air has a new butterfly-switch keyboard with a silicone membrane for a quieter typing experience. This is because MacBook Air has low travel and prevents dust. Further, it has louder speakers with bass response. It also comes with the modern Force Touch trackpad that is easy to click and is more substantial.
Apple has done away with the MagSafe connector, SD card reader, USB-A ports. Instead, MacBook Air adopted USB-C charging and has two Thunderbolt 3 connectors (40 Gbps). Due to a lack of USB-A connectors, you&rsquo;ll need to purchase a dongle.</li>

<p>Macs are still a favorite with music-makers &amp; DJs. Apple 15&quot; MacBook Pro Retina is robust, has many USB ports,

Further, It&rsquo;s compatible with many DAWs that are optimized to work with the Mac OS. Therefore, there are fewer performance issues or crashes.
B
<em>ut, why didn&rsquo;t I include the MacBook Pro 2016?</em>
Well, MacBook Pro 2016 has a decorative touchpad - whose application is not fully utilized for music production. But get some hard-drives for great studio work.
Also, the 2016 model lacks the MagSafe connector, Firewire sockets, and USB ports. MacBook Pro 2016&rsquo;s Touch-Pad may allow faster access to the tempo, record, stop and play controls on the Ableton Live.
Apple 15&quot; MacBook Pro will comfortably run sessions with many plugins and tracks running actively. This is because it has superior 16GB RAM and processing power (quad-core Intel Core i7). But this Mac has some noise fans that could disrupt your recordings  if you&rsquo;re doing this in the same space.

) for large-sized files: Also, Apple 15&quot; MacBook Pro uses SSD storage (
256GB
), and thus you can easily store the large-sized files without slowing the machine. The base model has 8GB RAM and a 3.6 GHz processor (dual-core) that&rsquo;s making.
Here&rsquo;s how different music producers use their Macs. (1) Traditional production - Record music tracks via mics &amp; instruments and finally mix. (2) DJs and performing musicians will use their Mac in recording and producing tracks and yet in playing. (3) Lastly, hip-hop artists and EDMs use DAW with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-laptops-for-fl-studio/">Best Laptops For FL Studio</a>
, MIDI-keyboard controllers, &amp; sequencers.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a traveling producer, get a sleek, light, and compact Mac. MacBook Pro 13-inch is excellent for on-the-go music production (when you&rsquo;re traveling).
On storage, you&rsquo;ll require a Mac with enough internal disk space for your current projects. But you&rsquo;ll need to transfer other files to an external SSD storage - about 500 GB.
Also, ensure that the room&rsquo;s surfaces and shape are appropriate so that they won&rsquo;t negatively affect the sound&rsquo;s EQ during the recording sessions. I recommend the iMac Pro 27-inch as the Best Mac for Music Production.</p>

Matching your music production needs with the right sound <a href="/posts/best-graphics-card-for-music-production/">card</a> (or audio interface) is challenging.</p>
<p>Considerations include input channel class, DAW compatibility, form factor, and Input/Output (I/O).</p>
<p>For quality audio processing - soundcards will render audio tracks (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">converter software</a>

reat for your studio and on-the-go music recording.</p>
<p>It has amazing DAWs - Waves Audio plugins, Ableton Live Lite, and Cubase LE. Further, with the monitor mix knob, you can easily add or record new parts to your current composition.
Luckily, the audio interface allows various versatile inputs, such as a condenser or electric guitar. Its single USB cable will enable data to connect and power.
Every channel provides balanced 1/4&quot; &amp; XLR input (for Lo-Z sources and microphones). Further, you can change the 1/4&quot; input to receive instrument level source such as electric guitar or make it readily receive the line-level signal.
You can get 48V to your XLR inputs from the phantom power switch that&rsquo;s great for professional condenser mics. The audio interface provides zero-latency monitoring for your input signal. Also, the LED metering will give you direct visual feedback for your input levels.

It also allows a 96 kHz sample rate and 24-bit resolution recording, which will give a producer the best quality recordings. However, if you still need FireWire connectivity and MIDI ins or outs on your audio interface, you may try the Focusrite Saffire Pro 14.

are combo XLR or Hi-Z, signal metering, direct monitoring, phantom power, and MIDI.
Luckily, the interface will have multiple cables (such as the MIDI breakout) to allow you to connect to your different devices. However, this IK Multimedia iRig

interface may lose some stability if its battery goes down on power.
Therefore, if you&rsquo;ll be recording music away from the studio or mains connection, it&rsquo;ll be helpful to carry some extra battery.</p>

<li>
<p>Audio interfaces allow seamless digital-audio conversion to allow any producer to achieve top-quality sound compared to the internal soundcards.</p>

      <description>****</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<hr>
<p>Hi Guys. I recently purchased MacBook Pro and I love its Touch bar - located above the keyboard. Also,�Apple released an update allowing the use of the touch bar (for some of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-mac-for-music-production/">best Mac for music production</a>
)
with the Logic Pro X.
Today, Ill explore how you can use the touch bar to increase your productivity in music production. Check these
WiFi Extenders for Verizon FiOS.
Overall: The touch bar in MacBook Pro is a great addition for producers and audio engineers. Imagine using the touch bar as a mixing control surface (for solo/ mute), MIDI controller, or a transport bar.</p>
<h2 id="touch-bar-to-increases-productivity-in-music-production">Touch Bar to Increases productivity in Music Production</h2>
<p>In Logic, this touch bar allows one to edit various parameters in the software. Interestingly, the parameters have been clustered into 4 key tabs.
Its usefulness in word processing or video editing is in question  but I believe its highly useful in making music. Read Also:

.</p>
<h3 id="1sttab--track-volume-level">1stTab -�Track volume level</h3>
<p>The first table allows you to control the track volume level and the plugins in the signal chain. The great touch will allow you to control third-party plugins such as the
<a href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/c1-compressor">wave&rsquo;s C1 Compressor</a>
, which I am using while writing this post.</p>
<h3 id="2ndtab---transports-cover-across">2ndTab - Transports cover across</h3>
<p>The 2
nd
Tab on the touch bar allows you to transports cover across the touch bar. From my personal experience, this feature allowed me to easily move my projects around.
I understand that professional producers could still do the same by simply using some quick key commands. However, the tough bad works great for me. Read Also:

<h3 id="3rdtab---loop-and-plays-buttons">3rdTab - Loop and plays buttons</h3>
<p>The 3
rd
tab has the loop and plays buttons in addition to the location select button. Notably, the font tab enables one to view the recording parameters like the inputs &amp; input monitor on the software instruments.</p>
<h3 id="4thtab---small-keyboard-across-top">4thTab - Small keyboard across Top</h3>
<p>An additional tab will appear thatll bring up a small keyboard across the top of the touch bar. Notably, the small keyboard could be helpful in the programming of simple drum beats in the small buttons. However, it cannot detect velocity metrics.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The feature I love l love most about the touch bar is using it to control volume through the touchscreen fader without connecting any external MIDI controller or iPad. Further, it&rsquo;s more natural and faster compared to clicking using the mouse.
In addition, controlling plug-in parameters is an amazing experience. But for others such as Charlie Q, it would be great to able to adjust the frequency in the cube as opposed to only the game van.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, Ill teach you how to overclock your Raspberry pi 3  with the goal of improving its performance.</p>
<p>Despite that overclocking mainly happen on the software level, the changes will significantly affect the physical level too.
First, increasing the power of the Raspberry Pi 3 processor  through overclocking  may cause hazardous overheating of the Raspberry Pi and all the hardware components near it.�Notably, the temperatures reach highs of 100  C! Read Also:

.</p>
<h2 id="why-overclock-raspberry-pi-3">Why Overclock Raspberry Pi 3?</h2>
<p>Despite Raspberry Pi 3 has an improved processor power, its still limited in some functions. For example, playing videos and games such as Minecraft require improved fluidity.
You can achieve the extra fluidity by overclocking the Raspberry Pi 3. Overclocking the Raspberry Pi 3 can help you boost its processor performance from the basic 1.2 GHz to about 1.5 GHz.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-laptops-for-fl-studio/">Laptops for FL Studio</a></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Next, an increase in the processor power creates a demand on the power consumption for the system. This might be dangerous when the power supply of your Raspberry Pi is not adequately upgraded.
Therefore, for the above challenges, youll require to arm, yourself with the vital accessories to overclock safely:</p>
<ol>
<li>A quality cooling system  this will help reduce the temperature rise that comes due to overclocking. Therefore, youll require a cooling system that included active cooling (fan) and passive cooling (heatsink).</li>
<li>A great microSD Card for your Raspberry Pi 3. Most definitely, 32GB of micro-SD storage will be adequate but you can check the
SD Card for Raspberry Pi 3
.</li>
<li>A great power supply  for this I advise that you take a 5v 3A power supply.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="modify-the-raspberry-pi-3-configuration-files"><strong>Modify the Raspberry Pi 3 configuration files.</strong></h2>
<p>Lets dive right into the overclocking details.�For previous Raspberry Pi models, you only required to use the sudo raspi-config command. But now, youll have to modify the Raspberry Pi 3 configuration files.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, well require modifying the /boot/config.txt files that hold different settings that are loading during Raspberry Pi startup. The settings mainly affect the processor use and Raspberry Pi behavior.
Therefore, begin a terminal window in the Raspberry Pi and input the command below:
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
The above command will launch the file named /boot/config.txt. Further, the command�sudo and the text editor�nano will request the system to undertake the function using the administrator account (�/boot/config.txt because this is a critical action.</li>
<li>With the file being open, ready for modification, now edit it so that you input the below-outlined lines:
<em>core_freq=500 # GPU Frequency</em>
<em>arm_freq=1300 # CPU Frequency</em>
<em>over_voltage=4 #Electric power sent to CPU / GPU (4 = 1.3V)</em>
<em>disable_splash=1 # Disables the display of the electric alert screen</em>
However, note that the above lines might already be available in different lines. In such a case, youll only need to ensure that the lines are not commented on (this means that the lines of code must not begin with one�#)</li>
<li>Next, save all the changes through this shortcut�Ctrl+o and finally exit from the file using this shortcut�Ctrl+x.</li>
<li>Finally, use the reboot command to restart your Raspberry Pi

</ol>
<h2 id="test-whether-the-overclock-is-enabled">Test whether the overclock is enabled</h2>
<p>To check, just run this command lscpu, and itll show the processor details. Therefore, if the CPU max MHz values are 1500, then youre on point  youve overclocked the Raspberry Pi 3!</p>
<h2 id="overclocking-raspberry-pi-2-or-older-models">Overclocking Raspberry Pi 2 or older models</h2>
<p>Like I had noted above, overclocking the Raspberry Pi 2 and easier models is much easier. Therefore, the modification will be a lot easier as youll utilize the GUI�raspi-config.
So, on the Raspberry Pi terminal, give the command below:
sudo raspi
<em>-config</em>
Then, select the Overclock option. Click ok on the pop up that will be outlining the dangers of such overclocking actions.
Next, select the overclock option that you like, such as the 1000MHz. Finally, click the ok option for a list of the changes youve made.
Finally, hit Finish and when prompted whether to restart your Raspberry Pi, click ok. And..thats all, you Raspberry Pi is now overclocked.

<h2 id="removing-the-overclocking">Removing the overclocking?</h2>
<p>So, to remove the Raspberry Pi overclocking, youll only require removing the changes you put above from the Raspberry Pi configuration file - /boot/config.txt.
However, if youd created a backup file, simply copy it to the /boot directory to fully overwrite your config.txt file.
Further, on the
<em>/etc/rc.local</em>
file  remember to remove the line named
<em>/usr/bin/zram.sh &amp;</em>
.
Finally, reboot the Raspberry Pi to fully disable all the overclocking configurations.
