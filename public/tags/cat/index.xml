      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two main types of <a href="/posts/how-to-tell-if-your-cat-has-fleas/">fleas</a> that live on cats and dogs - cat fleas and dog fleas. If you want to know the difference between cat fleas vs dog fleas, read on!</p>
<ul>
<li>*When our vet informed us that we needed to start treating our dog for cat fleas, I was confused. We don&rsquo;t have a cat and haven&rsquo;t had any in our yard that I know of. *
<em>Let me surprise you!</em></li>
<li>One of the most frequent questions that pet owners ask is this: do cat fleas (<em>Ctenocephalides�felis</em>) exclusively attack cats, while dog fleas (<em>Ctenocephalides canis</em>) live only off dogs?
**So, how do **
**cat fleas compare to dog fleas? While they&rsquo;re different species (only differentiable under a **
<strong>microscope</strong>
**), dog and cat fleas can infest either cats or dogs. But **
<strong>cat fleas (</strong>
<strong>Ctenocephalides felis</strong>
**) are more common in North America than dog fleas. **
Let&rsquo;s check the details!</li>
</ul>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Cat Fleas Vs Dog Fleas&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="comparison-cat-fleas-vs-dog-fleas">Comparison: Cat Fleas Vs Dog Fleas</h2>
<h3 id="1-preferred-host">1. Preferred Host?</h3>
<p>Fleas feed and breed off the blood of warm-blooded hosts, and that&rsquo;s how they make their way onto your cat or dog.</p>
<p>However, both cat and dog fleas do have the ability to survive off human blood for a few months.</p>
<p>Cat fleas�are�commonly found�on both�cats�and dogs in North America, while dog�fleas�are�found�in Europe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat fleas can live on different animals such as wild animals including opossums, birds,squirrels, foxes, mice, raccoons, and rats.
While it is impossible to know how your dog came in contact with fleas, chances are that he found them outside in the yard.</li>
<li>The flea eggs fall off flea-infested animal hosts andhatch to pupaewhen they land in a suitable environment, such as your yard and the pet&rsquo;s sleeping area.
Within two days of exiting the pupae cocoon with an adult form, the adult flea finds a host animal and takes its first blood meal. After feeding, the flea quickly finds a dark place to wait for its next host.</li>
<li>Cat fleas are also better adapted to finding hosts in areas with low levels of light and higher concentrations of carbon dioxide around their host&rsquo;s head as they move around the animals body.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-geographic-distribution">2. Geographic Distribution</h3>
<p>Cat fleas can be found on both dogs and cats, but one of the most important differences between cat and dog flea populations has been their geographic distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat Fleas - Found mainly in warmer habitats with higher humidity levels like in North America, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama;</li>
<li>Dog Fleas - Commonly found throughout Canada until New England.
If you&rsquo;re unsure where your pet picked up a flea population problem, it may help to know that when cats spend time outside they are at risk of becoming a host for both types of fleas, whereas dogs are more likely to be infested with dog fleas.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-size-comparison---cat-fleas-versus-dog-fleas">3. Size Comparison - Cat Fleas versus Dog Fleas</h3>
<p>Another difference between cat and dog fleas is that the former is smaller.</p>
<p>So, how big is a cat flea?</p>
<ul>
<li>Length of adult cat flea ranges from 1.5 - 3.2 millimeters (1/8&rsquo;&rsquo; and brownish-black or reddish black after feeding) with the females being slightly larger.</li>
<li>The female cat fleas have an average body length of 2.5 mm while the male cat flea length is around under 1 mm.</li>
<li>The heads of the female�cat fleas�are smaller and look disproportionate due to being very long.
And, how big is a dog flea?</li>
<li>Dog fleas have a length of 1.5 - 3.2 millimeters (1/8&rsquo;&rsquo;) and are brownish-black in color as well, but they have a lighter abdomen with dark brown stripes on the back of their bodies.
The head or called capitulum is relatively larger than cat fleas&rsquo; heads which makes them look disproportionally large for their body size.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-cat-fleas-infest-dogs">Do Cat Fleas Infest Dogs?</h2>
<p>Yes, cat fleas can infest a dog. Cat fleas jump from the cat to dogs, other animals, and humans.</p>
<p>They will primarily feed on cats but they may also bite domesticated pets such as rabbits, ferrets, and guinea pigs or wild animals like squirrels.</p>
<p>Can fleas transfer from cats to dogs? Yes, fleas can transfer between cats and dogs.</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible for your dog to get fleas from cats, especially if they live in North America where cat fleas very common.</p>
<h2 id="can-cat-fleas-live-on-humans">Can Cat Fleas Live On Humans?</h2>
<p>Both cat fleas and dog fleas don&rsquo;t live on humans but they can still bite you, but they will not reproduce off the human blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is believed that this is because only the cat&rsquo;s saliva triggers a response from eggs to hatch and larvae to develop into adults.</li>
<li>The egg may also need higher levels of heat or humidity than what people generally experience in their homes for it to fully mature.
Cat fleas do not tend to go onto a human host more than once, preferring instead to remain with cats.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are attracted by body warmth and carbon dioxide given off by breathing as well as a movement that could be caused by scratching an itch.</p>
<p>Flea bites cause itching around the bite site and sometimes swelling or hives; some people have sensitive skin reactions such as dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis after being bitten
*What about human hair? *
Fleas can
<em>hide temporarily</em>
in human hair when they cannot find their preferred animal hosts.</p>
<p>But usually, fleas
won&rsquo;t live in human hair
since it doesn&rsquo;t offer the same protection from sunlight and dryness that pet fur does.
<em>Can cat fleas live on your clothes?</em>
No,
clothes and other fabrics (sheets, pillows)
will not provide fleas with an environment in which they can survive.</p>
<p>However, fleas may hide on hems of clothing for a maximum of 24 hours. It is unlikely that fleas will remain on your clothes for long because they feed so often.</p>
<p>Their eggs may also be present on the garments.</p>
<ul>
<li>If these items are not washed or dry cleaned before they&rsquo;re worn again, fleas can end up traveling onto a person&rsquo;s body and causing an infestation.</li>
<li>The best way to prevent this is by either washing clothes after you wear them or putting all of your clothing into the drier for at least I hour (or until it comes out completely dry).
Flea eggs have been found in carpeting and upholstery - these eggs hatch into larvae that cannot move by themselves.</li>
<li>So it is important to vacuum regularly when pets live indoors as well as treat with an insecticide if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-dog-flea-treatment-kill-cat-fleas">Will Dog Flea Treatment Kill Cat Fleas?</h2>
<p>Yes, dog flea treatment can kill cat fleas. It only takes one bite from a dog carrying both types of parasites and the feline will become infested with both species of parasite at once, which is bad news for your kitty.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have products like Bravecto to protect against ticks too!</p>
<p>Our veterinarian doctors recommend you speak with them about what product would be best for your pet&rsquo;s needs today when they come into our office or call us if you are thinking about ordering online or purchasing it in-store.</p>
<p>Once a year, our vet recommends an examination by a doctor because there could be issues other than just pests on board; things such as allergies (fleas love going after dogs who suffer from the skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eggs have been found in carpeting and upholstery, so it&rsquo;s important to vacuum regularly and treat with insecticide if necessary.</li>
<li>Pet owners should comb their pets twice a day while they&rsquo;re infested because mature fleas may not be present on the pet 100% of the time - therefore preventing accidental transmission.
If you are going outside with your dog, make sure that he has had his monthly flea preventive recently (check expiration date) as this medication can also kill adult cat fleas!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-treat-my-home-for-dog-flea-and-cat-fleas">How Do I Treat my Home for Dog Flea and Cat Fleas?</h2>
<p>To treat an existing infestation: You will need to;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vacuum all floors (including under furniture) and
carpets
, upholstery in your home at least once every three days until no signs of fleas are found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clean pet bedding at least once a week so that you can get rid of any eggs or larvae your pets may have brought into the home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to use warm water and soap on these fabrics which will kill the flea eggs, prevent new infestations from taking hold in the fabric.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-
Treat the yard
with an appropriate pesticide if there&rsquo;s evidence of adult cat fleas outside; make sure it&rsquo;s safe for pets before applying!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chemical sprays are effective but may pose a health hazard to children or pets if not used correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For severe cases of infestation, speak with your veterinarian about an
oral medication
that can be given monthly to kill adult fleas on the pet as well as in the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You also need to comb your pup twice a day while it&rsquo;s infested so mature insects won&rsquo;t lay new eggs - which could then end up living off of other animals in the house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-puppy-shampoo-for-fleas/">put your pup in a flea bath</a>
that is meant to kill all stages of the life cycle, including eggs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about pesticides around kids and pets, try using
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas/">natural methods like diatomaceous earth (DE)</a>
, which kills any insects by dehydrating them as they walk over its fine particles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use
flea foggers or bombs
to exterminate the whole flea population in the residence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the subject, &ldquo;cat fleas vs dog fleas&rdquo; - there are a few different differences that you should know about.</p>
<p>Cat fleas are more common than dog fleas in North America, but dog fleas are more commonly found in Europe.</p>
<p>Flea bites can cause itching around the bite site. Some people have sensitive skin reactions such as dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis after being bitten.</p>
<p>Fleas usually won&rsquo;t live in human hair because it doesn&rsquo;t offer the same protection from sunlight and dryness that pet fur does.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Cats <a href="/posts/do-flying-termites-eat-wood/">Eat</a> Lizards? Have you ever met lizards and cats together in your home, yard or compound? Can your lizard and cat pet live together? It is interesting to find how cats go along with lizards in your place? So, do cats eat lizards?
<em>The direct answer is YES! Cats will eat lizards. Cats are great lizard predators. They will hunt, kill and eat lizard either by cutting it into pieces or swallow it whole (for the small sized cats).�</em>
<em>Cats prefer eating smaller lizards such as geckos, skins and Savannah�lizards. However, depending on the species, cats may not be safe after eating lizards. Some species such as salamanders and juvenile blue-tailed skinks secrets poison in their skin, which may kill your cat if eaten.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
<em>Though house lizards (gecko) may not have venom or poison, they carry parasites (liver flukes), pathogens and bacteria (salmonella) which affect adversely on the health of your cat when eaten.</em>

<h2 id="details-do-cats-eat-lizards">Details: Do Cats Eat Lizards?</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-do-cat-eat-lizards">1. How Do Cat Eat Lizards</h3>
<p>Cats normally hunt and kill the lizards before eating them. The cat will cut (using its teeth-canines) lizard into parts for easier swallowing. Also, the cat can tear the soft flesh from the body meat of the lizard. Main parts of lizards that are usually fed on by the cats include the body meat, limbs and the tail. When feeding on the lizards, cats do not remove lizards skin (which is infectious in some lizard species).
Most cats do not eat the Head of lizard unless when they swallow lizard whole (which is a rare case). Small cats dont eat the lizards bones. You will, probably, find bones leftovers where the cat was feeding.
Cats dont hunt lizards as a group unless when training their kitten. You are not likely to spot cats feeding since they hide mostly.�After killing the lizard, cat begins by eating the tail since its soft, fatty and its caudal bones can be chewed together with meat easily.</p>
<h3 id="2-which-lizards-do-cats-eat-most">2. Which Lizards Do Cats Eat Most?</h3>
<p>Your pet cat may not be selective when hunting lizards for food. However, most cats have been found to hunt more some of the following lizard species:</p>
<ol>
<li>**House lizards (Gecko).**These lizards are readily available at many homes and are safer when eaten by cats (not toxic/poisonous, contains no venom).</li>
<li>Moreover, geckos do not run faster when escaping in case of danger and their defense mechanism against cats is weak (mild bite and hiding) as compare to other lizards such as Tree crocodile monitor, which attack its predators.</li>
<li>**The savannah Lizards.**These lizards are small in size and are found in subtropical climate. Your pet cat will mainly go hunting them in the fields. Savannah lizards are quick to catch since they do not run fast.</li>
<li><strong>Nile water monitors</strong>. These love water bodies in rivers and pods around your home or region. Cats hunt them even though they get wild during capture. These lizards are safe and non-venomous.

The roots or Mexican Bearded lizards have venom glands that releases poison every time it bites your cat. The poison lowers the blood pressure of the cat and prevent blood clotting. Moreover, the cat face walking challenges, breathing, have frequent pooping and urination and generates inability to meow after eating Mexican bearded lizards.</li>
<li>**Gila Monitor lizard.**This lizard is known attack and bite cats in defense. Its poison is severe than that of Mexican Bearded lizard and its poisonous teeth paralyzes the cat on injection. Their skin also house bacteria that causes severe infection on your cat.</li>
<li>**Komodo dragon.**This lizard is able to attack and kill cats on approach immediately. It has poisonous glands that release killing venom on biting. Cats bitten by die in minutes. Most cats fear hunting the Komodo dragon. In fact, Komodo dragon is known to kill human beings.</li>
<li>**Juvenile blue-tailed skinks.**The skinks secrets poison in their skin, which kills the cat when eaten. Cats are highly attracted to blue tailed skinks and often prey on them. The skinks dont run fast in case of attack (they are easily caught by cats).</li>
<li>They have poisonous skin (skin produces poison) which kill cats when eaten. Salamanders have smooth soft skins and are usually swallowed whole by cats. Salamander dont escape faster and thus are easily caught by cats (predators).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-it-safe-for-cats-to-eat-lizards-what-are-the-dangers">Is it safe for cats to eat lizards? What are the Dangers?</h2>
<p>Most lizards are not toxic to cats when eaten (they are therefore safe). The body meat of lizard do not contain any poison that may affect the health of your cat. However, some lizards such as Komodo dragon and Gila Monitors have poisonous gland at their tooths root, which inject venom to its prey (cat) on attack thus paralyzing or killing it.
Though the lizards meat may not be poisonous, it may post the following dangers when eaten:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Get Liver Flukes. **Lizards such as skinks, savannah and geckos have liver flukes in their elementary tracks. These flukes do not affect these lizards. However, when your pet cat eats lizards, the liver flukes are transferred into the cats digestive canal from where they move up the liver to the gall bladder.</li>
<li>The liver flukes cause liver inflammations and block the bile duct of your cat leading to death.<em>Some symptoms of liver flukes</em>in your pet cat include yellow eyes and skin, vomiting, diarrhea, Lethargy, loss of appetite and swelling of abdomen.</li>
<li>**Acquire Salmonella Bacteria. **The skin of house lizard (gecko), skinks and bearded lizard house bacteria such as Salmonella. The salmonella bacteria may not cause sickness on a healthy cat. However, when the cat fall sick, the bacteria will accelerate the illness.</li>
<li>**Skin Infections.**The under skin of skins, Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, house lizards etc. have pathogens which cause severe skin infections on your pet cats.

<ol>
<li>**Running Away.**Most small sized lizards such as Gecko, skinks and savannah lizards run away in case of the attacks. However, they may not run very fast, but their swift enables them to reach their hideouts safely.</li>
<li>Inflate their Bodies. Lizards such as Thorny devil and Horned toad lizard inflates their bodies to appear big so as to scare away their predators. Bearded dragon is able to puff their throat out making them bigger thus scaring their predators.</li>
<li>**Autotomy.**This an act where the lizard is able to carry out self-amputation of tail. Lizards such as leopard geckos and house lizards are able to cut off its tail in case of danger. The cut tail is used as a bait or a mechanism that stops the predators (scare/confuse) from following them further.</li>
<li>** Fighting. **Monitor lizards such as Tree Crocodile monitor and Gila monitors are famous of fighting against their assailants. The Komodo dragon and Green Iguana use their tail to knock down their enemies.</li>
<li>**Using venom/biting.**Venomous lizards such as Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, Mexican Bearded lizards and the Tree Crocodile have venom in their teeth roots, which paralyses their prey on biting.</li>
<li>**Camouflaging.**Lizards such as chameleons are able to change color to match their hideouts. Small lizards are brown, grey or black colored, which camouflage well with their environment such as back or trees, rocks or sand. Some lizards such as bearded lizards and Gila monitors camouflage to send a warning signal to their predators.</li>
<li>**Hissing.**Frilled dragon opens its frills and produces a hissing sound, which frightens the predator and also makes it look more dangerous.</li>
<li>Squirting blood from their eyes. Pygmy short horned lizards squirts their blood from their eyes when they spot a predator. This make their eyes to enlarge thus scaring away their predators.</li>

<p>Well, not anymore!</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to show you how best to tell if your cat has fleas (these size-sized bugs) so that they can start feeling their fur again!</p>
<p>Cats can be prone to fleas, a common pest that if left untreated could inflict furry cats and
dogs
with severe problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats can get fleas from contact with other animals, picking them from the yard, or even by being in your home if you have an existing<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/cat-fleas"><strong>cat fleas</strong></a>population.</li>
<li>If left untreated, these pesky insects can cause discomfort and skin problems for your feline friend!
So, what are the signs&hellip;.again? Let&rsquo;s get started!

</ul>
<h2 id="whatarethese-cat-fleas">What<em>Are</em>these Cat Fleas?</h2>
<p>Cat fleas, also known as Ctenocephalides felis - parasitic insects, are a type of insect that feeds on the blood of cats as their host.</p>
<p>Cat fleas rarely come off the cat without being taken care of as they can
die without a host
.</p>
<p>In order to reproduce, adult cat fleas need a large amount of blood from a host like a cat or a dog. Fleas have four different stages during
their life cycle-life-cycle/)
:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eggs,</li>
<li>Larva,</li>
<li>Pupa, and</li>
<li>Adult.
A cat flea can hatch about 2,000 eggs

</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-tell-a-flea-on-your-cat">How do I tell a Flea on your Cat?</h2>
<p>Fleas are reddish-brown bugs that mainly live on cats - which lets them hide as they move through the host&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>Cat fleas are
<a href="https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/occas/catflea.htm"><strong>tiny</strong></a>
and will measure roughly 1/8-inch - they cannot fly or jump and they have no wings.</p>
<p>Fleas live in places like hair, between toes, and in the fur around the neck. Unfortunately, without the use of a magnifying lens or a microscope, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to see these fleas on the cat.</p>
<ul>
<li>But cats with light-colored hair (or fur) will be easier to examine for fleas and flea bites.
Gently brush along the sides of your cat to show a specific location area of its skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fleas will first appear like specks caught in your pet&rsquo;s fur - or some
specks of flea dirt
.</p>
<p>The small black specks (
flea dirt
) on your cat can be indicative of fleas. Also, bite marks (Red spots) can also denote a flea infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas are most active and will reproduce best at a temperature of 35C &amp; relative humidity of 70%.
Houses and pets in regions where the temperature falls below this for more than 40 hours every month won&rsquo;t have much flea activity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-how-to-tell-if-your-cat-has-fleas">Details: How To Tell If Your Cat Has Fleas?</h2>
<p>In order to produce eggs, fleas only need to take a single full-blood drink from their host - cat or dog.</p>
<p>Female fleas can lay as many as 30-50 eggs a day by the time they reach maturity.</p>
<p>Therefore, to control this massive reproduction, you must be vigilant about infestation symptoms.�Below is a video describing what you should look for if you suspect your cat has fleas.</p>

<h3 id="sign-1---anemia-and-itchy-bites">Sign 1 - Anemia and Itchy Bites</h3>
<p>Fleas are highly irritating, and many pets have little tolerance when it comes to biting at their fur in order to relieve the itch.</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="sign-3---bite-marks-ad-huge-hair-loss">Sign 3 - Bite Marks ad Huge Hair Loss</h3>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>One tactic that can help with spotting fleas in cats is to put a white towel or paper near the animal and comb through his fur.</li>

<p>Cats are for the most part independent and can take care of themselves; they need to look stylish, and because it makes them feel good too.</p>
<p>The grooming process involves licking, scratching, and even biting - these are necessary and fulfilling. But fleas will bite the cat and cause agitation, which in turn leads to excessive grooming.</p>
<p>Also, if the cats keep moving around the house and are particularly aggressive with their humans or other animals in the home; preferring to be alone.</p>
<p>These small, dark-brown, jumping creatures are very common during the spring and summer seasons. These dirt bugs may be your cat&rsquo;s worst enemy!</p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms, it&rsquo;s best that you schedule a veterinary appointment for remedies, especially if your cat is scratching excessively.</p>
<ul>
<li>And remember - cats can carry flea eggs on their fur so keep an eye out as well! If left untreated; they could pass them onto other animals (or humans) in the home too.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="sign-5---flea-dirt-or-flea-droppings">Sign 5 - Flea Dirt or Flea Droppings</h3>
<p>Flea dirt, which is made up of digested blood from the animal&rsquo;s last meal, can be differentiated from fleas or dirt by sprinkling it with water while it is lying on the white paper towel.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the dirt turns<a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/hospital/animal-health-topics/dermatology-fact-sheets">reddish-brown or red when wet</a>, it could be because the flea has passed digested blood out and deposited it on the cat.
Flea dropping (flea dirt) are black grains of feces, sometimes with a brownish tint, you&rsquo;ll find in your
*bedroom or the *
pet&rsquo;s bedding.</li>
<li>Signs of flea dirt on the cat&rsquo;s fur can be visible with a black light. The small particles show up as white or yellowish-white spots against dark areas, such as near the tail and between the toes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-6---environmental-cues">Sign 6 - Environmental Cues</h3>
<p>Next, look in the places where he or she spends a lot of time such as beds, couches, and carpets. You&rsquo;re checking for black specks (flea dirt) and fleas too.</p>
<p>Check the areas where your cat likes to sleep, such as on top of the refrigerator, kitchen cabinets, and window sills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, you can wear white socks and now walk all over the house - especially places that your cat frequents.</li>
<li>Fleas and/or flea dirt will most likely be picked up (if present) on a white sock.
You can also use some &ldquo;light traps&rdquo; to detect fleas in the home. Use a dawn soap solution in a bow and a light nearby to
attract and drown the fleas

<p>Really, what can I wash my cat with?</p>
<p>What should I use to wash my cat with so he doesn&rsquo;t get irritated skin or an allergic reaction?</p>
<ul>
<li>**In summary: to wash your cat, use a ****deodorizing shampoo made from natural ingredients. Or use a conditioning and dry skin shampoo, for a cat having dry skin. But overall, avoid human shampoo to wash the cat as it&rsquo;ll dry out its hair. **
Let us find out!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-can-i-wash-my-cat-with">Details: What Can I Wash My Cat with</h2>
<p>There are a number of benefits associated with using authentic cat shampoo compared to
human shampoo
, including; less dryness and itching, more natural pH balances, and fuller hair.</p>
<h3 id="1-cat-shampoo---earthbath-2-in-1-shampoo">1. Cat Shampoo - Earthbath 2-in-1 Shampoo</h3>
<p>What can I use to shampoo my cat? First, avoid human shampoo as it&rsquo;ll dry out the cat&rsquo;s skin.
Cat shampoos
are made with natural ingredients and do not contain harsh chemicals.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a wide range of cat shampoo to choose from, depending on the desired outcome - if you want your pet&rsquo;s hair to smell good or be soft &amp; silky all day long!</li>
<li>Earthbath 2-in-1 Shampoo is a gentle and natural product for your cat, suitable for all breeds - check the quora thread.
Earthbath contains no harsh chemicals that can cause skin problems or deter a flea-free environment, unlike many other pet shampoos on the market.
<em>Benefits of Earthbath:</em></li>
<li>Earthbath is 100% biodegradable</li>
<li>Contains only plant-based ingredients</li>
<li>Great smell! You&rsquo;ll love it too as you&rsquo;re cleaning kitty up</li>
<li>Great for sensitive skins/allergies</li>
<li>Soap- and sulfate-free and pH balanced</li>
<li>Works on tangled fur</li>
<li>Has almond oil and aloe vera
Earthbath 2-in-1 cat Shampoo is a popular choice for pet owners because it is gentle, natural, and biodegradable. It uses essential oils to make your pet smell good.
Earthbath also has almond oil to nourish your pet&rsquo;s skin while reducing allergic reactions caused by excessive bathing or flea bites
even on dogs
.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this without the use of harsh chemicals that can be toxic when inhaled or absorbed into a cat&rsquo;s bloodstream through contact with their skin.</p>
<h3 id="2-baby-shampoo-for-washing-cats">2. Baby shampoo for washing cats</h3>
<p>In contrast to regular pet shampoo, baby shampoo is made from gentle ingredients, and thus it&rsquo;s great for use on cats&rsquo; sensitive skin.</p>
<p>The pH balance is also great for the skin, which means that you can use it without worries of making your cat&rsquo;s fur too dry.</p>
<p>The other thing to know about baby shampoo is that even though it sounds like it has a light fragrance, in reality, there are no artificial fragrances added  so what you smell on your pet after using this type of shampoo comes from one natural ingredient: aloe vera.</p>
<ul>
<li>And by choosing something with zero sulfates and parabens as well as gentle cleansers or an organic selection, you&rsquo;re ensuring maximum safety for their delicate skin while removing odor-causing bacteria.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-dawn-dish-soap">3. Dawn dish soap</h3>
<p>Dawn dish soap is well known for its oil-stripping properties. Dawn dish soap is perfect for bathing the cat, but it will also do a great job of removing oily or sticky residue.</p>
<p>Dawn dish soap is typically more expensive than other brands of dish soap, but Dawn&rsquo;s oil-stripping properties make it worth the cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dawn dish soap should be used sparingly when washing cats because it can dry out your cat&rsquo;s skin and fur.</li>
<li>After you wash your cat with Dawn, let them air-dry outside or use a blow dryer on low to gently remove excess moisture from their coat.</li>
<li>If they won&rsquo;t stay put while drying in front of an open door or window, try using gentle hair rollers so that they don&rsquo;t get too wet as they&rsquo;re drying off.
Instead, put aside Dawn dish soap for washing cats and use a veterinarian-approved shampoo for animals with active skin infections.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in an emergency situation and don&rsquo;t have anything else at hand, sprinkle a small amount of Dawn on the cat&rsquo;s fur and towel dry it to get things clean again.</p>
<p>If you bathe your cat too often, it can dry out the skin and if they are infested with fleas then it is a trade-off between dry skin and scratching.</p>
<h3 id="4-castile-soap">4. Castile soap</h3>
<p>Castile soap is gentle and natural for dry skin, making it a good alternative to pet shampoo - especially for cats having dry skin.</p>
<p>Is it safe to use Castile soap on cats?</p>
<p>When bathing your cat, avoid using essential oil-based products. This includes orange oils, lemon oils, tea tree oil, and eucalyptus. But, it&rsquo;ll be safe to wash your cat with pure castile soap instead!</p>
<p>Dr. Bronners Castile is a popular choice because it is made of purified water, organic coconut oil, organic palm kernel oil, and pure castile soap.</p>
<p>Before using Castile soap on your cat for the first time, test this product in an inconspicuous place to see if there are any allergic reactions that may occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you decide to use Castile soap as shampoo, dilute one-half ounce per eight ounces of water or adjust according to what works best for your pet&rsquo;s coat type.</li>
<li>You can also try making homemade shampoos with ingredients such as apple cider vinegar mixed with a fractionated coconut oil - but be careful not to shake up the bottle!
If you have nothing else at hand and want to help clean off dirty cats then you can use Castile soap diluted in water as a makeshift shampoo.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-baking-soda">5. Baking soda</h3>
<p>If your cat doesn&rsquo;t need to be washed but they still smell or has fleas, you can
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-baking-soda-kill-fleas/">use baking soda</a>
. It will take away the bad smells and some dirt.</p>
<p>Baking soda will take away the bad smells and some dirt from your cat if they don&rsquo;t need any more than just being brushed out.</p>
<p>Sprinkle the baking soda over the cat&rsquo;s coat, avoiding their face. Rub into the base of the fur, then brush out. Wash your hands afterward if you&rsquo;ve touched the cat to keep from smelling like baking soda too!</p>
<ul>
<li>Baking soda is a good natural alternative for washing cats when they are covered in dirt or have fleas and don&rsquo;t need any more care than just being brushed out.
Baking soda is a great natural alternative to chemical-laden pet shampoos. It is important that you consult your vet before using it, and be sure to spot test on the furniture or carpet first.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you mix baking soda with urine, which is an acidic substance, the baking soda&rsquo;s chemical properties react to make them more neutralized. This can eliminate odors.</p>
<h3 id="6-oatmeal-diy-shampoo">6. Oatmeal DIY shampoo</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ground oatmeal (1 cup)</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
