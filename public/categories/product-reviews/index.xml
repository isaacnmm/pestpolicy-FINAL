      <description>Dealing with fleas? I&amp;#39;ve been there. Here are my honest reviews of the best flea traps that actually work, focusing on effectiveness, safety, and ease of use.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While sprays and treatments are essential for tackling a full-blown infestation, one of the most powerful tools in your long-term arsenal is a simple, plug-in flea trap. Think of it as a silent sentinel, working 24/7 to monitor and capture the adult <a href="/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/">fleas</a> that are hopping around your home. When you start your search, you&rsquo;ll immediately find dozens of options, but most of them are variations of a classic design, like the iconic <span style="color:red;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000668Z96/?tag=p-policy-20">Victor Flea Trap</a></span>, which has been a go-to for decades.</p>
<p>For a modern take on this classic, many people now opt for models like the <span style="color:red;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MEG8LKK/?tag=p-policy-20">Aspectek Sticky Dome Flea Trap</a></span>, which offers a similar mechanism with a slightly different design. But with so many choices, how do you pick the right one?</p>

  </div>

<h3 id="what-i-look-for-in-a-flea-trap">What I Look For in a Flea Trap</h3>
<p>After trying several models over the years, I&rsquo;ve learned to judge them on a few key things that really matter in a real-world home environment.</p>
<p><strong>First and foremost, does it actually catch fleas?</strong> This is non-negotiable. An effective trap uses the right combination of light and heat to be more attractive to a flea than your ankles are. The proof is right there on the sticky pad in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Is it safe for my curious pets and kids?</strong> This is my next biggest concern. Since these traps sit on the floor, they need to be designed so that a curious nose or paw can&rsquo;t easily get stuck on the glue pad. I look for traps with a sturdy plastic dome or cage that protects the sticky surface.</p>
<p><strong>How much of a hassle is it?</strong> Life is busy, especially when you&rsquo;re dealing with a pest problem. I want a trap that I can assemble in under a minute, that uses sticky pads that are easy to peel and replace, and that is built durably enough that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it breaking if it gets bumped by a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<h3 id="my-top-5-flea-trap-recommendations">My Top 5 Flea Trap Recommendations</h3>
<p>Here are my honest reviews of the flea traps that have proven themselves to be the best in the business.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Old Reliable: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000668Z96/?tag=p-policy-20">Victor Flea Trap</a></strong>
There&rsquo;s a reason the Victor trap is a classic. It’s highly effective, straightforward, and it just works. The design is simple: a light bulb sits over a sticky disc. Fleas are drawn to the warmth and light, and they get stuck. It can attract fleas from up to 30 feet away, making it a powerhouse for monitoring a large room. The only downside is that in a heavy infestation, you might find yourself changing the sticky pads often—but that’s also a good sign that it&rsquo;s doing its job!</p>
<p><strong>2. The User-Friendly Champ: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MEG8LKK/?tag=p-policy-20">Aspectek Sticky Dome Flea Trap</a></strong>
If you want something that&rsquo;s incredibly easy to set up and use, the Aspectek trap is a fantastic choice. It functions much like the Victor trap but comes in a simple dome design that snaps together in seconds. It often comes with a generous supply of extra sticky pads, making it a great value right out of the box. It’s a reliable and hassle-free option for anyone who wants to plug it in and forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Safety-First Choice: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4JTZFL/?tag=p-policy-20">Terro Flea Trap</a></strong>
When you have pets or small children, safety is everything. The Terro trap is designed with this in mind. The protective canopy does an excellent job of preventing accidental contact with the sticky surface, giving you peace of mind. It’s completely non-toxic and uses the same proven light-and-heat method to attract fleas. While its attraction radius might be slightly smaller than some other models, its safety-conscious design makes it the top pick for family homes.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Built-to-Last Option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4JTZFL/?tag=p-policy-20">Hoont Indoor Flea Trap</a></strong>
The Hoont trap feels noticeably sturdier than many of its competitors. It uses a bright LED light which is energy-efficient and has a very long lifespan, so you won&rsquo;t be replacing bulbs. The construction is robust, making it a great choice if you plan on using the trap for long-term prevention year after year. It’s a durable workhorse that can stand up to the rigors of a busy household.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Budget-Friendly Pick: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NBKKQSZ/?tag=p-policy-20">Easico Flea Trap</a></strong>
If you need to place multiple traps around your home without breaking the bank, the Easico trap is an excellent value. It delivers solid performance using the same light and heat principle but at a more accessible price point. The replacement pads and bulbs are also very affordable, making it a cost-effective solution for ongoing flea monitoring and control.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-word">The Final Word</h3>
<p>A good flea trap is a crucial part of your flea control strategy. To get the best results, place your trap in the areas where you see the most activity—often in pet bedding areas, carpets, or family rooms where people and pets spend the most time. Checking the sticky pad each morning will not only reduce the number of biting adults but will also tell you how well your larger treatment plan is working. It’s a small investment that delivers huge results and invaluable peace of mind.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skills, the manufacture of Bed Bug Bully, markets the product as an effective, non-toxic, all-natural bed bug killer spray.
So, how accurate is this?
Can Bed Bug Bully safely exterminate mild to moderate bed bug infestations? Will it kill even the
baby bed bugs/)
?
In this post, I seek to verify these claims by undertaking a thorough review of
Bed Bug
Bully.�So, let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Bed Bug Bully&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="summary-bed-bug-bully-review-full-analysis">Summary: Bed Bug Bully Review (Full Analysis)</h2>
<p><strong>My Overall Review:�Only Suitable for Treating Small to Medium Bed Bug Infestations.�</strong>
<strong>1.</strong>
Bed Bugs Bully is
a contact killing killer
that offers great residual protection for prevention and killing.
Luckily, being odorless and chemical-free, you can even
spray this insecticide
in the bedroom even before your sleep.
<strong>2.</strong>
The spray will kill the whole bed bug life cycle - eggs, their babies, and adults bed bugs (
check the pictures of bed bugs here
).
Bed Bugs Bully is equally safe, besides
being highly effective
, to both humans (including kids) and pets in your house.
<strong>3.</strong>
Spraying bed bugs
bully won&rsquo;t stain your furniture, linens, or other surfaces in the area of coverage. Equally, it has no harsh odor or chemicals - but leaves a mild scent behind.
<strong>4.</strong>
However, some
<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/how_effective_are_natural_bed_bug_pesticides-146722">available case studies</a>
claim that Bed Bugs Bully is ineffective in treating bed bugs. Further, some homeowners claim that pesticide doesn&rsquo;t
kill bed bug eggs
.
The issue is that the pesticide won&rsquo;t
kill bed bugs and their eggs
tucked deep in the fibers or the blankets, pillows, and mattresses.</p>
<h2 id="features-or-specifications">Features or Specifications</h2>
<p>Below are the�natural oils you&rsquo;ll
find in Bed Bugs
Bully - they&rsquo;re highly toxic to bed bugs but very safe for humans (including kids) and pets.</p>
<ol>
<li>Castor Oil - 0.5%,
*Clove oil - 0.40%, *
&amp;
*Citronella oil 0.40% *

&amp;
<em>Rosemary oil - 0.4%�</em></li>
<li>Citric Acid - 1% &amp; Sodium L. Sulfate - 2.5%</li>
<li>32 oz total Weight</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="bed-bug-bully---key-features">Bed Bug Bully - Key Features</h2>
<h3 id="1-longresidualprotection">1. Long<strong>Residual</strong>Protection</h3>
<p>Bed Bugs Bully is created
to have a long residue effect - it&rsquo;ll last even about 30 days.
Therefore, the pesticide will continue exterminating the
bugs for a long time after the first-bed
bug treatment.
However, it&rsquo;s good to repeat the
bed bug treatment
using this pesticide about 3-4 times after several weeks.</p>
<h3 id="2-contact-killing-pesticide">2. Contact-killing Pesticide</h3>
<p>The pesticide will kill the bugs only on contact and thus great for controlling
bed bugs you can see in your home
.
However, this could be a disadvantage because the bed bugs might be hidden inside crevices, cracks, or
inside carpet fibers
.</p>
<h3 id="3-non-poisonous-non-toxic">3. Non-Poisonous /Non-toxic</h3>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, the
bed bug bully mainly is made
from natural oils, including castor oil, clove oil, citronella oil, and mint oil.
The product has no toxic chemicals and will be safe to use around your family members, other humans, and pets.
This can be contrasted to using other pesticides like the
best bed bug fogger
that would require you, your family, and all pets to leave the house for about 12 hours after setting them off.
Also,
bed bug bully won&rsquo;t leave
a toxic or lingering odor - and thus, it&rsquo;ll be comfortable to even sleep in a room that you&rsquo;ve just treated for bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="3-its-a-liquid-form-spray">3. Its a Liquid Form Spray</h3>
<p>The pesticide exists in liquid form and hence will be easy to
apply to
bedbug-infested areas such as mattresses, crevices, cracks, or bed frames.
Further, the liquid form makes it easy to combine this bed bug bully will different cleaning products such as
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a></p>
<ul>
<li>for effective control of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-suitable-foroutdoor-andindoor-treatment">4. Suitable forOutdoor andIndoor Treatment</h3>
<p>Bed Bug Bully will work
great for both your outdoor and indoor spaces.�You&rsquo;ll be able to control the bugs both inside the house and before they infest your dwelling spaces.
I dare say that the bed bug insecticide will work for most weather conditions - including winter and summer, killing bed bug adults and their babies.</p>
<h2 id="an-alternative-to-bed-bug-bully-to-kill-bed-bugs">An alternative to Bed Bug Bully to Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Traditional pesticides are just as effective or the naturally developed
bed bug killers
. An excellent pointer is Steri Fab, which many people trust in exterminating
bed bugs from their business premises
and homes.
Sadly, most
bed bug sprays
are ineffective in controlling bed bugs, or theyll have a lower efficiency level.
For this, I suggested that you use a combination of different bed bug control techniques, including Eco Defense, mattress encasement, diatomaceous earth, and dry
bed bug steamers
.</p>
<h3 id="1-mattress-encasements">1. Mattress Encasements</h3>
<p>Bed bugs will always be looking
for dark and warm places to hide  and mattresses are such good locations. However, you can use
bed bugs mattress encasement
as theyll safeguard the mattress against any such attacks.
Further, any
bed bugs thatll lock inside
the mattress encasement will lack the chance to take their regular blood meals and will thus starve to death. This is mainly because
bed bugs cant bite through clothing or fabrics
.
However, you can also use box spring encasement if youre using box springs. Also, ensure that the encasement isnt damaged or scratched since this will provide entry or
exit points for bed bugs
and their babies.</p>
<h3 id="2-diatomaceous-earth">2. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth�will be a great alternative to bed bugs bully because its cheap, non-toxic, and its all-natural  itll prevent the bugs from moving around your house and thus
spreading carelessly
.
However, DE must not be used alone as itll have lower kilning effectiveness.�DE is a natural white power thats manufactured from sea rocks.
Luckily, itll tear the
bed bugs skin
, dehydrate it by taking out its body fluids and thus kill it. So, put some DE over the floors and furniture in your
house where the bed bugs
will be walking.</p>
<h3 id="3-dry-bed-bug-steamers">3. Dry Bed Bug Steamers</h3>
<p>Steamers are an excellent way to treat
bed bugs in your walls, cabinets
, mattresses, furniture, chairs, and sofas.
For example, most steamers will generate steam at over 200 degrees thatll
exterminate both bed bugs
eggs and adults.
Luckily, steam will easily reach the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/">bed bugs while hiding</a>
in the crevices, cracks, and baseboards. However, only shift the steamer at 1 inch every second while treating these blood-sucking bugs in your house.
The machine has nozzles thatll release small amounts of dry steam. However, the device must be used cautiously as it can burn kids and pets with high-temperature steam.
Remember to use a respirator to protect yourself from ant gages or chemicals that might be released.</p>
<h3 id="4-vacuuming">4. Vacuuming</h3>
<p>A vacuum will enable you to keenly clean all the tough spots and corners that may
easily hide bed bugs
and their babies.
However, be sure to securely seal the vacuum bag before disposing of it after youve finished vacuuming. Next, ensure thoroughly washing the vacuum cleaner to remove all the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-eggs/">bed bug eggs</a>
, the babies, and adults.
These, if not removed well, could trigger a
bed bug re-infestation
. Further, store the vacuum machine in a sealed bag  this will prevent re-infestation.</p>
<h3 id="5-wash-fabrics-with-hot-water">5. Wash Fabrics with Hot water</h3>
<p>Next, you can wash your clothes with very
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">water and then dry them to kill the bed bugs</a>
and their existing eggs.
Use a
dryer to kill bed bugs
with the least  but ensure to check the maximum temperature recommendation for each cloth fabric.</p>

The active ingredients are n-octyl dicarboximide (bicycloheptene) in addition to sumithrin, which is a great chemical to allow you to kill the bed bugs readily.
Luckily, the new formula in this Bedlam Plus has imidacloprid, enhancing a faster knockdown

strains.
While spraying your sofas, you&rsquo;ll need to give special attention to corner cracks, folds, and seams since that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll mainly find

The product uses the dry content that you can apply to the roach&rsquo;s hiding spaces, including gaps, splits, and cracks.
Luckily, the product uses the dry-penetrating formula that&rsquo;ll leave no mess or odor while also preventing any roach re-infestations for about 6-8
months.
Bengal roach killer is a bar of liquid gold that&rsquo;ll kill both adult roaches, their babies, plus their eggs. Check these pros associated with this roach spray;</p>
<ol>
<li>Long residue effect that&rsquo;ll offer more extended protection againstroach infestation. However, you can retreat your house or apartment after one month to ensure complete roach eradication.</li>
<li>The aerosol can is appropriately designed to allow deeper penetration of the insecticide to kill the roachesand the baby roacheshidden in different spaces.</li>
<li>Bengal roach killer is budget-friendly when compared to using a professional exterminator or roach bombs. Further, re-treatment can exterminate the whole roach family.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also non-staining, meaning that you won&rsquo;t have to worry about unnecessary scrubbing and washing after you&rsquo;re done spraying the insecticide.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-does-bengal-roach-spray-work">How Does Bengal Roach Spray Work?</h2>
<p>Bengal roach spray employs some particular dry propellant that allows it to go very deep into crevices and cracks, under your appliances, and behind the walls  these are the places where roaches breed and live.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bengal roach spray irritates the[<a href="/posts/best-roach-bait/">cockroaches</a> and goes ahead to kill cockroach eggs](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-cockroach-eggs/)within">https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-cockroach-eggs/)within</a> an hour. However, the irritation ejects the roaches from their hiding spaces to open areas where they die and get picked up orvacuumed off.</li>
<li>Regular sprays employ some water-based formula requiring direct application on the roaches for maximum effectiveness.</li>
<li>But Bengals key ingredient is permethrin thats non-staining, effective, and odorless, and has a long residue effect  single spraying lasts over two weeks.
<a href="https://twitter.com/GramcoFeed/status/1038430281269764097">https://twitter.com/GramcoFeed/status/1038430281269764097</a></li>
<li>Despite that roaches can survive radiation and hold their breath for over half an hour (enhancing survival in the water), Bengal <a href="/posts/best-roach-killer-for-apartments/">roach</a> spray is a great solution.</li>
<li>Therefore, Bengal&rsquo;s chemical will paralyze the roach&rsquo;s body and head &ndash; eventually leading to death. However, the spray&rsquo;s chemical formula won&rsquo;t harm human beings - its low in concentration.
Therefore, Bengal roach spray will kill roaches in their adult stages and the roach eggs and the baby roaches. Thus, the spray will also prevent roach re-infestation in your house, kitchen, or apartment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-use-bengal-roach-spray">When to Use Bengal Roach Spray?</h2>
<p>Apply Bengal roach spray in summer since this is the period when roaches are reproducing and growing fast. Summer comes with slightly high temperatures allowing better mating and breeding.
Therefore, it is not taken care of; the roaches will rapidly increase and spread diseases, allergens, and dust throughout the house and apartment.
Thus, in summer, you&rsquo;ll get a larger population of roaches roaming around the house, searching for food and
water - which makes it the appropriate time to kill the bugs
.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bengal roach
spray is effective in killing
adult roaches, their babies, and eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Precautions to Take:Kill or controlthe cockroaches before they get into your spaces - including the house or home.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWiu07UDH50">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWiu07UDH50</a>
There is a wide range of powders that you can use to protect your
home from being bed
bug-infested�effectively.
To use the powders in the right way, you need to start by clearing the clutter and other mess in your bedroom and other parts of the house.
Apply your favorite powder in the holes, crevices, under the carpet, and in stuffed toys. These are the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-bed-bugs/">areas that the bed bugs use to hide</a>
and reproduce.
The powders should be applied in small amounts. However, you must ensure that you target the right areas since without that, the bed bugs will keep reproducing, and your house will not be safe.
Regardless of the powder that you use, you are supposed to clean your house of the residue that might have been left behind after the powder&rsquo;s application.
Note that some powders work faster compared to the rest. After applying the powder, you should give it at least 48 hours to
kill all the adult bed bugs
.
A good powder will also target the eggs (including
baby bed bugs
) and destroy them all.</p>
<h2 id="is-bed-bug-power-safe-for-humans">Is Bed Bug Power Safe For Humans?</h2>
<p>Diatomaceous earth
is the primary ingredient used by the powders mentioned above. It is mainly natural and does not have any effect on human health.</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/">fact that it kills bed bugs</a>and prevents them from moving freely in your home makes it an ideal option.</li>
<li>It is essential to note that diatomaceous alone is not perfect forkilling and controlling bed bugsfrom infesting your home.
Though it kills and ensures that they dont move in your house, diatomaceous works best alongside heat treatment.
It is essential to heat-treat your items all the time and before using diatomaceous to complement the process.</li>
<li>Though the powders might not significantly affect humans, it is essential to treat and air your house after using them.</li>
<li>This makes sense since some companies use additives that might be poisonous.
Therefore, when your kids and pets get into contact with them, they might have allergic reactions that might be hard to deal with. Use as per the manufacturer&rsquo;s direction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bed bug powders come in different qualities, prices, and efficacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on your budget and level of infestation, you can pick the right powder to use.

<li>Bedlam Plus is a great contact spray (and equally a residual formula) that&rsquo;ll kill even the bed bugs that are pyrethroid-resistant and thebaby bed bugs.</li>
<li>Bedlam Plus is formulated to be a residual spray combining three key ingredients (1) 3-phenoxybenzyl, (2) Imidacloprid, and (3) 2-dimethyl-3 - this is pyrethroid plus synergized neonicotinoid.
But you can also spray on your clothing.
The aerosol has a quick knockdown effect and great residual control that&rsquo;ll
kill bed bugs
even two weeks after spraying. It has a sweet but very mild smell that won&rsquo;t be too irritating.
Bedlam Plus will show ovicidal features in addition to functioning like an adulticide. The formula will quickly
kill adult bed bugs and their eggs
only on contact.
Scientific findings show that 40 percent of the bed bugs treated using Bedlam Plus treated will die.
Luckily,
Bedlam Plus is a more natural and safe pesticide composed of pyrethroids and pyrethrum. Spray on a bed frame, clothes, carpets, box spring, mattresses (and
mattress encasements
), headboard, carpet, and furniture.
The straw applicator will hit the deepest of spaces, cracks, and crevices.
The Bedlam Plus formula allows you to control several pesticides or insects, including lice, fleas, carpet beetles, clothes moths, dust mites, and ticks.
It&rsquo;s also non-staining on your water-safe fabrics. But, first, test a smaller area of the fabric to avoid creating a stained mess. However, check the

Cimexa
CXID032 is an odorless and luckily non-staining bed bug dust (particularly silica-based) that you&rsquo;ll love in your
pest control
processes. Puff the dust on carpets and mattresses.
An interesting fact to note is that silica dust has a higher efficacy in killing bed bugs compared even to diatomaceous earth. Silica will soak the
bed bug&rsquo;s
wax and thus enhance speedier desiccation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cimexadust is finely ground dust that sticks on a bed bug&rsquo;s body (via electrostatic attraction) and breaks its exoskeleton (cuticle) to dehydrate the bug to its death. Keep off kids and pets.
The�silica dust, which you&rsquo;ll puff onto the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-bed-bugs/">bug&rsquo;s hiding areas, will dry on the bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton</a>
and thus dehydrate it to cause its death. It comes with a�puffer and applicator.
You may use a�paintbrush to spread the dust thinly onto crevices and�baseboards that the bed bugs will be hiding or moving around. Luckily, silica isn&rsquo;t toxic to human beings but wear a mask.
The Good:</li>
<li>Viable for about ten years if left undisturbed.</li>

<ul>
<li>However, with the bullet journal at hand, I&rsquo;ve now have created a &ldquo;healthy and fitness&rdquo; page that allows me to plan my self-care routine.
For example, the exciting box coloring for my stretch sessions has enabled me to take my supplements, vitamins easily, and early morning stretches.

I am more of a visual artist and love amazing BuJo. Therefore, the Bullet journal notebook in the
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bulletjournal/">#bulletjournal</a>
gave me many ideas that are tweaked and developed to create a unique Moleskin.</li>
<li>Now I am a proud owner of colorful pens to create fantastic washi tape.
Thus, with barely a page of bullet journaling or 20 minutes of spreading, I can develop my creative ideas and unwind the day&rsquo;s stress.
<strong>c. I no longer feel pressured for perfectness</strong>
Do you ever re-do a whole project when it looks less appealing? Well, just about what I was before meeting my bullet journaling notebook.
However, bullet journaling allows me to make up different aspects of my projects as I progress, increasing some pages as required.</li>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-car-wash-soap"><strong>How to Choose the Best Car Wash Soap</strong></h2>
<p>Cleaning is part of car maintenance in addition to other routines like changing oil, replacing filters, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>But in order to get the best car cleaning results, you need to have the right kind of car wash soap.</li>
<li>Dish soaps are not recommended for a car wash because they tend to strip off the wax finish and paint on your car.
Below, Ive provided you with a guide for choosing the best car wash soap.
<strong>Foaming</strong>
Plenty of suds or foams help in lifting dirt to separate it from the car surface. It also lubricates the dirt and surface, making it possible to flow away from the rinsing surface.</li>
<li>This is an important consideration because it reduces or eliminates the need for scrubbing, which may leave your paint surface with scratches.
However, some stains like bird droppings tend to stick on the surfaces and may not be removed without scrubbing.
<strong>PH Level</strong>
The sealants and paint finish on your car cannot withstand
<a href="https://www.lenosgarage.com/blogs/auto-detailing/4-things-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-car-wash-soap">high PH levels</a>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, keeping your home spotless should be effortless and efficient. Cordless stick vacuums are revolutionizing how we clean, offering unparalleled freedom and flexibility.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="5-best-cordless-stick-vacuums">5 Best Cordless Stick Vacuums</h2>
<h3 id="1-dyson-v15-detect"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CDN7F736?ie=UTF8&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_source=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtings.com%2Fvacuum%2Freviews%2Fbest%2Fcordless-stick&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=dab7fe8bf175f3fdbaa884342712975e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">1. Dyson V15 Detect</a></h3>
<p>Dyson V15 Detect is my top stick vacuum - I love its excellent suction to remove most dirt particles and human and pet hair (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-vacuuming-kill-flea-larvae/">and kill fleas</a>
) on my bare floor, hardwood, carpets, or sofa - thanks to the many attachments.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The battery offers 70 minutes of continuous vacuuming</li>
<li>Uses a laser to illuminate or sense surfaces, particles, and dust
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Challenging to push on hard rugs
However, it is inadvisable to keep the vacuum constantly on the stand since this tends to shorten the battery life - and these batteries are pricey. Dyson V15 Detect is suitable for vacuuming bare floors and high or low-pile carpets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dyson V15 Detect has a digital display that shows the particle count or size, predicted run time, and charging status. It&rsquo;s interesting that you can see the level of the trash in the collection bin, which you can empty easily.</p>
<p>It also has an ergonomic design so you can easily vacuum the stairs without power cords that could trip you over. It won&rsquo;t hurt your back, and you&rsquo;ll experience less fatigue compared to an upright vacuum that&rsquo;s super heavy.
<strong>Key Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Surfaces:**Hard Floors, floors, all floors</li>
<li>**Weight:**3.08 Kgs</li>
<li>**Run time:**60 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-shark-stratos-cordless-vacuum"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B5JMNGNQ?ie=UTF8&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_source=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtings.com%2Fvacuum%2Freviews%2Fbest%2Fcordless-stick&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=614792e30c0fc51053a9a7efc2fd7e0a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">2. Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum</a></h3>
<p>A unique feature of the Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum is its automatically controllable suction. The Clean Sense IQ function will adjust the suction power based on the sensor report (amount of debris) on the surface.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Impressive battery performance - 50+ minutes cleaning time</li>
<li>Great suction for dirt and debris</li>
<li>Brushroll is self-cleaning
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Longer charging time ~ 4 hours</li>
<li>Not suitable for thick carpeting
Its MultiFlex wand arm allows the user to reach around surfaces (like under chairs or tables) easily as it is hinged at the center. It&rsquo;s quite ergonomic, so you won&rsquo;t have to lean over or bend over much. It&rsquo;s also handy but comes with fewer attachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the twin-roller floorhead is also large and thus might be challenging to clean tight spaces.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shark Stratos Cordless comes with a bigger dustbin, so you won&rsquo;t need to empty it regularly. It also emits perfume through a replaceable cartridge on the floorhead that will envelop any bad odor as you&rsquo;re cleaning.</p>
<p>However, despite its ability to clean for an hour continuously, you&rsquo;ll get a larger downtime compared to the Dyson since it takes about 4 hours to charge fully.
<strong>Key Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Surfaces:**Floors but not thick carpeting</li>
<li>**Weight:**4.03697 Kgs</li>
<li>**Run time:**50+ minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-tineco-pure-one-s11"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CDQ52TB?ie=UTF8&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_source=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtings.com%2Fvacuum%2Freviews%2Fbest%2Fcordless-stick&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=778b977427173293f65df0b2751168c3&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">3. Tineco PURE ONE S11</a></h3>
<p>Compared to Dyson, the Tineco PURE ONE S11 is notably lightweight (bagless too) so it can clean in tight spaces. It will easily clean pet hair, carpet, and hardwood. Some of the attachments are the dust brush, for upholstery, and one for crevices.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper option</li>
<li>Lightweight and thus easy to carry
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Shorter run time ~ 40+ minutes continuously</li>
<li>Smaller dustbin
You&rsquo;ll love that the vacuum head has LED lights to illuminate the surfaces or objects being cleaned, including tiny items
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-vacuum-for-dog-hair/">like dog hair</a>
. The machine has two filters that it also cleans automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s also digital equipment that comes with a phone app to let you know the status of the vacuum filter and the battery.</p>
<p>The function power is also automatically adjusted like with the Shark Stratos Cordless, so it&rsquo;ll generate larger suction when the head encounters an area with more debris. But its dustbin may blow debris and dust when you&rsquo;re emptying it.
<strong>Key Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Surfaces:**Carpet, furniture, Stairs</li>
<li>**Weight:**2.58548 Kgs</li>
<li>**Run time:**40+ minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-wyze-cordless-vacuum"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09J8V2CXF?ie=UTF8&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_source=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtings.com%2Fvacuum%2Freviews%2Fbest%2Fcordless-stick&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=e6e367c2a7cd02193030c8c3a66d1742&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">4. Wyze Cordless Vacuum</a></h3>
<p>Wyze Cordless Vacuum is good for couches and hard surfaces. It also has good power but is not suitable for carpet vacuuming due to the low clearance and relatively low suction.
<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to assemble</li>
<li>Intensive spot cleaning with 24,000 Pa Suction Power</li>
<li>Offers 50+ run time
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Poor build quality - plastic
An extra battery would be great to have if you&rsquo;re vacuuming a large house. But this one has fewer attachments and doesn&rsquo;t have the automatic suction power adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll love it for vacuuming tiles, hardwood floors, carpets, and pet hair. It has great performance in picking solid debris, thanks to the HEPA exhaust filter that removes fine particles such as pet dirt and dust.</p>
<p>On runtime, Wyze Cordless Vacuum will give you about 60+ minutes of cleaning before you recharge.
<strong>Key Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Surfaces:**Bare floor, Carpet, Carpet, and Upholstery</li>
<li>**Weight:**1.27006 Kgs</li>
<li>**Run time:**50+ minutes</li>
</ul>

Dyson Omni-glide</a></h3>

<strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ultra-lightweight and easy to handle</li>

<h3 id="what-to-consider">What to Consider</h3>
<h4 id="i-battery-runtime-and-charging-time">i. Battery Runtime and Charging Time</h4>
<p>Longer runtime for your cordless stick vacuum will ensure you clean surfaces for an extended time without requiring frequent recharging. Also, check if your specific model has an interchangeable battery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have less downtime when cleaning if the vacuum machine requires less time charging - also you&rsquo;ll get power output that is consistent if the battery is Lithium-ion, and the battery will also last longer.</p>
<h4 id="ii-adjustable-suction-power">ii. Adjustable Suction Power</h4>
<p>Get a vacuum with adjustable suction power to ensure a more versatile cleaning. So, you&rsquo;ll easily adjust the suction power for various surfaces such as hard floors, or carpets.</p>
<p>Check if the cordless stick vacuum will suck different materials such as debris and fine dust particles possibly with multi-stage filtration.</p>
<h4 id="iii-maneuverability-and-weight">iii. Maneuverability and Weight</h4>
<p>Finally, consider the design and weight of the vacuum. This will affect how easily you can carry the machine to other rooms, including upstairs or downstairs.</p>
<p>If the vacuum is light, you&rsquo;ll easily undertake detailed or overhead cleaning. Check that the joints are flexible and also have swivel heads, which will allow easy cleaning of tight spaces and under furniture.</p>
<p>A lightweight design also speaks to inclusivity, ensuring that individuals of all ages and physical abilities can use the vacuum without strain. This consideration is crucial in creating universally designed products that cater to a diverse user base.</p>
<p>Also, the vacuum should have a large dustbin to cut down on how frequently you&rsquo;ll need to empty the machine during cleaning. This feature adds convenience but also highlights the importance of efficient waste management in household products.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>When shopping for a cordless stick vacuum, consider lightweight designs, budget, suction power and technology, battery life, and innovative technology to help clean different floor types.</p>
<p>This approach not only ensures a clean home but also reflects a thoughtful consideration of the broader implications of your choices, from environmental impact to inclusive design and cultural significance.</p>

<li>But you can keep your surfaces free from pet hair by acquiring a vacuum cleaner that is meant for pet hair.</li>
<li>If you dont know what to look for in a vacuum for pet hair, you have to the right place.
<strong>Suction Power</strong>
Your main aim is to have a powerful suction that will effectively dislodge pet hair from bare floors, deep carpets, and so on. So, your device should pick up pet hair without leaving some of it behind.
The motor rotation and battery power heavily determine the suction power. Currently, most vacuums come with special attachments that increase their ability to suck pet hair.
<strong>Roller Brush</strong>
A powered roller brush is the best tool for removing pet hair from carpets. The brush bristle dislodges pet hair from the carpet fibers while the sucking mechanism pulls them for vacuuming.
Go for a device that automatically reduces the roller brush rotation on transitioning from carpet to hard or smooth surface. This ensures that the carpets collected from the carpet do not get blown away before it gets vacuumed.
<strong>Head Attachments</strong>
Since pet hair will be located in various places, youll need different vacuuming heads.
Therefore, apart from the brush roll, you need a tool for vacuuming your upholstery and a crevice tool for reaching difficult areas.
<strong>Effective Filtration</strong>
Other than the hair, pets will shed off dander, which eventually brings in dust mites and their feces.
Under these circumstances, you are likely to suffer from allergic reactions, especially when vacuuming your house.
However, a vacuum with an effective filtration system will ensure that 99.9% of allergens and pollutants are trapped. HEPA filters are usually recommended because of their effective filtration.
<strong>Run-time</strong>
The choice of a cordless vacuum eliminates the inconvenience of a power cord trailing behind you. The presence of a rechargeable battery compensates for this.
However, it wont be of many benefits if the battery has a very short run-time. Therefore, its advisable to go for a high-quality lithium-ion battery model to get a substantial run-time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>With numerous vacuum cleaners in the market today, it might be challenging to settle on one that is ideal for vacuuming pet hair.</p>
<ul>
<li>But after going through this review and buyers guide, you should be in a position to pick your most ideal device.
Depending on your budget, theres something for you from the above list.</li>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-dishwasher-detergent"><strong>How to choose the Best Dishwasher Detergent</strong></h2>
<p>Dishwashers come in different types and qualities. Therere powder detergents, gel detergents, and tablets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Youll get all these in your local market or online. However, not all of them will perform as they promise.
So, before choosing your ideal dishwasher detergent, here are a few important things to consider.
<strong>Powder</strong>
Perhaps, powder detergents are some of the oldest cleaning products in the market.</li>
<li>Theyre available in both small and bulk. Getting the bulk package will give you cost-effective cleaning.</li>
<li>The main setback with powder detergents is their tendency to absorb moisture.
Therefore, youll have to store them in watertight containers so that they retain their cleaning properties.
<strong>Gels</strong>
Gel detergents are cheaper and have the ability to dissolve easily, especially in hot water in your dishwasher.</li>
<li>They dissolve even at low temperatures and will not have harsh effects on your hands.
Theyre, however, not as effective as either powders or tablets.
<strong>Tablets</strong>
Also known as tabs, pics, or packets, these dishwasher detergents are premeasured for use as single-dose pieces. This gives you convenience when putting the detergent in your dishwasher.
The single-dose tabs contain a multi-action formulation that pre-treats, degreases, bleaches, and rinses your utensils.</li>
<li>They are effective in lifting and removing the mess from utensils.
However, their cost-per-load is higher than that of powders or gels. They also tend to disintegrate when handled with wet hands.
<strong>Composition</strong>
Some ingredients used in the manufacture of dishwashing detergents negatively affect your utensils and affect your skin.
Avoid products that contain chemicals such as phosphate.
<strong>No Residue</strong>
Residues left on utensils after dishwashing requires you to rerun the machine or clean them manually.</li>
<li>This is not only time-taking but also consumes more water and energy.
If your dishwasher has a drying cycle, your utensils will have to get wet once more.
<strong>Packaging</strong>
Go for packaging that gives you an easy time when putting or pouring the detergent into your dishwasher.</li>
<li>Tablet detergents provide the quickest way to add to your dishwasher.
Some like the Finish Quantum Max Powerball is unwrapped and pre-measured. That means you only have to throw the tablet into the dishwasher.
Most of the powder products come in plastic bags, which are cheaper and environmentally friendly. Thus, youll have to pour them into a convenient and reusable container.
Some gel detergents come with a dispenser to enable precise measuring.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>If you have been getting unsatisfactory results with your dishwashing, its time you tried a new dishwasher detergent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting an effective brand will get your utensils clean in the least time, money, and with less hustle.
Whether you prefer a tablet, gel, or powder detergent, the brands I have reviewed will work perfectly with your dishwasher.</li>
</ul>

Further, the hair coat will be left smooth and shining.�Its bristles are not too hard to scratch the dog&rsquo;s
scalp.
However, it&rsquo;ll easily massage the scalp while moving through the pet&rsquo;s hair while enhancing natural oils&rsquo; release -
I recommend getting dog beds
.
I would recommend that you employ a tougher comb to detangle the tough hair before using this Boar Bristle Brush. However, this brush will work great for fine and delicate hair, as itll leave it intact.
The tool is lightweight and durable to easily move through the short hair due to the
Schima wood handle.</li>

<p>[amazon box=&quot;

&quot; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
HaloVa Pet Comb has double-sided bristles that also have quality wood. Further, I loved the plastic pin that wont scratch the dogs skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll find this dog brush also comfortable to hold due to the wooden handle.</li>
<li>HaloVa Pet Comb is both durable and strong to allow great grooming while still maintaining good blood circulation in the dogs coat.
Also, the comb&rsquo;s bristle side as itll easily glide (with no static) in the dogs fur.
HaloVa
Pet Comb will help remove any excess hair
, fur, and loose dirt from the dogs topcoat. Like the other two dog brushes above, this model also helps distribute the skin&rsquo;s oils and leave it healthier.</li>
<li>You can use this dog brush&rsquo;s pin side to remove hair tangles for a dog with no undercoats like the poodles.</li>
<li>However, for thick-haired dogs, you should the above reviewed FURminator de-shredding brush.
The bristles on this brush are close together and will be great for short-haired dogs like pug dogs or coarser hair. I noted that the bristle would be appropriate to remove knots and tangles.</li>

<p>[amazon box=&quot;

&quot; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Topping our list is the FURminator de-shedding brush thatll enable you de-shed your dog and achieve a full-deep dog wash.
You can be assured that youll now stopping your
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-%5Bfleas%5D(/posts/best-cordless-vacuum-for-pet-hair/)-live-in-human-hair/">living space off dog hair</a>
numerous times in a fortnight.
On quality, avoid brushes with bristles made from thin plastics or cheap wood as they&rsquo;ll break easily with short hair such as the chihuahua, Shih Tzu, or the pug <a href="/posts/best-dog-backpack-carrier-for-hiking/">dog</a>.
I would recommend this dog brush for cutting the hair thatll be falling off from your dogs dog onto the furniture, floors, coats, and car.
Luckily, this brush wont cut any hair on the topcoat, and thus the dogs undercoat will breathe easily and regulate the dogs temperature.
For a dog with heavy hair shedding and particularly during spring or fall, you can use the FURminator deShedding brush about 12-15 times per month.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, for light hair shedding, you can use the brush for roughly 15 minutes each time and about 2-3 times every week.</li>
<li>In addition to removing excess dog hair, the FURminator deShedding brush will also remove all the shed coat pieces from the pets skin.
Also, for timid and small dogs, choose the slicker brushes as theyll assist in spreading the natural oils produced on the dogs coat  leaving your pet smart and healthy.

The Chris Oval Pin Brush is a wire-pin model thatll prove great for your dog that has medium, curly, or woolly hair like the Shih Tzu or Maltipoo.
Chris Oval Pin Brush is also a light de-shredding tool thats equally firm cushioned and durable.
It&rsquo;s also a highly comfortable dog brush for short hair that wont scratch your dogs skin (due to the smooth tips), but its also stylish.
However, this pin brush model wont readily remove the loose dog hair compared to the de-shedding brushes, but it will be great for just brushing the dogs topcoat.
Further, the brush has rounded pins that lessen the dog&rsquo;s amount of discomfort while brushing it.
Itll easily remove all dirt, spread the body oils, and glide in the dog&rsquo;s coat. Also, you can easily detach the removed hair from the brush pins after youre done.

Hertzko Self Cleaning is a great brush thats compact, strong, and efficient in removing excessive hair on your dogs coat.
Itll easily untangle the difficult hairs with even less pain to your pet with short hair.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, this dog hairbrush has curved bristles to easily remove the excess hair thats on your dogs coat.</li>
<li>This would otherwise make the dog bristles not get overly close to the dogs skin and might even hurt it.
The curved bristles brushing would also enhance better blood flow that will promote faster growth of hair strands. It has retractable blades that are simple to clean.
Further, the dog brush wont slip easily (due to the runner grips) and doesnt stain the homeowners wrists even after extended times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>For example, you can&rsquo;t use metal de-shedders that are suitable for long-haired dog coats.
You have to consider the price and quality variation for the brushes in the market.</p>

<h2 id="buyers-guide---best-drain-snake"><strong>Buyers Guide - Best Drain Snake�</strong></h2>
<p>When shopping for a drain snake, it is common for many customers to become overwhelmed by the many varieties that the market has to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is worth noting that price does not always go with quality. So, be keen not to be fooled by shopkeepers who present the pricey products as the best in quality and performance.</li>
<li>Also, different customers may be interested in different features of a product.
So what you see as the qualifying factor in a product may not be the qualifying factor for another customer. Thus, I find it important to share some of the most important factors to consider when buying a drain snake.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considerationswhen-buying-a-drain-snake">Considerations**�when buying a drain snake**</h2>
<p><strong>1. Cable Length</strong>
Drain cleaners come with varying cable lengths. So, depending on the span of your clogs, the ideal cable should be able to reach them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, your cable length will be determined by theplace you livein. Typically, people who live in a single storied house will require a drain unit with a least 25 ft cable, such as Ridgid 41408.
A 25 ft cable will not be the ideal cable for cleaning a bathroom drain on the second floor. You need a unit with at least 25 ft cable length.
<strong>2. Diameter</strong>
A drain snake should slide freely through the drain piping to reach the clogs. That means the diameter of the cable should always be smaller than that of the drain piping.
Experts usually recommend a difference of at least  to 1 between the snake diameter and the pipe diameter.�If you dont know the pipe diameter, go for a small diameter.
<strong>3. Auger Mechanism</strong>
Every snake needs a means of spinning the cable through the drain. Turning of the cable is what makes it possible to negotiate curves and penetrate clogs.
Avoid units that lack an auger mechanism. The auger mechanism you opt for should be reliable. Otherwise, you might spend a lot of time unclogging your drain or even retrieving the cable from the drain.
<strong>4. Head Type</strong>
Drain cleaners come with either fixed or interchangeable heads. If you opt for a snake with a fixed head, choose one that will tackle your most frequent clogs.
In the case of interchangeable heads, choose those that are easy to change. Below are the most common types of head types used for drain snakes.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Screw head</strong>: Also known as coil head, this type of head allows you to pull the blockage. This is a powerful head for removing blockages such as paper towels and other related products.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting head</strong>: A cutting head is the most preferred head for blockages that require cutting. Most professional plumbers prefer this type of cable head.</li>
<li>**Fixed Head:**This type of head is fixed on the cable and cannot be changed.</li>
<li><strong>Interchangeable Head</strong>: When a drain snake comes with an interchangeable head, it provides you with a way of leveraging different heads to cater to different types of clogs. The good thing is that they are easy to change and do not require special tools to change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-drain-snakes"><strong>How to use the Drain Snakes�</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
We&rsquo;ll take the plumber&rsquo;s snake. Next, I&rsquo;ve loosened the thumbscrew, as this will allow me to pull out the snake.
<strong>2.</strong>
Next, we&rsquo;ll pull out the snake and start pushing it into the drainpipe that&rsquo;s clogged. Continue with this process until you meet so relatively high resistance. This resistance means that you&rsquo;ve reached the drain blockage or a bend in the pipe. Check
flea foggers
.
<strong>3.</strong>
But you need to be about 6 inches from the pipe opening. Once I meet some resistance, I&rsquo;ll tighten up the thumbscrew. Now, I&rsquo;ll spin the auger bit, and it&rsquo;ll drill through the blockage. To do this, I&rsquo;ll hold the handle while pushing forward.
<strong>4.</strong>
Now, hold at the end and loosen the nut, pull out the drain snake more, tighten the nut again and repeat the process to drill through more of the drain blockage.
<strong>5.</strong>
When you feel that you&rsquo;ve drilled through most of the blockage, loosen the thumb screen and pull back the drain snake.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to drain clogs of all types, a drain snake would be an ideal solution rather than paying for a plumber&rsquo;s services be.
And although there are various drain snakes out there, not all of them are suitable for your type of drain clog.
So, it is recommended that you access your kind of drain clog to determine the suitable drain snake for you.
Always go for a drain snake that fits into your drain pipes. Oversize drain snakes will not do a good job or, even worse, will end up damaging your pipes.</p>

<h3 id="1-dji-phantom-4-pro-professional-drone-hobby-rc-quadcopter"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RCHDW96/?tag=p-policy-20">1. DJI Phantom 4 PRO Professional Drone, Hobby RC Quadcopter</a></h3>
<p>Next up is the DJI Phantom 4 Pro (with a hull shape), which has interestingly included the omnidirectional (5-direction) obstacle avoidance for all objects, including buildings or trees that are on its way while shooting your photographs.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Camera:**20MP (1-inch CMOS sensor, mechanical shutter)</li>
<li>**Flight Time:**30 mins</li>
<li>**Range:**7 km</li>
<li>**Key Features:**Omnidirectional obstacle avoidance, 4K/60fps, burst mode.
**
With its mechanical shutter and ability for burst mode shooting (at 60FPS), its camera is highly rated and will give you top quality images (that have the 4k resolution too). It can achieve about a 72 kph speed.
It has exciting photographing modes - Tripod Mode (max 4mph speed), Atti Mode, and Position Mode (enables obstacle detection &amp; tracking) that will make your shooting fun and simple. I love the return to home function since you can make the drone to retrace its path to its initial position - and thus possibly avoiding obstacles.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-dji-inspire-2-quadcopter-premium-combo"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X9DS9PH/?tag=p-policy-20">2. DJI Inspire 2 Quadcopter Premium Combo</a></h3>

</ul>
<h2 id="considerations-when-choosing-drones-for-still-photography">Considerations when choosing Drones for Still Photography</h2>
<p>**1. Camera Resolution **
The camera is the most critical factor for still photography. Look for drones with
<strong>large sensors (1-inch or bigger)</strong>
as they capture more light and detail.
<strong>Higher megapixels (12MP+)</strong>
ensure sharp, high-resolution images.</p>
<p>Opt for drones that support
<strong>RAW or DNG formats</strong>
. These files retain more data, giving you greater flexibility in post-processing. A mechanical shutter (like on the Phantom 4 Pro) helps avoid rolling shutter distortion in fast-moving scenes.
Read Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-headphones-for-guitar-amps/">Headphones for Guitar Amps</a>
.
**2. Flight Control Range **
Longer flight times mean more opportunities to capture the perfect shot. Most high-end drones offer
<strong>25-30 minutes per battery</strong>
, while budget models may only provide 15-20 minutes.
But, Bluetooth, radio waves, and Wi-Fi connections have a limited range, and this will weaken as it moves to a further distance.
Always factor in
<strong>extra batteries</strong>
for extended shoots. Some professional drones, like the Autel Evo II Pro, push flight times to
<strong>40 minutes</strong>
, which is ideal for commercial work.</p>
<h3 id="3-balance-portability-and-performance"><strong>3. Balance Portability and Performance</strong></h3>
<p>If you travel frequently, a
<strong>compact, foldable drone</strong>
(like the Mavic 2 Pro) is a smart choice. These models fit in backpacks but still deliver pro-level image quality.</p>
<p>Larger drones (e.g., Inspire 2) offer
<strong>better stability and payload capacity</strong>
for interchangeable <a href="/posts/best-compact-cameras-under-300/">cameras</a>. However, theyre bulkier and require more storage space.</p>
<h3 id="4-obstacle-avoidance-is-essential"><strong>4. Obstacle Avoidance is Essential</strong></h3>
<p>For beginners,
<strong>obstacle sensors</strong>
prevent crashes while learning to fly. Advanced systems (like DJIs omnidirectional sensing) are crucial for
<strong>urban environments</strong>
with trees, buildings, or power lines.</p>
<p>Some drones, like the Yuneec Typhoon H Pro, use
<strong>Intel RealSense</strong>
for smarter object detection. If youre shooting in open areas, basic sensors may suffice.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Choosing the perfect drone for still photography depends on your specific needs, budget, and skill level. The market offers exceptional options at every price point, from the compact DJI Mini 4 Pro to the professional-grade DJI Inspire 3.</p>
<p>For most serious photographers, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro represents the <a href="/posts/best-point-and-shoot-camera-under-100/">best</a> balance of image quality, flight performance, and portability. Those needing the absolute best image quality should consider the Inspire 3, while travelers and hobbyists will appreciate the Mini 4 Pro&rsquo;s combination of capability and compact size.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best <a href="/posts/best-electric-riding-lawn-mowers/">electric</a> fly swatter, you can consider factors like power output, durability, ease of use, and safety features. These elements ensure that you not only eliminate flying insects effectively but also enjoy convenience and reliability in your pest control efforts.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-power-output">1. Power Output</h3>
<p>Some products, like the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0859Q3DQ2/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Zap It! Bug Zapper</strong></a>
, feature a high-voltage output of up to 4,000 volts. A higher voltage ensures more efficient insect killing with one swift swat, reducing the need for multiple attempts. On the other hand, some swatters, like the
<strong>Black Flag Handheld Zapper</strong>
, have a lower voltage but still provide consistent results for smaller insects.</p>
<p>A high-voltage swatter can kill bigger insects instantly, while a lower voltage swatter might require more effort for larger bugs but can still be effective for common household pests like
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef621">Fruit Flies</a>
and mosquitoes. Be sure to choose a device with the appropriate voltage for your specific needs.</p>
<h3 id="2-durability-and-build-quality">2. Durability and Build Quality</h3>
<p>Some products, such as the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F3N8A4Q/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Elucto Electric Fly Swatter</strong></a>
, are built with reinforced frames and robust mesh grids, ensuring that they last longer and withstand frequent use. Durability is critical because a flimsy swatter can break or bend easily, compromising its efficiency.</p>
<p>Electric fly swatters constructed from durable materials provide more value in the long run, as they can handle heavy use without significant wear and tear. A sturdy build, especially in products like the
<strong>Sourcing4U Executioner Fly Killer</strong>
, gives users peace of mind when dealing with tougher insects or daily pest control.</p>
<h3 id="3-ease-of-use">3. Ease of Use</h3>
<p>Some electric swatters, such as the
<strong>Beastron Bug Zapper</strong>
, feature ergonomic handles that make them easy to grip and maneuver. A lightweight and well-designed handle is key, especially for those who may need to use the swatter for extended periods. With an ergonomic handle, controlling the device becomes more comfortable and less tiring.</p>
<p>On the other hand, complex designs that require multiple buttons or additional setup steps can hinder usability. For example, while some multi-function devices offer more features, they may not be as straightforward to use as simpler models like the
<strong>Zap It! Bug Zapper</strong>
, which activates instantly with just a press of a button.</p>
<h3 id="4-safety-features">4. Safety Features</h3>
<p>Safety is paramount, especially when using high-voltage devices. Products like the
<strong>Black Flag Handheld Zapper</strong>
have a triple-layer safety mesh that prevents accidental contact with the electrified grid. This protective mesh ensures that users, particularly children, are safeguarded against accidental shocks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, automatic shut-off features can be found in some swatters, providing an added layer of protection. Safety features should not be overlooked, as they significantly enhance the user experience, especially in households with children or pets.</p>
<h3 id="5-battery-life-and-charging-options">5. Battery Life and Charging Options</h3>
<p>Some swatters, such as the
<strong>Zap It! Bug Zapper</strong>
, come equipped with a rechargeable battery, allowing for multiple uses before needing a charge. Rechargeable options tend to be more eco-friendly and convenient for those who don&rsquo;t want to constantly purchase disposable batteries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the
<strong>Black Flag Handheld Zapper</strong>
operates with replaceable AA batteries, which might be ideal for users who prefer quick replacements instead of waiting for a device to recharge. Battery life is important as it directly impacts how long you can use the swatter before needing to recharge or replace batteries.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best flea <a href="/posts/do-flea-collars-work/">collar</a> for cats, you can consider things like effectiveness, safety, duration of protection, and ease of use.</p>
<p>These factors play a crucial role in ensuring your cat remains flea-free and comfortable while wearing the collar. Related:
Spot-on flea treatments
.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-effectiveness"><strong>1. Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>The primary function of a flea collar is to repel and kill fleas. Some products, like the
<strong>Seresto Flea and Tick Collar</strong>
, offer nearly instant protection by starting to kill fleas within 24 hours of application.
Others, like the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B8CG5NK/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Hartz UltraGuard Plus</strong></a>
, may take a few days to reach full effectiveness but can still provide long-lasting relief. When considering effectiveness, its essential to look at
how quickly the collar starts working and how long it continues to protect your cat.</p>
<h3 id="2-safety"><strong>2. Safety</strong></h3>
<p>Safety is paramount when choosing a flea collar. Some collars, such as the
<em>Rolf Club 3D FLEA Collar</em>
, are designed with non-toxic materials that ensure your cats safety while wearing them.</p>
<p>Other options, like the
<em>Soresto Flea and Tick Collar</em>
, include a breakaway feature that prevents strangulation in case the collar gets caught. Its important to ensure the collar you choose is both safe for your cats health and minimizes the risk of accidents.</p>
<h3 id="3-duration-of-protection"><strong>3. Duration of Protection</strong></h3>
<p>The duration of protection varies among flea collars. Some products, like the
<em>Seresto Flea and Tick Collar for Cats</em>
, provide up to 8 months of continuous protection, making them an excellent option for long-term flea control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, collars like the
<em>Hartz UltraGuard Plus Flea &amp; Tick Collar</em>
offer up to 7 months of protection, which is slightly less but still substantial. When choosing a flea collar, consider how long you want the protection to last, as this will impact how often you need to replace the collar.</p>
<h3 id="4-ease-of-use"><strong>4. Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p>Ease of use is another critical factor to consider. Some collars, such as the
<em>Bayer Seresto Flea and Tick Collar for Cats</em>
, are easy to apply and adjust, ensuring a comfortable fit for your cat.</p>
<p>Others, like the
<em>Adams Flea and Tick Collar for Cats</em>
, come with adjustable sizes, making them versatile for cats of different sizes. Ensuring the collar is easy to put on and adjust will make the process less stressful for both you and your cat.</p>
<h3 id="5-water-resistance"><strong>5. Water Resistance</strong></h3>
<p>Water resistance is an important feature, especially for cats that enjoy outdoor activities or may encounter wet conditions. Some flea collars, like the
<em>Seresto Flea and Tick Collar for Cats</em>
, are designed to be water-resistant, meaning they continue to protect your cat even
if they get wet
.</p>
<p>Others, like the
<em>Rolf Club 3D FLEA Collar</em>
, may not be fully waterproof but can still withstand minor exposure to moisture. If your cat is often outdoors or exposed to water, choosing a water-resistant collar is crucial.</p>

      <description>In this post, Ive reviewed the</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, Ive reviewed the
best flea combs
for cats.
Flea Combs are safer and simple flea control solutions when liked to
flea spray
, boric acid, or flea shampoo.
With these combs, you can easily
find and remove <a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-use-a-flea-comb/">fleas</a>
, flea dirt, and eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, the combs are non-chemical flea control methods and suitable for kittens and puppies with sensitive or damaged skin.
**Summary: **
To stop scratching and itching in your cats &amp; dogs due to fleas, check these flea combs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-safari-flea-comb--double-row-tines-metal-flea-comb"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002RJMAK/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Safari Flea Comb  Double Row Tines (Metal) Flea Comb</a></h2>
<p>Top on the list of the best flea combs for cats and dogs is the safari flea comb. Initially, I noted that my cat was
dandruffy and scabby in addition to having fleas. In addition to pre-brushing the cats fur, I recommend the Safari
Flea Comb to search and remove
fleas.</p>
<p>Single vs. Double row teeth Flea Combs?</p>
<p>If you have your or orphaned kitten that could be too small to employ topical treatments, then the Safari Flea Comb will come in handy. I noted that I was required to run just a few
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">flea comb strokes through the cats</a>
fur before some fleas started jumping off.</p>
<p>Equally, the flea comb is effective for both flaky and dry skin. Youll need to put extra combing around the
cats tail base, nape of neck, and ears
. The flea combs arrest both the adult fleas, smaller-sized fleas, and flea dirt too. The Safari flea comb is suitable for both long and
short hair
. However, be sure to remove all tangles and mats that might break the combs teeth.</p>
<p>On durability, the Safari Flea Comb has a hard handle and durable body that makes it worth its price and hence will be usable with multiple kitties over time. Its double tines make the flea comb suitable for removing even the tiniest fleas. In addition to searching for fleas, this flea comb is great for identifying coat and skin problems. Just like all other flea combs, youll need to dip it into the soapy water between combing strokes. However, youll need first to remove all the hair tangles on your cats or dogs coat.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The teeth of the Safari Flea comb wont bend if you use it after brushing the cats fur using the regular human hair comb to remove all the tangles or knots. However, if you need to do extensive brushing, you should use a de-shedding comb  particularly for pets with long hair.</dt>
<dt>+</dt>
<dt><strong>Pros</strong></dt>
<dd>Good after using
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-shampoo-for-cats/">flea shampoos</a>
and powders, Easy to control with its great Contoured, does not irritate flea bites, has metal teeth, easy-to-grip handle.</dd>
<dt><strong>Cons</strong></dt>
<dd>Might not work well with long hair.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="2-honbay-flea-and-lice-comb--double-sided-plastic-comb"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K14DKA6/?tag=p-policy-20">2. Honbay Flea and Lice Comb  Double Sided Plastic Comb</a></h2>
<p>Hornby Flea and Lice Comb come second on the list and can comb most of your small pets. However, I noted that this one lacked a handle, unlike the Safari Flea comb. Hence it is a little difficult to use.</p>
<p>But, I loved the pretty pack of colored flea combs.</p>
<p>However, I loved that the flea comb had two sets of teeth of different widths  narrow and wide. The plastic teeth tend to electrify the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-drops-for-cats/">cats hair and thus assists in removing the fleas</a>
. However, compared to metal teeth, the plastic teeth are less strong, and hence the flea comb has lower durability  could twist or bend.</p>
<p>While you can use both sets for flea combing, the side with wider teeth is also suitable for general grooming. Its tines are built from plastic and will be easy on your cats skin  particularly if it has broken skin or flea bites that would cause discomfort during rough flea combing.</p>
<p>Note: Flea combs with a single row &amp; longer teeth are better for removing fleas from pets with long hair. You can also opt for an Electronic Flea Comb.</p>
<p>The double-sided plastic combs come if four colorful pieces that are also greatly priced. The bright color will help you to easily spot any fleas or flea dirt after each combing stroke. For additional comfort, the plastic
flea combs are soft on your cats
coat. Since the comb has only one row of teeth  that are also long teeth-, itll be easy to comb cats with long hair.
**+ The Good: **
Effective and gentle touch, easy flea comb to use, double-sided teeth, great color selection (4 options), great for pets with short or long hair.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Cons</strong></dt>
<dd>Plastic
might bend or break and h
as no handle.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="3-oster-animal-care-comb--suitable-ergonomic-design"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IMJ0286/?tag=p-policy-20">3. Oster Animal Care Comb  Suitable ergonomic design</a></h2>
<p>Oster Animal Care Comb is considered a highly ergonomic flea comb to remove fleas from dogs and cats. Like the Safari comb above, the Oster Animal Care Comb has metal teeth durable and will remove
fleas even in dense cat
coats. Equally, the comb is suitable for both long and short-haired cats.</p>
<p>Despite being made of metal, the combs teeth do not have sharp points and easily remove fleas from the skin while not hurting it. Further, the comb effectively removes some sections of the loose undercoat (that arises during summer) on your cat. This leaves your cat looking beautiful and welcoming.</p>
<p>The combs teeth can turn 90 degrees from your cats skin, which also protects the cat during the flea combing process. Therefore, the flea comb will not dig into your cats skin like other metal teeth in different combs. Dont be fooled by the metal teeth on this flea comb  its lightweight and thus easy to carry around and use.
<strong>+ The Good:</strong>
Has short and thin metal teeth, great for long and short hair, robust design, is slightly curved to ease the combing process.
** The Bad: **
Lacks a handle, thus challenging to use.</p>
<h2 id="4-pet-republique-dog--cat-flea-comb"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MF7SBG2/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Pet Republique Dog &amp; Cat Flea Comb</a></h2>
<p>Pet Republique Cat
Flea Comb is designed from flexible tines with top reliability in removing adult fleas, flea dirt, and dandruff flakes. The design of the comb prevents the occurrence of stray hair from your cat.</p>
<p>Considering ergonomics, the flea comb has sinking patterns and thus easy to hold while flea combing your cat.</p>
<p>The Pet Republique flea comb will work excellently with hair that has shedding, matting, knots, and long fur. Its bristles are designed from a sturdy and hard material, and thus they wont damage your cats skin or coat.</p>
<p>Pet Republique also sponsors the protection of abandoned cats and dogs  for the lovers of charity work or worthy causes.
**+ The Good: **
Easier to grip, ergonomic design, and top-quality pins
** The Bad: **
Relatively pricey</p>

<h2 id="guide-in-flea-shampoo-for-cats">Guide in Flea Shampoo for Cats</h2>
<p>It can be an overwhelming choice for a pet owner to choose the perfect treatment for your pet when they
contact fleas
.
With a multitude of�options and solutions to choose from, we can help guide you through the process�so you can identify the right choice for you and your pet.
Luckily, the market today has a lot to offer, and they have massively reduced the use of harsh chemicals so they wont give off a harsh toxic odor or damage your hands nor your pet&rsquo;s skin.
When you have a flea invasion, you may feel like you want to mix every solution you can encounter while the infestation takes over your house. It can irritate not just your pet, other pets, and your family.
It is important to have a little insight into the flea&rsquo;s life cycle to best prepare and know how you can best prevent any further spreading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anadult�flea can produce up to fifty eggsper day, making it crucial to stop these.</li>
<li>Pests as soon as possible. They aresmall and jump, making them hard to spot.
The fleas survive through blood, with the new eggs hatching within six days. A�single
flea can produce two thousand eggs
in its lifetime.</li>
<li>The eggs tend to hatch indoors best nestled in carpets, soft furnishings, and anywhere that provides warmth.</li>
<li>While you have the heating on during winter, this can also encourage fleas to produceoutdoor, fleas hatch in shaded areas and sandy pits.
The worst part about a flea survival tactic is that it can remain in a cocoon for up to three hundred and fifty days until it hatches, waiting for the perfect conditions for best survival.
They wait for body heat and movement.
How�you can identify if your pet has
fleas is a lot easier than getting rid
of�them, unfortunately.
Check your pet&rsquo;s coat by eye and by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-combs-for-dogs/">combing through with a�flea</a>
comb and look for scales and bite marks on your pet&rsquo;s skin. You may also
Have some
bite marks on your skin
also. You can rub aloe vera on, which will soothe the bite.
Check your bedding if your pet sleeps near you for
flea eggs
and�clean these to prevent spreading.</li>
<li>Same with any bedding that your pets may be�sleeping on.</li>
<li>The most difficult stage to tackle a flea cycle is when the flea is in an immature state.
Again by ensuring your pet&rsquo;s
bedding is washed, you can immediately improve your chances of getting rid of fleas
. You can also apply flea shampoo regularly.
We suggest vacuuming the carpets whenever you can, too, which will remove any eggs or clean floorboards with eucalyptus.
Just be careful to dispose of the
vacuum�bag properly
; otherwise, you may risk the fleas hatching in the bag, and then you have another problem!</li>
<li>In terms of medications, you can provide to your pet; you can try flea bombs, which can be tricky for you if you want to get into your house any time soon.</li>
<li>It is also very toxic, and the smell can linger for quite some time afteryou have used it.
It will work well if you have a terrible and stubborn problem with fleas, but we would only recommend this as a last resort and not to apply directly to your pet, and it can also kill fish and birds.</li>
<li>You will have to remain off.The premises, while the flea bomb is activated too, and use external assistance for this. It is a more expensive option.</li>
<li>The spot-on treatments, which are usually applied behind your pet&rsquo;s ear or neck area, are also a popular option.
We have found that these can be difficult to apply, especially if your cat is particularly squirmy.
The treatment doesnt seem to target a full area, and you will need to reapply regularly on larger animals. With cats, in particular, they will room themselves and obliterate the ointment.
Oral solutions can be an option but do not work for long-term use, and the fleas can jump right back on your pet&rsquo;s coat once the pill is not potent any longer.
Pill and oral medications are an option but hard too often; it is hard to medicate if you are an owner and to ensure that your pet has swallowed the treatment fully.
Often the pet has a reaction to the pill and wont swallow the tablet or throw it up after mixing it in with their usual cat or dog food.
You�can stay ahead of a flea attack and keep your cupboards topped with the right�treatment and have enough so you can treat your pet all year round.
Shampoos are a great alternative to use, and vets and manufacturers have spent a lot of time developing products that wont damage your pet or the environment.
The solutions not only stop fleas in their cycle, but they will also care for your pet&rsquo;s coat, not give off any toxic smells or damage your hands while you are applying the solutions.
Most�of the shampoos are reasonably priced and also come in varying sizes and�smells. They are widely available and have been tried and tested by so many�animal lovers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you have young children who may contact your pet, this may not be the best option for you as the solution is toxic, and they may touch their mouth or eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some pets have also been reactive to this type of treatment, especially if they suffer from hair loss or skin irritation.</li>
<li>The�solution isnt as chemically friendly as other alternatives nor as effective.
We know it can be expensive caring for your pet, and fleas are pests that can keep coming back and attacking.
It is hassle buying products that don&rsquo;t work, and you feel trapped in the pest-ridden household.
Shampoo your pet frequently in the solution, and comb and clean bedding will keep your
home safe�and fleas
at bay.</li>

<p>It uses pyrethrins as the main ingredient. The product contains natural components that are known to kill a wide range of pests that might infest your home.</p>
<p>It is safe for use in houses and homes with both pets and children. It does not contain strange chemicals that might have adverse side effects on plants.
For the best results, you need to use this product as a surface dilute. This is because it is not strong enough to kill insects beneath the ground.

If you apply this product on your pet, you will notice that the insects climb up to the coat before dropping dead. If you see any fleas and ticks shortly after application, then your pet might have picked them elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="considerations-in-the-best-flea-spray-for-yard">Considerations in the Best Flea Spray For Yard</h2>
<p>Therefore, read on to discover what to look for when shopping for the best fleas spray for the yard.</p>
<h3 id="1-ease-of-use">1. Ease-of-use</h3>
<p>When companies manufacture products, they ensure that users will not struggle to use them to treat their homes. Nevertheless, some of them do not pay close attention to this vital aspect.
This is why you need to ensure that you buy a spray that you will not struggle to use at home. An easy-to-use product should come application-ready so that you get to save time during the application.</p>
<h3 id="2-safety">2. Safety</h3>
<p>From the reviews above, you can see that most products have natural ingredients. This means that they are safe to use in homes and compounds with plants, pets, and humans.
Still, it is important to note that some of them might have secret additives that might cause severe side effects or allergic reactions. Before purchasing a product, you want to check the ingredients used to make the formulation and check that they are safe for you and your loved ones.</p>
<h3 id="3-effectiveness">3. Effectiveness</h3>
<p>You dont want to end up with a product that is not effective enough. It is vital to get value for your money at all times. To get this, make sure to get a product that will keep killing for the longest time possible.
You can get this information by going through online product reviews. However, it would help if you were careful since some reviews are done by the same companies that sell the products.
Also, try to buy a spray that you can dilute in small quantity but end up using in large areas. For instance, if you can use 32 0z on 13,000 square feet, then that is a highly effective product.</p>
<h3 id="4-check-the-reputation-of-the-dealers">4. Check the Reputation of the Dealers</h3>
<p>Currently, many companies claim to manufacture the best pesticide, but you cant be so sure by reading from their website. To be certain about this, look for sites that offer a genuine review of those companies.
Moreover, you can get information from the people that have used their products before. Some companies do not use the right procedures to make insecticides; therefore, they end up selling low-quality products that will not meet your expectations.
Avoid buying products from companies that do not share enough information about the products that they sell.</p>
<h3 id="5-check-the-price">5. Check the Price</h3>
<p>With the price of the product, you can tell whether a product is effective. However, you should not buy products with inflated prices, since this might not imply that they are right.
Reliable companies sell products at reasonable prices since they are not looking to exploit buyers. Shop online, make a list of products that you consider buying, and compares their prices. If possible, save money for going for the ones on offer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this list, we have indicated the best flea spray for the yard. However, you need to note that they work in different ways.
Therefore, you need to pick the one that would best serve your needs. Always make sure to follow the right direction to avoid wasting messing up.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best flea treatment for dogs, you can consider things like the product&rsquo;s effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and your dog&rsquo;s specific needs. Selecting the right flea treatment can keep your dog comfortable and protect them from harmful parasites.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-effectiveness-against-fleas-and-ticks"><strong>1. Effectiveness Against Fleas and Ticks</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002J1FOO/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Frontline Plus</strong></a>
, are renowned for their ability to eliminate both fleas and ticks at various life stages.</p>
<p>This broad-spectrum effectiveness ensures your dog is protected from infestation and the diseases these parasites carry. Look for treatments that kill adult fleas and also target larvae and eggs, preventing future outbreaks.</p>
<h3 id="2-safety-for-your-dog"><strong>2. Safety for Your Dog</strong></h3>
<p>Some flea treatments, such as
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00061MSGM/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Advantage II for Dogs</strong></a>
, are designed specifically for dogs, ensuring that the ingredients are safe and non-toxic when used as directed.</p>
<p>Consider your dog&rsquo;s age, size, and any pre-existing health conditions when selecting a treatment. Puppies or dogs with sensitive skin may require milder formulations, while stronger treatments might be suitable for
larger, healthy dogs
.</p>
<h3 id="3-ease-of-application-">**3. Ease of Application **</h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>NexGard</strong>
, come in the form of a tasty chewable tablet, making administration simple and stress-free, especially for dogs that resist topical treatments.</p>
<p>Others, like
<strong>Seresto</strong>
, are available as collars that provide continuous protection for up to 8 months. Consider what method your dog is most comfortable with, as this will make regular flea prevention easier to maintain.</p>
<h3 id="4-duration-of-protection"><strong>4. Duration of Protection</strong></h3>
<p>Some flea treatments, such as the
<strong>Seresto Flea and Tick Collar</strong>
, offer extended protection for up to eight months, reducing the need for
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6081898/">frequent reapplications</a>
.</p>
<p>On the other hand,
<strong>Capstar</strong>
provides immediate relief but needs to be used more frequently. Consider how long you want the treatment to last and how often you&rsquo;re willing to reapply or administer it.</p>
<h3 id="5-cost-effectiveness"><strong>5. Cost-Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>Some treatments, like
**PetArmor Plus **
with
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671438/">fipronil/(S)-methoprene</a>
, provide a budget-friendly option while still offering effective protection against fleas and ticks.</p>
<p>Balancing cost with effectiveness is crucial, especially if you have
multiple pets
or are looking for long-term treatment. It&rsquo;s important to evaluate whether the price reflects the quality and duration of protection you need for your dog.</p>

<p>Bug Soother is a top choice for those who prefer
<strong>plant-based protection</strong>
. Made with citronella, lemongrass, and vanilla essential oils, it repels gnats without harsh chemicals. The light, pleasant scent makes it great for everyday use, and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, natural repellents typically require

are herbivores and feed on different kinds of roots. They also eat leaves and some insects -
try the best gopher <a href="/posts/best-poison-for-squirrels/">poison</a>.
So if you see an area of dead grass, it might be because gophers have been eating up its roots.</p>
<p>To tackle these pests, most people use <a href="/posts/best-gopher-traps/">gopher</a> baits that act as a poisonous meal.
As gophers tend to use the existing tunnels, they might come across leftover bait that&rsquo;s lying around. It&rsquo;ll get attracted to the bait and end up eating it and die before you even find out about the presence of a new gopher.</p>
<h2 id="reviews-top-7-best-gopher-poison-for-2025">Reviews: Top 7 Best Gopher Poison for 2025</h2>
<h3 id="1-jt-eaton-anticoagulant-poison--bait---1-pick"><strong>1. JT Eaton Anticoagulant Poison / Bait - #1 Pick</strong></h3>
<p>This gopher bait is undoubtedly our top pick and the best solution to your gopher problem.</p>
<p>Its a first-generation anticoagulant bait. The active ingredient used in this is diphacinone at 0.005%.
It&rsquo;s relatively easy to use, empty, and re-use as you don&rsquo;t have to fill in the tunnel. It&rsquo;s able to hold up against moisture and can be left unattended for long periods.
It can be used over and over again and tends to produce outstanding results every time without any change in the method.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a first-generation anticoagulant.</li>
<li>The block baits are moisture resistant.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to dig up to use this bait.</li>
<li>The bait is long-lasting and can be used time and time again.</li>

<h3 id="2-kaput-gopher-poison--bait---2-pick"><strong>2. Kaput Gopher Poison / Bait - #2 Pick</strong></h3>
<p>Diphacinone is the active ingredient that&rsquo;s used to make the Kaput Gopher Bait. Unlike the bait mentioned before that is in the form of a block, this one comes in the shape of a pellet.</p>
<p>The gophers seem to love this bait as their last meal.�It comes in a large-sized bucket for various uses. You only require a few ounces to put in each hole. However, you need to dig a hole and then place the bait.
Make a hole in the ground and pour the pellets in, or use an applicator to do so. You&rsquo;ll have plenty of the bait to cover a wide area and apply it in each hole.
After waiting for a few days, bait the holes again, and it&rsquo;ll help you get rid of the gophers.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bait is the first-generation anticoagulant.</li>
<li>The bait is quite long-lasting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to dig or use an applicator to apply the bait.</li>

<h3 id="3-amdro-mole--gopher-bait---3-pick"><strong>3. Amdro Mole &amp; Gopher Bait - #3 Pick</strong></h3>
<p>The formula of the Amdro Mole and Gopher Bait consists of zinc phosphide as the active ingredient. It&rsquo;s the first zinc phosphide bait on the list.</p>
<p>If you follow the instructions on the label carefully, you&rsquo;ll achieve great results from its use.
The bait is in a pellet shape that comes in a small container. When using this bait, you need to be right on target, as the attractant isn&rsquo;t too strong, and the gophers might ignore it and move on.
As the quantity is limited, you might run out of the bait if you try to cover a large number of mounds. Proper baiting requires time and multiple attempts to get the job done right.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any homeowner can use it with ease.</li>
<li>It uses zinc phospohide as an active ingredient</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attractant can be improved.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-moletox-gopher-killer"><strong>4. MOLETOX, Gopher Killer</strong></h3>
<p>Moletox is another bait that uses zinc phosphide as its active ingredient. This pellet shaped bait is a choke-type trap for the gopher. So, it would help if you killed the gopher once it gets caught.</p>
<p>It would help if you placed it on the ground in a way that it&rsquo;s secured and anchored to it. The corn attractant seems to work quite well.
The label claims that you only require a teaspoon of bait for each mound to kill the gophers, and it&rsquo;s true.
However, this bait also comes in a small package which only contains one pound of bait.
It turns out to be an insufficient quantity when treating the entire yard that&rsquo;s affected by gophers. You would require more quantity as you&rsquo;ll soon run out of it.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains a corn-based attractant that&rsquo;s quite effective.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to put in a lot of effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a small container that means you need to spend a few extra bucks</li>

<h3 id="5-sweeney"><strong>5. Sweeney&rsquo;s Gopher Poison Peanuts</strong></h3>
<p>The last bait on the list is another one that has zinc phosphide in it. Quite similar to the previous gopher bait, this one&rsquo;s also a choke-type trap that requires you to kill the gopher after the catch.</p>
<p>This bait has an excellent attractant that gophers are lured to. If you place it in the right spots, they&rsquo;ll be attracted to it and die once they eat it.
When applying this bait, secure it to the ground such that it&rsquo;s anchored. It&rsquo;s easy to use as it comes in four cone-shaped packages, a fact which enables you to pour it down the hole easily.
It&rsquo;s perfect if the yard has a limited infestation as only 24 ounces can get the job done, but for repeating bait, it&rsquo;s better to have more of it.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attractant does the job perfectly well.</li>
<li>Amongst the rest of the pellet baits, this one is the easiest to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-easily-select-the-best-gopher-bait">How to Easily Select the Best Gopher Bait?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When choosing gopher bait, go for the one that&rsquo;s known to have a successful track record.</li>
<li>The bait must have a good attractant that smells like food so that the gopher is lured in and tricked into eating it. After taking a few bites only, the gopher bait should prove to be fatal.</li>
<li>In case it doesn&rsquo;t work, the animal won&rsquo;t die but get sick instead, making it immune to that active ingredient in the future. It usually takes a day to work once ingested, and for it to take any longer indicates a bad formula.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-to-place-the-gopher-bait">Where to Place the Gopher Bait?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Place the bait on the insides of the gopher&rsquo;s tunnel that&rsquo;s almost 18-24 inches from the initial opening in the mound. The tunnel is usually in a horseshoe shape, where the open end indicates the direction in which the tunnel is going.</li>
<li>To apply granular bait, use a long stick to poke a hole in the tunnel. Slide the granules inside and cover up the hole again. Also, close the opening to the mound.</li>
<li>When using block bait, shove a piece of it as deep and far into the mound as you can. Push it far inside the mound with the help of a stick and cover the opening of the mound. Otherwise, use a shovel to dig a hole in the ground, place the block of bait in the gopher&rsquo;s tunnel and cover both the hole and the opening.</li>
<li>Make sure you treat every mound in your yard if you want to get rid of them completely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-gopher-bait-the-best-treatment-available">Why is Gopher Bait the Best Treatment Available?</h2>
<p>In case you use gopher traps, you will surely get rid of the gophers, but later on, you&rsquo;d be left to deal with their dead bodies. You would have to remove them from the traps yourself.</p>
<p>As they&rsquo;re wild animals, they might have fleas, mites, or lice on their bodies and could be covered in dirt and filth. Getting stuck in the trap, their bodies might get bloody, and you wouldn&rsquo;t want to handle them in such a condition.
Only after a single use of the trap, it might get difficult to handle once it has caught and killed the gopher. The trap can get covered with skin, hair, body fluids, or fecal matter. Cleaning up the mess after each use isn&rsquo;t an experience that you&rsquo;d want to go through repeatedly.
Gopher poisons help you avoid all these situations. Baits are a good option as the unused poison will stay in the tunnels underneath the yard and will help you prevent gophers in the future as well.
Be careful when using gopher bait, however, as it is not only poisonous for the gophers but can be fatal if consumed by your pets and children as well.</p>

<h3 id="3-durability"><strong>3. Durability</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like the
<em>Cinch Gopher Trap</em>
, are built to last with high-quality materials such as galvanized steel.</p>
<p>Durability matters because gopher trapping can be a long-term task, and a trap that wears out quickly will require frequent replacements, adding to your costs. Opt for traps made from robust materials that can withstand various environmental conditions.</p>
<h3 id="4-safety"><strong>4. Safety</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like the
<em>Black Hole Reusable Gopher Trap</em>
, are designed with safety in mind, ensuring minimal risk to pets and non-target animals.</p>
<p>Safety is a key consideration, especially if you have pets or children who might accidentally come into contact with the trap. Traps with protective mechanisms or designs that minimize exposure to the trapping

<p>Some products, like the
<em>Wire Tek 1001 EasySet Mole Eliminator Trap</em>
and
<em>Macabee MGT</em>
, offer excellent value for money, combining effectiveness and durability at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness is about getting the best bang for your buck. While it&rsquo;s tempting to go for the cheapest option, consider the long-term value of a trap that may cost more upfront but performs better and lasts longer.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="igrs-and-flea-control---selecting-the-best-igr">IGRs and Flea Control - Selecting the Best IGR</h2>
<p>There are 2 major classifications of IGRs for fleas, based on</p>
<ol>
<li>The active ingredient</li>
<li>Added chemicals like knockdowns and synergists
<strong>1. (S)-Hydroprene</strong>
The active ingredient in Gentrol is
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/hydropregen.pdf">(S)-Hydroprene</a>
. This chemical has been found to work for killing both fleas, moths, beetles, and cockroaches.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The knockdown in Gentrol has been found to work for killing both adult fleas and their larvae.</li>
<li>This IGR can be used on carpets, upholstery, cracks and crevices, non-food areas where pets are present indoors only.
<strong>2. Pyriproxifen</strong>
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyriprogen.html">Pyriproxifen</a>
is another IGR for fleas that are applied directly to your dogs and cats.</li>
<li>This chemical has been found to work for killing larval stages of fleas, as well as moths, cockroaches, beetles, and ants.</li>
<li>The knockdown in this product has also proven useful against adult fleas indoors only on carpets or upholstery with no food present.
It can be used outdoors if pets are not around but it must stay dry when applied outside because rain and direct sunlight will affect its effectiveness.
<strong>3. Dinotefuran</strong>
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/TOOLS/PNAI/pnaishow.php?id=29">Dinotefuran</a>
is classified as a
<a href="https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/what-is-a-neonicotinoid/"><strong>neonicotinoid</strong></a>
as it&rsquo;ll damage the fleas nerve synapses&rsquo; receptors in the CNS. This is an insecticide, not an IGR.
Sentinel is a fast-acting product that works as an adulticide, and its residual effect will last for about 3 months.
<strong>3. Methoprene</strong>
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/methogen.html">Methoprene</a>
is available in either r-methoprene or s-methoprene and it&rsquo;s a good choice for fleas because of its low toxicity to humans, pets, and wildlife.
S-methoprene works like an IGR; it&rsquo;s sprayed around on the carpets or upholstery.</li>
<li>This product should be used as soon as possible to prevent new eggs from hatching.</li>
<li>If you choose this option it&rsquo;s important not to let it dry out because rain will wash the chemical away before it has been able to activate.
<strong>4. Prallethrin</strong>
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/180.545">Prallethrin</a>
is an insecticide from the
<a href="http://www.npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf"><strong>pyrethroid</strong></a>
family and it&rsquo;s often used alongside an IGR.
Prallethrin is a chemical generally used for the control of food-contaminating and nuisance insects like ticks, fleas, roaches, and
ants
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Selecting the best IGR for fleas requires careful consideration of various factors, including effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and environmental impact. Products like NyGuard IGR, Precor IGR, and Martin&rsquo;s IGR each offer unique benefits that make them suitable for different situations.</p>
<p>By evaluating your specific needs and the conditions of your environment, you can choose an IGR that provides long-lasting, safe, and effective flea control, ensuring a pest-free home.</p>

Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its non-staining.</li>
<li>Offers a non-synthetic alternative for removing fleas.</li>

<p>The active ingredients in this spray are Pyriproxyfen, Pyrethrums, and Permethrin. Its powerful enough to help rid you of any adult fleas, and also stops the pupae from developing.
However, it has no effect on their eggs, so youd have to use an insect growth regulator to kill those.
Once youre done spraying the room, we advise you and your pets to step out of that space till the product dries up. Staying inside the room can be harmful as well as an unpleasant experience for you or your pets.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its non-staining and quite easy to use.</li>
<li>It has a long-range of around 2100 square feet.</li>
<li>Its effect can last for almost seven months.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires at least two hours of drying out.</li>

It can be used on both cats and dogs, and the scent of the spray keeps the flea away. It offers a good substitute for the more powerful chemical products that you may be using.

<li>Its an all-natural flea spray.</li>
<li>Wont leave you with an unpleasant odor.</li>

<li><em>Headphone Jack</em>:3.5 mm, four mics, Stereo speakers
The Radeon Pro Vega 56 graphics (with 8GB HBM2 memory) are great for music and video editing. The
5-mm thin screen and
built-in CPU won&rsquo;t take much space and will display vast information compared to the 21.5-inch model.
You&rsquo;ll get an SDXC slot and the headphone mini-jack that&rsquo;ll allow the production of fantastic sound from your internal stereo speakers. In addition to the Mac Pro features, this iMac Pro has a 5K retina that&rsquo;s simple to set up.
After giving an update to the Logic Pro X, this iMac Pro is even better for production. Logic Pro X now supports eighteen processor cores (named 36 threads). It can now run many plugins plus tracks and sample libraries.</li>

<h3 id="4-apple-macbook-air-13-inch-retina-display---latest-model"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WRY8H/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch Retina display - Latest Model)</a></h3>
<p>The MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air for Music Production debate came up lately on an
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5855044">apple discussion</a>
. It has Thunderbolt 3 ports, a Retina display, a new trackpad and keyboard, and a modern Intel processor. Apple has maintained the 12 hours battery life, which is great for music production while traveling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to the old MacBook Air, this laptop has achieved a 30% upgrade on its Graphics performance.</li>
<li>It has a 128GB SSD storage to take 1 GB/sec and 2 GB/sec in write and read speeds, respectively. This is blazing fast for a laptop its size.
MacBook Air Retina display comes with a 2560x1600 resolution (with DCI-P3 color gamut). This is four times better compared to the older MacBook Air. It has black bezels, lighter (2.75 pounds), and thinner  just about the size of the MacBook Pro. It has Touch ID, which provides the real ESC key and Function keys. The T2 processor allows audio processing, disk encryption, secure booting.
MacBook Air has a new butterfly-switch keyboard with a silicone membrane for a quieter typing experience. This is because MacBook Air has low travel and prevents dust. Further, it has louder speakers with bass response. It also comes with the modern Force Touch trackpad that is easy to click and is more substantial.
Apple has done away with the MagSafe connector, SD card reader, USB-A ports. Instead, MacBook Air adopted USB-C charging and has two Thunderbolt 3 connectors (40 Gbps). Due to a lack of USB-A connectors, you&rsquo;ll need to purchase a dongle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-apple-macbook-pro-retina-2015-core-i7-22ghz"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J3WBHTS/?tag=p-policy-20">5. Apple MacBook Pro Retina 2015 Core i7 2.2GHz</a></h3>
<p>Macs are still a favorite with music-makers &amp; DJs. Apple 15&quot; MacBook Pro Retina is robust, has many USB ports,
<em>MagSafe present, and no noisy butterfly keys.</em>
Further, It&rsquo;s compatible with many DAWs that are optimized to work with the Mac OS. Therefore, there are fewer performance issues or crashes.
B
<em>ut, why didn&rsquo;t I include the MacBook Pro 2016?</em>
Well, MacBook Pro 2016 has a decorative touchpad - whose application is not fully utilized for music production. But get some hard-drives for great studio work.
Also, the 2016 model lacks the MagSafe connector, Firewire sockets, and USB ports. MacBook Pro 2016&rsquo;s Touch-Pad may allow faster access to the tempo, record, stop and play controls on the Ableton Live.
Apple 15&quot; MacBook Pro will comfortably run sessions with many plugins and tracks running actively. This is because it has superior 16GB RAM and processing power (quad-core Intel Core i7). But this Mac has some noise fans that could disrupt your recordings  if you&rsquo;re doing this in the same space.
SSD storage (
256GB
) for large-sized files: Also, Apple 15&quot; MacBook Pro uses SSD storage (
256GB
), and thus you can easily store the large-sized files without slowing the machine. The base model has 8GB RAM and a 3.6 GHz processor (dual-core) that&rsquo;s making.
Here&rsquo;s how different music producers use their Macs. (1) Traditional production - Record music tracks via mics &amp; instruments and finally mix. (2) DJs and performing musicians will use their Mac in recording and producing tracks and yet in playing. (3) Lastly, hip-hop artists and EDMs use DAW with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-laptops-for-fl-studio/">Best Laptops For FL Studio</a>
, MIDI-keyboard controllers, &amp; sequencers.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a traveling producer, get a sleek, light, and compact Mac. MacBook Pro 13-inch is excellent for on-the-go music production (when you&rsquo;re traveling).
On storage, you&rsquo;ll require a Mac with enough internal disk space for your current projects. But you&rsquo;ll need to transfer other files to an external SSD storage - about 500 GB.
Also, ensure that the room&rsquo;s surfaces and shape are appropriate so that they won&rsquo;t negatively affect the sound&rsquo;s EQ during the recording sessions. I recommend the iMac Pro 27-inch as the Best Mac for Music Production.</p>

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0025YOJXS&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Zymox Otic Pet Ear Treatment is one of the most popular and effective ear mite treatments available. The treatment usually works in 7 days though it might take longer in other animals.
It is gentle and safe. Zymox works by cleaning the ear first to get rid of the debris. You dont have to dig in the cats ears, which is very painful to the cat.
The treatment helps destroy antibiotic-resistant organisms and is ideal for treating inflammation from bacterial, yeast, and viral infections.
Made under acceptable manufacturing practices, the product is certified as being cruelty-free to animals.
Even during development, no experimentation is done on animals. It is not advisable to clean the ears before or during the administration of the treatment.</p>
<h2 id="4-sentry-hc-earmitefree-ear-miticide-for-cats"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0030DH0Q6/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Sentry Hc Earmitefree Ear Miticide For Cats</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0030DH0Q6&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
The Sentry HC Earmite is for use in
cats only to control
ear mite infestations. Made from pyrethrin and piperonyl, it is effective for the elimination of ear mites and ticks.
Some cats show allergic reactions to the pyrethrin ingredient; this is not a serious problem in most cases. Stop medication in such cases. It also contains aloe vera, which helps in soothing and relieving itchiness on the skin.
Make sure the cats ears are cleaned before administering medication. Massage the ears gently after every treatment helps the medication penetrate the ears&rsquo; inner parts.
The treatment is water-based and non-oily, which makes it fast and easy to use. It is, however, harmful when swallowed, so it should be kept away from children. It can lead to allergic reactions.</p>
<h2 id="5-otomite-plus-ear-mite-treatment"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HJOZECO/?tag=p-policy-20">5. Otomite Plus Ear Mite Treatment</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B00HJOZECO&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Otomite Plus Ear Mite Treatment doesnt irritate the cat after administering. This makes it one of the best
options for the treatment
of ear mites. It can also be used on dogs, puppies, and kittens.
The medicine&rsquo;s oil suspension enables it to penetrate the deep inner parts of the cats ears. The treatment is, therefore, able to kill all the ear mite. Clean the cats ears before administering it.
It is recommended for the best results to re-treat the cat with another dose of Otomite Plus Ear Mite Treatment. This should be done every seven days.
Discontinue the treatment after two weeks if there are no changes. The treatment is only recommended for animals that are over 12 weeks old.</p>
<h2 id="6-zymox-enzymatic-ear-solution--05-percent-hydrocortisone"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NVJAJG/?tag=p-policy-20">6. ZYMOX Enzymatic Ear-Solution + 0.5-Percent Hydrocortisone</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B007NVJAJG&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Zymox Ear Solution is very effective in managing bacterial, yeast, and fungal infections in cats. However, it is only half as strong as the Zymox Otic Pet Ear Treatment.
The treatment doesnt directly target ear mites but is a cost-effective way of dealing with ear mites in cats. To win the fight against ear mites, you will have to double the dose administered.
Warm the solution in a cup of hot water before administering it. The treatment is a bit oily and slippery. Therefore, it should be applied on a tiled floor where it is much easier to clean up after administering it.</p>
<h2 id="7-eradimite-ear-mite-treatment-for-cats"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002AL6UQ/?tag=p-policy-20">7. Eradimite Ear Mite Treatment for Cats</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0002AL6UQ&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Eradicate
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-get-ear-mites-from-dogs/">Ear Mite</a>
Treatment is made from aloe vera. It is, therefore, completely safe with minimum chances of developing
side effects
to the treatment.
The aloe vera also helps in soothing the inflamed or itchy skin caused by the ear mites. Apart from cats, it can also be used on other
pets such as dogs
and rabbits. The treatment also gets rid of the ticks and helps in breaking down and removing ear wax.
It is easy to administer
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">medication to the cat as the treatment</a>
is applied through topical drops to the ear. Eradicate Ear Mite Treatment is readily available over the counter.
One does not need a prescription to purchase the medicine. It is, however, advisable to seek professional advice from a qualified vet before administering. Consult your vet in the case of side effects, or the cat is under special conditions such as pregnancy.</p>

<h2 id="considerations-for-buying-the-best-mold-remover-in-2025">Considerations for Buying the Best Mold Remover in 2025</h2>
<p><strong>1. Ingredients and Type of surface</strong>
This is one of the top considerations when shopping for mold removers.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are concerned about safety, you might want to avoid products containing toxic ingredients.</li>
<li>Therefore, it follows that natural ingredients are preferable to harmful chemicals, which tend to accelerate the action.
There are different designs of mold removers that are suited for different surfaces.
Since molds tend to build upon different surfaces, it is imperative to read the user directions and specifications to determine whether it meets your needs.
Whereas some removers are designed for hard surfaces, others are suited for upholstery, and other interior uses.

You might want to check the user reviews and ratings before making the purchases to establish whether it has previously worked in eliminating a mold similar to what you are dealing with.
Molds are mostly found in the damp areas around your home, particularly around the bathroom and kitchen areas.
Since the wet conditions in these areas make it easy for mold to multiply, you might want to go a remover that targets hard-to-reach areas while catering to your specific needs.
<strong>3. Ease of use and Fast-acting</strong>
The ease of applying your preferred mold remover is an important consideration to allow you to cover the affected area with minimal hassles.</li>
<li>A mold remover with a sprayer is preferable, particularly if you are looking for effortless results on hard-to-reach surfaces.</li>

<h3 id="1-tomcat-mole-trap-hands-free-effective-and-innovative">[1. Tomcat Mole <a href="/posts/best-fly-trap/">Trap</a>: hands-free, effective, and Innovative](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043FHXVM/?tag=p-policy-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043FHXVM/?tag=p-policy-20</a>)</h3>
<p>Tomcat is an out-of-the-ordinary mole trap with notable features that make it one of the most popular brands in the market today.</p>
<p>The most selling attribute inherent in this device is the hands-free setup option. It only requires you to step on the yellow lever to set up the device. Plus, once a mole is caught, you don&rsquo;t have to use your hands to release it.
To set the device, locate an active tunnel and press with your heel or hand to make a depression (about one inch deep). There&rsquo;s a depth gauge on the backside of the trap for checking the correct depth. Using a shovel, make two long slots where the jaws can fit and open up freely.
Place the trap on the slots and step down slowly. Press the trigger post down until the trap locks, then release the pedal. I usually recommend using a stick to press the trigger.
The trap is under tension, and the pedal could hit your hand if he traps don&rsquo;t lock when releasing the pedal.
Your trap is now ready for a catch! You will know that a mole has been trapped when the yellow lever springs up.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hands-free operation</li>
<li>No additional setting tools or tongs are required.</li>
<li>Safe and easy to use</li>
<li>Simple to set</li>
<li>Excellent design</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a plastic construction which could break</li>

<p>Setting up this trap is very easy. Unlike other traps, this one requires no digging or setting up sharp prongs that could sometimes be dangerous to the user, children, and pets.
To set up the trap, locate an active mole tunnel and insert the closed jaws in the tunnel, with the base of the trap flushing with the ground.
Once you press down on the lever, the trap is now ready for the catch! Usually, moles have an instinct to reopen their tunnels whenever they collapse.
A will mole travels through the tunnel to find a blind end at the collapsed portion of the tunnel. When it pushes through the tunnel, the trigger is released, clamping the pest between the jaws.
What&rsquo;s more, this is a safe, effective, and environmentally friendly way to eradicate moles. It&rsquo;s ideal for use in nurseries, ranches, and organic farms.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective mole trap</li>

Besides, the device is reasonably easy to use. Once you have identified an active tunnel, push down the grass with your hands or heel. Push down the trap until the spears touch the bottom.

<h2 id="considerations-for-best-mole-traps"><strong>Considerations for Best Mole Traps</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-ease-of-use"><strong>1. Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone buying a mole trap will go for one that is simple to use. A good mole trap is easy to set up and simple to use. It does not require you to assemble parts as you relocate the trap from one tunnel to another.
On the other hand, complicated traps waste a lot of your time because of the settings involved.�Also
, the device should also be easy to clean. Not only does cleaning prolong the device&rsquo;s lifespan, but also because moles tend to avoid dirty traps.</p>
<h3 id="2-efficiency"><strong>2. Efficiency</strong></h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to waste your time and money on a trap that misses the target now and then. Always go for a dependable trap to avoid frustrations. Remember that the effectiveness of certain traps may depend on the type of soil they are used in.
Some traps tend to work effectively on certain types of soil. Therefore it is always advisable to know the type traps used by people around.</p>
<h3 id="3-trapping-method"><strong>3. Trapping method</strong></h3>
<p>Normally, different people will buy mole traps depending on the trapping mechanism. Some gardeners prefer to use exposed traps because these traps are easy to clean with pressurized water. Others opt to buy traps that will hide the mole insight.
While some gardeners prefer traps that kill moles, others wouldn&rsquo;t even come close to a dead mole. If you prefer traps that kill moles, be sure to check your trap regularly to avoid bad smell that comes from overstayed carcasses.
Once you have identified the type of trapping device, read the instructional manuals to help you set up the tools properly. Plus, you can take time to learn the basics of the device.</p>
<h3 id="4-safety"><strong>4. Safety</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the devices I have discussed are spring-loaded and bare sharp clasping jaws/edges. Thus, safety is of great importance when using them to kill moles. A good trap will kill moles without inflicting injuries to you, your kids, guests, and pets.
Most of these traps come with safety pins/clips to protect you from accidental triggers. Learn the mechanism of the traps to know how the safety clips work. Also, beware of the exposed pointed corners of the trap.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Moles are destructive creatures but can be effectively eradicated using the best mole traps in the market. Do not allow these creatures to disturb your peace anymore!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you find yourself constantly worrying about your kids getting <a href="/posts/best-mosquito-yard-spray/">mosquitoes</a> bites every time they are out playing in your backyard? Well, you should be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mosquitoes are responsible for almost<a href="https://www.isglobal.org/en_GB/-/mosquito-el-animal-mas-letal-del-mundo">720,000 deaths every year</a>, with the biggest percentage being kids.</li>
<li>You can never go wrong with investing in a mosquito repellent for your yard. This can save you or your guests the discomfort thatcomes with mosquitobites.
Mosquitoes, especially the female kind, are a hazard to our lives. If you happen to have a lot of bloom in your garden, its highly likely that mosquitoes will get a breeding ground.
amazon bestseller=&quot;[Best Mosquito Repellent for Yard&quot; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-1-top-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PGE032/?tag=p-policy-20">1. #1 Top Pick:<strong>Cutter HG-61067 Backyard Mosquito Concentrate</strong></a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B000PGE032&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
What I liked about this spray is the ability to continue working even during the rainy season.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its effectiveness lasts up to 8 weeks in normal dry weather, but it lasts up to 4 weeks during the rainy season.</li>
<li>It comes in a 32-ounce bottle that can be used for an area of about 5,000 square feet.
It is effortless to use, does not leave any residue or smell behind after application.
Backyard
Bug Control Spray
from Cutter is a favorite for many as it gets rid of mosquitoes and other bugs.</li>
<li>When the bottle is hooked to a hose, it easily sprays a radius of 5000 square feet, literally soaking an entire yard.</li>
<li>One application is enough to keep the bloodsuckers and bugs off for up to 12 weeks.
However, you are recommended to reapply after 8- 10 weeks to control the mosquito population, especially during their peak season.
Given that the
bug control spray
kills other insects too bees included, ensure that you dont spray the flowering plants during bloom.
If you are more into natural sprays, this might not be ideal for you as chemically synthesized.
It is made from Lambda-cyhalothrin, a synthetic pyrethroid. These two chemicals have strong repelling properties that keep mosquitoes at bay.
You will only need a small amount of the Cutter Backyard
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-mosquito-yard-spray/">Spray to get rid of mosquitoes</a>
for at least several weeks, depending on the weather.
It also gets
rids of bugs
, deer ticks, flies, ants, Japanese beetles, worms, among other pests found both below or above the ground.
You shouldnt be worried about your pets and children when using Cutter Backyard Spray. It poses no risk as long as it is used correctly and is left to dry before letting them play in the treated area.

safe for pets

Spectracide Triazicide either comes in a 32-ounce bottle of dilutable concentrate formula or ready to spray formula. Both work the same way. After application, it does not leave any stain; neither does it have any after-scent.

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B002GJPFIU&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Summit 20-Pack Mosquito Dunk is specially formulated to kill mosquito larvae before they become old enough to start biting. It is used in any standing water - here&rsquo;s how to unclog the water.</p>
<p>A single dunk application of this organic larvicide killer lasts up to 30 days and covers a surface area of 100 square feet. These dunks are inexpensive and are great at reducing the mosquito population in your yard.</p>
<p>The dunk works by releasing a natural soil bacteria called the Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI ), which is only toxic to mosquitoes. The bacteria released stops thousand of adult mosquitoes from breeding in just a minute.</p>
<p>The only limiting factor with mosquito dunks is that they cannot kill adult mosquitoes and only works in standing water.</p>
<p>Summit 20-Pack Mosquito Dunk is safe to use around plants, humans, and animals. Since it is a naturally occurring bacteria, it is eco-friendly and can be used for gardening. The dunks have been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).</p>
<p>These dunks are light in weight and can effortlessly float in water as they slowly dissolve to release the mosquito-toxic bacteria.</p>
<p>They are long-lasting; therefore, they do not require frequent replacement. They are easy to use; you need to string them and place them in the water area.</p>
<h2 id="6-wondercide-flea-and-tick-and-mosquito-control-spray"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076VTZZ6N/?tag=p-policy-20">6. Wondercide Flea and Tick and Mosquito Control Spray</a></h2>

Wondercide Natural Spray is a purely organic natural spray- no toxins and no chemical substances. Once the application has dried up, your children and pets are safe to use the treated area.
Being a natural spray, it has a delightful mild scent, which you will love. Its main ingredients are organic cedar oil, ethyl lactate, and water. All of which are natural.
Are you wondering if there is an eco-friendly and biodegradable alternative to harmful chemical yard products?
Well, Wondercide Ready-to-Spray is a
naturally derived and safe product that kills
and repels crawling, stinging, and flying insects, including mosquitoes, fleas, and crickets.
This means you dont have to worry about the creepy insects cropping back later.

This spray treats around 8,000 square feet and comes with a ready-to-use nozzle.
Like the rest, this non-toxic spray comes in a 32-ounce bottle that can cover an area of 5,000 square feet. Unless your yard is larger, you dont need multiple bottles of Wondercide Natural Spray.

<ul>
<li>It not only kills them but acts as a barrier byrepelling other pestsfrom coming into the treated area.</li>

<h2 id="7-ortho-bug-b-gon-insect-killer-for-lawns-and-gardens"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BLXZJW4/?tag=p-policy-20">7. Ortho Bug B Gon Insect Killer for Lawns and Gardens</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B00BLXZJW4&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
My first review, which is also my
top pick, goes to Ortho
Bug B Gon.� What makes it stand out is the long-lasting period of effectiveness- its effects last up to 6 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another reason why Ortho Bug B Gon made it to the top of my review is that it kills as many as 235+ listed different species of outdoor pests among the mosquitoes, fleas, spiders,� ants, and ticks.
Using this product, your yard, flowers, trees, shrubs, and lawns will remain pest-free.
It comes in a 32-ounce bottle, which covers an area of up to 5,300 square feet. Unless your yard is larger, a single bottle is enough to keep mosquitoes away for 6 months.
The active ingredients found in this
yard spray
are Bifenthrin and zeta-cypermethrin (from the pyrethrin class). Both of these ingredients have highly effective insect-killing and repelling properties.
Ortho Bug B Gon kills mosquitoes almost instantly. And the best part is that it is safe to use around pets and children once dried up.
Additionally, Ortho Bug B Gon does not leave any post-application residue. However, it has a rather heavy scent, which you might find repelling as well.</li>

<h2 id="8-black-flag-190107-electric-insect-fogger---best-mosquito-fogger"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYBSD/?tag=p-policy-20">8. Black Flag 190107 Electric Insect Fogger - Best Mosquito Fogger</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0000BYBSD&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Black Flag 190107 Electric Insect Fogger is ideal for an evening in your backyard or patio. It kills and repels
mosquitoes and other biting
pests.
Black Flag 190107 Electric Insect Fogger dispenses a 10 feet cone of odorless fog to cover an area of 5,000 square feet in just 10 minutes. As soon as the fog dissipates, which should be about 5 minutes later, the area is safe to be used for the next six hours. Both pets and humans are safe.
It is important to note that fogger solutions are not food-safe so when dispensing the fog, keep away from all food plants.
Ensure that you preheat the fogger for at least 2 minutes before you start the application. This enables the insecticide to work efficiently.
The Black Flag 190107 Electric insect fogger repels and kills mosquitoes completely even in hard-to-reach places like under the shrubs or dense foliage areas where mosquitoes rest.
Finally, the Black Flag 190107 Electric is easy to use only if you follow the instructions keenly. Also, ensure that you only use 3 wires of either 10, 12, and 14 gauge extension cables.</p>
<h2 id="9-tiki-brand-bitefighter-mosquito-repellent-torch-fuel"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0146LHXSK/?tag=p-policy-20">9. TIKI Brand BiteFighter Mosquito Repellent Torch Fuel</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0146LHXSK&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
TIKIs fuel is easy to use and will only require a torch. You can either use TIKIs branded torches or any other. You can even get creative and use a clear mason jar or something similar.
It doubles as a mosquito repellant and an outdoor lighting torch. It keeps away mosquitoes and all manner of bugs.
To use, light the torch and place it where you intend to stay or the area affected.
The TIKI fuel solution is made up of a blend of cedar oils and citronella. Both of these have strong repelling properties that are good at keeping insects at bay.</p>
<ul>
<li>The TIKI torch fuel burns with a relatively low smoke amount and soot. The smell is also fairly mild.</li>
<li>The fuels are sold in different forms and sizes, starting from a 12-ounce canister to 1-gallon containers.
However, I would recommend taking the biggest size they have since it is more economical unless you intend to use it only once.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="10-off-deep-woods-dry-aerosol-insect-repellent"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP8RQL5/?tag=p-policy-20">10. Off! Deep Woods Dry Aerosol Insect Repellent</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B07PP8RQL5&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
OFF&rsquo;s repellant! Happens to be among the best as it comes in 4 different varieties; wipes and aerosols to suit your preferences. With a 25% DEET active formula, OFF!
Deep Woods come in a mild scent that masks off the DEET chemical odor; that way, you dont need to use a gas mask when spraying.
The aerosol application is quite straightforward, and a little spray covers a wide area and provides protection for up to eight hours.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping mosquitoes away requires a powerful mosquito repellant. You can choose one that repels, kills mosquitoes, or stops their breeding altogether.</li>
<li>For your yard, target areas such as standing waters and deep thick vegetation are the perfect breeding conditions for mosquitoes.
If you are looking for the best mosquito
repellent for your yard
, I am sure one of the ones I have reviewed will help you. It is perfectly fine to use more than one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Choosing the best mosquito repellant should be dependent on many factors, budget notwithstanding. In the end, effectiveness is all that matters.
This will ensure that you are protected from the annoying bloodsuckers and other creepy insects.
So, whether you enjoy watching the sunset in your backyard, hosting a barbeque party, or have children who enjoy playing outdoor games, you need to invest in the best mosquito repellant for your yard.</p>

<p>This guide will help you navigate these factors to make an informed decision and recommend the top mosquito traps on the market today.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1effectiveness">1.<strong>Effectiveness</strong></h3>

, are known for their high effectiveness. The Flowtron BK-15D uses a powerful UV light to attract mosquitoes and an electrified grid to kill them instantly.</p>

<h3 id="2coverage-area">2.<strong>Coverage Area</strong></h3>
<p>For larger outdoor spaces, products like the

offer extensive coverage. This trap can protect up to 1 acre, making it suitable for big backyards or gardens.</p>
<p>When considering a mosquito trap, it&rsquo;s essential to match the coverage area with the size of the space you need to protect. Smaller traps may not be effective in large areas, leading to unsatisfactory results.</p>

<strong>2. Reliability</strong>
The active ingredients in an insect killer provide the means for exterminating and repelling pests. Thus, a reliable mosquito spray should contain the most effective ingredients to repel and kill mosquitoes.</p>

A high residual
effect eliminates the need
for regular treatment, thus saving you time and money.

Inorganic insecticide sprays contain chemical ingredients that are harmful to the environment. So if youre the cautious environment type, you may opt for organic insect sprays that are 100% free from chemicals.
<strong>3. Odourless</strong>
You dont want to have a smelly situation in your yard or garden. The synthetic formulations utilized in most chemical insecticides produce bothersome odors, which may cause several inconveniences.</li>

<em>Bonide Mole and Gopher Bait</em>
, are effective but must be used with extreme caution as they are highly toxic and have no antidote.
<strong>2. Effectiveness�</strong>

The primer for oak cabinets should minimize the wood&rsquo;s grain and keep the grain from bleeding through the paint. Its minimal shrinkage - a suitable choice for cabinet surface preparation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-aqua-coat-white-cabinet-grain-filler"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HQY2PF6/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Aqua Coat white cabinet grain filler</a></h3>
<p>Aqua Coat white is easy to apply a solution, which allows you to fill the pores and grains of your wooden cabinets before the painting process begins.
T
his action minimizes the absorption rate while raising the grain level to a uniform height to guarantee you a smooth polished surface - especially using this roller.</p>
<p>The Aqua Coat Grain Filler is ideal for smoothing out the grain of oak wood cabinets resulting in a dramatic difference compared to surfaces without fillers.
With a drying time of 45-60 minutes, this primer presents an excellent choice if you are looking for an instant solution. This unit is easy to apply and clean up, which further attests to this unit&rsquo;s dependability.
The filler can be thinned with water if you are a DIYer who is just getting acquainted with cabinet priming. Don&rsquo;t avoid your priming step if you need to

<p>If theres a wild animal that will courageously venture into your property, then it is a raccoon. Their masked faces and piercing stare is terrifying to some people.
Others, however, find them adorable. Until they start knocking over garbage all over the backyard, stealing your fruits and vegetables, and nibbling on wooden fixtures. Related:
how to trap raccoons
.</p>
<h2 id="reviews-top-7-best-raccoon-bait-for-2025">Reviews: Top 7 Best Raccoon Bait for 2025</h2>
<h3 id="1-coon-gitter-dog-proof-bait-for-dp---1-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J81MQOY/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Coon Gitter Dog-proof Bait for Dp - #1 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Raccoons are easy to trap as they are not picky eaters and will be attracted to any bait that looks or smells good. Here are some of the best raccoon baits you can use around your home.</p>
<p>There are also raccoon bait products that you can buy from a local store or online. Here are two products that make for the best raccoon baits.
Raccoons have a sweet tooth. The Treeberry Paste Bait has a mixture of sweet-smelling tree-ripened fruits that will attract the raccoon into the trap.
You can smear it inside the trap or use it on the other edible baits such as marshmallows. While the paste has no harmful effects, you should still keep it out of the reach of children.
It can, however, attract other types of animals too.
Tin foil -
Raccoons are very curious animals. Shiny materials spark their curiosity.
You can hang a piece of tin foil inside the trap as bait. Use a string to tie the piece of foil to the top of the trap such that it dangles inside the trap.
This will lure them into the trap when their nocturnal eyes spot something shiny in the dark. It is important to use clean foils as a smelly one could attract other animals.</p>
<h3 id="2-ringtail-cocktail-bait---2-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A6TOYAC/?tag=p-policy-20">2. Ringtail Cocktail Bait - #2 Pick</a></h3>
<p>The Ringtail Cocktail bait is made from smoked salmon fish. While it works great for trapping raccoons, it might also lure your dog and other animals that like fish.</p>
<p>It is advisable to use traps that dont cause any physical harm to animals so that you dont end up hurting your dog, or other harmless animals.
The best raccoon bait should be one that forces the raccoon to fully enter into the trap and step on the plate that triggers the trap. You should wear a glove when placing your baits as a human scent will scare them off.
Because of wildlife conservation efforts and public health safety reasons, your local authority may have laws and regulations regarding the trapping of domestic pests such as raccoons.
Marshmallows -
Raccoons have a soft spot for marshmallows. They also make for good bait as they are unlikely to attract other unwanted wild animals.
It is advisable to use large marshmallows as they cant be easily pulled out through the sides of the trap, and small marshmallows might also attract skunks wandering about looking for grubs. The last thing you want is to trap a skunk in your property.

<h3 id="3-pete-rickard"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A6TOYAC/?tag=p-policy-20">3. Pete Rickard&rsquo;s-LC260 Fish Oil - #3 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Always place the bait away from the walls of the trap. Raccoons are intelligent and may grab the bait without getting into the trap.</p>
<p>Remember to place something heavy on top of the trap so that the raccoon doesnt knock it over.
If you need to trap more than a single raccoon, it is advisable to engage the services of a professional so that the nursery can be quickly relocated after trapping. This will guarantee the safety of the kits. The expert will also be able to put measures that prevent future invasions again.
Always find out the laid down wildlife regulation policies for your area so you dont find yourself on the wrong side of the law.�Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/raccoon-facts/">Learn The Raccoon Facts</a>
An egg -
Raccoons arent picky eaters. They eat anything and everything they come across. Eggs are some of their favorites. You can trap them by simply placing an uncracked egg at the back of the trap.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With an egg, there are very little chances of other animals walking into that trap so you have higher chances of landing the right target.
You can also use other food such as raw nuts, bread, sweet corn, meat, fruits, ham, peanut butter, and dry dog kibble among others.</p>

<a href="http://www.canadianfieldnaturalist.ca/index.php/cfn/article/view/360">rat poison</a>
, you can consider things like effectiveness, safety for non-target animals, ease of use, and environmental impact. Selecting the right rat poison is crucial for eliminating rodent infestations while minimizing risks to pets, children, and the environment.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1effectiveness">1.<strong>Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HHM0JK/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Motomco Tomcat</strong></a>
, are known for their high efficacy. Effectiveness refers to how quickly and thoroughly the product can eradicate
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-poison-for-squirrels/">rodents</a>
. The active ingredient in the poison plays a significant role in this.</p>
<p>For example, bromethalin, found in products like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005ORDWYA/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Farnam Just One Bite II</strong></a>
, is a potent neurotoxin that kills rodents after a single feeding, making it highly effective in dealing with infestations.</p>
<h3 id="2safety-for-non-target-animals">2.<strong>Safety for Non-Target Animals</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>d-CON Corner Fit Mouse Poison Bait Station</strong>
, are designed with safety features that minimize risks to pets and children.</p>
<p>This is crucial because traditional rodenticides can be harmful if accidentally ingested by non-target animals. Products that come in tamper-resistant bait stations or use less toxic ingredients are preferable in households with pets and children.</p>
<h3 id="3ease-of-use">3.<strong>Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Neogen Ramik Green Rodenticide</strong>
, are easy to use because they come in pre-measured packets that can be placed directly in areas frequented by rodents.</p>
<p>The ease of use of a rat poison includes factors like packaging, application method, and how often the bait needs to be replaced. Products that require minimal handling and can be used in various weather conditions are ideal for busy homeowners.

<h3 id="4environmental-impact">4.<strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>EcoClear Products RatX</strong>
, are eco-friendly, breaking down into non-toxic components after use.</p>
<p>The environmental impact of rat poison is a crucial consideration, especially in outdoor settings where non-target wildlife may come into contact with the bait. Choosing products that minimize secondary poisoning and do not harm other wildlife is important for environmentally conscious consumers.</p>
<h4 id="5cost-effectiveness">5.<strong>Cost-Effectiveness</strong></h4>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>JT Eaton Bait Block Rodenticide</strong>
, offer a balance between cost and effectiveness, providing a large quantity of bait for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness involves assessing the price per ounce of bait, the longevity of the product, and the number of doses required to eliminate the infestation. Products that offer a good balance between price and performance are ideal for those on a budget.</p>

<p>Advion Hot New Syngenta is highly effective due to its active ingredient, Indoxacarb. When roaches ingest Indoxacarb, they return to their nest and regurgitate, spreading the poison and causing a secondary kill effect.</p>

<p>Avoid using it alongside instant kill products, as it relies on progressive deaths to ensure the entire colony is affected. For maximum impact, combining it with boric acid can yield
comprehensive control
over roach infestations.

<h2 id="factors-to-consider-for-best-roach-killer"><strong>Factors To Consider for Best Roach Killer�</strong></h2>
<p>I have already reviewed the best cockroach killers in the market. But theres one more thing! Lets look at some of the considerations you should bear in mind before you go shopping for cockroach pesticides.</p>
<h3 id="strength"><strong>Strength</strong></h3>
<p>Usually, the strength of cockroach killers depends on the form in which it takes.
While some pesticides last for a few weeks, others may last up to a year. Traps last longer than sprays, while sprays last longer than powders.</p>
<h3 id="targeted-pests-">**Targeted Pests **</h3>
<p>Not all pesticides are formulated for cockroaches. So when buying pest killers, choose the ones that are meant to attract and kill cockroaches.
Even better, choose pesticides that are formulated to eliminate other pests in addition to cockroaches.</p>
<h3 id="usage-">**Usage **</h3>
<p>Normally, most cockroach pesticides are formulated for both indoors and outdoors. If your pesticides are targeted in areas that serve food, a lot of care should be taken not to poison the foot.
Where possible, buy pesticides whose ingredients are food-grade. Besides, follow the directions carefully.</p>
<h3 id="count"><strong>Count</strong></h3>
<p>Just as cockroach infestations come in different extents, so do pesticide quantities. The counts are other depending on the nature of the product.
Typically pesticides are available in tubes, liters, dozens, etc. So, depending on the extent of your roach infestation, you need to know how much you require.
For example, you may talk of 3 tubes of gel, two dozen bait traps, 5 liters of spray, etc.</p>
<h3 id="pets-and-kids-safe"><strong>Pets and kids Safe</strong></h3>
<p>Kids and pets will be curious whenever they see something new in the house. Therefore cockroach killers can be very dangerous when not used properly.
Its however, advisable to buy roach killers that do not pose a lot of danger to kids and pets. Follow the directions of any pesticide carefully to ascertain the threats.</p>
<h3 id="dimensions-">**Dimensions **</h3>
<p>When dealing with cockroach traps, the size of the trap matters a lot.�Small-sized traps are better because they dont look clumsy around the area or along walking paths. For gels and sprays, size does not matter.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>You dont have to live with cockroaches anymore! Its not the right time to call a professional exterminator, either. With the right kind of pesticide, you can say goodbye to roaches and other small pests in your house.
The products in this review are all best-selling remedies for cockroach infestation. Among these products, Bengal Gold Roach Spray turns out to be the best. Its handy and affordable.</p>

) indoxacarb, causing a secondary kill effect on roaches like
American and German cockroaches
.</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains carboxylate, which is super lethal to roaches but safe forpets.</li>
<li>So,plunge the gel from syringes onto basements, cabinets, baseboards, and kitchen countertops.
However, t
ake care if you&rsquo;re using the roach gel on planes and boats, including areas such as trashcans or baseboards.
Advion&rsquo;s active ingredients will change to new molecules inside the roaches bodies and thus wont harm other useful insects like ladybugs.</li>
<li>But Advion gel is great for outdoor and indoor applications, including holes or cracks.</li>
<li>The roach bait has a long residue effect.
Also, the syringe allows you to drop the roach bait into small crevices and cracks. Luckily, the secondary kill effect allows the roach bait to kill both the visible roaches and those in hiding.
The Good:</li>
<li>Long action range - 4 bait spots can attract roaches within 10 feet</li>
<li>Secondary kill effect (1 poisoned roach can infect over 35 others)</li>
<li>Safe for food handling areas and hospitals</li>
<li>Ease to apply compared to roach sprays
The Bad:</li>
<li>Can dry up when applied to surfaces with constant airflow</li>

Create a lethal roach barrier with this formula in areas such as garages, crawlspaces, door-frames, and windows.
However, this roach formula is poisonous, and thus, you must avoid spraying in areas frequented by pets or kids.
But use this roach formula in floor areas that wont be covered by carpets.
It has the non-staining capability; it&rsquo;s rain-resistant and has no odor in addition to being quick to
kill roaches and other insects such as spiders

Set the discrete Combat Roach
Bait Stations
in your house to act as a virtual shield.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ingredients are highly lethal to roaches and start killing roaches from day one for up to 12 months.
Do you experience regular infestation by small cockroaches? Well, shun the many insecticide cans and opt for a more discrete, effective, and compact solution  this
combat Max 12
.
This roach killer solution will be great if your home has a regular infestation of small cockroaches. With this trap, you wont have to keep many insecticides in the house.
Highlights: Ease of use, budget-friendly, highly effective for a long time, and discreet usage. But what is this trap really?
Its made up of black discs that a homeowner can place in concealed locations such as under the bed, behind your toilet, under the fridge, or in drawers or cabinets.</li>
<li>Every package comes with 18 bait stations that can last you even about a year controlling roaches in your house.
As noted in the bait station name, these roach killers will be active in
how to get rid of roaches in apartments naturally
for about 12 months.
Therefore, exterminators consider this roach bait to be one of the longest-lasting roach killing solutions available on the market today.
This bait station&rsquo;s key advantages are that its both durable and cheap, and thus consumers consider them as great value for their money.</li>
<li>I noted that after getting the bait stations to various house locations, I experienced a sudden reduction in the roach population.
The roaches will eat the Fipronil and transport them back to their nests, which will not kill just themselves but other roaches in the colony.
Since the roaches carry the insecticide to their nests, this bait station will help kill even the cockroaches you cant see and cant reach with spraying.
One of a few of the roaches will feed on the bait station and spread the love to their counterparts who were left at home in areas like under huge appliances or sinks.</li>
<li>Therefore, to kill a large roach population in your apartment, this Combat Max 12-Month is our top recommendation.
But,
<a href="https://www.entm.purdue.edu/ants/pubs/18.pdf">Indoxacarb</a>
and Imidacloprid are great ingredients as they&rsquo;ll trigger a secondary killing.

Therefore, itll be a great alternative to using pesticides or poisons in roach killers. Itll be functional for roughly 2-4 months.
The adhesive has some attractants for the cockroaches. However, avoid keeping the trap in areas with dirt and dust as it might cover the syrupy bait, which will significantly reduce its effectiveness.</li>
<li>Some roach exterminators noted that this roach trap is highly effective for all roach types and sizes.</li>
<li>But, you might still require to employ contact roach killers such as those with Raid Ant &amp; Roach Spray.
I noted that this Roach Motel 61009 roach bait would work for kitchen areas (like cabinets or cupboards) and food areas because it has no poisons.
However, keep pets and children away from this bait as they might be unable to remove themselves from the sticky setup.
This Black Flag Roach Motel 61009 will clean a roach infestation and wont leave carcasses spread all over the house like the roach sprays.
As noted above, the roach trap employs a sticky and sweetly smelling formula that will attract the roaches to the created cardboard box.

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-shark-vacuum-for-pet-hair"><strong>How to Choose the Best Shark Vacuum for Pet Hair</strong></h2>
<p>Although shark is a leader in manufacturing vacuum cleaners, their certain features you should look for before buying a vacuum for pet hair. Here are the most important considerations.
<strong>1. Performance</strong>
The performance of your vacuum cleaner determines how efficiently it can pick up and suck debris from various surfaces.
Thus, your device of choice should be able to pick pet hair and other debris and suck them into the canister without leaving any spills.
Typically, a device with 99.9 % suction ability will ensure that your floor or carpet is free from debris.
Also, consider the performance of the device on different surfaces. While some devices are useful on hard floors, they may not perform very well on carpets.
So, it is advisable to go for tools that work effectively on both carpets and hard floors.
<strong>2. Attachments</strong>
Pet hair can be scattered anywhere in the house apart from the floor and carpet. You find pet hair on your couches, bedding, and other furniture.
So, you need a versatile device with attachments that allow you to vacuum various areas of your house. For example, consider
bed bug steamers
.
Most market devices come with various brush attachments that enable users to remove pet hair for upholstery, baseboards, and other tight spaces.
Depending on your preferences, you can choose the one that fits the settings in your home.
<strong>Allergen Filters</strong>
Whenever you are vacuuming, pet hair and other microscopic particles get raised into the air.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, the suction should be powerful enough to collect as many of these particles as possible.</li>
<li>Also, the device should be equipped with HEPA filters to trap these particles.
This protects the user from possible allergic reactions to these particles. The advantage of HEPA filters is that they can be washed and reused.
<strong>Cord Length</strong>
The length of the power cord determines how far you can go on with your cleaning job before changing the power plug.</li>
<li>Its a hassle having to stop and change the plug.</li>
<li>Therefore, its advisable to go for long power cords to give you convenience and less hassle when vacuuming your house.
Most of the sharks devices have cords stretching up to 30 feet. This is quite convenient for vacuuming a house with several rooms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Having gone through this review and guide, I hope youre now equipped with adequate information regarding pet hair vacuum cleaners.
Getting one of these devices will keep your house free from pet fur and eliminate instances of allergies or respiratory complications.</p>

      <description>When choosing the</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the
<strong>best shower drain cleaner</strong>
, you can consider factors like effectiveness,
safety
, ease of use, and environmental impact. Selecting the right product will help prevent costly plumbing repairs and keep your <a href="/posts/how-drain-cleaners-work/">drains</a> flowing smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1effectiveness">1.<strong>Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0182VBOJE/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Green Gobbler</strong></a>
, are known for their powerful formulas that quickly break down hair, soap scum, and grease.
Effectiveness is key when choosing a cleaner, as it directly impacts how quickly and thoroughly the drain becomes unclogged. Look for products specifically designed to target your type of clog, whether its due to hair or grease build-up.</p>
<h3 id="2safety-for-pipes-and-septic-systems">2.<strong>Safety for Pipes and Septic Systems</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TS2R1A/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Drano Max Gel Clog Remover</strong></a>
, are formulated to be tough on clogs but gentle on pipes. Using harsh chemicals can damage your plumbing over time, so its important to choose a drain cleaner that is safe for all types of pipes, including PVC and metal.
For homes with septic systems, opt for septic-safe products to avoid disrupting the balance of bacteria essential for the systems function.</p>
<h3 id="3environmental-impact">3.<strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Environmentally friendly options, like
<strong>Biokleen Bac-Out Drain Care Gel</strong>
, offer effective cleaning power without harmful chemicals.
These products use natural enzymes or bacteria to break down organic material in the drain, which is better for the environment and safer for your home. If reducing your ecological footprint is a priority, check for biodegradable and non-toxic labels.</p>
<h3 id="4ease-of-use">4.<strong>Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Liquid-Plumr Pro-Strength Full Clog Destroyer</strong>
, are designed to be user-friendly, requiring no special tools or complicated instructions.
The ease of application can make a significant difference, especially if youre dealing with a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner/">stubborn clog</a>
and need a quick fix. Most gel formulas are easy to pour directly into the drain without any mess.</p>
<h3 id="5speed-of-action">5.<strong>Speed of Action</strong></h3>
<p>Some cleaners, such as
<strong>CLR Power Plumber</strong>
, work within minutes, while others might need to sit in the drain for a longer period to achieve full effectiveness. Fast-acting solutions are ideal for emergencies when you need to restore water flow quickly. However, slower-acting solutions can be more thorough and may prevent future clogs from building up again soon.</p>

<h2 id="buyers-guidebest-snake-repellent-for-yard">Buyer&rsquo;s Guide:�Best Snake Repellent for Yard</h2>
<h3 id="1-tips-for-repelling-snakes">1. Tips for Repelling Snakes</h3>
<p>Though the products mentioned above work to repel snakes and keep them from invading your yard for some time, there are directions to be followed.</p>
<p>To get started, you have to ensure that you cut grass and clear the clutter. That way, you will have an easy time targeting the areas used by snakes to find their way into your house.</p>
<p>You should check the label of products and follow the directions provided by the manufacturing company. You will learn that some of them require a lot of water, while some come application-ready.</p>
<p>Since some repellents might contain harmful chemicals, make sure to put on protective garments while applying them.</p>
<h3 id="2-does-lime-keep-snakes-away">2. Does Lime Keep Snakes Away?</h3>
<p>Many have been taught to use lime to keep snakes off their turf. However, there is no scientific proof to back this claim.</p>
<p>You might have been told that by putting lime around your property, you will prevent snakes from entering your compound.�Though this might sound a great idea, lime does nothing to prevent snakes from entering your home.</p>
<p>Also, you need to understand that instead, lime is a substance that can be dangerous to your loved ones and pets. It has been reported that lime causes severe skin burn, which is why you should avoid it.</p>
<h3 id="3-does-salt-keep-snakes-away">3. Does salt keep snakes away?</h3>
<p>Many studies have been conducted to confirm whether salt could be used to keep snakes away from home. It is accurate to state that nothing has been found to work.</p>
<p>Instead, the products that contain salt are formulated with other chemicals that might harm your health.�It is essential to consider using methods that have been studied and proven to work.</p>
<p>If anything, snakes do not feed on salt, which is why you cant feed them salt to kill them. Also, salt does not dehydrate snakes, so they will just walk through it and invade your home.</p>
<p>If your property is snake-infested, consider using any of the methods mentioned on this list, and you will be safe.</p>
<h3 id="4-do-mothballs-repel-snakes">4. Do Mothballs repel snakes?</h3>
<p>There is no way you can use mothballs to repel snakes. There is nothing special about mothballs that can make them keep snakes from invading your property.</p>
<p>You need to know that mothballs are a kind of poison and might cause severe damage to your red blood cells. Therefore, you should not even think about using them to control snakes in your home. Worse still, mothballs are known to cause liver failure.</p>
<p>Instead, if you apply mothballs in your garden, you will not do any harm to snakes, but end up poisoning the land. Snakes are dangerous animals, and if you are going to control them, you should use a reliable method.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many types of snake repellents on the market. As a potential buyer, you need to check that a given repellent has effective ingredients that will not harm you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>The other things to look for include price, and ease-of-use. Look for reliable dealers who are known to supply genuine products so that you get value for your money.</p>

Snake Repellents -
Encountering a snake in your home can be a traumatizing experience. Plus, they pose a great danger to your family and your pets and should, therefore, be kept as far away as possible.
Some repellents could have toxic chemicals such as malignant and carcinogens Naphthalene, as outlined by the
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/naphthalene.pdf">EPA</a>
that produces phthalic anhydride. These are the four best snake

What&rsquo;s a Snake Repellent? -
A�Snake repellent is either a
<a href="http://www.wildlifeanimalcontrol.com/homemade-snake.html">natural</a>
, chemical-based (naphthalene) or sonic product created to stop snakes from getting in
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/pest/snake.html">spaces such as yards or houses</a>
. Most of them will contain a repellent ingredient, an adjuvant, and an inert carrier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eugenol,�clove oil, and�cinnamon oil are also great natural snake repellents if sprayed directly on the snakes. Historically,<em>Styrax</em>trees&rsquo; resin was burned for the same purpose of chasing off�poisonous snakes.</li>
<li>What Is in a snake repellent? -The active ingredients in most�chemical-based snake repellents are either (1)<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top">Naphthalene</a>, (2) Sulfur, or (3) both. Naphthalene is also the ingredient in the good old mothballs that&rsquo;ll irritate the snakes&rsquo; receptors.
Naphthalene is a chemical that has an unpleasant smell for snakes and will damage the reptile&rsquo;s retinal system and nerves. It&rsquo;s mainly extracted from the walnut trees (the black type). Natural best snake repellents are
created from�essential oils
like clove, peppermint, castor, and cinnamon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-dr-t"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042XAOJI/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Dr. T&rsquo;s 28 lb. Snake-A-Way Snake Repelling Granules</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0042XAOJI&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Dr.Ts Snake Repellent granule is an EPA-registered granular snake repellent that effectively repels both poisonous and non-poisonous snakes from your home.
This formula contains a powerful combination of 28 percent Sulfur and 7 percent
<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top">Naphthalene</a>
, which creates an unpleasant odor.
When poured around the garden or yard, any snake that attempts to go near the granule is repelled by the pungent smell. By disrupting the snakes sensory reception, the snake slithers away in search of fresh air.
The odor lasts for about 2-3 months, after which you can reapply when it becomes faint. Dr.Ts Nature Snake Repellent is an affordable solution for homeowners dealing with a serious snake infestation. It comes in a 4.3 pounds container.
And given that it has a 91 percent repellency for garter and rattlesnakes, it wont disappoint you in the fight against these dangerous reptiles. See these

The Dr.T Snake
Repellent Hose End Spray
provides an easy yet effective way to eliminate snakes without harming them.
According to the manufacturer, this�best snake repellent can offer protection up to 500 sq ft. This will help you deter snakes from accessing areas around your house, flowerbed, garden, garage, cabin, barns, and more.
The product contains a powerful blend of ingredients that temporarily disrupts the reptiles sensory receptors, making it hard for it to smell its prey. The reaction causes it to slither away from your home in search of fresh air.
To use it, attach a garden hose to the bottle (comes with a hose-end) and spray the solution all around your property. However, avoid applying the mixture direct on crops and plants intended for consumption.
Otherwise, when used correctly, its entirely safe for humans, pets, and plants. Its also very affordable. The only disadvantage is that you have to reapply the solution after heavy rains for continued effectiveness.</p>

It&rsquo;ll easily repel the snakes that roam around your house or the fenced area for about 3 months.
But, a notable limitation of this snake repellent is that, compared to the granules repellents, it&rsquo;ll evaporate at a faster rate since it&rsquo;s a liquid. Luckily, it leaves no mess, it&rsquo;s easy to apply, and will snake treat a large lawn area effectively.

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B07P73PNVJ&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Unlike all the snake repellents weve reviewed, the VENSMILE Solar-Powered snake repellent does not use chemicals. Instead, it uses electric shock to scare/repel moles, snakes, and gophers away.
The snake repellent comes in the form of spikes that are strategically placed in targeted areas. The spikes are continuously charged by the built-in solar panels to produce enough electric shock to scare away snakes.
When charged for about 4 hours, the spikes can last for five days. The best snake repellent is waterproof, easy to use, and long-lasting.
The spikes work by emitting penetrating vibration pulses when placed on the ground. Every 55 seconds, the spikes produce powerful vibrations and flashing red light, which irritates the pests, causing them to run off.
Even better, the spikes provide extensive shock coverage and operate in a circular pattern, usually about 100 ft in diameter. This means that for a 1-acre piece of land, youll need to use at least 6 VenSmile spikes.</p>
<h2 id="chemical-snake-repellents">Chemical Snake Repellents</h2>
<p><strong>1. Mothballs</strong>
-�Mothballs are generally accepted by homeowners for repelling snakes. However, their effectiveness has been proven to be higher in repelling�silverfish and�moths compared to snakes. In addition to being less effective against snakes,�Mothballs also contain�neurotoxins that can be toxic to kids and pets.
<strong>2. Sulphur�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If used alone (even in the powdered form), sulfur is highly ineffective in repelling snakes. However, sulfur will work great when combined with naphthalene. For instance, Snake-A-Way combines 7% naphthalene and 28% sulfur to control even rattle and garter snakes.
The chemical snake repellents are created to produce a pungent smell that will be harsh on the snakes. The snakes&rsquo; mouthparts (
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/26/4/433/266106">vomeronasal organs</a>
), as opposed to their nose or nostrils, will sense the smell of the odor particles that the reptile picks up with its tongues.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>What about sonic repellents? Well, these types of snake repellents will produce sounds with a frequency that only the snakes will detect (and not human beings).
The key to note is that the unique frequency sound is both irritating and unpleasant to the snakes, and thus, the reptiles will move away from that area.</p>

<li>**&ldquo;Your House Is Theirs&rdquo; Principle:**Spiders often establish their territory within your home, creating webs and laying eggs. This behavior makes them difficult to eliminate entirely.</li>

live in inaccessible places
, Spectricide will not disappoint you. Its foam spreads easily to eliminate ground-nesting bees and yellow jackets.
It is designed with a detachable extension tube to precisely attack the yellow jackets in their underground hideouts.
This auxiliary feature makes it highly effective in knocking out a huge colony of wasps with minimal spray.</p>

Besides, Spectricide works like a foam due to its ability to spread to crevices where some of the wasps hide. Whats more, this is a valuable asset that will relieve you from the havoc wreaked by wasps.

      <title>Best Steam Cleaner for Fleas</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/best-steam-cleaner-for-fleas/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/best-steam-cleaner-for-fleas/</guid>
      <description>When choosing the</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the
<strong>best steam cleaner for <a href="/posts/best-cordless-vacuum-for-pet-hair/">fleas</a></strong>
, you need to consider factors like heat output, tank size, pressure, and versatility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas are resilient pests, and a good steam cleaner will help eliminate them at every stage of their lifecyclefrom adult fleas to their eggs and larvae.
Below, well break down the most important factors to consider when choosing a steam cleaner and provide recommendations to help you make an informed buying decision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-temperature-and-heat-output">1. Temperature and Heat Output</h3>
<p>The effectiveness of a steam cleaner in eliminating fleas is closely tied to its temperature.
<strong>High heat</strong>
is crucial because fleas, especially their eggs and larvae, are resistant to lower temperatures. A steam cleaner that produces steam at over 200F is ideal.</p>
<p>For instance, the
<strong>Dupray Neat Steam Cleaner</strong>
generates steam up to 275F, ensuring it not only kills adult fleas but also penetrates and destroys flea eggs, preventing reinfestation. Lower-temperature steamers may not have the same effect on eggs, which could lead to recurring flea issues.</p>
<h3 id="2-versatility-and-attachments">2. Versatility and Attachments</h3>
<p>The ability to clean various surfaces is another critical factor. Fleas can hide in carpets, upholstery, and even hard floors, so a steam cleaner with multiple attachments is a must. The more versatile the machine, the better it will be at reaching every nook and cranny in your home.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DF0RB/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>McCulloch-MC1275 Flea Steamer</strong></a>
stands out in this area with its 18 attachments, including scrub pads, brass brushes, and a floor mop attachment. This makes it perfect for deep-cleaning carpets and furniture where fleas often nest.</p>
<h3 id="3-tank-capacity-and-continuous-use">3. Tank Capacity and Continuous Use</h3>
<p>When dealing with fleas, especially in larger areas, tank capacity becomes a key factor. A larger tank means longer cleaning sessions without the need for frequent refills. This allows for a more efficient cleaning process and better results in eradicating fleas.</p>
<p>For example, the
<strong>Dupray Neat Steam Cleaner</strong>
boasts a large 54-ounce water tank, providing up to 50 minutes of continuous cleaning. On the other hand, the
<strong>PurSteam Handheld Pressurized Steam Cleaner</strong>
has a smaller tank of 8 ounces, which limits continuous use but is great for quick, targeted cleaning tasks.</p>
<h3 id="4-steam-pressure">4. Steam Pressure</h3>
<p>High-pressure steam helps to deeply penetrate into carpets, rugs, and upholsteryareas where fleas like to hide. Its important to choose a steam cleaner that offers strong steam pressure to dislodge fleas and their eggs from deep within fabric fibers.</p>
<p>The
<strong>Wagner Spraytech 0282014 HomeRight SteamMachine Elite</strong>
offers strong steam pressure that ensures deep penetration, making it effective for heavily infested areas. This model is particularly useful for reaching hidden areas where fleas could be thriving.</p>
<h3 id="5-portability-and-ease-of-use">5. Portability and Ease of Use</h3>
<p>If you plan to steam clean multiple rooms or areas of your home, portability becomes a key consideration. Some steam cleaners are heavy and bulky, while others are designed to be lightweight and easy to maneuver. The portability of a steam cleaner impacts how easily you can clean areas like stairs, upholstery, or even vehicles.</p>
<p>The
<strong>PurSteam Handheld Pressurized Steam Cleaner</strong>
is lightweight and portable, making it ideal for quick jobs or smaller areas. For larger spaces, a more powerful but still maneuverable option like the
<strong>Bissell PowerFresh Lift-Off Pet Steam Mop</strong>
may be a better choice.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best substrate for <a href="/posts/best-cages-for-bearded-dragons/">bearded</a> dragons, you can consider things like safety, ease of cleaning, and the natural feel that mimics their
environment
.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-safety-">**1. Safety **</h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Reptile Carpet such as�Zoo Med Eco Cage</strong>
, are designed to minimize the risk of impaction, a common concern with loose substrates.</p>
<p>Reptile Carpet is a non-loose <a href="/posts/best-substrate-for-leopard-gecko/">substrate</a> that provides a solid surface, reducing the chance of your bearded dragon
ingesting harmful particles
. However, it may require frequent cleaning and replacement to maintain hygiene.</p>
<h3 id="2-ease-of-cleaning"><strong>2. Ease of Cleaning</strong></h3>
<p>Some substrates, like
<strong>Tiles</strong>
(e.g.
<strong>SunGrow, Reptile Mat,</strong>
slate or ceramic tiles), are incredibly easy to clean. Tiles are non-absorbent and can be easily wiped down or removed for thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>Additionally, they help in keeping your bearded dragon&rsquo;s claws trimmed. However, they might lack the natural feel of loose substrates.</p>
<h3 id="3-natural-feel"><strong>3. Natural Feel</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Play Sand</strong>
, provide a more natural feel that closely mimics the desert environment of bearded dragons. Play Sand is loose and allows for natural digging behavior, which is beneficial for the mental stimulation of your pet.</p>
<p>However, it can pose a risk of impaction if ingested and may require regular monitoring and cleaning to avoid bacterial growth.</p>
<h3 id="4-temperature-regulation"><strong>4. Temperature Regulation</strong></h3>
<p>Some substrates, like
<strong>Coconut Fiber</strong>
(e.g., Eco Earth), offer good insulation and help maintain humidity levels within the enclosure. Coconut Fiber retains moisture well, which can be beneficial in dry climates.</p>
<p>However, it may not be ideal for desert-dwelling reptiles like bearded dragons, who require lower humidity levels.</p>
<h3 id="5-cost-effectiveness"><strong>5. Cost-Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>Some substrates, like
<strong>Paper Towels</strong>
, are highly cost-effective. Paper Towels are inexpensive, easy to replace, and do not pose a risk of impaction.</p>
<p>However, they do not provide a natural appearance and may require frequent changes to maintain cleanliness.</p>

<p>When searching for the best termite bait station, therere certain factors that you should consider in order to get the best value for your money. These include:</p>
<h3 id="area-to-cover"><strong>Area to Cover</strong></h3>
<p>The area to be covered determines the number of bait stations required for effective termite control.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the different bait station brands come with directions for use including the distance between each station.</li>
<li>The distance between each bait station depends on its effectiveness and the extent of the infestation.
So, once you have settled on a brand, consider the area to be covered so that you can buy adequate bait stations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extent-of-infestation"><strong>Extent of Infestation</strong></h3>
<p>The level of termite infestation determines whether bait stations are enough to control the termites, or you need to combine with other remedies.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the infestation has already gone out of hand, youll have to use bait stations together with other effective products such as liquid insecticides.</li>
<li>The extent of infestation also determines the number of bait stations needed to achieve better termite control.
If youre dealing with a large infestation, youll have to place your baits closer to one another for more effectiveness. Thus, youll require more baits than when you have a small infestation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The former only detect the presence of termites, but it gives you the freedom to use any other termite poison to kill them.
The latter gives you convenience because you replace the detection cartridge with the bait cartridge once termite activity is detected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safety"><strong>Safety</strong></h3>
<p>Another factor to consider is the type of ingredient utilized in the bait cartridge of your bait station.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the ingredients contained in some products may be toxic to the soil or vegetation.</li>
<li>To have a piece of mind, get a product that does not harm your property.

</ul>
<h3 id="type-of-termites"><strong>Type of Termites</strong></h3>
<p>Not all bait stations will work effectively on all termite species. Therefore, its advisable to know the type of termites you have to get the most effective bait station. You can get a professional pest exterminator to help in identification.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-installing-termite-bait-stations"><strong>Tips for Installing Termite Bait Stations</strong></h2>
<p>If this is your first encounter with a termite bait station, you might need some guidance on how to get the best results from your product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, most of the products come with instruction manuals/booklets for easy installation.</li>
<li>These are general<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-prevention/">tips that apply to most types of termite</a>bait stations. They include:
<strong>Mapping Out the Affected Area</strong>
The installation of bait stations needs to be done accurately to cover the exact areas that have been infested. Mapping out the exact areas to be treated enhances your accuracy and estimates the number of stations to be used.
Start your mapping at least 3 to 4 feet from the foundations of buildings or fences.</li>
<li>The distance between each bait station should be between 8 and 12 feet depending on the brand and the infestation extent.</li>
<li>For more accurate mapping, you can sketch the affected areas showing the bait station locations.
Make sure the locations do not coincide with the roof drip lines. This will prevent water from getting into the bait station, affecting results, or damage the cartridges.
<strong>Drilling Holes</strong>
Bait stations come in different sizes. Holes should be dug to fit the size and design of the bait station.
Some products come with an auger to facilitate easy digging. If your chosen brand does not have a digging tool, you can buy one separately or use your garden shovel.
Make your holes deeper than the bait station&rsquo;s length to prevent damage to the cartridges by groundwater.
<strong>Inserting the Bait Station</strong>
Once the holes are ready, insert the bait stations and compact them with soil to ensure they are firm.
Also, ensure that the top part is level with the ground to avoid interference by your pets or lawnmower.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring"><strong>Monitoring</strong></h3>
<p>Bait stations require regular monitoring to maintain their performance to an optimal level.
Monitoring for termite activity should be done at least once after every 30 days.
If termites are detected, the monitoring cartridge should be replaced with the cartridge containing the poison.
Monitoring also entails checking the soil moisture content to ensure your bait cartridge is not damaged. Replace bait cartridges in case of damage or when it has been completely eaten out.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Termite control
using liquid insecticides requires a lot of digging, which may cause considerable property damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, bait stations are easy to install and only require holes for installation. Thus, you dont risk destroying your property.</li>
<li>When installed correctly, bait stations prove to be very effective methods of eliminating termites.
Get yourself one of these bait stations to help you eradicate termites from your home.</li>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-terrariums-for-snakes"><strong>How to Choose the Best Terrariums for Snakes</strong></h2>
<p>A pet snake wont serve its purpose if it is not housed properly. A good terrarium should not only give you a good display of your pet but also provide a comfortable environment for the reptile.
In this guide, Ill take you through some important factors to consider when searching for the right enclosure for your snake.
<strong>The Size of the Terrarium</strong>
Snake pets come in different sizes and species. Some species are more active than others, meaning they exhibit a lot of movement inside a cage. Therefore, when selecting a cage, consider the length of your snake and its activity level.
You can choose a cage that is at least  of the snakes length. However, these criteria may not apply when you add too many accessories to enhance the cage&rsquo;s beauty. In this case, you should consider a cage that is longer than the snake.
<strong>Ventilation</strong>
Just like humans, snakes need to breathe correctly for their survival. Therefore, a good snake cage should allow air to get in and out. Most of the cages have meshed screens on their top for ventilation and lighting.
Some have additional vents on their sides and near the door to increase airflow in and out of the cage.
<strong>Heating and Lighting</strong>
Snakes thrive well when provided with an environment that mimics their natural habitat. Right temperature and lighting are essential parameters for the survival and comfort of your snake.
Therefore, ensure that the cage comes with a means for heating and lighting. You might need a thermometer to monitor the temperature in the cage to maintain the optimum temperature.
<strong>Security</strong>
You cant risk losing your adorable pet. Its both painful and a waste of money. So, you should ensure you get a secure terrarium with no possible escape routes for your pet. If the snake gets out of the cage, it may run into the bush, get trampled on the floor, or get
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">killed by your dog</a>
or cat.
It also ensures that your cage comes with a reliable lock to prevent your kid&rsquo;s or pets&rsquo; accidental opening.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Like other pets, snake pets should be taken care of to have a quality life. And apart from diet, they require an excellent terrarium that blends their natural habitat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your typical terrarium will essentially be determined by your budget and the size of the snake.</li>
<li>Other factors to consider include ventilation, security, and the ability to regulate temperature and humidity.</li>

<h2 id="considerations-for-the-best-toilet-paper-for-septic">Considerations for the Best Toilet Paper for Septic</h2>
<p><strong>1. Breaking Ability and Ease to Dissolve.</strong>
Ensure you select a toilet paper that can break rapidly into small pieces after use.</p>
<ul>
<li>This makes it easier to be carried by flush water without blocking the septic system.</li>
<li>Besides, the broken pieces shoulddissolve easily in flush water from a liquidmixture.
It is difficult to flush undissolved toilet paper. Moreover, these fibrous tissues will require extra Flush water to push them forward.
<strong>2. Anti-clog type.</strong>
Check if the toilet paper you intend to buy whether has anti-clog a property. Most low-quality tissue papers clog the toilet, sewer, and septic system affecting the entire network.
What happens is that the broken tissue paper stick on the inner lining of the sewer pipes and septic, thus narrowing the passage.
The flush water cannot wash away these clogs since they form a hard substance that requires higher force (the ingredients for which these low-quality toilet papers are made from propagating the stick ability).
<strong>3. The Biodegradable ability.</strong>
Any tissue should be biodegradable. This means that it should be in a position to be decomposed by
bacteria found in the septic
or sewer system at ease.</li>
<li>This is very important as it will avoid pollution and the high accumulation of used toilet paper in the septic tank.
Removal of undigested used toilet paper waste from the septic system is costly and time-consuming.
Ensure you confirm the biodegradable label before purchasing any toilet paper brand.
<strong>4. The Eco-friendly�</strong>
The climate and environmental organizations encourage the use of products that do not pollute the environment during and after use.
Toilet papers, when dropped in the background, should naturally decompose and cause minimal pollution.</li>
<li>You should avoid purchasing tissue papers that take longer to decompose.
The pulp used for toilet paper should be sourced from well-managed forests but not from recycled materials. Do your background study of any tissue paper producing company well before buying their product.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dont-flush-down-septic-systems-why">Don&rsquo;t Flush Down Septic Systems? Why?</h2>
<p>You can achieve this by avoiding flushing some of these things:
<strong>1. Clothes and Sanitary towels.</strong>
Usually, clothes do not decompose in septic tanks quickly. Though they may be of small size, their accumulation in the septic tank is disastrous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most sanitary towels do not decompose swiftly.Some of them are large and make it difficult to flow in sewer lines.
Together with clothes, sanitary towels mostly block the septic and sewer system leading to unnecessary maintenance costs.
<strong>2. Plastics and Nylon products�</strong>
Avoid flushing plastic and nylon products such as papers, condoms, pampers, and wrappers since they block the septic and sewer system and accumulate in the septic tank.
It would be vital if you can make a notice at your home to warn users against flushing such substances.
<strong>3. Chemicals</strong>
Don&rsquo;t wash/clean your septic and sewer system with chemicals (Sodium Hydroxide, Lye, caustic soda) that may be found in your houses, such as
dish soap
, drain cleaners, and powder cleaners.</li>
<li>Most of them contain substances that form foam in the septic tank.
Avoid oily waste flush into your septic as it sticks on the inner wall causing a thick layer, which accumulates, thus narrowing the system network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The right selection of toilet paper is key for the safety of your septic system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for biodegradable, eco-friendly, chemical-free, rapid braking, and more comfortable dissolving properties when purchasing the best toilet paper for your septic.
Avoid flushing plastic, nylon, and non-biodegradable products in your septic as a proper way of maintaining your septic and sewer system.</li>

<p>When you browse through the internet, youll find myriads of ultrasonic pest repellers. Although, all of them utilize the ultrasonic sound technology, they have varying degrees of effectiveness. So, before you make a decision to purchase one, here are a few factors to consider.
<strong>1. Application Frequency</strong>
Pests have sensitive ears that make it possible to hear sounds of very high frequencies. However, some pests may not hear some sounds of certain frequencies. So, you should choose your device depending on the type of pests you have. Normally, the frequency range for most of the household pests is between 60 kHz to 80 kHz.
<strong>2. Area covered</strong>
A device that covers a larger area allows you to repel more pests with little costs. Most of the devices cover between 1000 and 2000 square feet. However, some like the Cleanrth CR008 cover up to 7000 square feet.�Therefore, you should choose your device depending on the area you want to cover.
<strong>3. Repeller Cost</strong>
Ultrasonic pest repellents come with varying costs depending on their quality and brand. Usually, prices range from 10$ to 100$. Cheaper devices cover small areas and will require replacement after a short duration.
Those that cover large areas and last longer come with a higher price tag. Some products come with packs of 2 to 5 items. Buying in packs helps you save on cost than when you buy single products. Further, consider the running costs of the repellent - which brings us to
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7918230/">solar energy repellers</a>
.
Some products also come with premium features making them cost higher than ordinary devices. The most common inclusion is the nightlight, which adds some light in places where they are plugged in.
**4. Durability and **
<strong>Safety</strong>
A device that works effectively and last longer will keep your house free from pests for a long time. Thus, you wont regularly spend on pest eradication tasks.
Although ultrasonic pest repellers are free from chemicals, they produce high-frequency sounds that may disturb your pets. So, ensure your repellers have been verified to be safe for pets such as dogs, cats, hamsters, among others - what about

.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Ultrasonic pest repellers provide a convenient and effective method for ejecting pests from your home. They are affordable, safe, and require little or no intervention for them to work. However, they wont provide a permanent solution to your pest infestation.
If youre dealing with a severe infestation or want a permanent solution, you can use UPRs alongside other pest remedies such as pesticides.</p>

Next up is this bObsweep PetHair Plus thats great for cleaning dog hair, mopping, filtering dirt particles, sweeping and general home vacuuming, and also cleaning hardwood flooring.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most effective flea vacuums combine several key features:�powerful suction to pull pests from deep fibers, HEPA filtration to trap microscopic eggs, sealed containment systems to prevent escape, and specialized brush rolls that agitate surfaces to dislodge
embedded pests-in-the-winter/)
.</p>
<p>Regular vacuuming with the right machine can remove up to 30% of larvae and 60% of <a href="/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/">flea</a> eggs from carpets, significantly disrupting their life cycle.�We&rsquo;ve evaluated dozens of models based on these criteria to bring you the top 5 vacuums specifically designed to
combat flea infestations
.</p>
<h2 id="top-9-best-vacuums-for-fleas-in-2025">Top 9 Best Vacuums for Fleas in 2025</h2>
<h3 id="1-dyson-ball-animal-3-best-overall-flea-vacuum"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B75Q388N?tag=p-policy-20">1. Dyson Ball Animal 3 (Best Overall Flea Vacuum)</a></h3>
<p>The Dyson Ball Animal 3 stands as our top recommendation for complete flea eradication. Its�306 AW suction power�(air watts) creates enough force to pull fleas from deep within carpet fibers and upholstery.</p>
<p>The self-adjusting cleaner head automatically adapts its height to maintain optimal contact with different floor surfaces, from thick carpets to hardwoods, ensuring consistent flea removal across your entire home.</p>
<p>What truly sets this model apart is its�whole-machine HEPA filtration system. Unlike vacuums where only the final filter is HEPA-rated, the Dyson Ball Animal 3 maintains HEPA-standard filtration throughout the entire airflow path.</p>
<p>This captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns - including flea eggs that measure about 0.5 mm - preventing them from being recirculated into your home&rsquo;s air.</p>
<p>The tangle-free turbine tool is particularly effective at
removing flea eggs
from pet bedding and furniture with its counter-rotating brushes that prevent hair wrap while agitating surfaces.</p>

<p>The Shark Navigator Lift-Away NV356E offers remarkable flea-fighting capabilities at a more accessible price point. Its Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology creates a closed system that prevents fleas and their eggs from escaping back into your home.</p>
<p>When combined with the true HEPA filter, this system captures and contains 99.9% of dust and allergens down to 0.3 microns - including flea eggs and larvae.</p>
<p>The�Lift-Away feature�makes this vacuum exceptionally versatile for flea control. You can detach the pod from the main body to easily clean stairs, furniture, and other flea hotspots.</p>
<p>The�motorized brush roll�features stiff bristles that dig into carpet fibers to dislodge flea eggs, while the�swivel steering�allows you to maneuver around furniture legs and other obstacles where fleas often hide.</p>
<p>At just 14 pounds, it&rsquo;s significantly lighter than many upright models, making frequent vacuuming sessions less strenuous.</p>
<h3 id="3-miele-complete-c3-cat--dog-best-canister-vacuum-for-fleas"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R43I490?tag=p-policy-20">3. Miele Complete C3 Cat &amp; Dog (Best Canister Vacuum for Fleas)</a></h3>
<p>The Miele Complete C3 Cat &amp; Dog represents the pinnacle of canister vacuum technology for flea control. Its vortex-powered suction system generates exceptional airflow that pulls fleas from deep within carpets and upholstery.</p>
<p>The Active AirClean HEPA filter exceeds standard HEPA requirements, capturing 99.99% of particles down to 0.1 microns - small enough to trap even broken flea egg fragments and larval casings.</p>
<p>This model comes with the SEB-228 Electro Plus brush, which uses an electrically-driven beater bar that vibrates at high frequency to shake flea eggs loose from carpet fibers.</p>
<p>The AirClean Sealed System ensures no particles escape during operation or disposal - when you remove the bag, it automatically seals shut to contain the captured pests.�At just�64 decibels, it&rsquo;s quiet enough to use even when pets are present, reducing stress for noise-sensitive animals.</p>
<h3 id="4-bissell-2252-cleanview-swivel-upright-bagless-vacuum"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F6N3RT6?tag=p-policy-20">4. Bissell 2252 CleanView Swivel Upright Bagless Vacuum</a></h3>
<p>The Bissell CleanView Swivel Pet Vacuum offers excellent suction power and a tangle-free brush roll that helps remove pet hair and fleas from carpets and floors. Its swivel steering makes it easy to maneuver
around furniture and obstacles
.</p>
<p>With a specialized pet hair tool, this vacuum is ideal for cleaning areas where fleas are likely to be present. The washable filter is another eco-friendly feature that helps improve air quality by trapping dust, fleas, and other particles.</p>
<p>The Bissell CleanView is specifically designed for pet owners battling both hair and flea problems. Its tangle-free brush roll incorporates alternating rows of stiff and soft bristles that effectively remove flea eggs without becoming clogged with pet hair.</p>
<p>The scatter-free technology uses a combination of suction and brush design to prevent flea eggs from being kicked up into the air during vacuuming.</p>
<p>This model features a�HEPA filtration system�that traps flea allergens and a�Febreze odor-eliminating filter�to help control the musty smell that often accompanies flea infestations.</p>
<h3 id="5-irobot-roomba-j7-best-robotic-vacuum-for-flea-maintenance"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094NYHTMF?tag=p-policy-20">5. iRobot Roomba j7+ (Best Robotic Vacuum for Flea Maintenance)</a></h3>
<p>While robotic vacuums can&rsquo;t match the power of uprights for severe infestations, the iRobot Roomba j7+ excels at�maintenance cleaning between deep vacuuming sessions.</p>
<p>Its�high-efficiency filter�captures 99% of pollen, mold, and flea eggs, while the�dual rubber brushes�are designed to resist hair tangles while agitating surfaces to dislodge pests.</p>
<p>The�smart mapping technology�allows the Roomba to learn your home&rsquo;s layout and focus on flea hotspots like pet resting areas. Its�automatic dirt disposal�feature holds up to 60 days of debris in the clean base, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to handle potentially flea-infested dust bins.</p>
<p>The Pet Owner Official Promise guarantees replacement if the vacuum fails to avoid pet accidents - a valuable feature when dealing with stressed pets during flea treatment.</p>

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B07TC5BQL8&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
FMC Pyrethrin is a naturally blended wasp fogger that&rsquo;s specially manufactured for indoor use only.
The fluid is sufficiently pressurized (5oz) for smooth administration, while the canister is fitted with a classic spray nozzle that supports point fumigation.
With improved concentration, FMC Pyrethrin guarantees extended area coverage - you can spray up to 5000 cubic feet. More so, FMC is human and pet safe - it won&rsquo;t cause skin irritation or respiratory discomfort when inhaled.
The natural additives found in FMC Pyrethrin makes it ideal for use in areas such as hospital, warehouses, hotels, schools, garages, and homes without any adverse effects - it is environmentally friendly.
Indeed, FMC kills and prevents future re-infestation of wasps on single or double applications. The killing effectiveness left behind (by FMC Pyrethrin) prevents wasp&rsquo;s eggs from hatching, while the product&rsquo;s scent dies down in a couple of minutes.
The neuro-tech principle used in FMC Pyrethrin attacks the wasp&rsquo;s central nervous system instantly, thus killing the insect slowly without any violence - stinging or buzzing.
Although FMC Pyrethrin works best for indoors, it&rsquo;s not suitable for use in small closets or cabinets - high concentration may take longer to surge or fade.

Ortho Home Defense is a modern-tech wasp fogger that features a complex chemical regulator, which treats surface for up to 8 hours.
The simple solvent action formula that comes with Ortho breaks easily without straining the surface - it&rsquo;s more comfortable to clean.
Indeed, Ortho integrates a classic press activation mechanism that not only allows intermittent spray action but also supports point application - you can easily fog wasps right at their hideouts/nest.
By choosing to use Ortho Home, you will also kill other insects like gnats, flies, mites, mosquitoes, hornets, and bugs. Furthermore, you&rsquo;ll inhibit future wasp infestation as well.
Ortho Home guarantees instant killing action upon contact and comes with limited overflow - the dense fluid formulation keeps it stuck on the surface during the action.
With Ortho Home, you can also eliminate ornamental garden pests sufficiently - it remains active for up to 7 days. Remember, Ortho Home comes with extended use coverage - it&rsquo;s best for outdoor wasps elimination.
NB: Always leave the solvent to dry before settling in the treated section. If possible, wipe/mop the surface with warm water.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>looking for the best <a href="/posts/best-weed-killer-for-lawns/">weed</a> killer for flower beds?
<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/introduction-to-weeds-and-herbicides">Gardening or weeding</a>
is a time consuming and demanding hobby that not many can keep up with.</p>
<ul>
<li>From regularly watering and fertilizing plants to carrying out much more laborious and complex activities such as transplanting, thinning, and spraying insecticides, growing plants is notan easy job.
What makes it even harder are those pesky, recurring wild weeds that grow back no matter how much and how often you weed out your flowerbeds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-best-weed-killer-for-flower-beds">9 Best Weed Killer for Flower Beds</h2>
<h3 id="1-compare-n-save-41-glyphosate-concentrate-weed-and-grass-killer"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ARKS3XO/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Compare-N-Save 41% Glyphosate Concentrate Weed and Grass Killer</a></h3>
<p>The Compare-N-Save weed killer is a strong wild grass and weed terminator with its fast affecting components.</p>
<p>It is strong enough to rid your garden of almost all types of wild grasses and weeds, such as quack grass, chickweed, Bermuda grass, broadleaf weeds, bushes, purslane, spurge, nutsedge, crabgrass, among many others.</p>
<p>One of the best features of this weed-killing solution is that it kills the weeds and grass at their roots, saving gardeners the time and effort of having to apply it from the leaves down. This is possible because of the 41% glyphosate present in the solution, which gets absorbed by the weeds and grass, killing them at the roots.</p>
<p>Another great aspect of this solution is that it mixes very well with water; you can mix 3 tablespoons of this liquid in a gallon of water, and it will still be strong and efficient enough to kill the weeds that show up in your lawn.</p>
<p>One of the negative aspects of this liquid, however, is that it does not avert future weed growth. Therefore, it might be one of the best weed killers, but it isnt necessarily the ideal weed solution since it does not prevent further weed growth.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very affordable</li>
<li>Fast results</li>
<li>Does not wash off easily, which means that constant reapplication is not necessary
Cons:</li>
<li>Needs to be sprayed carefully</li>
<li>Is not pet-friendly</li>
<li>Only kills and does not prevent weed growth</li>
</ul>

<p>This solution, like the Preen Garden Weed Preventer discussed above, is more of a weed preventer than a weed killer.</p>
<p>The Preen extended control weed preventer prevents weed and wild grass seeds from germinating and averts their growth before they can even bud.</p>
<p>What makes it different from the Preen garden weed preventer is its easy-to-use bottle and flip cap, which make the application of the weed preventing solution a breeze.</p>
<p>Moreover, as soon as you are done
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-lawn-mower-for-large-yard/">de-weeding your garden</a>
, you can apply it by simply spraying it the targeted areas of your lawn. Their granular structures make them easy to apply and do not damage the soil, your plants, or any sowed flower seeds.</p>
<p>Another great feature of this product is that the Preen extended control weed preventer is the best solution for use in areas where transplanted and grown plants are present.</p>
<p>The product, like everything else, does have some downsides, too. For instance, many consumers complain that Preen only prevents the growth of any future weeds and grasses but does nothing to the preexisting weeds.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The easy to use jug-handled bottle with a handy flip-top lid makes the application and spraying process very easy</li>
<li>Advanced weed prevention solution</li>

<p>The Roundup Landscape Weed Preventer solution is rated as one of the best weed preventing liquids in the market by both experts as well as amateur gardeners.</p>
<p>It is effective for most commonly found wild grasses and weeds, and it has a very effective track record. The roundup landscape weed preventer works by creating a weed control barrier on the ground, which prevents weeds and grasses from sprouting for up to 6 months. Moreover, its easy application makes it even more popular among gardeners.</p>
<p>Many gardeners also prefer this weed preventer because of the convenience it offers them by way of its pre-fitted applicator. This applicator of the product helps provide complete coverage that protects all the treated plants and garden patches.</p>
<p>Moreover, the application procedure is also very easy, making gardening easier for beginners as well. All you need to do is apply this weed preventer on the soil in the affected area and water the treated area, thus activating the solution.</p>

<ul>
<li>Keeps weeds and wild grass growth under control</li>
<li>Comes with an easy-to-use applicator</li>
<li>Effective weed prevention</li>

.</p>
<p>Its fast results will have your garden rid of weeds within 12 to 24 hours since its first application, turning the weeds brown and killing them. However, it needs to be sprayed regularly since it washes away when the plants are washed and after rain spells.
Pros:</p>

<li>It is eco-friendly</li>
<li>It is highly effective and produces results within 12-24 hours</li>

<p>The Preen Garden Weed Preventer liquid focuses more on preventing wild weeds from growing rather than killing them.</p>
<p>Therefore, this product is more useful for people who have just weeded their gardens and lawns and want to prevent them from growing in the future, keeping their landscapes and gardens well maintained and weed-free.</p>
<p>This product is well received by gardeners for its easy application process and long-lasting effects, i.e., it is not easily washed off by rain or hose water.

<em>Best <a href="/posts/best-weed-killer-for-flower-beds/">Weed</a> Killer for Lawns</em>

<a href="https://weeds.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CS053-Lecture-9-Nonselective-herbicides-handout-BW.pdf">safety for your grass</a>
, ease of use, and environmental impact.</p>
<p>Each lawn has its unique needs, so selecting the right product is essential for maintaining a healthy and beautiful lawn.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<p><strong>1. Effectiveness Against Weeds</strong>
Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JIRKFVE/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Roundup for Lawns</strong></a>
, excel at killing a wide range of weeds, including tough ones like dandelions and crabgrass.</p>
<p>When considering effectiveness, look for a product that targets the specific weeds in your lawn - check
<a href="https://weedid.wisc.edu/weedid.php">weed ID tool</a>
. Products like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FDWXV60/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Ortho Weed B Gon</strong></a>
are particularly good at eliminating broadleaf weeds without harming your grass.
<strong>2. Safety for Grass</strong>
A crucial factor is ensuring the weed killer is selective, meaning it kills weeds without damaging your lawn.
<em>Scotts Turf Builder Weed and Feed</em>
is a good example, as it not only kills weeds but also nourishes your grass, promoting thicker and healthier growth.</p>
<p>Always check whether the product is safe for your specific type of grass.�Related:

<em>Spectracide Weed Stop for Lawns</em>

<h3 id="1-chemical-treatments"><strong>1. Chemical Treatments</strong></h3>
<p>Usually, insect sprays that don&rsquo;t contain chemicals as their active ingredients are regarded as the best remedies. The chemical treatments that you use indoors may not necessarily work effectively outdoors since the weather conditions are different.
You will also find that treatments that you use outdoors vary in their effectiveness.�Therefore chemical treatments work effectively when applied to their specific environments.
As an example, Methoprene won&rsquo;t be effective when used in direct sunlight, since UV rays usually break it down. It&rsquo;s, however, effective where there is shade. Therefore, when buying insect killers, make sure it is ideal for the specific outdoor conditions in your yard.
Also, look for chemical treatments that contain the most effective active ingredients in the market. Products that contain pyrethrin prove to very effective in destroying insects throughout their stages of the lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="2-non-chemical-treatments"><strong>2. Non-Chemical Treatments</strong></h3>
<p>There are many eco-friendly options to choose from if you are conscious about the environment. These are organic products that will help you eradicate ticks, fleas, and other insects while protecting your family, pets, and the environment.
Clove extract and peppermint are among the most popular natural ingredients inherent in organic insect sprays. Clove extract contains eugenol, a potent pesticide for eradicating ticks and fleas.
When you use organic products, you will be in an excellent position to repel other pesky insects like mosquitoes. The scent of some of these products is quite unbearable for mosquitoes.
Other available natural remedies include the use of beneficial nematodes, which are little worms-like bugs sold in spray cans. They release toxic substances capable of killing ticks and fleas. They don&rsquo;t pose any threat to humans or animals.

<p>To ensure the safety of your family, animals, and pets, it&rsquo;s advisable to buy organic insect treatments because they don&rsquo;t contain any toxic substances.
In case you prefer chemical treatments, go for products that are less dangerous to use around kids and pets.
Besides, opt for chemical treatments that dry quickly from the time of application. This makes the residues less dangerous to kids and pets. More importantly, follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions carefully and keep the products away from kids and pets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-turn_mower">zero turn mowers</a>
, you can consider things like cutting deck size, engine power, comfort features, and price.</p>
<p>These factors help determine which <a href="/posts/best-riding-lawn-mower-for-uneven-terrain/">mower</a> suits your specific lawn care needs, whether you&rsquo;re maintaining a small yard or managing a large property.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1cutting-deck-size">1.<strong>Cutting Deck Size</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like the
<strong>Husqvarna Z254 Hydrostatic</strong>
, offer a large 61-inch cutting deck, allowing you to cover more ground in less time.</p>
<p>The deck size is crucial because it determines how wide a swath the mower cuts in a single pass. A larger deck size is ideal for extensive lawns, while a smaller deck may be more maneuverable for tight spaces.</p>
<h3 id="2engine-power">2.<strong>Engine Power</strong></h3>
<p>Products like the
<strong>Ariens 25HP ZTR</strong>
feature a robust 25 HP Kohler engine, providing the strength to tackle tough grass and challenging terrain.</p>
<p>Engine power is essential for ensuring that the mower can handle the demands of your lawn, especially if it includes hills or dense grass. A more powerful engine also helps maintain consistent speed and cutting performance.</p>
<h3 id="3comfort-features">3.<strong>Comfort Features</strong></h3>
<p>The
<strong>Poulan Pro P46ZX</strong>
<strong>Briggs V-Twin</strong>
comes equipped with a comfortable high-back seat and easy-to-use controls, making it more comfortable during long mowing sessions.</p>

      <description>Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review? Dont we all hate the common challenge of the slow-moving drain in the kitchen or sink?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review? Dont we all hate the common challenge of the slow-moving drain in the kitchen or sink?
In this post, Ive reviewed the Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria, which is one of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners I recommend for your plumbing systems</a>
. I tested Bio-clean using Friskies cat food that contains 10 % fats, 30 % protein, and the others are mineral substances &amp; carbohydrates.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
You have to note that Bio-clean
Drain cleaner
is a bacteria/ enzyme formula that is eco-friendly. Luckily, itll tear down the clog/ gunk on the inner side of your
drain pipes
(both metal including copper and PVC pipes) but wont damage the pipes.</p>
<h2 id="bio-clean-drain-septic-bacteria-2-review">Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review</h2>
<p>Therefore, compared to other
drain cleaners that are either highly basic or highly acidic
, thus harming your piping system, this Bio-clean Drain cleaner has only enzymes and natural bacteria thatll break down the organic matter (the drain clog) thats blocking the plumbing system.</p>
<h3 id="safe-and-ease-of-application">Safe and Ease of application</h3>
<p>Youll require a single teaspoonful of the
drain cleaner and dump it into the clogged/)
<a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> or piping system. However, mix the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">drain cleaner powder with some hot water</a>
to activate the bacteria and enzymes&rsquo; working. Finally, pour your great water drain cleaner mixture directly into the clogged drain.</p>
<h3 id="the-slower-rate-of-action-4-6-hours-overnight-is-better">The slower rate of action: 4-6 hours (Overnight is better)</h3>
<p>Compared to the other drain cleaners such as
Pure Lye drain opener
,
Drano Max Gel Clog Remover
, or the
XIONLAB Safer Drain Opener
that required an allowance of 15-30 minutes to work on the drain clog fully, this Bio-clean Drain cleaner requires about 4-6 hours without flushing with either cold or hot water. This is mainly because The organic enzymes and bacteria have a slow rate of action compared to the basic, acidic or caustic cleaners.</p>
<h3 id="cost-effective-drain-cleaner">Cost-effective drain cleaner</h3>
<p>Bio-clean Drain cleaner is more very safe and cost-effective compared to other drain cleaners available in the market today  due to the en enzymatic mode of action. Bio-clean is highly economical.
It allows about 100 drain treatments per bottle. As noted above, youll only require just one tablespoon to treat your clogged drain. The natural bacteria tend to multiply fast after eating some organic matter in the plumbing system, giving you faster and cheap drain removal.
[amazon box=&ldquo;B001N09KN4&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]</p>
<h3 id="genetically-built-formula">Genetically built formula</h3>
<p>The genetically built formula will consume all the soap scum, oil, grease, hair, and cotton in your clogged drains. Its a unique formula that is a development from the advances in the recent decades biotechnology. The clog&rsquo;s enzymes act by digesting the foreign material in a way just like how humans digest food.
On the other hand, once mixed in water, the bio-clean digest the organic matter, tripling in number by the minute, and release mineral ash, carbon dioxide, and water. Further, the enzymes do not rely on gravity to act and will thus ill love throughout the clogged drain and eat away the organic matter.</p>
<h2 id="bio-clean-safe-for-pipes"><strong>Bio-Clean safe for pipes</strong>?</h2>
<p>I would say that Bio-clean, as they are just natural bacteria and enzymes, wont generate dangerous gases in their action. Bio-clean digests organic materials without heating or generation poisonous fumes.
The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner</a>
wont harm your pipes as it has not contained caustic, acidic, or alkaline formula. Further, it wont eat away any live tissue as hence its safe for yourself, your kids, or pets in addition to being eco-friendly.
Further, the products of its action are only mineral ash, water, and carbon dioxide. The mineral ash must not make you worry as it&rsquo;s safe and even helps aid plant development.</p>

.</p>
<ul>
<li>The nitenpyram ingredient falls under the group of neonicotinoids.
The oral tablet is effective and safe for killing fleas in large dogs.
However, the manufacturers caution that these oral tablets must not be used for humans.</li>
<li>So, keep the tablets away from the reach of kids.
Luckily, Capstar is safe for use on so you can give a second dose to the dog if it has a fleas&rsquo; re-infestation.
Administering the Capstar flea trap tablets will require that you conceal the medication in the pet&rsquo;s food or drop it into the dog&rsquo;s mouth directly.</li>
<li>Inspect the dog thoroughly to ensure it has swallowed the flea tablet or re-administer the medication if you are not sure if it has swallowed.
NB: Remember that the fleas can multiply and reproduce while on another pet in your household even when you flea-treated your dog.</li>
<li>So, it is good to adopt a comprehensive flea treatment approach for the house and on other pets. Related:<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs/">Capstar Flea Tablets�for Small Dogs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dosage-and-reaction">Dosage and Reaction</h2>
<p>Capstar flea tablets must be administered separately to the dog or other pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, you must not administer Capstar tablets to any pet whose weight is below 2 pounds.
Also, check the packaging instructions 4 outlines on current dosing for the Capstar flea tablets.
No adverse effects have been recorded while administering Capstar flea tablets on dogs or pets over 2 pounds.
You will achieve 90% effective flea control on dogs with these Capstar flea tablets.</li>
<li>Luckily, Capstar tablets have a quick knock-down on fleas since they will kill the bugs in just 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-capstar-flea-tablets-safe-for-nursing-or-pregnant-dogs">Are Capstar flea tablets safe for nursing or pregnant dogs?</h2>
<p>During the flea treatment process, you may notice that the dog may start itching and scratching - this is when the fleas are dying.
Itching and scratching in dogs after giving them the Capstar flea tablets is a temporary reaction to the movement of fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats can show some temporary signs like excessive grooming, vocalization, panting, and hyperactivity.
You can prevent miliary dermatitis and flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) in dogs by treating the pets using Capstar flea tablets.
Also, you can use Capstar tablets in conjunction with other medications including shampoos, deworming medications, vaccines, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and heartworm preventives.
Remember that fleas also spread tapeworms and so controlling these products will have extensive medical benefits to your dog.
Capstar tablets will however not kill the fleas that are in and around the house (
the pets&rsquo; environment
).</li>
<li>So, repeat the flea treatment on the dog using Capstar tablets since the immature fleas in the environment will develop into mature ladies attacking your large dogs again.
So, in addition to using the Capstar tablet to exterminate the adult fleas, you can use an insect growth inhibitor such as program flavor to help control fleas in the other life stages.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-OvxhEkJ0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-OvxhEkJ0</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fleas-life-cycle">Fleas life cycle</h2>
<p>Fleas are known to be fast producers and so their presence can cause a major problem to your pets and the household in general.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, 1 female flea willlay about 2000+ eggsbefore it dies.
These eggs will develop and hatch to become adults in about 3 weeks. Next, once the female fleas have their blood meal from the pets, they will go ahead and lay more eggs.</li>
<li>The flea larvae will emerge from the flea eggs in a few days and will remain in the pet&rsquo;s environment concealed in places such as the pet bedding and the carpet.
Next, the flea larvae will create a cocoon and wait for appropriate stimuli so that they can emerge as young adult fleas.
The fleas in the stage will next
hitchhike your pet
and continue feeding on their blood - growth further to the flea cycle.</li>
<li>So, effectively control the fleas in all the life stages, we recommend a combination of the Capstar tablets (nitenpyram) and the flavor tablets (lufenuron).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capstar-nitenpyram-for-large-dogs">Capstar (nitenpyram) for Large Dogs</h2>
<p>The oral tablets (Capstar) will exterminate adult fleas in large dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens that are 4 + weeks old and whose weight is 2 + pounds.
The nitenpyram (neonicotinoids) Capstar tablets will contain 57 mg of the active ingredient (for large dogs) or 11.4 mg of the same (for small dogs and cats).
But how long will the Capstar flea treatment last?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, Capstar tablets will have a quick knockdown on the adult fleas (killing them in 15 minutes)</li>
<li>However, the effectiveness and life of the free tablets will be around 24 hours when you will be required to re-administer if the pests are still around.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-recent-customer-review">A Recent Customer Review</h2>
<p>The customer notes that he hit the research grounds for an effective flea killer recently.</p>
<ul>
<li>But he is keen to caution that Capstar tablets are our only guide for killing adult fleas on large dogs.
It is therefore impossible to use Capstar tablets to target fleas that are in the environment.</li>
<li>But the customer states that the Capstar flea tablets are an excellent tool that you can incorporate into the flea control mission.
So, if you&rsquo;re planning to utilize mostly or only cut the tablets to control fleas in the house and on the dog, you will require extra vigilance and keen knowledge of the flea cycle.</li>
<li>This would require that you give the large dogs these Capstar flea tablets for a long time - this would require a vet&rsquo;s advice.
This technique might not work for dogs that show adverse skin reactions from flea bites - this would require emergency flea treatment in the whole environment.</li>
<li>So, I recommend you combine administration of the tablets with thorough vacuuming and cleaning plusflea shampooing the dogfollowing a regular schedule.
This combination will provide almost instant relief to the large dogs against fleas while also controlling the pests to slow their growth in the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, the Capstar flea tablets for large dogs are effective in exterminating adult fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>But to control the fleas in the pets&rsquo; environment, you will require acomprehensive flea extermination strategy.
Despite the fact that the Capstar tablets will only work for 24 hours, it offers a quick knockdown on the fleas - which will be around 15 minutes.
Cheers!</li>

Notably, capital will begin killing the fleas on your dog in around half an hour and its effectiveness will last for one day.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I advise that you start the journey of controlling that flea infestation on your car or the dog by administering Capstar - it is an effective flea killer and it&rsquo;s also fast-acting.
Let&rsquo;s dig in!

<h2 id="details-capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs">Details: Capstar Flea Tablets For Small Dogs</h2>
<p>Cops are tablets that are effective and fast in killing fleas on small dogs such that you&rsquo;ll actually see the pests falling off from your pet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Professionals advise you to use Capstar tablets in combination with other flea treatments that are considered long-acting.</li>
<li>Some of the known long-acting play Killers include tick control collars like those produced by Solesto or advantage.
The tablets are easy to administer and we&rsquo;ll kill the adult fleas very fast. You can give the tablets daily - probably with food or even without.</li>
<li>Capstar flea tablets will be effective and safe for controlling fleas in small dogs that measure up to 11 kgs.
KILL ADULT FLEAS: Capstar oral flea treatment tablets (11.4 mg) are safe for dogs and puppies from 2-25 lbs., four (4) weeks and older.
With the 11.4 mg of the Capstar tablets, we exterminate adult fleas in puppies and dogs that are 4 + weeks old or 2 lbs to 25 lbs.</li>
<li>Lucky for convenience and cost reduction, Capstar flea tablets can be purchased without needing a veterinarian prescription.
Capstar flea tablets are all so fast in treating re-infestations - experts advise that you just administer another daily dose until all is cleared.</li>
<li>Capstar tablets also have a quick knock-down effect on the fleas - so the pests will start falling off from the dog in just 30 minutes.

</ul>
<h2 id="effective-and-fast-acting">Effective and Fast Acting</h2>
<p>Capstar is made using the nitenpyram active ingredient which will kill the fleas fast on your cats and dogs - the knock-down effect is estimated at just 30 minutes.
An analysis of the Capstars action shows that the remedy is able to disseminate 90 + percent of the adult fleas in just 4 hours (in dogs) and only 6 hours (in cats).
Besides capsule tablets we&rsquo;ll be safe and effective for use on kittens, cats, puppies, and dogs that are 2 + oz in weight or 4 + weeks in age.
Another advantage of the Capstar tablets is that we will exterminate adult fleas before they begin reproducing and laying eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capstar will exterminate adult fleas that would otherwise trigger allergy dermatitis caused by fleas.
Luckily, Capstar can be purchased for killing fleas in 57 mg for large dogs (25 pounds - 125 pounds) or in 11.4 mg for small dogs and cats (2 lb to 25 pounds).</li>
<li>Administration of the Capstar tablets is easy as you will simply be required to give them in food or drop a tablet inside the pet&rsquo;s mouth.
You can administer Capstar flea tablets with other medications such as the longer-lasting or monthly medications and they&rsquo;ll be safe.</li>
<li>Also, you can administer Capstar flea tablets with flea shampoos, deworming medications, vaccines, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and heartworm preventatives.
However, Capstar flea tablets are not suitable for use as a preventative flea medication.</li>
<li>So you should purchase and use another flea prevention remedy for your small dogs - ensure that a solution is able to kill even the flea larvae and flea eggs.
However, Capstar flea tablets are not safe for use in kittens and puppies that are under 20 pounds in body weight or under 4 weeks in age.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-will-the-capstar-flea-tablets-last">How long will the Capstar Flea tablets last?</h2>
<p>As noted above, Capstar flea tablets are not to be used as preventative medications for fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dosing the small dog with a tablet will only kill please that are on its body at that time.
So, Capstar tablets are widely used in rescue operations - for flea-treating stray cats or dogs.</li>
<li>The process involves dosing the cat or dog using Capstar tablets, feeding them appropriately, and then bathing them probably using asuitable flea shampoo.
So, on how long the Capstar flea tablets last, I will say that this is an incorrect or misplaced question because this solution will not offer long-lasting prevention.
So, the Capstar tablet may be described as an instant flea solution as opposed to being a long-term flea pill.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-capstar-flea-tablets-safe-for-my-small-dog">Are Capstar flea tablets safe for my small dog?</h2>
<p>Yes, Capstar tablets are effective in treating fleas on both cats and small dogs.
However, you must strictly adhere to the dosage recommendations that are on the product description.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 11.4 mg package is suitable for flea-treating dogs and cats that are 2 lb 25 pounds in body weight</li>
<li>The 57 mg package is effective unsafe for flea-treating dogs that weigh 25.1 lb to 125 pounds
The oral medication can be administered by hiding it in the dog&rsquo;s food or simply dropping the tablet into the pet&rsquo;s mouth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flea-free-dogs">Flea-Free Dogs</h2>
<p>My mum received the Capstar tablets package in the evening and she administered it immediately.
She says that, after 1 hour, she&rsquo;s checked through the dog&rsquo;s hair for any live fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, not a single live flea was found but there were many dead ones.
Next, my mum decided to give a dog a thorough washing to remove most of those dead or live fleas.</li>
<li>Finally, my mum reports that her small dog became flea-free and also happy.
However, she noted that the product description classified the product as non-long-term in its action.</li>
<li>So, she had to contact the vet for accommodation with a longer-term flea killer for a small dog.
My mum&rsquo;s review is that Capstar tablets will be great if you need an easy and quick remedy for fleas prior to getting a longer-term remedy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="effective-for-small-dogs">Effective for small dogs</h2>
<p>Capstar tablets worked excellently as described.</p>
<ul>
<li>I used the product on my small dogs that weigh anywhere from 11 lb to 16 pounds.
I noticed that the Shitzu dog that had denser hair on its body came with more fleas.
But we administered 1 dose to each of the dogs and the formulation was able to clear all the pests within 1 to 2 days.</li>
<li>However, it was important to administer another dose to the dog that had long hair after 1 week.
My review is that Capstar tablets are effective safe and well-priced for use in controlling fleas - plus they are nonprescription which makes them very convenient.
Capstar cleared the fleas on my Shih Tzu dog that mainly stays in the US but sometimes moves to the yard - where I believe he picked some fleas.</li>
<li>But ever since this encounter, I also purchased a<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">yard flea killer</a>that has helped so much.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="used-in-conjunction-with-flea-combs">Used in Conjunction with Flea Combs</h2>
<p>Experts recommend that you use the Capstar tablets in conjunction with some quality flea combs.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will increase the chances of catching all the fleas within one hour.
After administering the medication, you will notice that a small dog will begin moving around and becoming restless and scratching crazily.</li>
<li>This is because the fleas will have panicked and so will be moving around as they die from the medication.
Pet owners are advised that this is a common habit but they should comb the outdoors to catch any fleas that may escape.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in summary, Capstar tablets are effective remedies for controlling adult fleas that are already on your small dog.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, be cautious because there is a dosage limitation depending on the age and weight of your small dog.
I also recommend you use Capstar tablets in combination with other longer-term flea remedies such as the Sentry Oatmeal Flea Shampoo.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Capstar tablets are formulated to kill the various adult flea species and they&rsquo;re meant for use on large dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens that are over 2 pounds in weight.</p>
<ul>
<li>For most of these pests, one dose of the Capstar tablets will kill most of the <a href="/posts/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs/">fleas</a> - but you must use other techniques tobreak the flea lifecycle.
In this article, I will online and discuss some of the Capstar flea treatment reviews that are accessible to me.
Let&rsquo;s dig in!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-capstar-flea-treatment-reviews">Details: Capstar Flea Treatment Reviews</h2>
<h3 id="review-1-highly-effective-oral-flea-treatment">Review #1: Highly Effective Oral Flea Treatment</h3>
<p>I can say that I finally landed on an effective and still
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs">safe flea killer - for small dogs</a>
and large dogs plus cats.
Compared to other over-the-counter pesticides and repellents that I had used trying to control the fleas on my pets, Capstar tablets proved much better.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had my reservations in using the oral tablets for flea control especially after going through the CDC reports regarding their safety.
The results after using the Capstar flea tablets proved amazing since the chemical damaged the bug&rsquo;s central nervous system and thus killed them.
Luckily the active ingredients do not affect the body system of the pet and it also acts facts plus it doesn&rsquo;t remain in the body for long.</li>
<li>Therefore the side effects on the pet (if any) we&rsquo;ll be for a short time and others you&rsquo;ll have time to discontinue a medication prior to causing extensive damage.
This will not be like other prescription flea treatments that tend to remain in the pet body for years or months - which may come with adverse health effects.
So my feedback is that Capstar flea tablets produced positive outcomes in handling and finishing the flea infestation that had proved stubborn.</li>
<li>So if those pets including cats kitties dogs and puppies pickfleas from the yardand bring them in the house, Capstar tablets will help you.
Also, fleas make cats and dogs lose their fur through scratching and itchy.
Therefore a suitable oral flea medication will save the pets from dropping off their fur - it will work well for
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-large-dogs">large medium and small furry pets</a>
.</li>
<li>Just within a week, my home became flea-free and my pets why are healing their wounds while also re-growing their fur at a fast rate.
Within a month none of my pets showed any signs of physical or mental sickness and that&rsquo;s why I conclude Capstar flea tablets are quite effective.
Father the natural flea repellents may not work always to control the bags while some chemical pesticides may irritate the pet&rsquo;s skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="review-2-quick-action-and-cheap-in-killing-fleas">Review #2: Quick Action and Cheap in Killing Fleas</h3>
<p>My mum has five indoor cats but just 2 go outdoors for a short time daily. But with the recent massive rains, the flea infestation has increased.
Since the cats are many numbers then controlling fleas on all of them, especially through a veterinarian is quite costly.
Luckily after sharing the Capstar flea tablets among the cats they are now back to resting and relaxing after just 30 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the cats relax my mum checked them out and don&rsquo;t list dead fleas on they are bedding and their bodies.
Capstar flea tablets works!
On cost, I note that Capstar flea tablets are considerably cheap and I would also write them five stars for effectiveness.
You can use the capitol flea tablets in conjunction with other topical flea treatments such as frontline and
revolution</li>
<li>but even when alone the tablets will exterminate the place within 1 to 4 hours.
Capstar tablets should be used in combination with other techniques in a broader flea control mission.</li>
<li>This is because please we require a blood meal to lay their eggs.</li>
<li>So if you can remove the other place from the bed as you treat the house and yard to be easy to break theflea life cycle.
My strategy was a month of thorough flea control that included using home flea sprays, vacuuming, washing, using frontline plus, and flea collars - in addition to the Capstar flea tablets on my pets.</li>
<li>Also, I washed and heat dried the bedding before finally flea-bombing my residence.</li>
<li>I noted that flea bombing the house in conjunction with administering the Capstar tablets to the pets produced the best results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="review-3-exterminates-adult-fleas-only">Review #3: Exterminates Adult Fleas Only</h3>
<p>Capstar flea tablets will work within 24 hours unless you require to administer the medication to the pets.
In 24 hours, you&rsquo;ll be able to clean at the services using other flea control methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advice that you buy the Capstar tablets and administer one for your pet daily but ensure to read the packaging directions.
Another product that will improve the effectiveness of the flea control methods is using flea shampoo.</li>
<li>This is because the Capstar tablet won&rsquo;t exterminate fleas in other life-stages apart from adults.</li>
<li>Using suitable flea shampoo will help you kill the flea larvae and flea eggs.
But make sure to wash the pet thoroughly while using the flea shampoo to give it time for effective extermination of the pests.
After using the Capstar flea tablets most of the fleas will die.</li>
<li>But you can use a flea comb to catch any that are still alive and hiding in the fur of the pet.
The flea comb will also help remove the dead skin and detached hair from the body of the pet and that gives it a better look.</li>
<li>A flea spray that has highly effective but safe ingredients will easily kill fleas in the house and the yard.</li>
<li>But don&rsquo;t spray on or around the pets or allow them to pass near the spread area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vacuum the unwashable items used by pests such as their cat trees and carpets. Also,o laundry on the pet clothes, fabrics, and bedding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore I know that the Capstar flea tablets easily achievedeffective flea control on my petswithin 24 hours but this could only be achieved in about two weeks with other methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>While roach showers and sprays are only good for getting rid of the roaches you see, they are not very effective at dealing with infestations. This is because
roaches propagate at an alarmingly high rate, and it doesnt take long for them to repopulate after a roach spray
attack.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkrhY-2sqIY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkrhY-2sqIY</a>
You need a powerful bait, such as the one in the Combat Max 12 Month
Roach Killer
. Baiting is a more effective way of dealing with cockroaches because it slowly but gradually spreads the poison within their population and hideouts.
Unlike sprays and showers, baits can affect many of their population because the toxin can be spread from roach to roach even when theyre dead.
Combat Max utilizes Fipronil, a powerful insecticide, in the creation of their baits, which are also comprised of food particles designed to attract German cockroaches and smaller, more stubborn roaches.
This 12-month roach killer comes with 18
bait stations
. Youll want this kind of coverage if youre dealing with a severe infestation or trying to de-infest a large house.
Combat Max starts to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/">kill off roaches</a>
in a matter of hours. Any roach killer that shows results in hours is promising. However, what makes this particular roach killer unique is that it remains active for up to 12 months.
If youve handled
roach infestations
before, then you know the only way to stop them is to be persistent about it. With a bait thats active for up to 12 months, you dont have to worry too much about the roaches coming back, especially if you set up the bait stations in the right places.

<h3 id="1-starts-killing-roaches-in-hours">1. Starts Killing Roaches in Hours</h3>
<p>When it comes to ridding your home of roach infestations, speed is an essential factor. The faster you can kill them off, the more effectively you will control the infestation.
Combat Max contains a lethal mix of the insecticide fipronil and tasty food scraps to bait the cockroaches. Once set up, the baits start killing immediately, and within a few hours, you may start seeing dead roaches all over the place.
Combat Max is, therefore, a good solution for large infestations as its killing potential is enough to disrupt the roaches re-population cycle.</p>
<h3 id="2-designed-to-kill-german-roaches">2. Designed to Kill German Roaches</h3>
<p>Combat Max is designed to eliminate
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/">German roaches</a>
, which can be bigger, smarter, and very stubborn pests. Go for it if youve confirmed that the roach infestation you want to get rid of is a camp of these stubborn nuisances.
That being said, the 12-month roach killer is just as effective when targeting smaller roaches, which can be harder to kill with sprays and showers as theyre very agile.
The baits work like charms when it comes to bringing roaches out of the woodwork and killing them (or at least assaulting their sensory organs) when they come into contact with them.

<h3 id="3-easy-to-set-up-and-use">3. Easy to Set Up and Use</h3>
<p>When shopping for the perfect roach killing bait, its easy to overlook the simple stuff, such as how easy it is to use or set up. Considering that youre handling very poisonous bait, it is important to think about this for a moment.
The Combat Max roach killer is very easy to set up thanks to its no-mess baits. Youre not dealing with powders or formulations here, just a good old solid roach bait thats completely child-resistant and deadly for roaches.
With plug-and-play functionality like this, you dont have to worry about anything other than setting up the baits in the right location. It doesnt get more convenient than this.</p>
<h3 id="4-comes-with-18-baits">4. Comes with 18 Baits</h3>
<p>One thing to love about the Combat Max roach killer is the amount of coverage you can get with such a small package. Offering up to 18 baits per pack, this is the roach
killer you need when
relentless roaches run over your home.
The bait stations are perfect for placing in the places roaches frequent the most  behind the fridge, dishwasher, and cooker, under the kitchen sink, hidden away in cabinets, under furniture, and wherever else the roaches are taking over in your home.
Though it depends on your roach infestation&rsquo;s severity, 18 baits are more than enough to get the situation under control.</p>
<h3 id="5-all-baits-are-childproof">5. All Baits are Childproof</h3>
<p>If youve got toddlers and young children in the house, you need to think about their safety when setting up the bait stations. With Combat Max, you can rest easy knowing that all 18 bait stations are encased in childproof containers and are therefore safe to use around the house.
For maximum effectiveness, always ensure that the bait stations are touching the walls and spread out at least 1 foot away from each other. They are especially useful when setting up in corners.
<strong>Pros�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers excellent coverage with 18 bait stations</li>
<li>Utilizes a powerful insecticide that kills in hours and lasts for 12 months</li>
<li>Designed to handle German cockroaches</li>
<li>Bait stations are easy to set up.
<strong>Cons�</strong></li>
<li>While sufficient enough to reduce infestations, Combat Max fails at curbing proliferation permanently.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Combat Max 12 Month Roach Killer should be enough for most roach infestations. The baits are encased in childproof containers, and thats a massive advantage if you have a family with small children.
Furthermore, it draws out roaches quickly and
kills them just as fast
. Setting up out of the box is relatively easy too.
On that note, it is fair to say that Combat Max is a decent choice for dealing with roaches (mainly German roaches), but dont expect it to completely stop the spread of roaches to other houses around you. It excels mostly at driving roaches out of your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most folks can achieve a bedbug-free home for less than $200-$300 over 2-3 months with some diligence. If done correctly, you shouldnt see bed bugs after 2-3 weeks when using CrossFire along with Cimexa.</p>
<p>Many people swear by steaming or heat-treating
bed bugs/)
.
I tried this method twice and found that it failed for me because I did not have the time or patience to do it daily for two months. This review focuses on the chemical route with CrossFire, which has proven to be more effective with consistent application.</p>

<h2 id="crossfire-for-bed-bugs-residual-spray">CrossFire for Bed Bugs (Residual Spray)</h2>
<p>Bed bugs lay eggs daily in various hidden areas around your home. Even with thorough treatment, there will likely be areas you miss that will have hatching bugs. CrossFire is designed to keep working for long periods, ensuring that bed bugs are continually targeted even after the initial application.</p>
<h3 id="1-remove-clutter-">**1. Remove Clutter **</h3>
<p>The first step is to declutter your home. Get rid of clothes, shoes, books, and other items you can live without. Wash and dry everything on
high heat
, then seal them in plastic bags. This step is crucial to prevent bed bugs from finding new hiding spots and to eliminate any that may be hiding in your belongings.</p>
<p>Another significant issue is identifying the source of the infestation. If you dont figure out where they are coming from, you may find yourself needing to treat your home indefinitely.</p>
<h3 id="2-mix-and-apply-crossfire-">**2. Mix and Apply CrossFire **</h3>
<p>To start, mix  the bottle of CrossFire with  gallon of water in a chemical sprayer. Spray every nook, cranny, baseboard, corner, and crevice in your home. You will need to repeat this process every 10-14 days for 8-12 weeks. It&rsquo;s essential to only mix what you need because once mixed, CrossFire needs to be used within 24 hours.</p>
<p>One quart of CrossFire goes a long way; I was able to treat my 1200 sq ft, three-bedroom apartment with just one quart. Alongside CrossFire, use Cimexa dust, a fine powder that should be lightly applied to outlet covers, light-switch covers, and other voids in your home. Be cautious not to apply too much; a light dusting is sufficient as bed bugs will avoid overly thick layers.</p>
<h3 id="3-launder-your-clothes-thoroughly-">**3. Launder Your Clothes Thoroughly **</h3>
<p>During the first 2-3 weeks, while you may still
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-carpet/">see live bed bugs</a>
, launder your bedclothes every three days and dry them on high heat. Keep your CrossFire spray handy in case you spot any bed bugs crawling around.</p>
<p>Vacuum your home daily, paying special attention to baseboards if you have carpeting. Immediately empty the vacuum, tie up the debris, and remove it from your home to ensure you kill even the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/baby-bed-bugs/">baby bed bugs</a>
.</p>
<p>Clear out shelves in closets and books on bookcasesno boxes either, as bed bugs love hiding in cardboard. Everything you keep needs to be sealed or tied up in plastic or garbage bags. This leaves bed bugs nowhere to hide.</p>
<h3 id="4-treat-your-car-for-bed-bugs-">**4. Treat Your Car for Bed Bugs **</h3>
<p>Dont forget to treat your car. Bed bugs can hitchhike to your vehicle and eventually infest it. Treat your car with CrossFire every time you treat your home.</p>
<p>The cheapest place Ive found to buy CrossFire is from an online source where its priced at $30 with free shipping if you spend over $45. I suggest buying two bottles upfront, as it will take at least that much to treat every 14 days for 2-3 months, plus youll benefit from free shipping.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>CrossFire offers an effective solution to the persistent problem of bed bugs when used correctly and consistently. By following these stepsdecluttering, correctly mixing and applying CrossFire, laundering your clothes regularly, and not forgetting to treat your caryou can achieve a bedbug-free home.</p>
<p>Although the initial process may seem daunting, the results are well worth the effort. With the right approach and a bit of diligence, you can rid your home of these pests for good.</p>

      <title>Does Boric Acid Kill Roaches</title>

      <description>You&amp;#39;ll get boric acid in either dust or</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;ll get <a href="/posts/does-boric-acid-kill-bed-bugs/">boric</a> acid in either dust or
gel forms
, but largely dusts are used for pest extermination. Chemically, boric acid will contain electrostatic charges and thus it&rsquo;ll cling to the roach&rsquo;s body while it&rsquo;s crawling on the roach-treated surfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Does Boric Acid Kill Roaches? I&rsquo;ve come to love Boric acid powder�(available on Amazon) for its effectiveness in killing roaches.�****The boric�acid powder is a boron derivative. **</li>
<li><strong>You&rsquo;ll require to�mix the powder with sweet substances such as honey to create Boric Acid Gel or roach-attracting borax acid paste.�</strong>
If youre a homeowner, how do you get rid of a cockroach colony? Some of the roach-control products available in the market are
roach bombs
, roach sprays,
roach killers
, and roach gels.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Does Boric Acid Kill Roaches&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="boric-acid-for-roaches-powder-roach-treatments">Boric Acid For Roaches? Powder Roach Treatments</h2>
<p>In this post, I have a comprehensive guide on creating a borax acid paste.�Also, I&rsquo;ll describe the mistakes homeowners make when using Boric Acid to
Kill Roaches
.
Unfortunately, the boric acid powder can be easily misapplied and readily blown away by air currents. This could send the powder to areas where kids and pets could contact it and sadly get poisoned. Therefore, the most effective application method is to make a boric acid paste for the roaches to eat.
<strong>Summary:</strong>
Using honey and bacon grease to make the boric acid paste will help attract the toxic boric acid (and
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/boricgen.html">readily kill them</a>
). The roaches feed on the paste or carry it back to their nests, where other <a href="/posts/harris-boric-acid-roach-powder-with-lure-review/">cockroaches</a> also feed and die. If the roach die and their counterparts eat them, then theyd even die.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-roach-attracting-and-killing-boric-acid-paste">How To Make a Roach-attracting (and killing) Boric Acid Paste</h2>
<p>Sadly, roaches come in a colony, and thus, seeing one implies that many others are hiding. I know you might have tried toxic chemicals or employed the services of an exterminator. However, with boric acid, the process is easy, effective, and inexpensive - and it&rsquo;s
excellent even for roaches that can fly or glide
.
<strong>Requirements:�</strong>
<em>To create the extra-delicious boric acid cake, youll require 2 cups of boric acid powder, 1 cup of baking flour, two tablespoons of bacon grease, two tablespoons of maple syrup or honey, one popsicle stick for mixing, and 2 cups of water.</em>
<strong>Preliminary�Steps to take</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Restoring sanity in your house after a
roach infestation
requires a comprehensive plan and consistent work. First, youll need to remove water and food sources that would be feeding the pests.
Therefore, clean the house and undertake some necessary home repairs. Also, drain all standing water in or around your house and stop any water leads.</li>
<li>Also, clean any dirty sinks and dishes, remove pet water dishes, and watered plants. Clean the kitchen appliances to remove any little food that remains.
Next, youll need to remove garbage and trash cans while still doing daily vacuuming of your carpet and seal any penetrations via ground-level walls. Avoid leaving food and bread cramps on the furniture or rugs. Also, do not leave pet
food or water overnight in the pet eating
dishes.
<strong>Step 1:</strong>
First, mix the 2 cups of water with the boric acid powder and 1 cup of the baking floor. This process will produce a milky-looking solution.
<strong>Step 2:</strong>
Next, mix the honey syrup or honey with the resultant mix from step one. Pour some water to bring the paste to get the correct consistency. I mainly target to create a paste that has a texture nearing that of peanut butter.
**Step 3: **
Take the popsicle stick and now pour a small portion of the roach-killing paste to a place where you know roaches will get the frequency. Such sites include pipes, in food cabinet, under cookers and fridge.
<strong>Step 4:�</strong>
Finally, to prevent roaches from coming through walls or drainages from outside the house, youll need to cover these areas with boric acid paste. So, smear the paste on walls or pipes where roaches might have routes for getting into your apartment.
Roaches will usually take back the food they get to their nests or colony, and thus other roaches will feed on the same and die. If one of the poisoned
roaches poops
or dies and other of their colleagues eat it, theyll die. Therefore, this feeding chain would allow you to
kill most of the roaches
even in their hiding places  areas where roach sprays would ordinarily not reach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-boric-acid-or-borax">What&rsquo;s Boric Acid or Borax?</h2>
<p>So, youre asking, which mechanism does boric acid used to kill roaches and their colonies? As outlined above, Boric acid (popular as
<em><strong>Acidum boricua, boracic acid, or hydrogen borate</strong></em>
) is a borax derivative that acts as a
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/products.html">pesticide</a>
.
Youll mainly find boric acid powder in substances such as toothpaste and another detergent. Boric Acid For
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">Roaches acts</a>
as a desiccant (dehydrates roaches) and being non-repellant and odorless.</p>
<h2 id="how-boric-acid-works-to-kill-cockroaches">How boric acid works to kill cockroaches</h2>
<p>When the roaches crawl near the boric acid roach paste, the mixture will stick on the pests bodies and arms. Further, when the roach ingests the paste, the boric acid will get into the pests digestive and nervous systems, crippling them and causing death.
Further, Boric acid will kill another roach population when they eat other dead roaches fed on the boric acid paste. Additionally, the
roaches carry the roach paste back to the roach nest
, helping kill the roach population in the nest or hidden place.
Further, the boric acid destroys the roaches exoskeleton, which allows the paste to dehydrate the roach and thus kill it.
Boric acid functions as a desiccant and will extract the pest&rsquo;s body moisture, causing dehydration and death. Notably, the infant roaches may die within 48 hours, while the adult roaches will die in 72 hours.</p>
<h2 id="mistakes-homeowners-make-with-boric-acid">Mistakes homeowners make with Boric Acid.</h2>
<p>For the boric acid to be effective, youll need to avoid simple mistakes that could hamper your roach-control success. Herere the mistakes you must avoid.
<strong>1. Disregarding Safety Rules</strong>
For the chemical that boric acid is, you must use it to protect your pet&rsquo;s and kids&rsquo; health. Therefore, Ive always told my clients that they must use gloves to use boric acid powder safely.
As discussed above, you must clean up any food substances sticking on your furniture, countertops, and wash the dishes. You must place the boric acid paste in a hidden location from kids and people in the house for additional safety.
<strong>2. Excessive boric acid application�</strong>
Roaches are not your regular damn pests. Theyll quickly notice a pile of roach acid paste and quickly see that it could be a death trap. Hence, its great that you apply the boric acid paste in a thin layer so that the roaches wont avoid it.
If you&rsquo;re using a boric acid powder, you can use a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Use-Pest-Control-Duster/dp/B014V9RIFK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486039585&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=bulb+duster&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=e33adca45f459c8415975b8ec6bdd049">pest control bulb duster</a>
to apply uniformly.
Hence, you can use the stick to create a skinny layer of the boric-acid paste, and therefore you wont leave lumps of the solution. Its important to know that not many
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/combat-max-12-month-roach-killing-bait-review/">roach paste quantities are required to kill</a>
the cockroaches.
<strong>3.�Using the Boric Acid in the incorrect spots</strong>
You need to apply the boric acid in food preparation areas or those where food gets stored or could drop. You must special attention to crevices and cracks under the fridge and other food appliances, sinks, and cabinets.
Therefore, if you dont get the high traffic or food waste areas right, youll have started your roach control journey on the wrong footing.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Avoid wasting time and resources by identifying the right places to apply boric acid. However, you must also practice some patience in the roach control since you&rsquo;ll most likely see notable results (that&rsquo;s a large number of roaches dying) in about 2-5 days.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today, Im at my house in Downtown Houston ready to do a review of the Drano Max Gel Clog Remover - the runner-up product in the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaners</a>
. I aim to see what the cleaner can do about a severe clog in my kitchen sink.
<em>Summary: Drano Max Gel will liquefy even the most challenging drain clogs in your plumbing or septic systems. This powerful drain cleaner will clean soap scum, hair, shampoo oil, organic matter, paper, &amp; grease. Its ultra-thick to move through standing water, and it&rsquo;s a 100% biodegradable product.�</em>
So, Ill go ahead. The label instruction recommends that I pour about a fifth of cleaner in this container and allow it to sit in there for 15-30 minutes. It&rsquo;s excellent for drains in the kitchen, laundry sinks, bathroom, lavatory, garbage disposals. Luckily, its also odorless, and not corrosive, and wont leave any waste.
<strong>See top drain cleaners.</strong>
I&rsquo;d tried to use boiling water, plungers,
vinegar, and baking soda, but they didn&rsquo;t remove the drain clog
.</p>
<h3 id="whats-this-drano-max-gel">What&rsquo;s this, Drano Max Gel?</h3>
<p>This Drano Max Gel is a powerful enzymatic
drain cleaner
that will clean most of your tough drain clogs. The cleanser is produced by S. C. Johnson &amp; Son  an American company that stands for quality and ethical manufacturing.
But the Drano Max Gel cleaner was first produced in 1923. So, you can guess that it has undergone numerous iterative improvements in safety and quality. �However, the company also has other products such as Drano snake and Drano Aerosol Plunger.
What makes Drano Max Gel unique among all the drain cleaners include-:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its produced to protect your pipes (both PVC and metal pipes) from corrosive action. Also, you can leave it overnight,working on your clogged drain.</li>
<li>It has quick action time  about 15 to 30 minutes before you flush out the debris using warm water.</li>
<li>You can pour into the sink with water, and itll cut through it and get to the drain clog fast with its natural enzyme formula.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="drain-test---time-it-takes-bottle-of-water-to-drain">Drain Test - Time it takes Bottle of water to drain</h2>
<p>To test this Drano
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner&rsquo;s</a>
effectiveness, well time how long it takes to drain a pre-measured bottle of water before and after using the drain cleaner. So, lets get started. I now pour the water (filled to the top line) while setting off the timer to check on time.
So, I am done pouring the water, and it has gone down the drain in 7.74 seconds (
<em>as shown in our timer below</em>
).</p>
<h2 id="now-pour-a-5th-of-the-drano-in-the-clogged-drain">Now, pour a 5th of the Drano in the clogged drain.</h2>
<p>As noted above, it took 7.74 seconds to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">drain the clean water</a>
. We&rsquo;ll come back to this time at the end of the experiment. But first, now we pour the Drano Max Gel.
Therefore, I thoroughly rinsed out this sink. Next, I pour about a fifth of the Drano Max Gel into the drain. Next, I set my timer and allow 20 minutes before we come back for the next process. Finally, the 20 minutes ended.</p>
<h2 id="flash-drain-with-warm-water">Flash Drain with Warm Water</h2>
<p>So, we continue following the label instructions. Next up, we now use warm water to flush the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/sink-not-draining-but-pipes-clear/">drain hoping that Drano has now cleared</a>
the clog. So, we do that right away  flush the water for about a minute, as fast as the faucet can run from the tap.
Luckily, I can already tell that the water is draining much faster than before using the Drano MAX Gel cleaner. When my wife brushed her teeth this morning, the water was backing up and getting to about three-quarters of the sink.
However, to verify my claims, well repeat the drain test  with clean water and a timer.</p>
<h2 id="second-drain-test---draining-clean-water-timer">Second Drain Test - Draining clean water (Timer)</h2>
<p>Now, we go back to the bottle filled with clean water and have our timer running. So, let&rsquo;s get right to the test. So, the water runs down the drain in about 4.36 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, this test shows we achieved faster water draining - but about 3.38 seconds. So, definitely, this Drano Max Gel Clog Remover works, and I would recommend that you trust it for your clogged drains and garbage disposal pipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage-results--">Usage Results: -</h3>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drano Max Gel Clog Remover is made to be a thick formula that&rsquo;ll dissolve even the toughest of the drain clogs. Further, being denser than water, the cleaner will move through standing water and work on the challenging clogs - including hair, soap scum, oils, and grease.
It has no phosphorus and will work great for septic systems, garbage disposals in addition to metal, PVC, and plastic pipes.</p>

<p>Previously, I had used several fly repellents for my equine friend. I would avoid any fly repellent that had relatively toxic chemicals. Sadly, all the repellents I used would not work effectively in repelling the horse flies.
Finally, your horse&rsquo;s coat will be left shinning even more and won&rsquo;t make it fade in any way as would with other fly repellents.
But, with this Espree Aloe Herbal, the horses can peacefully feed on their hay or graze around with no disturbance from the flies. I also noted that the horse no longer has marks of fly bites on their legs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green Gobbler is conveniently packed in two packets that youll find easy to use on your clogged pipes and drains. Luckily, this product also tops our list of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaner</a>
available in the market.
The powder formula was great, but this new liquid option is even simpler to use. Just un-cock it and pour the contents one of the chambers, and you&rsquo;re done. Check top drain cleaners.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Green Gobbler GGDIS2CH32 Dissolve&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="green-gobbler-liquid-instructions">Green gobbler Liquid instructions</h2>
<p>Interestingly, you don&rsquo;t wear rubber gloves, no nothing - it&rsquo;s all safe. Most traditional
drain cleaners
may bore the clog (with heat) to allow some water to move through it but don&rsquo;t clean the pipes. However, Green Gobbler won&rsquo;t produce heat and will clean the pipes too.</p>
<h2 id="how-green-gobbler-liquid-works">How Green Gobbler Liquid Works</h2>
<p>Green Gobbler will
clear drain
clogs in the tubs, showers, sinks, and toilets. It works through emulsification and dissolution of paper, oils, grease, feminine products, toothpaste, hair, and organic matter stuck in the clogged drain pipe.
<strong>Shower Drains &amp; tubs</strong>
I recently discussed how to
clean a shower drain clogged with hair
. This post noted that Showers, Drains, and tubs are mainly clogged by hair, soap scum, grease, and
shampoo oils
. Therefore, an enzymatic cleaner like Green Gobbler will be the best solution to emulsify and dissolve all those debris and organic matter.
So, after pouring the
cleaner into the clogged drain
, give it like 20 minutes (check the product label for instruction) and finally pouring hot water to flush the foreign materials.
<strong>Toilets</strong>
Most times, well accidentally flush female products such as sanitary pads down the toilet. This leads to confusion; do you use a plunger, hot water, or acidic cleaner to eat away the product&rsquo;s fiber? Luckily, you can unclog the pipes by pouring down the Green Gobbler powder into the toilet, even without removing the water remaining on the toilet basin.
<strong>Sink Drains</strong>
In addition to the hair, grease, and shampoo oils,
sink drains
will also be clogged by toothpaste as you brush your teeth. A major differentiating factor for Green Gobbler is that it is eco-friendly as it doesnt use chemical but just natural enzymes. Sadly, I have to tell you that you&rsquo;ll need to
<strong>avoid vinegar and Baking Soda</strong>
remedy because
it doesn&rsquo;t work
.
<strong>The Good:�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**1. Pre-measured Liquid bottles:�**As you may have noted, this green gobbler liquid is packed in a plastic bottle that is conveniently divided into two compartments with separate lids. Luckily, each of the packets is enough for a single treatment or<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/">drain unclogging</a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, no mess and no measuring. You&rsquo;ll use one chamber for your kitchen or shower sink while you&rsquo;ll need to empty two chambers when cleaning any toilet clogs.</li>
<li>**2. Environmental friendly:�**Green Gobbler works through enzymatic action and does not produce dangerous fumes while in action. Its not basic, acidic, or acoustic-like your regular drain cleaners. This has earned this cleaner the prestigious EPA approval for being environmentally friendly and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation">biodegradable</a>.</li>
<li><strong>3. Great for PVC and metal pipes</strong>: Contrary to common belief, this liquid<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/xionlab-safer-drain-opener-review/">drain cleaner</a>will work well in both PVC and metal pipes  this includes cast iron, copper, and aluminum. It also dissolves most clogs and hair fast enough. It&rsquo;s also great for big toilet clogs.</li>
<li>It has fast dissolve technology that will help to clear the drain clogs effectively. So, if you have regular problems with toilet clogs and are environmentally conscious, then this Green Gobbler dissolve should be your ultimate drain cleaner.
<strong>The Bad:�</strong></li>
<li>**1. Requires hot water:�**Green Gobbler comes in a liquid form. After 20-30 minutes, you&rsquo;ll need to flush the toilet (not activating) using hot water. Therefore, if you&rsquo;re not on solar power, the process could be delayed by power blackout or gas unavailability.</li>
<li>**2. Slow on fully clogged drains:**I noted that when the drain or sink, if fully clogged, you might need to use a snake first or a bent hanger wire, or else the process will be too slow.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Itll dissolve fast, oil, soap scum, hair, and grease  in its amazingly two pre-measured portions. Being heavier or denser than
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">water, the Green Gobbler cleaner will move through</a>
stagnant water and clean your pipes and drains.
Further, it is non-flammable and odorless, making it so much better than the acidic, basic, or acoustic drain cleaners. Itll be great for shower drains, bathtubs, toilets, or kitchen sinks.</p>

.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-my-detailed-review">#2: My Detailed Review</h2>
<h3 id="1non-staining-formula">1.Non-staining Formula</h3>
<p>Harris Bed Bug Killer won&rsquo;t stain your clothes, fabrics, or linen. The spray formula won&rsquo;t damage furniture finished despite leaving a residue that&rsquo;ll be active for long.
The long residue effect (7 to 10 days) means that the formula will continue
killing bed bugs
over time and won&rsquo;t require frequent re-application after the first day.</p>
<h3 id="2-suitable-for-indoor-and-outdoor-spraying">2. Suitable for Indoor and Outdoor Spraying</h3>
<p>This product will
kill bed bugs
excellently for both your outdoor and indoor spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would say that you&rsquo;ll require to combine thisspray with bed bugbaits.
However,�Harris
Bed Bug Killer is more effective
in controlling bed bugs in indoor spaces where roaches tend to create their safe havens.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-liquid-spray-formula">3. Liquid Spray formula</h3>
<p>Being a spray formula, this product will be suitable to spray places that
bed bugs are hiding
or have created a bug nest.</p>
<ul>
<li>I found the nozzle to be highly convenient in distributing the liquid.</li>
<li>Luckily, the liquid spray tends to dry out just about 5 minutes after the application.
Therefore, it&rsquo;s great to apply to your bedding, mattresses, and furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-odorless-formula-or-mild-smell">4. Odorless formula (or mild smell)</h3>
<p>In addition to being effective
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dead-bed-bugs/">against bed bugs</a>
, this product is odorless and non-irritating to both human beings and your pets.
However, some customers note that they experience some mild (though non-irritating) smell, which would disapprove of the &ldquo;odorless&rdquo; claim.</p>
<h2 id="3-my-experience">#3: My Experience:</h2>
<h3 id="1-deltamethrin-irritates-the-skin">1. Deltamethrin irritates the skin</h3>
<p>Harris Bed Bug Killer contains the Deltamethrin that tends to irritate the human skin, particularly the eyes, and thus you must take care when spraying or use goggles.
However, the Deltamethrin in this product is less toxic if minimal amounts are eaten or ingested, and that person would tend to vomit a lot to remove the poison.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bugs-are-resistant-todeltamethrin">1. Bed bugs are resistant to�Deltamethrin</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common fact that current bed bugs are continually developing resistance against Deltamethrin. Therefore, at the usual dosage, the bed bugs will still endure.
Recent
<a href="https://www.npmapestworld.org/default/assets/File/newsroom/magazine/2015/nov-dec_2015.pdf">research</a>
shows that over 85 percent of the cockroaches don&rsquo;t die from exposing them to Deltamethrin-containing pesticides while also ranking bed bugs as the worst pests.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ve reviewed Harris Boric Acid powder as an effective roach killer. Harris Boric Acid is a historic roach control method, at least the composition&rsquo;s chemical side.
In addition to killing roaches, the boric acid powder will also exterminate other bugs such as silverfish, palmetto bugs, and water bugs.
Boric Acid is highly effective in killing roaches yet also budget-friendly and thus topping the
best roach killers
available today.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Harris Boric Acid Roach Powder&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="special-lure-attractant">Special lure/ Attractant</h2>
<p>Harris
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">boric acid contains a unique lure thatll attract the roaches</a>
to the poison and trick it into feeding o its death. Further, the <a href="/posts/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">cockroaches</a> tend to carry the boric acid back to their nests, causing the secondary
kill effect on the whole roach
colony.
The included straw has a tube-like design thatll allow the homeowner to place the
roach killing
powders to the deepest of the cracks and crevices.�But, being a chemical, boric acid must not be ingested by humans, pets, and livestock as it can be poisonous to them.</p>
<h2 id="condensed-milk-mixture"><strong>Condensed milk mixture�</strong></h2>
<p>It would help if you mixed the boric acid roach killer with condensed milk, creating a thick paste thats highly attractive to top efficiency roaches. This will help confuse some roaches and bugs that will readily avoid eating some
roach baits
with a specific smell, color, or shape.
This roach powder offers high-efficiency rates where you can see dead roaches two days after being applied in the right locations.</p>
<h2 id="harris-boric-acid-works">Harris Boric Acid works</h2>
<p>Youll find this boric acid very simple to use in
killing roaches
and other bugs. On application, youll need to pour a portion of the roach powders into the designated surface. The killers lure will attract the bugs and hence allow the chemical to kill them on contact.
The cockroaches will be dead in the next 48 hours after getting into contact with the boric acid. As noted above, the chemical has a long residue effect lasting even for five days.
Youll need to treat the areas that are difficult to reach, such as under the sofa set, on countertops, in cupboards, and under the refrigerators. Harris Boric Acid is EPA registered, which means its suitable and safe for home use.</p>
<h2 id="is-boric-acid-roach-killer-safe-for-humans--pets">Is Boric Acid roach killer Safe for Humans &amp; Pets?</h2>
<p>Despite that this roach killer is highly toxic to roaches and other insects such as
fleas
and
bed bugs
, the products have low-toxicity levels that would not poison humans and pets (either cats or dogs).
Therefore,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pet-safe-roach-killer/">roach acid will be safe around pets</a>
and humans if it&rsquo;s in low dosages. Further, boric acid causes no carcinogenic impacts on the roaches. However, the boric acid powder must not be used near breastfeeding or nursing women.
Ingesting high amounts of the roach acid powders can cause a coma, seizures, tremors, skin rashes, and diarrhea - and thus, care is paramount. Further, the roach
killing powder
may trigger a burning or irritating feeling on your skin and eyes.
Therefore, when making the boric acid application, you&rsquo;ll need to wear protective goggles and gloves to safeguard and block your eyes, mouth, and nose. However, exposure to low levels of boric acid may cause hives, rashes, burning sensation on your nasal passages, and dry throat.</p>
<h2 id="compareborax-vsboric-acid"><strong>Compare�Borax vs.�Boric Acid�</strong></h2>
<p>First things first, both borax and boric acid are extracted from the mineral boron. Further, you can both of these chemicals to kill roaches and other insects.
But borax is used in toothpaste, laundry detergent, or
dish soap
and kills mildew and molds as a suitable fungicide.
Therefore, borax incorporated in the regular use products comes in low quantities and will pose minimal risk to both pets and human beings. However, you must follow the product label instructions before using this boric acid powder to kill insects such as roaches.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HVLP
(high volume, low pressure) <a href="/posts/best-automotive-hvlp-spray-gun-for-the-money/">spray</a> guns are a popular tool for DIY home renovators and professionals alike. They are efficient and provide a smooth, even finish on surfaces such as walls, furniture, and cabinets.</p>
<p>However, like any tool, <a href="/posts/best-hvlp-spray-gun-for-lacquer/">HVLP</a> spray guns require regular cleaning and maintenance to ensure they continue to function properly.�In this article, we will go through the steps of cleaning an
HVLP spray gun
, so you can keep your tool in top condition.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-an-hvlp-spray-gun">How To Clean an HVLP Spray Gun</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-remove-the-paint-cup-or-container-and-pour-any-remaining-paint-back-into-the-can-or-container"><strong>Step 1: Remove the paint cup or container and pour any remaining paint back into the can or container.</strong></h3>
<p>Before you start cleaning your HVLP spray gun, it&rsquo;s important to make sure that there is no paint left in the cup or container. If there is, pour it back into the can or container for future use.</p>
<p>This will prevent any paint residue from drying and hardening in the cup or container, which can make cleaning more difficult.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-use-a-cleaning-solution-specifically-designed-for-cleaning-paint-spray-guns-such-as-mineral-spirits-or-lacquer-thinner-to-flush-the-paint-out-of-the-gun-if-you-don"><strong>Step 2: Use a cleaning solution specifically designed for cleaning paint spray guns, such as mineral spirits or lacquer thinner, to flush the paint out of the gun.

You can do this by using a cleaning solution specifically designed for cleaning paint spray guns -</h2>
<p>even with undercoat paints
.
These cleaning solutions, such as mineral spirits or lacquer thinner, are effective at breaking down and removing paint residue. If you don&rsquo;t have a cleaning solution, you can use water as an alternative.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-spray-the-cleaning-solution-or-water-through-the-gun-until-it-runs-clear"><strong>Step 3: Spray the cleaning solution or water through the gun until it runs clear.</strong></h3>
<p>Once you have your cleaning solution or water, attach the gun to the cleaning solution container or a bucket of water. Turn on the gun and spray the cleaning solution or water through the gun until it runs clear.</p>
<p>This will flush out any paint residue that may be inside the gun. It is important to keep the gun moving while you are flushing it out, to ensure that all the paint is removed.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-disassemble-the-gun-including-the-tip-and-soak-all-of-the-parts-in-the-cleaning-solution-or-water-for-a-few-minutes"><strong>Step 4: Disassemble the gun, including the tip, and soak all of the parts in the cleaning solution or water for a few minutes.</strong></h3>
<p>The next step is to disassemble the gun. This includes removing the tip, as well as any other parts such as the air cap and fluid nozzle. Once the gun is disassembled, soak all of the parts in the cleaning solution or water for a few minutes. This will allow the cleaning solution or water to break down any paint residue that may be on the parts.</p>
<p>Step 5: Use a brush or a toothbrush to scrub any paint residue from the parts.�After the parts have soaked for a few minutes, take a brush or a toothbrush and scrub any paint residue from the parts.</p>
<p>Make sure to pay attention to the small crevices and grooves, as paint can often get trapped in these areas. Scrubbing the parts will ensure that all the paint is removed, and the gun will be ready for use.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-rinse-the-parts-with-water-and-dry-them-thoroughly-with-a-clean-cloth-or-air-gun"><strong>Step 6: Rinse the parts with water and dry them thoroughly with a clean cloth or air gun.</strong></h3>
<p>Once you have scrubbed all the paint residue off the parts, it&rsquo;s time to rinse them with water. This will remove any remaining cleaning solution or paint residue.</p>
<p>Be sure to rinse the parts thoroughly, so that there is no cleaning solution or paint residue left on them -</p>
<ul>
<li>just like with
swing set stains
. You can then proceed to immerse the gun.
After rinsing, dry the parts thoroughly with a clean cloth or air gun. Drying the parts will prevent rust and ensure that the gun is ready for use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-7-reassemble-the-gun-and-test-it-before-using-it-again"><strong>Step 7: Reassemble the gun and test it before using it again.</strong></h3>
<p>The final step in cleaning your HVLP spray gun is to reassemble it. Make sure that all the parts are properly secured and connected.</p>
<p>Once the gun is reassembled, it is important to test it before using it again. This will ensure that the gun is working properly and that there are no leaks or other issues. If everything is working correctly, your HVLP spray gun is now ready for use.</p>
<p>In addition to regular cleaning, it&rsquo;s also important to keep your gun lubricated. Check the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions for recommended lubricant to use. A lubricated gun will help ensure that it functions smoothly and reduces wear and tear on the parts.</p>
<p>Regular cleaning and maintenance of your HVLP spray gun will help prolong its lifespan and ensure that it continues to provide a smooth, even finish on your projects.</p>
<p>By following these simple steps, you can keep your HVLP spray gun in top condition, so you can continue to tackle your DIY home renovation projects with ease.�Additional Considerations while using the HVLP spray gun</p>
<p>There are some additional points that you should consider when cleaning your HVLP spray gun:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always wear gloves and protective eyewear when cleaning your HVLP spray gun. This will protect your skin and eyes from the chemicals used in cleaning solutions.</li>
<li>Clean your HVLP spray gun immediately after use. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove the paint residue.</li>
<li>Be careful when cleaning the air cap and fluid nozzle. These are delicate parts of the gun and can be easily damaged if not handled properly.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget to clean the paint filter. The paint filter is located inside the gun and is designed to remove any debris or impurities from the paint. A clogged paint filter will affect the quality of the finish.</li>
<li>After cleaning, run some water or cleaning solution through the gun before using it again. This will help ensure that there is no residue left in the gun that could affect the quality of the finish.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also important to regularly check the air cap, fluid nozzle, and needle for wear or damage. These parts can be easily replaced if necessary.</li>
<li>Keep the gun in a dry place, and cover it with a plastic bag when not in use to avoid<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-hvlp-spray-gun-for-woodworking/">dust and debris accumulation</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By following these steps, you can ensure that your HVLP spray gun is clean and functioning properly, which will result in a better quality finish on your painting projects. Additionally, regular cleaning will prolong the life of your gun.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most often, it is hard to identify the best living room <a href="/posts/how-to-prep-a-room-for-paint/">paint</a> colors with brown
furniture
. At some point, some have gone to an extent of terming brown as boring.
Much as this is not true - maybe its time you give it a little more consideration and see what becomes of it with my recommendations.
There are several ways to compliment that brown furniture and give your living <a href="/posts/how-to-soundproof-a-room-cheaply/">room</a> a new and glamorous look.</p>
<h2 id="living-room-paint-colors-with-brown-furniture"><strong>Living Room Paint Colors with Brown Furniture</strong></h2>
<p>Below are different paints that you can consider to make the room more accommodative and less boring.</p>
<h3 id="1-denver-home-remodel">1. Denver Home Remodel</h3>
<p>This involves a combination of brown and gray. The different application of the textured colors bring out a very impressive look.
This combination impressively blends the colors to match the brown furniture.</p>
<h3 id="2-a-brown-floor">2. A Brown Floor</h3>
<p>Not every time you have to get rid of the already existing brown color, sometimes you can decide to make it better.
To achieve this, you can complement the brown floor with a purple or grey wall. This will override and make the floor look great.</p>
<h3 id="3-a-natural-wall">3. A Natural Wall</h3>
<p>To add shade and neutralize the brown furniture effect, a neutral wall will make a great deal.
Depending on how you like it to be, you can either make it to be reflective to draw the attention from the furniture or dampen it to make your furniture the center of attraction
To achieve this, you can use a mixture paints or use a mixture of items too to draw the attention from the furniture. A woven basket a pillow are some good additional that you can use.</p>
<h3 id="4-gray-wall">4. Gray wall</h3>
<p>There are dark grays and light grays too. You can either of the two depending on the theme you want to achieve in your living room.
Gray is a great neutralizer that has over time replaced beige and white. As a substitute for white, you may want to consider shading light gray.
This will lighten up the room and overshadow the brown furniture. For a beige substitute, a darker shade of gray will be very convenient, however be careful not to overdo it to avoid a scenario of an extremely dark room.
However, you can use this to create a perfect calm and dark atmosphere in your bedroom.</p>
<h3 id="5-beige">5. Beige</h3>
<p>Beige is seemingly a cool color. If you do not want a rather bright room, you can use beige.
It equally neutralizes, the brown furniture environment and the same time create a warm atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="6-white-wall">6. White Wall</h3>
<p>Depending on the tone of your brown furniture, you can also decide to introduce white color in the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-undercoat-paint/">walls of your living room</a>
.
By this, you create a clean environment white in turn reflects the nature of your room.
Being a bright color, it shout more and draws the attention more than the brown furniture therefore neutralizing it.</p>
<h3 id="7-red-color">7. Red color</h3>
<p>When you are considering painting your walls, think of the effect a red color would bring in the in the living room.
If your furniture is dark brown, doing a deep red color with dampen the room or even make it look small. Alternatively, you can also chose to have either a bright red or a deep red.
As for a bright red, combining it with golden or white accents will brighten and diverge the attention from the furniture.</p>
<h3 id="8-yellow">8. Yellow</h3>
<p>Yellow is such a fantastic color to use especially in the living room. It has a unique way of bringing excitement into the room. However, not everyone wants to make their rooms this vibrant.
In this regard, using muted portions of the yellow color blended or rather a golden yellow for that case, will leave your living room well lit up and with the brown furniture virtually visible.</p>
<h3 id="9-white-colored-ceiling">9. White Colored Ceiling</h3>
<p>If you are still scared of that brown furniture on your living room, maybe you should consider having a white ceiling to minimize on its attention.
The white ceiling will greatly light up the room and take away any attention drawn by the brown furniture.
To be on the safer side, you need to learn the art to balance the two to avoid the scenario of one overriding the other.
Choosing a brighter white is also dependent on how you want your living room to be, bright and warm.</p>
<h3 id="10-colored-throw-pillows">10. �Colored Throw Pillows</h3>
<p>Another way to way the attention of the brown furniture is use of colored pillows. Choosing either mixed color or singling out a particular color will be based on your preference.
Apart from the throw pillows, you can also choose to use either colored blankets to draw the attention form the furniture from seemingly dull furniture.</p>
<h3 id="11-colored-curtains">11. Colored Curtains</h3>
<p>Your curtains can be another source of diluting the color of the brown furniture in your living room.
At this point, you can use them to warm up the room and make it more cheerful.
A mustard yellow, a burnt orange are among the few colors you can use on your curtains to make it more exciting.</p>
<h3 id="12-blue-walls">12. Blue walls</h3>
<p>Having a blue can make a good turning point from the brown furniture. What I like about the color is that you can also blend or mix it with white to make the room brighter.
Another alternative, is a dark blue color which can bring out exceptional beauty to your living room.
White tulips on the blue walls will also play an essential role in illuminating the room.</p>
<h3 id="13-green">13. Green</h3>
<p>If you are a great fan of green color, you dont have to feel left out on blending your brown furniture with the color.
My favorite is deep forest green because of the way it harmoniously creates a jungle environment when it blends with brown.
I prefer this on the walls combined with a rusty pattern to make the room more warm and glamorous.
You can also choose a light green shade in the guest room.� This will be an excellent choice to harmonize the natures main colors green and brown.
To relax and calm your guests, this will be the perfect way to decongest and cool down any form of noise.</p>
<h3 id="14-cream">14. Cream</h3>
<p>In order to create a unique flow in the room, cream paint is an excellent choice for that.
What is amazing about cream is that you can combine it with white to pull the attention from the brown furniture.
If the living room is overcrowded, you can use this color to create a comfortable environment.</p>
<h3 id="15-gold">15. Gold</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a rich and a gorgeous color, this is perfect match for you. This will be a good match for your brown furniture.
You can also use this color on other surfaces like blue, red, or even green color.
Apart from using it on walls, you can also use it on frames to give your room a fine touch.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Brown is a great color and if you are looking for the best living room paint colors with brown furniture, then you already have an answer.
As listed above, the color ideas gives you the multiple options of colors to apply to either on your walls, ceiling or living room in general to match and blend with your brown furniture.
These color options will give your living room different styles that can be interpreted differently depending on what you want.</p>

want to use all/)
harsh ingredients as this may harm your pets - including cats and dogs.
<strong>Check these pet safe cockroach killers.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Roach Baits&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-rid-of-roaches-without-harming-pets">How Do I Get Rid Of Roaches Without Harming Pets?</h2>
<p>Roaches can be found anywhere but they seem to love warm, moist places like bathrooms and kitchens where food spills happen often.
Here we will give some tips on how to get rid of roaches without harming pets?
<strong>1. Prevention</strong>
Sealing up all entry points like loose-fitting door openings can be an important step in preventing roaches from entering the house. Also, keep your counters and floors clean to avoid attracting roaches.
Do not leave pet food out where a roach can jump in from a surrounding counter. Garbage containers should be kept inside and secure, preferably in airtight containers.
Remove clutter like paper, books, and old clothes in your home so that cockroaches will have less of a chance to infest. Also, clean garbage disposals and sink strainers often.
<strong>2. Roach Traps</strong>
There are a few different types of roach traps that can be used to capture and kill these roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>One is the glue trap, which you just place in an area where there have been sightings of them (such as under or near kitchen appliances).</li>
<li>They get stuck on this sticky surface when they try to cross it. You can then dispose of the captured bugs by simply peeling off the cardstock backing.
Grease bowl traps work by luring roaches in with bait, such as bacon or ham. They are then trapped by a lip on the bowl and cannot get out so they die of starvation.
These traps should be placed where there is an infestation to cut down on their numbers before you try any other type of trap for catching them.
<strong>3. Baits</strong>
This type of roach trap uses poison gel baits that do not harm pets but will kill these bugs within hours after coming into contact with it.
Roach baits
that do not pose a danger to your pets since their ingredients are enclosed in some sealed container.
Put the
boric acid roach Trap
near corners, cracks, or under appliances where you have seen them.
Roach baits work by attracting these bugs and they then eat the bait that contains a fast-acting, slow-killing poison.
This gives you time to find out how roaches are entering your house and control them with more efficient methods.
<strong>4. Boric Acid</strong>
Boric acid is an inexpensive roach killer. It is generally used as an outer perimeter treatment around the perimeters of homes, apartments, or businesses to prevent pests from entering.
It can also be applied inside as bait for German cockroaches only - the
borax
will not kill other roaches such as American, Brown-Banded, or Oriental Roaches.</li>
<li>A little borax goes a long way with this natural product that has been shown in various studies to be up to 95% effective against all types of household insects including ants, fleas beetles, weevils, etc.
In addition, it&rsquo;s safe on plants and won&rsquo;t harm any pets you may have at your home. This makes it one less thing you need to worry about when it comes to pest control.</li>
<li>One reason for this is because bugs are highly attracted to its taste due to the sugar content which makes them take it back into their nest where they then pass it onto others making a chain reaction of death from within.
<strong>5. Diatomaceous Earth</strong>
Diatomaceous earth (&ldquo;food grade&rdquo; option) is a natural product made from the fossilized remains of diatoms that are ground up into dust.
Diatomaceous earth
can be used around pets to deter roaches, but it needs to be applied often.
But theres still some limited risk for your pet if they go outside or lick their fur after walking on dirt where DE has been applied.
Apply the Diatomaceous Earth in the areas where you have seen cockroaches.
It will work as a repellant for them and they wont be able to cross it without feeling that their exoskeleton is being scratched by the DE particles.
You can sprinkle enough food-grade Diatomaceous Earth all over your house (in corners or along walls), it should keep roaches away from your home altogether!</li>

<p>Diatomaceous earth is an active and non-toxic roach killer. It&rsquo;s safe and is used in most pets&rsquo; pesticides. Sprinkle this roach killer in all cockroaches&rsquo; habitats.
[amazon box=&ldquo;B01D60GAW2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
You can also apply the pesticide in areas such as crevices, cracks, or any other potential places, including behind household appliances.
After applying the pesticide, it&rsquo;ll leave a white powder trail that contains algae fossils remains.
This composition will cut the pest&rsquo;s exoskeleton, and thus killing them. Diatomaceous earth is user-friendly, and you don&rsquo;t have to wear protective clothing while handling it.
About 5-7 days after the treatment, there&rsquo;ll be many cockroaches all over the house as they search for water.
This is due to the dehydration effect on roaches caused by the pesticide. Thus, it&rsquo;s essential to fix any leaking pipes or drain stagnant water to
combat roaches&rsquo;
invasion.
However, Diatomaceous may not be useful in wet or damp spaces. Sprinkle the product only in the areas free from water or other liquids.
Sometimes cockroaches can be difficult to eliminate from your home because they adapt to almost all environmental conditions.
They can coexist with people who drive food and shelter, feeding on unattended cereals, leftovers, or juices. Previously, I reviewed the high-grade roach killers and

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s a Pure Lye Drain Opener Review - I am here in my basement, and the sink drain has been clogged for a few weeks. Definitely, the sink now has serious stuff such as oils, grease, and debris. I can already smell the bad odor since the water has been standing for a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this post, Ill be going through tips on using the Pure LyeDrain Openerto unclog slow-moving drains.</li>
<li>However, the caveat is that this cleaner, despite being among the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">top drain cleaners</a>,�is not as effective on a totally clogged drain. However, you can use it tounclog a bathtub that has standing water.
<strong>Precautions</strong>
: Ensure you wear disposable rubber gloves and safety goggles while ensuring that the rooms are adequately ventilated.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Pure Lye Drain Opener&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="natural-drain-cleaner"><strong>Natural drain cleaner�</strong></h2>
<p>The Pure Lye Drain Opener is a pure white formula that is a natural remedy for your clogged drain and sewer full of odor. Pure Lye allows you to do away with the pungent vapors and fumes that come from a
clogged drain
. Its safe to use either in restaurants, hospitals, educational institutions, and households.
I noticed that the finely shaped and small lye beads work great for PVC and metal pipes, chrome trims, and bath fixtures. The green/ eco-friendly clog remover contains almost 100% biodegradable formula with no bad odors, toxic chemicals, acids, or dyes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chOsY3ynFDE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chOsY3ynFDE</a></p>
<h2 id="works-in-all-drain-types">Works in all drain types</h2>
<p>Pure Lye
Drain Opener is powerful enough
to unclog quickly�(in about 15  30 minutes) all types of septic systems, sewer lines, sinks drains, and shower/ bathtub drains. Also, make sure you pour some hot or warm water down the drain so that you warm (or almost there) the pipes. This will make the lye cleaner function better by quickly activating it.
Youll require to begin with just a few lye tablespoons, and when the water starts going down, you can now add some more over the clogged drain. Finally, pour some hot or warm water to dissolve the lye and activate it.
Now allow the lye to work on the clogged drain for about 15 - 30 minutes. Definitely, some cracking sounds will be coming off the clogged
drain as the lye cleaner
does its work. Finally, pour additional hot water to clean the slow-moving drain fully.</p>
<h2 id="is-lye-drain-cleaner-safe-for-pipes">Is lye drain cleaner safe for pipes?</h2>
<p>Lye (in chemical terms described as caustic soda/ sodium hydroxide) is considered a reliable drain clog remover. However, some homeowner has understandable fears that it would be too powerful for drain pipes. This is because the chemical is also used on an industrial scale for a cleaning agent or different purposes.
However, to settle this debate, I have to say that this lye
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner</a>
could corrode your pipes if you dont use the right concentration (as described in the product label instructions). Therefore, it will be helpful if you use the right concentration to protect your plumbing systems.</p>
<h3 id="polyvinyl-chloride-pvc-pipes"><strong>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes�</strong></h3>
<p>PVC pipes are made from some form of thermoplastic polymer that is cheap and strong enough to withstand weather changes and some chemicals in your plumbing system.
Also, PVC will not react with most chemicals and is light, which implies that the lye clog remover wont corrode its pipes.�To get a great glimpse of such reactions, check this
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/">guide on how drain cleaners work</a>
.</p>
<h4 id="corrosive-to-metal-pipes-">**Corrosive to metal pipes? **</h4>
<p>Although PVC pipes can resist corrosion from the lye chemical, weve noted that its important to avoid very high concentrations beyond the recommendation on the product label instructions.
Also, lye can corrode some metals due to its caustic nature. You must also not mix the lye drain cleaner with different chemicals like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/drano-max-gel-clog-remover-review/">Drano Max Gel Clog Remover</a>
.</p>
<h4 id="caustic-lye"><strong>Caustic Lye�</strong></h4>
<p>As noted above, lye is a caustic alkali base with its pH being 7.0 or more. Therefore, despite not being an acid, a strong chemical concentration would still corrode the PVC pipes. Notably, some of the lye cleaners will be mixed with different quantities of aluminum.</p>

Interestingly, you wont need to mix the chemical with anything as it is delivered ready to use. In this post, I&rsquo;ve reviewed this PIRANHA Wipe N Spray which is among the
<em>best fly spray for horses.�</em>

Flies will particularly be rampant during the months of summer  particularly with areas that experience hot summers and mild winters. With this Pyranha

, you can easily control the flies and bugs attacking your horse.
Definitely, with its conspicuously yellow bottle, its easy to identify this horse product even in your local store. I have to reveal that I first tested this
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/ecosmart-organic-horse-fly-knockdown-repellent-review/">horse fly</a>
spray after I saw very many horse owners with the yellow bottle during different shows.</p>
<h2 id="pyrethrin-based-fly-spray">Pyrethrin-based fly spray</h2>
<p>It is a pyrethrin-based fly spray which makes it&rsquo;s super effective. In addition, it comes with lanolin (with high sheen), an ingredient thatll leave your horses coat shining amazingly. This lanolin acts like the coat conditioner while the spray also has a citronella scent. Therefore, recently when I attended a horse show, I didnt require to purchase an additional horse product for extra shine.</p>
<h2 id="ergonomic-bottle-design">Ergonomic bottle design</h2>
<p>You can use a towel of mitt for the horses face or just spray all over the other parts of the animals body. In addition to having the gallon refill options, this fly spray has an ergonomic bottle designs thats easy to hold and use.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-pyranha-wipe-n-spray-fly-">**How to use PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly **</h2>
<p>**Wiping **</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the horse using a brush to clear all the dust and dirt for its coat. This will ensure that no spray is wasted on useless objects such as being taken up by dust.</li>
<li>Next up, just moisten the soft cloth you have using the PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly and finally rub it over the horses hair  make sure your wiping strokes are going against the animals hair growth.</li>
<li>Its important to ensure you seriously spray critical areas such as shanks, shoulders, and legs in addition to giving the animals face area the required attention.
**Spraying **</li>
<li>On spraying the PYRANHA Wipe N Spray, youll need to create a mist of the product that will reach the critical areas of the horse.</li>
<li>However, avoid spraying horses face since it could affect its eyes  therefore youll need to use the wiping method above.</li>
<li>In addition, you must not we the skin of your horse and must not go over 2 oz. for every fly spray application.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-i-love-this-pyranha-wipe-n-spray-fly"><strong>Why I love this PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Well, this PYRANHA Wipe N Spray truly
kills fleas
, gnats, mosquitos in addition to other dominant insects that tend to attack horses. Definitely, with this spray I dont have to re-spraying my horse since it will actively control the flies for about 1 week.</li>
<li>After using the spray I noticed that my horse immediately tends to become less irritable with lesswagging of its tail.Luckily, this formula controls/ repel more than just the flies that you were initially targeting.
3.�The fly spray will not irritate your horses skin. Further, its cost-effective as youll require less number of spray re-applications. However, you must not wet the horse.</li>
<li>Further, as noted above, PYRANHA Wipe N Spray contains lanolin thatll ease the dryness or in your horses skin, even with the chapped skin. Further, as I noted earlier, this lanolin ingredient left the horses coat shining, healthy and soft.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-downsides-of-thispyranha-wipe-n-spray-fly">The downsides of this<strong>PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly�</strong></h2>
<p>Despite all the love I have for this spray, below I outline some of the cons I experienced (this is for total transparency).
For dirty, sandy, or dusty areas, you might find out that upon applying the fly spray, dirt could s stick on your horse. Therefore, if youre in a horse show, you might require to constantly need to wipe your horses skin.
Second, some horse owners may not like the smell (the strong citronella scent we discussed earlier) of this PYRANHA Wipe N Spray�product. However, this is not the case with all of us out here  the best you can do is to test it as you night also love the citronella scent like myself.</p>

<a href="https://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/household/brands?tbl=brands&amp;id=19001023">Raid Ant &amp; Roach Killer</a>
that will readily exterminate roaches and other insects such as ants, just like the
Harris Boric acid
and other
best roach killers
.
Most homeowners will love the lemon scent in this roach killer, which will ensure that no foul odors are left behind.
The roach spray kills on contact; it has a fast roach and ant killer whose residue effect will last for about four weeks but lacks the secondary kill effect in
roach baits
.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Raid Ant Roach Killer Insecticide Spray&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="active-ingredients---raid-ant-roach-killer-insecticide-spray-review">Active Ingredients - Raid ant roach killer insecticide spray review</h2>
<p>This roach killing spray is made from Imiprothrin (0.100%) and Cypermethrin (0.100%), the ingredient thatll kill both ants and roaches on contact.
Most homeowners also use the roach killing aerosol like an indoor residual spray to prevent roaches and ants from getting into your house for about one month. The spray dries fast, will leave no oily residue or foul odor in the place due to the fantastic lemon scent.</p>
<h2 id="effectivenessagainst-roach-colony">Effectiveness�against Roach Colony</h2>
<p>Raid Ant &amp;
Roach Killer will not be effective in killing
the roach colony or their queen. The
roach killer
will clear the smaller roach invasions.
However, homeowners require reapplying the insect
killer if youre trying to control a significant ant
or roach infestation. Compared to roach baits that demand a lot of patients, sprays are instant killing on contact.</p>
<h2 id="dont-spray-near-dishes-or-food">Don&rsquo;t Spray Near Dishes or Food.</h2>
<p>As outlined earlier, its active ingredients are cypermethrin and imiprothrin, which are very popular and influential in
killing roaches/)
and ants.� But you must not spray near dishes, food, human beings, or pets as this could cause dangerous poisoning.
The spray is poisonous when swallowed, and you must not allow it to get into contact with your skin. Also, dont inhale the spray vapors or mist while applying around and in the home.
However, you should ensure that the spray mist gets into all the crevices and cracks where roaches and ants could have entered. Therefore, the roach
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fire-%5Bant%5D(/posts/ant-control-in-bellingham/)-killer-for-lawns/">killer will additionally create a</a>
protective barrier against ants, spiders, and roaches.</p>
<h2 id="roaches-and-infestations">Roaches and Infestations</h2>
<p>Roaches invade�your�home just like a joke - slow but sure. First, they&rsquo;ll occupy the small crevices and crack that are already on your kitchen&rsquo;s cupboard, countertops, and�baseboard.
In their infant stages, you might confuse the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">baby roaches</a>
to something like ants such that they&rsquo;ll completely hide in the cracks.
When some roaches find some food crumbs around the house, they&rsquo;ll go back to their
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/">nests and come with the other roaches</a>
to eat. That&rsquo;s how they feed, then reproduce to create a whole roach colony in your house.
Cleaning and doing general repairs in your house can help reduce the possibility of roaches attacking. Ensure that you wash the dishes and clean the cupboard and countertops. Further, use the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">best drain cleaners</a>
to make sure the drainages are free-flowing.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-forraid-ant--roach-killer">Alternatives for�Raid Ant &amp; Roach Killer</h2>
<p>Maybe this
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bengal-roach-spray-review/">roach spray</a>
might not work for you, depending on your house&rsquo;s unique conditions or the attacking roach species.
Therefore, I would recommend that you try other roach control solutions such as roach gel, roach baits, and roach traps.
Raid roach traps would essentially have some holes where the roaches would drop to a waiting container - it would be great if you placed on the kitchen�countertops.</p>

<li>Termite Tent fumigation- This fumigation technique is rarely used nowadays. But Rentokil notes that they can offer this service whenever required. Therefore, I would recommend you have a budget upwards of $15,000.</li>
<li>UsingLiquid barrier termite treatments- These liquid treatments will be upwards of� $2,000 but this varies will the size of the home. However, Rentokil may require that you place a 10% deposit.</li>
<li>Spot treatments - The spot treatment for termites offered by this exterminator will range from $700 - $2,000. The exterminators will use liquid foam treatments, crevice &amp; crack applications, and spraying.</li>
<li>Bait stations - Despite that experts discourage using termite baits alone, a number of homeowners may still order their use for prevention purposes. Youll be charged around $300 - $600 for thetermite bait station.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Since the company has about 100 years of experience in bug control, its technicians have developed innovative and expert strategies for pest control worldwide.</p>
<ul>
<li>The company outlines its mission as offering protection and enhancing the lives of residents through providing sustainable and efficient pest control.</li>

<ul>

First, ensure to cover and protect yourself the best you can as you are
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">treating the cat for fleas</a>
.</li>
<li>For example, if you aren&rsquo;t well protected, the fleas may jump from the pet onto your skin.
Also, conduct a thorough inspection of the pet (for the hotspots of the fleas) prior to applying the revolution flea treatment.</li>
<li>Finally, avoid over-applying the flea medication as this could lead to skin burning and irritation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-pets-weight">1. Pets weight</h3>
<p>As you are starting the flea treatment journey, determine the weight of the pet and the appropriate dosage.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s important that you don&rsquo;t miss or exit the dosage you offered to your cat.
Also, experts recommend that you Revolution, cats that are 6 + weeks old and only administer it once a month.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-active-ingredients">2. Active ingredients</h3>
<p>Before you purchase a flea treatment from the local stores you must check the active ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if your cat has a specific allergy, ensure to check if the product&rsquo;s active ingredients will affect them.
Further, examine if the dosage of the active ingredient in the products is appropriate for your cat.
Also, check on the safety of the products&rsquo; active ingredients, comparing them to the health, age, and weight of the cat.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-products-expiry-date">3. Products expiry date</h3>

Manufacturers and stockists can play tricks when it comes to non-prescription revolution flea Killers.</p>
<ul>
<li>So check the product&rsquo;s expiry date label and if it is not there take that pack.
Besides you should purchase revolution and other cat products from a reliable and trusted brand.

</ul>
<h2 id="a-sneak-peek-into-fleas-on-your-cat">A sneak peek into fleas on your Cat</h2>
<p>Fleas follow the same life cycle and stages as butterflies. But why do you love butterflies and hate fleas?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, fleas will bite pets and humans to leave them with pain and even infections that may affect their health.
Also, fleas are quite challenging to control due to their hardness as they will survive even at 37 degrees Fahrenheit.
On reproduction, fleas are fast at creating a massive population in a small space provided they have a suitable blood meal.
Finally, here are the critical flea facts that you should know as you are using revolution.</li>
<li>About 3 - 4 cat fleas (females), if they&rsquo;re taking four blood meals daily, will cause about 1500 + flea bites within 4 months.</li>
<li>Flea dirt or the flea&rsquo;s body waste will be the food that the flea larvae will eat to achieve effective development.</li>
<li>Also, if you have seen an adult flea in your space or on the pet, be sure that there is another flea population that is hiding.
Usage directions for evolution Plus in treating fleas
For safety purposes, you must not use revolution Plus to control fleas on kittens that are under 8 weeks or also have a weight of between 2.5 - 7.5 kg.
You must not also apply Revolution Plus on the areas of the pet that have scratches, fresh wounds, or broken skin.</li>
<li>After applying the flea control remedy, don&rsquo;t bathe the pet within 24 hours as this may minimize its effectiveness.
However, even if the pets have ear mites inside their ears, you must not apply revolution class inside the ears.</li>

Finally, remember to keep the Revolution class away from any fire or heat sources since it is flammable.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>So, the non-prescription Revolution Plus for controlling fleas in cats is a great savior.
Besides, revolution plus will also help exterminate intestinal worms, ear mites, and heartworms.</li>

      <description>It is important to go for a primer that will be compatible with your paint and the surface if you want a professional look - and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve reviewed t...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is important to go for a primer that will be compatible with your paint and the surface if you want a professional look - and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve reviewed the <a href="/posts/rustoleum-rust-reformer-review/">Rustoleum</a> Galvanized Metal Primer below.
If you are a pro, you will clearly understand the challenges of painting non-primed galvanized metal.�After drying, the paint easily peels off when subjected to adverse weather and direct sunlight.
<em>In brief: Rust-Oleum (e.g. Rust-Oleum 3202) removes rust easily by creating great�adhesion on galvanized surfaces and aluminum - it&rsquo;s also simple to clean using water + soap. But the surface must be prepared, cleaned - including spot-welded and unpainted sheet metal.�</em></p>
<h2 id="details-rustoleum-galvanized-metal-primer">Details: Rustoleum Galvanized Metal Primer</h2>
<h3 id="1-rust-oleum-flat-aluminum-primer-8781502---corrosion-resistant"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000C018C2/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Rust-Oleum Flat Aluminum Primer-8781502 - Corrosion-Resistant</a></h3>
<p>For the best Galvanized Metal Primer, the flat aluminum primer will be a great deal for you. W
hats fascinating about this primer is its resistant to corrosion and tough weather. This is to means that you can use it on both interior and exterior surfaces. It also works best on all galvanized steel and aluminum metals.</p>
<p>Being a water-based primer, it leaves behind both a protective and long-lasting coat that keeps your surface rust-free.
This is only achievable through the excellent adhesion that makes it hold strong for longer no matter the condition it is exposed to.
The gray color and flat finish will give your surface an incredible look. From its formulation, this primer has a low odor but that does not limit you from using protective gears when doing your spray.
This primer will take approximately 1-2 hours for it to dry and ready to touch. And one quart can cover a range of 55-90 square ft. but that depends on the
surface texture
.
Being a latex-based paint, it means you can use this primer on most surfaces that are incompatible with latex paints. Did I mention that this primer also helps make your surface withstand flaking and blistering and even prevents the paint from peeling off?
In case of spillage, you can easily clean-up the primer with water and soap without necessarily rubbing off the paint. You can use a brush, a roller, or a sprayer to apply this primer but you may need to do thinning if you want to achieve a professional finish.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast drying</li>
<li>Has low odor</li>
<li>Suitable on aluminum and galvanized metals</li>
<li>Easy clean-up</li>
<li>Easy application</li>
<li>Compatible with both water and oil-based paints
Cons:</li>
<li>There are chances of the spray gun clogging if proper thinning of the paint is not done.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lMIGtFWbic">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lMIGtFWbic</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-why-do-priming-on-the-galvanized-surface-before-painting">2. Why do priming on the galvanized surface before painting?</h3>
<p>As a painter, you can carry out the painting with or without priming and it will still hold, but how durable is it?
If indeed you want the paint to adhere to the galvanized surface well, then priming the surface will be very necessary.
Additionally, you may also need to clean-up the surface thoroughly from dust, rust, and any other dirt just for the primer to adhere well.</p>
<h3 id="3-prime--paint-aluminum-and-galvanized-metals-with-rust-oleum">3. Prime &amp; paint aluminum and galvanized metals with Rust-Oleum</h3>
<p>You can apply this primer by either
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-deck-stain-for-pressure-treated-wood/">spraying</a>
, brushing, or rolling. However, spraying remains the most appropriate method of application.
You can also find this primer in two forms either a spray can and in liquid form.
Before application, you may need to do thinning if you really need to achieve a professional finish. How do you do thinning? Well, a recommended ratio of 2:1 for primer and thinner respectively is advised.
In case you are using the spray gun, a 1.4 nozzle tip is the most appropriate if you target to achieve a professional finish.
You can use any thinning material but I can recommend you use acetone for much better results.</p>
<h4 id="i-cleaning-the-surface">i. Cleaning the surface</h4>
<p>Cleaning the surface is not necessary but driven by need.
For a surface with rust, old paints, dust, and other dirt cleaning are necessary for proper surface adhesion.
You can use sandpaper or any other cleaning agent and clean the surface before priming.</p>
<h4 id="ii-priming-the-surface">ii. Priming the surface</h4>
<p>As earlier discussed, a sprayer is the most appropriate for use in priming aluminum and galvanized metal surfaces.
To avoid clogging use a 1.4mm spraying nozzle tip and ensure the primer is well thinned before application.
Get a good sprayer that should be able to spray all patterns to minimize wastage of paints and primer.</p>
<h4 id="iii-painting-the-primed-dry-surface">iii. Painting the primed dry surface</h4>
<p>Getting the right paint for the primed surface is very important. This is because some paints might be incompatible with the primer and therefore rendering the whole process futile.
However, top of our recommendation is Rust-Oleum Flat Aluminum Primer-8781502 primer that is incredibly compatible with most paint whether water or oil-based.</p>
<h4 id="iv-painting-the-galvanized-and-primed-surface">iv. Painting the galvanized and primed surface</h4>
<p>When you have done proper priming,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-deck-sealer-for-pressure-treated-wood/">painting</a>
becomes an easy task for you, and you are only left with deciding the choice of color to go for.
A well-primed surface will pave way for easy painting with either a roller, brush or even a sprayer depending on the surface and your objective too.</p>
<h2 id="can-this-primer-work-on-any-metal">Can this primer work on any metal?</h2>
<p>This primer is specially designed for aluminum and galvanized metals.
To qualify the metals for application of this primer, you may need to galvanize the first for later priming.
Galvanizing the metals is done to make them rust-proof which makes all metals qualify for this primer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It has been a pleasure going through Rust-Oleum galvanized metal primer review together. I hope it was informative enough and has given you the courage to buy it.
With nearly 69% of metals recycled each year in the US and Rust-Oleum Flat Aluminum Primer-8781502 becomes a very great product to this effect.
You are guaranteed both durability and quality that gives you the confidence to use this primer.</p>

      <description>Finding a decent</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a decent
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaner</a>
is difficult. Most options on the market are far too expensive. And those that you can afford are often limited in the functions they can perform.
So you have to purchase multiple types and brands of drain cleaners to sufficiently cater to your homes entire plumbing system.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-thethrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner">+What is the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/THRIFT-T-600-Alkaline-Granular-Cleaner/dp/B00E1N09JO?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=2b4aec92d6fd01239eb8ccd0c93edf67&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner</a>?</h2>
<p>Thrift T-600 is an acid-free drain cleaner. In other words, it can eliminate the organic matter that clogs your <a href="/posts/best-drain-cleaner/">drains</a> without using acidic components.
The Thrift T-600 cleaner stands out because it provides four
cleaning solutions
where other <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> cleaners only cater to one or two disparate issues.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner">+Why You Need the Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner?</h2>
<p>Clogging is unavoidable. Human activity is designed to produce the sort of waste that debilitates a plumbing system&rsquo;s functions. You can neither prevent nor guard against clogging.
Every time you shower, you shed hair. This is particularly problematic if you live in a home with multiple women. But even if the hair wasnt a problem, any bath you take will probably involve soap, shampoo, or some detergent.</p>
<p>Soap scum and bath oils are common causes of clogging. The same can be said for the grease that pours down the drain of your kitchen sink every time you wash your plates after a scrumptious dinner.
Over time, all that grease and soap scum and hair and bath oils will accumulate to create blockages. The symptoms are difficult to miss. You will notice that the water in your
sink drains
slower than usual and that the drain even spits back food particles every once in a while.
If you allow the situation to deteriorate without taking action, your drains will stop working altogether.
Now, people are quick to reach out to plumbers who often waste no time in opening all the pipes and deploying their drain snakes whenever this happens.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/">Drain cleaners</a>
like the Thrift T-600 generally make all that chaos unnecessary. If you hate the mess that the unclogging process attracts, you can pour a drain cleaner down your pipes and sewers and then sit back and wait for it to do all the work.
It sounds like a lazy approach to the problem, but it works. You dont really need any technical plumbing knowledge. Anyone can deploy the Thrift T-600 Drain cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner-do">+What Does the Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner Do?</h2>
<p>The Thrift T-600 cleaner comes in a 6-pound bottle filled with dry, odorless crystals. To deploy the cleaner, pour the crystals down the drain and then pour hot water.
The hot water will activate the crystals, and the crystals will liquefy all the hair and the grease clogging your drains.
It is that simple. There are no unique drain snakes required, no plumbers that you need to hire to dismantle and re-configure your pipes.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-the-thrift-t-600-drain-cleaner-so-special">+What Makes the Thrift T-600 Drain Cleaner so Special?</h2>
<h3 id="-pros">+ Pros</h3>
<p>1). You can find plenty of drain cleaners on the market that works on either sewer lines, grease traps, septic systems, or drains. But this product applies to all four areas. Drain cleaners are rarely that multi-functional.
2). The cleaner works so quickly. Expect results in as little as sixty seconds. This is as opposed to other products that require several hours.
3). Despite its efficacy as a drain cleaner that eats hair and grease, the Thrift T-600 will only affect organic matter. It wont eat acrylic, fiberglass, or any other delicate components. As such, you can use it on kitchen and bathroom surfaces without worry.
4). The drain cleaner is not disruptive. Whereas many other drain cleaners produce dangerous fumes, this one doesnt even have much odor. So you can use it in hospitals, schools and the like without causing distress.
5). The product is straightforward to use. Just pour the crystals and then add hot water.
6). The crystal format makes the drain cleaner safer to use.</p>
<h3 id="-cons">+ Cons</h3>
<p>1). The drain cleaner is quite expensive.
2). Even though it is supposed to be less disruptive, the drain cleaner still produces toxic vapors when it is in use. If you come too close to the drain, the vapor will irritate your eyes and nose.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner-work-on-toilets">+Does, the Thrift T-600 Alkaline, Based Drain Cleaner Work on Toilets?</h2>
<p>This product works so well that it is easy to see why some people might be tempted to use it in their toilet. But the drain cleaner only activates when hot water is applied.
So even if you got the crystals in place, you have no way of running hot water over them in a toilet. More importantly, even the packaging warns you against using the drain cleaner on toilet bowls and garbage disposals.
That being said, if you have the plumbing experience and can afford to pull the toilet up, the Thrift T-600 could work for you.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">+Verdict</h2>
<p>Drain Cleaners might be a dime a dozen today, but it is easy to see why this one draws so much attention.
You wont find that many drain cleaners on the market that come in crystal format, only require hot water to activate, and can liquefy hair and grease in 60 seconds without ruining your polished brass, porcelain, and chrome trim, plastic, or even the metal pipes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below I discuss what it truly means to have <a href="/posts/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/">Bad</a> Knees? I was yearning to stay active, but I didnt have my ever strong knees.
&ldquo;Bad knees&rdquo;  the root of most of my fitness challenges  is a collection of injuries that occur to the knee.
The injuries are classified into two: (1) traumatic/ acute injuries and (2) overuse injuries - check these

<h2 id="what-it-truly-means-to-have-bad-knees">What it truly means to have Bad Knees?</h2>
<p>Most people, experience the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome">patellar pain syndrome</a>
, a kind of knee overuse injury, which involves pain, soreness, and discomfort at the fore and below the kneecap.
Due to bad knees, I was hesitant to do lower body days or even work out the legs since all thought of with the lunges and squats was the pain or additional injury it would cause if I didnt do it right.</p>
<p>You can take different movements that would work your posterior chain to allow the hamstrings and glutes to prevent knee pain.
However, the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/FrameWork-Knee-6-Step-Preventing-Injury/dp/1605295930/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;ascsub&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=873671e9e1be6d13419f783a68892104">book</a>
by Nicholas notes that bad knees occur due to overloading the joint with repetitive movements such as excessive lunges, squats, and running, mainly with limited recovery time.</p>
<ul>
<li>If done right and with the correct intensity, duration, and frequency, the above exercises can help improve your bad knee by strengthening muscles supporting the knees like quads, hamstrings, and glutes.
Things youll need to avoid: an abrupt change in your workouts such as everyday training, going to a crazy workout or gymnasium or increasing your runs or racing coverage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="traumatic-or-acute-injury">Traumatic or Acute Injury</h2>
<p>The acute bad knee injury happens because of twisting action or trauma. The amount of pain experienced will depend on the mechanism of induction and its severity. However, avoid excessively strenuous exercise as they could advance the knee injury and pain.</p>
<h3 id="a-anterior-cruciate-ligament-acl-sprain">(a) Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sprain</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury">ACL</a>sprains happened regularly in sports that entail sudden directional changes such as contact sports. Such an injury could also include, knee joint injury and swelling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-a-medial-ligament-mcl-sprain">(b) A medial ligament MCL sprain</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament">MCL</a>injury is characterized by a ligament tear in the inner side of the knee. MCL injury happens because of twisting and impact motion. However, MCL sprain could also emerge due to knee joint twisting or falling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-patella-tendon-rupture">(c) Patella tendon rupture</h3>
<ul>
<li>An injury characterized by a &lsquo;pop&rsquo; sound? The Patella tendon ruptures are also highly painful. Sadly the injury could rapture for the aged people and those with jumpers knee.</li>
<li>The bad knee will swell mainly above the tendon and below the knee.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-remedies">Any remedies</h2>
<p>Most of the outlined bad knees issue listed above can be prevented by keeping your bad knee safe.</p>
<h3 id="appropriate-exercises">Appropriate exercises</h3>
<p>Notably, your bad knee will not love an intensive workout. Therefore, youll have to shift the workout plan to make the knee to familiarise.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may begin with working out or exercising for about 3 days per week. During this period, you can increase the workout time and intensity while considering your bodys reaction.</li>
<li>If, you&rsquo;ll be jogging or running, ensure you acquire the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/">right shoes for bad knees</a>.�As we had noted earlier, it is essential to take breaks in your workout plans to give your bad knee enough time to recover.</li>
<li>Therefore, for our current workout plan, you can take about 2 resting days during which time the body will recover.
Notably, avoid rushing to a new sport without training the relevant muscles. For example, if youll be starting tennis in the next month, ensure you strength train relevant muscles, which will prepare you to handle the physical stress resulting from the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="balance-your-workouts">Balance your workouts</h3>
<p>Like your proper and healthy diet, exercises should come in a balanced manner. Therefore, avoid following a similar workout plan over and over again: itll weaken your joints, and its monotonous too.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UxUfRb619A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UxUfRb619A</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Therefore, bad knees could be painful and stressful as your attitude can fall or rise. Youll need to consume the right information regarding the proper exercises that will benefit both your bad knee and other muscles.
After all, it is clear that bad knee should not hamper your workout and fitness journey. Therefore, mix up your workouts with cross-training, lunges, squats, and days off for rest.</p>
