<h2 id="buyers-guidebest-snake-repellent-for-yard">Buyer&rsquo;s Guide:ï¿½Best Snake Repellent for Yard</h2>
<h3 id="1-tips-for-repelling-snakes">1. Tips for Repelling Snakes</h3>
<p>Though the products mentioned above work to repel snakes and keep them from invading your yard for some time, there are directions to be followed.</p>
<p>To get started, you have to ensure that you cut grass and clear the clutter. That way, you will have an easy time targeting the areas used by snakes to find their way into your house.</p>
<p>You should check the label of products and follow the directions provided by the manufacturing company. You will learn that some of them require a lot of water, while some come application-ready.</p>
<p>Since some repellents might contain harmful chemicals, make sure to put on protective garments while applying them.</p>
<h3 id="2-does-lime-keep-snakes-away">2. Does Lime Keep Snakes Away?</h3>
<p>Many have been taught to use lime to keep snakes off their turf. However, there is no scientific proof to back this claim.</p>
<p>You might have been told that by putting lime around your property, you will prevent snakes from entering your compound.ï¿½Though this might sound a great idea, lime does nothing to prevent snakes from entering your home.</p>
<p>Also, you need to understand that instead, lime is a substance that can be dangerous to your loved ones and pets. It has been reported that lime causes severe skin burn, which is why you should avoid it.</p>
<h3 id="3-does-salt-keep-snakes-away">3. Does salt keep snakes away?</h3>
<p>Many studies have been conducted to confirm whether salt could be used to keep snakes away from home. It is accurate to state that nothing has been found to work.</p>
<p>Instead, the products that contain salt are formulated with other chemicals that might harm your health.ï¿½It is essential to consider using methods that have been studied and proven to work.</p>
<p>If anything, snakes do not feed on salt, which is why you cant feed them salt to kill them. Also, salt does not dehydrate snakes, so they will just walk through it and invade your home.</p>
<p>If your property is snake-infested, consider using any of the methods mentioned on this list, and you will be safe.</p>
<h3 id="4-do-mothballs-repel-snakes">4. Do Mothballs repel snakes?</h3>
<p>There is no way you can use mothballs to repel snakes. There is nothing special about mothballs that can make them keep snakes from invading your property.</p>
<p>You need to know that mothballs are a kind of poison and might cause severe damage to your red blood cells. Therefore, you should not even think about using them to control snakes in your home. Worse still, mothballs are known to cause liver failure.</p>
<p>Instead, if you apply mothballs in your garden, you will not do any harm to snakes, but end up poisoning the land. Snakes are dangerous animals, and if you are going to control them, you should use a reliable method.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many types of snake repellents on the market. As a potential buyer, you need to check that a given repellent has effective ingredients that will not harm you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>The other things to look for include price, and ease-of-use. Look for reliable dealers who are known to supply genuine products so that you get value for your money.</p>

Snake Repellents -
Encountering a snake in your home can be a traumatizing experience. Plus, they pose a great danger to your family and your pets and should, therefore, be kept as far away as possible.
Some repellents could have toxic chemicals such as malignant and carcinogens Naphthalene, as outlined by the
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/naphthalene.pdf">EPA</a>
that produces phthalic anhydride. These are the four best snake
repellent for the yard

What&rsquo;s a Snake Repellent? -
Aï¿½Snake repellent is either a
<a href="http://www.wildlifeanimalcontrol.com/homemade-snake.html">natural</a>
, chemical-based (naphthalene) or sonic product created to stop snakes from getting in
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/pest/snake.html">spaces such as yards or houses</a>
. Most of them will contain a repellent ingredient, an adjuvant, and an inert carrier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eugenol,ï¿½clove oil, andï¿½cinnamon oil are also great natural snake repellents if sprayed directly on the snakes. Historically,<em>Styrax</em>trees&rsquo; resin was burned for the same purpose of chasing offï¿½poisonous snakes.</li>
<li>What Is in a snake repellent? -The active ingredients in mostï¿½chemical-based snake repellents are either (1)<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top">Naphthalene</a>, (2) Sulfur, or (3) both. Naphthalene is also the ingredient in the good old mothballs that&rsquo;ll irritate the snakes&rsquo; receptors.
Naphthalene is a chemical that has an unpleasant smell for snakes and will damage the reptile&rsquo;s retinal system and nerves. It&rsquo;s mainly extracted from the walnut trees (the black type). Natural best snake repellents are
created fromï¿½essential oils
like clove, peppermint, castor, and cinnamon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-dr-t"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042XAOJI/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Dr. T&rsquo;s 28 lb. Snake-A-Way Snake Repelling Granules</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0042XAOJI&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Dr.Ts Snake Repellent granule is an EPA-registered granular snake repellent that effectively repels both poisonous and non-poisonous snakes from your home.
This formula contains a powerful combination of 28 percent Sulfur and 7 percent
<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top">Naphthalene</a>
, which creates an unpleasant odor.
When poured around the garden or yard, any snake that attempts to go near the granule is repelled by the pungent smell. By disrupting the snakes sensory reception, the snake slithers away in search of fresh air.
The odor lasts for about 2-3 months, after which you can reapply when it becomes faint. Dr.Ts Nature Snake Repellent is an affordable solution for homeowners dealing with a serious snake infestation. It comes in a 4.3 pounds container.
And given that it has a 91 percent repellency for garter and rattlesnakes, it wont disappoint you in the fight against these dangerous reptiles. See these

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B0753WVKQQ&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
The Dr.T Snake
Repellent Hose End Spray
provides an easy yet effective way to eliminate snakes without harming them.
According to the manufacturer, thisï¿½best snake repellent can offer protection up to 500 sq ft. This will help you deter snakes from accessing areas around your house, flowerbed, garden, garage, cabin, barns, and more.
The product contains a powerful blend of ingredients that temporarily disrupts the reptiles sensory receptors, making it hard for it to smell its prey. The reaction causes it to slither away from your home in search of fresh air.
To use it, attach a garden hose to the bottle (comes with a hose-end) and spray the solution all around your property. However, avoid applying the mixture direct on crops and plants intended for consumption.
Otherwise, when used correctly, its entirely safe for humans, pets, and plants. Its also very affordable. The only disadvantage is that you have to reapply the solution after heavy rains for continued effectiveness.</p>

Snake
Stopperï¿½repellent is also a natural
solution against snakes roaming in your backyard. This product also has an amazing smell and treats a large yard area, p
atios, or garden.
Snake Stopper allows horse-end use. It&rsquo;s safe, sweet-smelling, and more practical but may damage some flora and fauna. But it&rsquo;ll naturally push the snakes out of your lawn, yard, garden, or around the house into the woods where they came originated.
I would add that this product has quick action as snakes will immediately find it difficult to cope in the yard once you&rsquo;ve made the application. Snake Stopper comes in liquid form, and thus, most homeowners find it significantly easy to apply.
Since it has no dangerous chemicals,
Snake Stopper will be non-toxic to you and your kids running around the yard or garden. Specifically, this product is made from sulfur, clove oil, cinnamon oil, and cedar oil, whose combination will easily repel the venomous &amp; non-venomous snakes.

<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B01EMCAFXI&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Next up is this
Snake Defense repellent that&rsquo;ll repel both
non-venomous and venomous/ dangerous snakes (such as rattlesnake or python) and thus preferred by most Exterminators.
This
Snake Defense repellent is made up ofï¿½natural ingredients (cinnamon oil,ï¿½peppermint oil,ï¿½clove oil, and water) that will readily the
slithering and dangerous reptiles infesting your yard. Therefore, there is no danger of poisoning human beings, cats, or dogs going to the yard.
The
Snake Defense repellent, unlike another snake&rsquo;s best snake repellent, is safe to spray in all areas of your lawn, including around patios, driveways, basement doors, porch area, and other doorways. It&rsquo;ll easily repel the snakes that roam around your house or the fenced area for about 3 months.
But, a notable limitation of this snake repellent is that, compared to the granules repellents, it&rsquo;ll evaporate at a faster rate since it&rsquo;s a liquid. Luckily, it leaves no mess, it&rsquo;s easy to apply, and will snake treat a large lawn area effectively.

<h2 id="8-vensmile-solar-powered-sonic-snake-repellent"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P73PNVJ/?tag=p-policy-20">8. VENSMILE Solar-Powered Sonic Snake Repellent</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B07P73PNVJ&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
Unlike all the snake repellents weve reviewed, the VENSMILE Solar-Powered snake repellent does not use chemicals. Instead, it uses electric shock to scare/repel moles, snakes, and gophers away.
The snake repellent comes in the form of spikes that are strategically placed in targeted areas. The spikes are continuously charged by the built-in solar panels to produce enough electric shock to scare away snakes.
When charged for about 4 hours, the spikes can last for five days. The best snake repellent is waterproof, easy to use, and long-lasting.
The spikes work by emitting penetrating vibration pulses when placed on the ground. Every 55 seconds, the spikes produce powerful vibrations and flashing red light, which irritates the pests, causing them to run off.
Even better, the spikes provide extensive shock coverage and operate in a circular pattern, usually about 100 ft in diameter. This means that for a 1-acre piece of land, youll need to use at least 6 VenSmile spikes.</p>
<h2 id="chemical-snake-repellents">Chemical Snake Repellents</h2>
<p><strong>1. Mothballs</strong>
-ï¿½Mothballs are generally accepted by homeowners for repelling snakes. However, their effectiveness has been proven to be higher in repellingï¿½silverfish andï¿½moths compared to snakes. In addition to being less effective against snakes,ï¿½Mothballs also containï¿½neurotoxins that can be toxic to kids and pets.
<strong>2. Sulphurï¿½</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If used alone (even in the powdered form), sulfur is highly ineffective in repelling snakes. However, sulfur will work great when combined with naphthalene. For instance, Snake-A-Way combines 7% naphthalene and 28% sulfur to control even rattle and garter snakes.
The chemical snake repellents are created to produce a pungent smell that will be harsh on the snakes. The snakes&rsquo; mouthparts (

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>What about sonic repellents? Well, these types of snake repellents will produce sounds with a frequency that only the snakes will detect (and not human beings).
The key to note is that the unique frequency sound is both irritating and unpleasant to the snakes, and thus, the reptiles will move away from that area.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-terrariums-for-snakes"><strong>How to Choose the Best Terrariums for Snakes</strong></h2>
<p>A pet snake wont serve its purpose if it is not housed properly. A good terrarium should not only give you a good display of your pet but also provide a comfortable environment for the reptile.
In this guide, Ill take you through some important factors to consider when searching for the right enclosure for your snake.
<strong>The Size of the Terrarium</strong>
Snake pets come in different sizes and species. Some species are more active than others, meaning they exhibit a lot of movement inside a cage. Therefore, when selecting a cage, consider the length of your snake and its activity level.
You can choose a cage that is at least  of the snakes length. However, these criteria may not apply when you add too many accessories to enhance the cage&rsquo;s beauty. In this case, you should consider a cage that is longer than the snake.
<strong>Ventilation</strong>
Just like humans, snakes need to breathe correctly for their survival. Therefore, a good snake cage should allow air to get in and out. Most of the cages have meshed screens on their top for ventilation and lighting.
Some have additional vents on their sides and near the door to increase airflow in and out of the cage.
<strong>Heating and Lighting</strong>
Snakes thrive well when provided with an environment that mimics their natural habitat. Right temperature and lighting are essential parameters for the survival and comfort of your snake.
Therefore, ensure that the cage comes with a means for heating and lighting. You might need a thermometer to monitor the temperature in the cage to maintain the optimum temperature.
<strong>Security</strong>
You cant risk losing your adorable pet. Its both painful and a waste of money. So, you should ensure you get a secure terrarium with no possible escape routes for your pet. If the snake gets out of the cage, it may run into the bush, get trampled on the floor, or get
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">killed by your dog</a>
or cat.
It also ensures that your cage comes with a reliable lock to prevent your kid&rsquo;s or pets&rsquo; accidental opening.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Like other pets, snake pets should be taken care of to have a quality life. And apart from diet, they require an excellent terrarium that blends their natural habitat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your typical terrarium will essentially be determined by your budget and the size of the snake.</li>
<li>Other factors to consider include ventilation, security, and the ability to regulate temperature and humidity.</li>

[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Cages for Snakes&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-do-snakes-have-feelings">Details: Do Snakes Have Feelings?</h2>
<p>Various scientific researchers have proven that snake have feelings. The can show hunger, anger, happiness, fear or respond to touch. However, most snakes show varying emotional reactions towards some of these feelings.</p>
<h3 id="1-anger-feelings"><strong>1. Anger feelings</strong></h3>
<p>Often, most snakes when angered, they react by biting. They would rebel their enemies by threatening to bite them or spiting their poisonous/venomous saliva. ï¿½This defensive reaction is brought by sadness feelings that has materialized/accumulated in them.</p>
<p>Snakes generate anger because of life stresses, hunger and reproduction occurrences. When each of these causes of anger materializes, they make snakes to respond with mixed negative reactions that may harm other snakes, pets or humans.</p>
<p>Importantly, the snake that has anger feelings usually shows calmness, does not seem to move about, frequently , turn its eyes from its hideout, raises it head and back (python) or pushes its tongue back and forth severally.</p>
<p>Angered snake will suddenly attack you on approach and retreat or escape.</p>
<h3 id="2-hunger-feelings"><strong>2. Hunger Feelings.</strong></h3>
<p>Snakes shows the hunger feelings by flicking out their tongues regularly. They will keep moving about in their cage (possibly looking for food). Normally, snakes will tend to be rebellious and angry when hungry. When hungry, snakes will tend to resist their owner and even attack any visitor in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Contrary, snakes that are fully fed remain calm. They do not move about in their cage a lot (though some may move to stretch their bodies and bask under the sun). Snakes in full stomach tend to be friendlier to the owner and visitors too.</p>
<h3 id="3-fear">3. Fear</h3>
<p>Snakes often generate fear. Mostly, fear glows when snakes detect attack from its assailant. The reaction may be by attacking the enemy (using its venom) or escaping by lateral undulation.</p>
<p>The snake is believed to have senses that enables them to detect any attack (this is pronounced in the black mamba species). It will often notice you before reach to kill it.</p>
<p>Snakes use their thermal vision, color and smell to located their enemies and prey.</p>
<h3 id="4-touch-feeling-response"><strong>4. Touch Feeling Response.</strong></h3>
<p>Most Snake negatively if you try to reach and pick them by hands. Some snake like anaconda or python will bite you on touch.</p>
<p>All snake species respond immediately to touch. These cold-blooded reptiles will detect your touch instantly using thermal receptors in their skin.</p>
<p>Though snakes can be held by hands after training/bonding, most of them are not comfortable (they tend to coil out of your hands once held).</p>
<h2 id="can-snakes-feel-love">Can Snakes Feel Love?</h2>
<p>No! Unlike human beings, snakes do not have any intellectual capacity and capability to feel love or get affectionate. Snakes can get friendly with the owner, but they may not generate any love feelings towards him/her.</p>
<p>Normally, the snake feels the connective care of a creature (owner) that is not threatening and that which will offer care. Snake owners tend to think that snakes are affectionate when they coil around them  this is usually not the truth, snakes have no capability. The love instinct, which is emotionally connected, does not exists in snakes at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, snakes do not show love to other pets either. The relationship between snakes and their mates doesnt last for long after reproduction activity is done  this tells why snake can mate anywhere it meets the female.</p>
<h2 id="can-snake-be-petted">Can Snake be Petted?</h2>
<p>You can pet a snake. This may not be that easy at first. However, snakes will get free when they realize that you are not a threat or source of food. As the owner, you must maintain a continuous care for your snakes to create that close bond with them.</p>
<p>Importantly, you must involve a vet for regular check on it emotional reactions, the venomous content and level of human-pet freedom gained.</p>
<p>Though you can pet snakes, it is not always assured that petted snakes will respond positively to you (owners) or other humans. You therefore need to check on the feelings and emotional conditions of your snakes before interacting with them.</p>
<h2 id="do-snakes-have-a-personality">Do Snakes Have A Personality?</h2>
<p>Scientific researches shows that snakes have a certain level of personalities that can be assigned to them. They are able to associate with human beings and shows clearly their preference. When a snake is not comfortable with a given condition or feed, it react differently.</p>
<p>You will find that various species of snakes live differently in their cage or nest  it is not possible for different snake species to live in the same cage (they may fight).</p>
<p>Snakes such as anaconda, black mamba and python are associated with strong personalities as compared to green snakes.</p>
<h2 id="can-snakes-be-friendly">Can Snakes be Friendly?</h2>
<p>Normally, snakes are known to be dangerous and venomous reptiles. Naturally, snakes are friendly to human  only that they feel threated in presence of humans who tend to kill them.</p>
<p>Snakes love to stay in homes than in forest or bushes. Research shows that many snakes have been found in bed sleeping next to human without harming them.</p>
<p>This shows that most snake are friendly if assured of their life security. The idea of training the snakes has even made snakes become friendlier with humans and pets without negative reactions.</p>
<p>King snake and ball pythons are the friendliest snakes for any beginners. Make sure you do not annoy the snake as it may turn aggressive.</p>
<h2 id="can-snake-be-tamed">Can Snake Be Tamed</h2>
<p>Unlike Dogs and cat, snakes cannot be tamed or domesticated to serve various activities in their cage. Even though they are partially friendly, they will remain and die as wild reptiles full of reactive feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>You cannot leave your kid with wild snakes such as boa, anaconda, python or black mamba  they may get violent kill the child.</p>
<p>There is no single successful snake taming that has been carried out in the universe  most attempt have only made snakes friendlier to human beings than before.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Snakes, like human beings, have feelings of anger/sadness, hunger, happiness, pain, fear and can response to touch. Snakes are not friendly to human at first and will react by defending themselves or escaping in case they spot you.</p>
<p>However, continuous bonding through feeding of snakes make them friendlier. It is important to note that snakes cannot be tamed and will remain wild throughout their life. You should therefore asses their feelings before attending them.</p>
