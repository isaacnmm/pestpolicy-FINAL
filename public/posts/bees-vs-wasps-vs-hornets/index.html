<p>Well, wasps (non-furry insects) are carnivores, while bees are furry and will east flower pollen to produce honey. Check these
sprays for yellow jackets.</p>
<h3 id="1-color">**1. **<strong>Color�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-color">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
The color of bees can range between yellow and black, depending on the species. But
<a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/honey-bee-anatomy">honey bees share different traits</a>
with various bugs.
For instance, honey bees have a golden-yellow color with a characteristic brown band. Bumblebees are tan in color with yellow or orange coloration. Bees have 3 pairs of legs - and thus may be considered like
<a href="http://www.reachoutmichigan.org/funexperiments/agesubject/lessons/insect.html">insects</a>
.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps come in a myriad of colors. There are over
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/group/wasps/">30,000 different wasps</a>
. Stinging wasps have bright colors that serve as a warning to intruders. For example, the yellow and black color on yellow jackets indicates they have the ability to sting.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Usually, hornets will appear to be black and white. However, the European hornet is brown with either orange or yellow markings. The yellow hornet is yellow and black in color.</p>
<h3 id="2-body-appearance">**2. **<strong>Body Appearance</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-body-appearance">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Bees have three body parts, just like other insects  Head, thorax, and abdomen. The part connecting the abdomen and thorax is thicker in bees than in both wasps and hornets. Bees come in different sizes depending on the species. Bumblebees are wider and hairy, while honeybees are small in girth and less hairy.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
A wasps body is segmented into three parts with a characteristic thin waistline, distinguishing them from either bees or hornets. They have a slim body, which is less hairy compared to bees.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are close relatives of wasps, although they emerge from different species. They have a larger body and a thicker waist when compared to wasps.
<a href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/housing/pubs/pests/bees.pdf">Hornets look very similar to wasps</a></p>

</ul>
<h3 id="3-nesting-habits">**3. **<strong>Nesting Habits</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-nesting-habits">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Although all bees live in colonies, their nesting habits vary from one species to another. Honeybees make their nests in voids found on walls or tree hollows. A typical honeybee colony can hold up to 10,000 bees.
On the other hand, bumblebees live in underground burrows, especially those abandoned by burrowing animals. They live in colonies of hundreds of bees.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps build nests using a paper-like substance, which they give out after chewing wood fiber. These nests appear as open-end hexagonal cells similar to honeycombs.
Wasp nests can be found under sheltered building eaves, tree branches, open pipes, and in places like garage and attics. The location of nests depends on the wasp species. While mud daubers prefer building nests in higher areas,
<a href="http://naturemappingfoundation.org/natmap/facts/yellow_jacket_712.html">yellow jackets</a>
will build nests on the ground.
Wasp nest can be as small as a golf ball and grow to as large as football or even bigger. Enormous nests of up to 15000 wasps have been found in Alabama.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/hornet-nest-removal/">Hornet removal</a>
appear as paper-like substances with a grayish color. However, unlike the bee and wasp nests, they are oval-shaped. They construct their nests overhanging from higher places like trees, chimneys, outside buildings, poles, etc.
A hornet nest starts as a small piece but can grow to the size of a basketball.

<h3 id="4-diet-and-feeding">**4. **<strong>Diet and Feeding</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-diet-and-feeding">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
A bees diet mainly entails pollen and nectar. Since they crave sweet food, they also feed on sweet juices such as those found in fruits and soft drinks. Thats why you might see bees hovering around during your outdoor parties or treats.
The worker bees do the work of collecting nectar and pollen and bringing it to the nests for the rest of the colony.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps forage for their food among invertebrates such as flies, spiders, ants, caterpillars, and other small insects. Some are omnivorous and will feed on honeydew, nectar, and fallen fruits.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are omnivorous  they feed on sugary plant foods such as tree sap and rotting fruits. Theyre also predators of small insects such as flies, among others.</p>
<h3 id="5-aggressiveness">**5. **<strong>Aggressiveness</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-aggressiveness">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Bees are less aggressive than both wasps and hornets - but
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353869">can sting</a>
. Bees will not sting you unless they feel threatened or when defending their nests. But unlike wasps and hornets, they have barbed stingers which bite only once.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps are more aggressive than bees but not as aggressive as hornets. Like others in the Vespidae family, they can sting several times, each time withdrawing their stinger from the victim.
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/wasp-sting">Wasps may also sting</a>
-�they usually sting when provoked or defending their nests.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are very quick at stinging. They will sting at the slightest provocation. They belong to the Vespidae family, whose stingers are not barbed. That means they can sting several times because of the ability to withdraw their stinger.
A hornet sting inflicts a lot of pain and can sometimes lead to fatal allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>
<h3 id="6-nest-behavior">**6. **<strong>Nest Behavior</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-nest-behavior">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
A bee nest consists of the queen, female workers, and the male drones. The queen lays eggs while the drones do the work of mating with the queen. Female workers are responsible for housekeeping, gathering food, protection, and feeding larvae.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Most of the wasp species live a solitary life. In this case, mature females dig or construct nests near food sources to live and lay eggs. A few species exhibit a social behavior where they live as a community. These include yellow jackets and paper wasps.
A colony of social wasps mainly entails the queen and the female workers. Males leave the hive immediately after mating and die due to dehydration. Mating occurs in summer, where the females hibernate only to start new colonies in spring. New males for the next mating season emerge from the unfertilized eggs.
Female workers are tasked with all communal work, including gathering food, housekeeping, feeding the larvae, and protecting the colony.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
At the center of a hornet hive is the queen, whose sole function is to lay eggs for reproduction. The seemingly few males in the nest only do mating and will die soon after mating.
Female hornets perform daily communal jobs such as getting food, building the nest, protection, and feeding the larvae.

<h3 id="locate-the-nest"><strong>Locate the Nest</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#locate-the-nest">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you have been stung several times or suspect you have stinging insects, begin by investigating whether theres a nest around. Common areas where stinging insects construct nests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tree branches</li>
<li>Stacked wood</li>
<li>Utility or fence poles</li>
<li>Anything hollow, including pipes and wood</li>
<li>Underneath the roof awnings or canopy</li>
<li>Underground burrows</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identify-the-insect"><strong>Identify the Insect</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#identify-the-insect">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is important to know which of the three stinging insects youre dealing with. Thats because not all of them pose a threat to your family. For instance, a bee nest in the garden can be left out since it doesnt pose a big threat. Bees are not only less provocative but are also useful in pollinating flowering plants in the compound.
The above comparison will help you identify the insects with ease. In case you have difficulties in identification, you can contact an expert. Correct identification enables you to
effectively get rid of termites
and stinging insects from your home.</p>
<h3 id="treat-and-remove-the-nest"><strong>Treat and Remove the Nest</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#treat-and-remove-the-nest">¶</a></h3>
<p>Treating or removing stinging insects is a very delicate process. If not done carefully, you might end up with painful stings or serious allergic reactions. If youre dealing with aggressive species, its advisable to call a professional exterminator to do the work.
However, if youre confident to handle the situation by yourself, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>If youre not sure about your reaction to stings, get an allergy test from your doctor. Do not continue with the removal of the test is positive. Call an exterminator.</li>
<li>Whether youre an expert or a novice in removing stinging insects, ensure you wear protective clothing. Wear long pants, boots, a long-sleeved hoodie, gloves, protective glasses, a scarf, and a heart.</li>
<li>In case of an emergency, you need someone to give you first aid. So ensure theres someone to do that. Also, plan an escape route in case the mission fails.</li>
<li>Nowspray the ant nest with an insecticideof your choice. Be sure to get one that is labeled wasps, bees, or hornets. Also, ensure the product you get is a jet spray. This allows you to spray nests that are more than 10 feet high. The best time to remove these insects is after dusk or at dawn.</li>
<li>Best results will be achieved if you spray a solid jet directly into the nest entrance and any other opening.</li>
<li>If the nest is in a high place, dont stay directly below the nest. You might sustain stings from falling insects.</li>
<li>After spraying, stay away from the area for one day. Afterward, you can remove and discard the nest if therere no signs of insect activity.</li>
</ul>
