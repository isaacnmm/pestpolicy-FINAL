**The direct answer is YES. Monitor lizards (such as Komodo Dragon, Asian Water Monitor, and Tree Crocodile Monitor) can bite and cause poisonous infections since they are venomous. **
<strong>The venom contains crotamine, which prevents blood clotting leading to a drop in blood pressure and cause death at the long run. On the other hand, Monitor Lizards such as Bengal Monitor and Savana Monitor are believed to be harmless and defenseless. However, these species are few.�</strong>

<p>The Monitor Lizards such as Komodo Dragon, Asian Water Monitor, and Tree Crocodile Monitor are poisonous reptiles that bite and inject poisonous venom to their prey, thus paralyzing it to death.
The monitor lizards venom contains crotamine chemical which prevents clotting of blood. The blood Oz cause the overall drop of blood pressure in the body. The venom also leaves infections that cause painful swelling on the bitten part.
However, some Monitor Lizards such as Bengal Monitor and Savana Monitor are believed to be harmless and defenseless.
Monitor lizards can also harbor salmonella bacteria, which cause infections to your pets and humans. Proper disinfections and prevention measures should be carried out to maintain healthy life in your place.</p>
