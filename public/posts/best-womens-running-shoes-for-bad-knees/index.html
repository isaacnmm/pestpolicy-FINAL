<p>ASICS GT-2000 7 is a stability running shoe designed for overpronators and runners with knee issues. GT-2000 7 is a highly comfortable, breathable, and supportive shoe thatll make your running experience enjoyable.</p>
<p>The midsole unit of the GT-2000 7 features a DuoMax Support system. This system prevents excessive inward rolling of the foot during running. Hence, it alleviates stress on the feet and knees.</p>
<p>The midsole also has an Impact Guidance System. This Technology interlinks various components to enable a natural gait movement during the running session.</p>
<p>Another feature that the midsole boasts of is the Trusstic System. This system works to prevent twisting of the foot that can cause knee injury. It does this by providing structural integrity, ensuring the shoe remains in good shape throughout the running period.</p>
<p>On the forefoot and rearfoot sections, youll find gel cushioning technologies. The cushioning helps in impact reduction upon impact.</p>
<p>The outsole features the AHAR rubber compound. The forefoot section features a blown rubber compound that aids in delivering improved flexibility and responsive cushioning. The heel section features AHAR+ which enhances the shoes durability. These two types of rubber deliver reliable traction and grip.</p>
<p>The upper features a Jacquard mesh material that promotes the shoes durability while ensuring breathability. Hence, it allows a sufficient amount of air into the shoe for a cool and comfortable in-shoe environment.
