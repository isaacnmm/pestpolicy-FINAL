      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Natural horse fly repellents are made from naturally grown plants or animals. Further,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fly-spray-for-horses/">processing the repellents</a>
undergo must not downgrade the natural form of its ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, the natural horse fly repellent needs to be safe for plants &amp; animals (at least the non-targeted ones) and human beings.
How do you keep horseflies away naturally? Can you use DEET on horses? Diethyltoluamide (DEET) is a highly effective ingredient in insect repellents. Notably, it was first created by the United States Army in World War II.</li>
<li>The ingredient can kill ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes. Further, DEET has a yellow die that could stain your clothes.</li>
<li>At high concentration levels (or with highly sensitive skins), DEET could be toxic to animals and people. Icaridin is an odorless and colorless chemical formula.
This ingredient is an excellent DEET-alternative since it&rsquo;s less harmful. However, its great to control horse <a href="/posts/how-long-do-fruit-flies-live/">flies</a> and other insects such as gnats and mosquitos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="will-apple-cider-vinegar-repel-horse-flies">Will Apple cider vinegar Repel Horse Flies?</h3>
<p>When you need to treat any number of horses, youll need to utilize an aerosol fly spray since it will be easier to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, YES, apple cider vinegar will repel horse flies - but it must be apple cider vinegar must be natural (unpasteurized).
You&rsquo;ll need to spray the apple cider vinegar on the horse&rsquo;s hair coat - externally to effectively kill the horse flies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-essential-oils-that-repel-horse-flies">Any Essential Oils That Repel Horse Flies?</h2>
<p>To repel horse flies, I recommend using a combination of these essential oils: Cedarwood, Lemon Grass, Tea Tree, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Lavender, and Citronella.</p>
<ul>
<li>The natural repellents include natural grape seed oil, rosemaryessential oil, natural lemon eucalyptus, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, avocado oil, and Aloe Vera juice.</li>
<li>Finally, natural products need to be environmental-friendly and bio-degradable, sustainable to the environment and human beings.
However, you can use other products like fly masks, boots, and fly sheets to protect your equine friend.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-the-best-fly-spray-for-horses">Choosing the Best Fly Spray for Horses</h2>
<h3 id="1active-ingredients">1.Active Ingredients</h3>
<p>The active ingredients (synthetic or natural) affect the horse spray&rsquo;s repellent and killing power. However, not all are suitable for foals and lactating mares.
Here&rsquo;re the most used actives: permethrin, pyrethrins, picaridin, cypermethrin, tetramethrin, and resmethrin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pyrethrins - A natural active ingredient extracted from one of the chrysanthemum species. Pyrethrins provide<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ground-bees/">fast knockdown - it&rsquo;ll kill</a>the horse flies quickly. Piperonyl Butoxide plus pyrethrin will give a quick knockdown by damaging the central nervous system of the horsefly.</li>
<li><em>Pyrethrins</em>: - These are derivatives of the pyrethrum (the popular chrysanthemum) plant. However, these pyrethrins are highly poisonous, which means that theyll readily penetrate the fly&rsquo;s skin or shell and other comparable insects.</li>
<li>Further, the pyrethrin insecticides will immediately move to the flys nervous system to immobilize them. However, this will not kill the insect as they have some enzymatic action thatll detoxify the pyrethrins and enable the flies to recover.</li>
<li>Therefore, the spray formulas contain synergists that work to slow the enzymatic functioning. Thus, the pyrethrin would have adequate time to paralyze the horse fly. But with moisture, Oxygen, and sunlight, the pyrethrin ingredient will erode easily and hence wont harm plants and animals  but youll need to take top precautions with fish.</li>
<li>Synergists - But Pyrethrins must be mixed with additional synergists to prevent being broken down by sunlight. Synergists offer long-lasting protection and boost the killing power of the insecticide. But you can try one of these homemade fly sprays for horses (essential oil-based).</li>
<li>Permethrin (a Pyrethroid)  The synthetically created permethrin is comparable to the natural pyrethrin. It stimulates the nervous system of the horse fly and has neurotoxin and synergists that take down the insects. Permethrin is highly stable and will protect your horse longer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-oil-based-or-water-based-spray">2. Oil-Based or Water-Based Spray?</h3>
<p>Oil-based or water-based spray? Well, both have their unique pros and cons. But first, the water-based sprays don&rsquo;t attract dust or dirt and won&rsquo;t irritate your horse&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>But for the water-based sprays, you must use synergists to prevent break down from sweat, rain, and sunlight.
However, the oil-based spray (marked as having Petroleum Distillate) offers quicker knockdown (through insect suffocation) and sticks better on the horse&rsquo;s hair coat.
The downside is that the oil-based brands will attract dust or dirt and may irritate or burn the sensitive horse skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-special-horses-conditions">3. Special Horses Conditions</h3>
<p>Consider if your horse has conditions like sensitive skin, open wounds, or another health issue that might be worsened by using the horse fly spray.</p>
<ul>
<li>For minor issues, you might need to be extra careful when applying the insecticide.</li>
<li>However, any adverse reactions from spraying must be reported to your veterinarian.
But you&rsquo;ll be safer if you first test the horse fly spray on a spray section of your horse to check its effectiveness and the presence of any adverse reactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-number-of-horses-and-residue-effect">4. Number of Horses and Residue Effect</h3>
<p>Depending on the number of horses youll be treated, you must consider the type of formula to use or maximum effectiveness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Horseflies are not active at night. Thus, horses can comfortably graze<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef511">during the night since the horse flies will be least active</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Youll need to consider the number of days that the repellent or fly killer will be effective on your horse - horse flies are mainly active from May to September.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, UltraShield EX Equine Spray will repel horse flies for seven days.</li>
</ul>

      <description>Could you be asking yourself how long fruit flies live?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Could you be asking yourself how long <a href="/posts/where-do-fruit-flies-come-from/">fruit</a> <a href="/posts/how-do-you-keep-horse-flies-away-naturally/">flies</a> live?</p>
<p>Do fruit flies bother you by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fruit-flies-come-from/">flying all over in your house and compound</a>
that you wonder when they will die?
<strong>Fruit flies live for approximately 40 to 50 earth days. During this time, the female fruit flies are able to mate with males severally and lay thousands of eggs that hatch into new ones.�</strong>
In fact, the fruit flies do not just hatch into flies directly; they undergo different stages in their life cycle to achieve fully development.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-long-do-fruit-flies-live-">**Details: How long do Fruit flies live? **</h2>
<p>Fruit flies live for approximately 40 to 50 earth days. To achieve full maturity, they undergo various stages (metamorphosis). The duration in each development stage may vary from place to place due varying factors, which affects their growth.</p>
<p>The life cycle of a fruit fly begins from reproduction where the female lays eggs which develop into larva then pupa and finally adult.</p>
<p>The adult fruit fly is a very small insect and sometime you may not see it with naked eye unless they are in huge number. Many of them come together and create a swam that engulf rotting/fermenting foodstuff leading to spoilage.</p>
<p>The continuous reproduction of fruit flies within as short period give them a great advantage of rapid multiplication in a given area. Though they die, their birth rate is higher than death rate.</p>
<p>You will also realize that fruit flies follow foodstuff, without which they leave. You may keep off foodstuff that attract fruit flies if you desire to get rid of them entirely. Importantly, you must keep a close look into my other articles to learn more of ways to get rid of fruit flies.</p>
<p>I will now elaborate in depth each stage in the life cycle of a fruit fly in various subheading below.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-life-cycle-of-fruit-flies"><strong>What is a life cycle of Fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>The life of fruit fly is classified in various stages that are interlinked continuously. These stages together form its life cycle. �Each stage consists of a number of developments, which make it different from the next or other stages.</p>
<p>You will see that larvae and pupa are two different organisms though they are sub stage of an adult fruit fly. It is, therefore, important to learn these development stages as they may help you, in case you want to get rid of these fruit flies, to efficiently destroy them at any point of wish.</p>
<p>The Life cycle of fruit fly is classified into four stages i.e. egg, larvae, pupa and adult. The female fruit fly after mating lays eggs which hatches into larvae. This develop into pupa stage and later matures to an adult fruit fly.</p>
<p>Lets discuss each stage:</p>
<h3 id="stage-1--reproduction-process"><strong>Stage 1  Reproduction Process.</strong></h3>
<p>Once the female mates with male fruit fly, the fruit fly looks for a better place to lay eggs. This could be on your rotting/fermenting foodstuff, damp rag or mop, fruit skin, dustbin or even drainage system.</p>
<p>Before female fruit fly lays the eggs, the fruit fly must ensure that the temperature is high enough. The temperature of around 77 degree Fahrenheit suit her best. This can be lower however; it should not go below 22 degree, which may kill the fruit flys hatched babies. Fruit flies for reproduction purposes select humid environment.</p>
<p>Once that is done, about 24 hours after mating, the female fruit fries lays between 200 to 500 eggs at ago. This answers you why their survival rate is so high.</p>
<p>Each egg is able to hatch after 24 to 30 hours. By 8 to 13 days, you will be having adult fruit flies buzzing around in your place. No wonder you may keep complaining how quick these flies mature.</p>
<p>Once the eggs hatch, they proceed to the next stage called larvae stage.</p>
<h3 id="stage-2--larvae"><strong>Stage 2  Larvae�</strong></h3>
<p>This is stage is the most pronounce stage of fruit flies. Basically, a larvae is a worm-like organism that does not have legs. It is very active when it comes to movement and feeding so as to secure enough energy for the next stage.</p>
<p>Larva are seen mostly as they mess the fruits and other rotting foodstuff a lot. Though small in sizes, their impact is highly seen. They are highly attracted by the fermenting parts of the fruits or rotting substances.</p>
<p>These larvae feeds on yeast organism &amp; fungi in the rotting/ fermenting foodstuff and turns it into a messy semi-liquid substance that emits irritating smell.</p>
<p>In fact, they provides further acceleration of bacteria, which affects the foodstuff to a point of no use.�After about four days, the larvae moves to a dark place where matures and change into pupa, which is the next stage.
<strong>Stage 3  Pupa�</strong>
The pupa Stage is termed as an inactive stage by observation. This is because the pupa is actually an immobile organism.</p>
<p>During this stage, the legless larvae develop six legs, eyes and wings using the energy that was stored during the larvae stage.</p>
<p>The skins begins to darken as it continues to develop. The three body parts i.e. head, thorax and abdomen become distinct and at this point, the puparium is about to break.</p>
<p>This development takes about four days. Then the pupa breaks the skin and a light colored-young adult emerges. This now proceeds to the next stage.
<strong>Stage 4  Adult�</strong>
The development stage of young adult fruit fly to a fully adult is a self-developing process that takes two to three days.</p>
<p>The young adult emerges as light in color fly. However, its color darkens with time. This young Fruit fly feeds on the available rotting foodstuff so as to acquire the full adulthood.</p>
<p>During this time, the wings and legs are strengthened so as to help it in flying and landing. In addition, abdomen develops further such that spiracles for breathing are able to function properly.</p>
<p>The adult stage development time may vary from place to place due to environment. It is worth noting that you will expect to see female adult fruit fly being ready for mating and lay eggs after two days of its pupa stage.</p>
<p>This means that they quickly get into reproduction as soon as they are released as young adults.</p>
<p>NB: This process, from reproduction to full adulthood of fruit flies, is known as metamorphosis and we said it takes between eight to thirteen days, which may vary from place to place due climatic factor among other things.</p>
<h2 id="which-affects-the-lifespan-of-fruit-flies"><strong>Which affects the Lifespan of Fruit flies?</strong></h2>
<p>Survival of fruit flies is affected by various factors that may vary from place to place depending on the point of consideration. These factors may either favor their existence or cause their death. Some of these factors include:</p>
<h3 id="1-ambient-temperature">1. Ambient temperature</h3>
<p>Most fruit flies thrives very well is ambient temperature of a given environment. Research shows that the optimal temperature of about 78 degree Fahrenheit is suitable for best survival of these fruit flies.</p>
<p>They can also survive in low temperatures however; this should not go below 20 degree Fahrenheit as this may result to their dead or affect their reproduction activities.</p>
<p>We know that ambient temperature also accelerates the rotting/fermenting process as well as multiplication of these fruit flies; it is important then that you take precaution so as to prevent food rooting or any environment that may result to the same.
<strong>2. Ability to breed frequently�</strong>
It is to the advantage of fruit flies that they are able to breed and multiply at a very short time. Within eight to thirteen days from time the eggs were laid, the fully developed fruit fly is able to bring to existence the new generation of its own.</p>
<p>These flies are also very active sexually. The fact that after laying they are able to regain their sexual activeness after a short time, this gives them a super chance to bring more and more babies into life.
<strong>3. They have different food alternatives.</strong>
We know that the fruit flies are attracted by any rotting or fermenting foodstuff. This could be in any place e.g. within the house or outside.</p>
<p>Once fruit flies have depleted one food source, they quickly shift to another within the locality. Just think of youself expelling them from your house when you have the garbage at your compound unkempt or some damply rags or mops outside; definitely you will find some there after some times.</p>
<p>It is very important to ensure that you clean all possible sites that may, in any away, attract these fruit flies into their vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="can-fruit-flies-die-on-their-own"><strong>Can fruit flies die on their own?�</strong></h2>
<p>This is a nice concern. Definitely, fruit flies will die after forty to fifty days of survival. However, it may not seem like they really are dying if the source of food still exists.</p>
<p>You will agree with me that the more you feed them, the more they will stay since their reproduction rate is more that their death rate.</p>
<p>Just in case you want them to die on their own, kindly allow them to deplete the current food source and eventually once it is completely eaten away by them, they will either die of starvation or look for another food source around or kilometers away.</p>
<p>I am only worried if you will dread to face such infestation of fruit flies by giving them a chance to die slowly!</p>
<h2 id="do-fruit-flies-cause-sickness"><strong>Do fruit flies cause sickness?�</strong></h2>
<p>Sickness is something you always try to avoid. The fact that fruit flies are irritating is termed as a special kind of sickness as where they are you can stay at peace.</p>
<p>Moreover, these flies lands and touch over other contaminated substances before feeding on your food thus bringing disease-causing germs to it.</p>
<p>The larvae stage of fruit flies mostly prefer feeding on fermenting/rotting food. They accelerates the action of bacteria as well as food poisoning. If such food is eaten, it may cause illness, stomach upset or other types of sicknesses.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-destroy-fruit-flies-breeding-ground"><strong>How do I destroy fruit flies breeding ground?�</strong></h2>
<p>It is necessary know that the most destructive stages of a fruit fly is larvae and adult stage. These stages plays a great role in destroying your foodstuff.�In case you desire to destroy their breeding ground, just try and do away with these two stages.</p>
<p>For the case of larvae stage, it is difficult to handle them independently as they continuously change to next stage in a few days. Therefore, it is important to deal with egg stage and adult stage.</p>
<p>You can do this by maintaining very low temperature that ensures that these eggs never hatch do larvae within the room thus killing the generation.</p>
<p>This means that you will have to do that for about fifty days so that the living fruit flies die of temperature changes.</p>
<p>If you need to get rid of the living fruit flies, it is important to use efficiently the existing methods that are used to get rid of fruit flies such as the use of Yellow flytrap, vinegar or wine trap etc.</p>
<p>Chemicals can be used to kill both the fruit flies and their laid egg however; most of these chemicals cause environmental pollution.</p>
<p>I may therefore not recommend their use unless you find that the problem for fruit flies has escalated and other methods are not yielding results.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-prevent-fruit-flies-in-my-home"><strong>How do I prevent fruit flies in my home?�</strong></h2>
<p>This is just easy. You will require to keep off any substance that attract fruit flies into your house of place. This can be made by ensuring that you do not store any rotting foodstuff or ensuring those products with fruit flies attracting smell has securely stored.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is very important for you. Ensure that you empty garbage bin, clean all spilled food, store mops and rags when dry, flush sinks and toilet as well as drains with proper cleaning fluids or clean your kitchen and dishes immediately after use to keep off smell.</p>
<p>These, if you put them into practice, will help you a lot in preventing presence of fruit flies in your house or compound.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Your concern on life of fruit flies is valid. Fruit flies lives for about 40 to 50 earth days. The lifecycle of a fruit fly is classified into four stages: egg, larvae, pupa and adult.�Fruit flies lives may be affected by various factors such as temperature humidity as well as source of food nutrients.</p>
<p>It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that you keep your house or compound free from these irritating fruit flies by ensuring that you are able to observe proper sanitation requirement as I have advised in this articles. A fruit fly free home is a nice place to live. What do you think about it?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Could <a href="/posts/how-long-do-fruit-flies-live/">fruit</a> <a href="/posts/how-do-you-keep-horse-flies-away-naturally/">flies</a> have disturbed you in your place? Do you wonder where they may have come from or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-fruit-flies-live/">how long they live</a>
?</p>
<p>In this article, I will be answering this question in depth.</p>
<p>Summary:
<strong>Fruit fries come from bush hideouts through the windows, doors and even ventilation; fruit trees and flower in the compound or neighborhood; they can come as a result of weather changes in the area; they could have been on your food when you were bringing it home or it could even be possible that some of your food you bought had fruit flies eggs inside it without notice.</strong>
However, it is important to note that these fruit flies may come because something has attracted them into the vicinity. Their movement is mainly triggered by specific attractants - though there could be other means as highlighted above that may have resulted them to being in your household.</p>
<h2 id="what-attracts-fruit-flies"><strong>What attracts fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>Fruit fries are very small insects commonly found in tropical areas with humid climatic condition.�Mostly, fruit fries are attracted into your house by ripen fruits or vegetables.</p>
<p>Fruits like tomatoes, melons, grapes or other perishables in the farm attracts these flies. Rotting potatoes, bananas, onions, cabbages and other unrefrigerated products bought from groceries in your house attracts many of these fruit flies.</p>
<p>They can also be attracted to decomposing waste, empty bottles, cleaning rags or mops that are within the compound or farm. The key thing here is the fermenting smell. These flies have very high sense of smell thus; they can detect these scents when they are kilometers away.</p>
<p>Yeast leads to fermentation process and helps a lot in making these fruit flies get attracted to foodstuff. Alcoholic drinks tend to attract the fruit flies due to the fermentation scent in them especially the locally made brews. It is therefore important for you keep note of proper storage of these fruit flies attracting products so as to minimize the effects associated with them.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-fruit-flies-enter-your-house-from-outsidehideouts"><strong>How do fruit flies enter your house from outside/hideouts?�</strong></h2>
<p>You may wonder to find that even after closing all your doors, windows and keeping everything spotless clean, you still find fruit flies in your house. This is not magic! Fruit flies are very small. They can penetrate through the tinniest space left at the door or window from outside and find its way to the rotting/fermenting items in the house.</p>
<p>This is a major blow to individuals as its almost impossible to seal completely your house so as to prevent their entrance. In fact, you need ventilation for aeration in the house, which offers them a quick route into the kitchen, bathroom or toilet.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-fruit-flies-come-from-fruit-trees-and-flowers"><strong>How do fruit flies come from fruit trees and flowers?�</strong></h2>
<p>We now know very well that fruit flies are highly attracted by fermenting substances and through use of sense of smell, they can locate the rotting foodstuff. Fruits like grapes, mangoes or oranges highly produce these scents when they are ripening. You will find that more of these flies brood in these environments.</p>
<p>The flowers from various plants also hold breeding grounds for these fruit flies. This is attributed by nectar produced by these particular flowers. In case your compound or yard has these flowers, expect some fruit flies within.</p>
<p>Once the attractants are depleted from the vicinity, these fruit flies looks for any available option around which could be: in your house, nearby hotel or even damping site- just by use of smell.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-weather-change-favors-existence-of-fruit-flies"><strong>How does weather change favors existence of fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>Fruit flies tend to thrive very well during summer than in winter. This is attributed by the fact that temperature accelerate rotting/fermentation activity, which in turn releases a scent that attracts the fruit flies. Moreover, warm temperature favors breeding of these fruit flies in a given environment.</p>
<p>Fruit flies also work best during dusk or dawn. They like dim light environment more as compared to the bright light areas. This does not mean that you wont find them in bright-lit regions. No! Only that dim light is more favorable for Fruit flies.</p>
<p>During winter. You may experience less fruit flies as compared to summer. This wont overlook the fact that you will see some of them in your household! However, the number will drastically fall. This tells you why some people rarely experience fruit flies problems in their locality.</p>
<h2 id="in-which-way-do-fruit-flies-get-into-the-food-that-is-brought-home"><strong>In which way do fruit flies get into the food that is brought home?�</strong></h2>
<p>Often, you find yourself doing shopping of various fruits and vegetables. In case you buy them in a grocery where there were fruit flies invasion, chances are that your items will have some of these flies. You may ask how?</p>
<p>These fruit flies are very small. They may have laid eggs beneath the fruits or other vegetables and you may end up transporting them home where they hatch into fruit flies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of them may hide inside some vegetables like cabbages or kales only to go hatch and multiply in your house. It is very important for you to keep note of health matter of groceries that you frequently buy your fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>At times, you may even have bought flowers or drinks like wine that attracts these fruit fries. This may attract some of fruit flies to these items without your notice and they end up into your homestead where the further bred.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-fruit-flies-breedreproduce"><strong>Where do fruit flies breed/reproduce?�</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we know fruit flies are mainly found in hotels, homes or supermarkets where foodstuff are allowed to ferment or rot, lets elaborate their breeding process. Fruit flies lay eggs near the surface of the rotting/fermenting food, organic material or beneath the fruit skin.</p>
<p>Each fruit fly lay about 500 eggs, which takes 24-48 hours to hatch. This should tell you that within a week, you would expect thousands of these flies in the house if not taken care of.</p>
<p>These flies can also breed in any moist place. It could be drain, garbage disposal, wet rag or mop. The larvae is able to feed on the surface or fermenting/rooting product (fruit/vegetables) thus accelerating the process further.</p>
<p>These flies end up destroying the whole fruit or vegetable making them unsafe for human consumption.�This may really be pathetic. Therefore, you will need to take care of them before they get more nuisance.</p>
<h2 id="do-fruit-flies-cause-any-problemsharmful"><strong>Do fruit flies cause any problems/harmful?�</strong></h2>
<p>You will agree with me that there is nothing as much irritating as swam of fruit flies in your kitchen, living room or compound. It becomes even more disgusting to walk into a supermarket or restaurant and a swam of them flew over foodstuff. This will not auger well.</p>
<p>These flies causes discomfort to human where they even engulf a person when you try to chase them away. Worse of it all is that the more you chase them, the more they keep coming back. It is such a tedious work that many find themselves giving up on them or disposing the whole food items. �They actually cause waste of food material.</p>
<p>Fruit flies accelerate the rotting of the food substances. Fruits like ripe bananas rots faster in their presence since the larvae feeds on the surface exposing the inner part, which is most nutritious for human consumption.</p>
<p>Contamination caused on food by fruit flies lead to food poisoning. In addition, they introduce bacteria and other disease causing organisms that may be harmful to human beings.</p>
<p>Importantly, you do not need to dispose you fruits or other vegetables just because they have been attached by fruit flies- just cut off the affected part since these flies do not dig deep while feeding.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-fruit-flies"><strong>How do you get rid of fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwM0TA5N61U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwM0TA5N61U</a></p>
<p>There various ways/methods of getting rid of fruit flies you can use in case they are giving you real problem. I have discussed each of them below.</p>
<h3 id="method-1-attracting-them-using-rotten-fruit"><strong>Method 1: Attracting them using rotten fruit.</strong></h3>
<p>Since fruit flies like rotten fruits due to fermentation smell, which attracts them. You can place several of them in a proper place inside a container where the flies can easily smell. Then cover with a polythene paper or plastic casing with few holes. These flies will fly in and are trapped inside.</p>
<h3 id="method-2-using-a-flytrap-that-stick"><strong>Method 2: Using a flytrap that stick.</strong></h3>
<p>You can buy a flytrap that stick from the market. This fly traps are smeared with sticky substances which when fruit fly touch it, it cannot escape. You will need to place several of these traps in various places like toilet, bathroom or kitchen where these fruit flies can get trapped.</p>
