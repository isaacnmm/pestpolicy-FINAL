      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that possums eat cats is largely a misconception. Possums, being opportunistic omnivores and scavengers, primarily feed on fruits, insects, and small animals like rodents.</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not actively hunt cats, and while they might scavenge the remains of a deceased cat, they do not pose a direct threat to living, healthy ones.
Possums are more likely to compete with cats for food than to attack them. This article explores <a href="/posts/do-possums-eat-chickens/">possum</a> behavior, their dietary preferences, and the nature of their interactions with domestic cats, offering reassurance to pet owners and tips to prevent unwanted encounters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possum-diet-what-do-they-eat">Possum Diet: What Do They <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a>?</h2>
<p>Possums are omnivores, which means they eat a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-opossums-eat/">variety of plant and animal matter</a>
. Their diet is highly opportunistic, often dictated by what is easily available in their environment. In the wild, possums typically consume:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fruits and berries</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insects and small invertebrates</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rodents and small birds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Carrion (dead animals)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vegetables and grains</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eggs but not chicken</strong></li>
<li><strong>Small reptiles and amphibians</strong>
In urban areas, possums may forage through garbage cans and eat pet food that is left outside. They are scavengers by nature, which means they are more likely to feed on what they can find rather than actively hunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to understanding their dietary habits is that possums are not hunters in the traditional sense. Instead, they forage and will eat whatever is most accessible and easy to catch or find, including plant material, insects, and small animals.</p>
<h2 id="possums-and-cats-understanding-the-interaction">Possums and Cats: Understanding the Interaction</h2>
<p>The idea that possums eat cats is largely a myth. Cats are much larger than most of the typical prey items that possums eat. In fact, adult cats are far too big and capable of defending themselves, making them an unlikely target for a possums diet.</p>
<p>While possums may be opportunistic eaters, they do not have the predatory skills or desire to hunt down a living, healthy cat.</p>
<dl>
<dt>There are, however, a few scenarios where a possum and a cat might interact:</dt>
<dt><strong>1. Competition for Food</strong></dt>
<dd>If a possum and a cat are both foraging in the same area, such as near an outdoor food dish, they may compete for resources. Possums may try to eat leftover cat food, but this does not indicate predation. The possum is simply scavenging what it can find.
<strong>2. Scavenging Behavior</strong></dd>
<dd>In very rare cases, a possum may be found eating a deceased cat. However, it is important to stress that this does not mean the possum killed the cat. As scavengers, possums will eat carrion, and if they come across a dead animal, including a cat, they may consume it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>This can lead to the misconception that possums hunt cats, but they are merely feeding on an already deceased animal.Possums live an average of 1 to 2 years but<a href="https://opossumsocietyus.org/general-opossum-information/">can do up to 4 years</a>, but don&rsquo;t kill them - mainly when you see their destructive habits.</li>

<strong>3. Defensive Reactions</strong>
: If a cat and possum were to get into a confrontation, the possums instinct would not be to attack but to defend itself. Possums often employ a defense mechanism known as &ldquo;playing possum,&rdquo; where they feign death to avoid aggression from predators. In some cases, if a possum feels cornered, it may hiss, growl, or show its sharp teeth to scare off a potential threat, but it would not go on the offensive unless absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-possums-arent-a-threat-to-cats">Why Possums Aren&rsquo;t a Threat to Cats</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why possums dont pose a significant threat to cats:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Size and Strength</strong>: Adult cats are generally larger, faster, and stronger than possums. In a physical altercation, a healthy cat would likely come out on top, or at the very least, would be able to escape without serious injury.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Differences</strong>: Cats are predators by nature and tend to be territorial. On the other hand, possums are scavengers and generally prefer to avoid confrontation with larger animals. When faced with a cat, a possum is more likely to flee or try to scare the cat away rather than attack.</li>
<li><strong>Dietary Preferences</strong>: Possums have no real interest in hunting down and consuming large animals like cats. Their natural diet consists of smaller prey and scavenged food. While they may consume carrion if they find it, this is far different from actively seeking out and killing a cat for food.

<h2 id="what-should-pet-owners-do">What Should Pet Owners Do?</h2>
<p>While possums dont pose a direct threat to cats, pet owners may still want to take precautions to minimize interactions between the two animals. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep Pet Food Indoors</strong>: Avoid leaving pet food outside, especially overnight, as it can attract possums and other wildlife.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Garbage Cans</strong>: Since possums are scavengers, they may try to get into unsecured garbage cans. Keeping lids tightly closed will discourage them from foraging in your yard.</li>
<li><strong>Supervise Pets Outdoors</strong>: While possums arent likely to harm your cat, its always a good idea to supervise your pets when theyre outdoors, especially at night when possums are most active.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Attractants</strong>: Possums are drawn to food sources, so removing things like fallen fruit, bird feeders, and compost piles can help prevent them from frequenting your property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the notion that possums eat cats is largely unfounded. While possums are opportunistic feeders and scavengers, their natural diet does not include live, healthy cats.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are more likely to forage for fruits, insects, and small animals or scavenge for dead animals. Interactions between possums and cats are usually driven by competition for food rather than predation.
Pet owners can reduce the likelihood of encounters by taking simple precautions, but overall, possums are not a significant threat to household pets.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe some chicken (plus chicks) and their eggs have recently disappeared from their coop. Recently, there have been some native opossums
*(Didelphis Virginiana) and dead chickens *
around - well, these are scavengers.
So, you&rsquo;re wondering really &lsquo;do possums eat chickens?&rsquo; Well, Yes, possums will scavenger and eat chickens (including fully-grown hens) and other easy food sources like chicks and eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The adult <a href="/posts/do-possums-eat-cats/">possum</a> weighs 4 to 15 lb and measures about 21 to 36 inches in length - about the size of your house-cat. They have 50 pointed and sharp teeth with a white mouth (&amp; face) with grey or white fur.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll also notice that they have a hairless tail, black eyes, and pink nose, and pointed faces.
To repel the possums, you may position ammonia-coaked rags near the chikcen coop or spray any of these rodent repellents&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="do-opossums-or-possums-eat-chickens">Do Opossums or Possums <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a> Chickens?</h2>
<p>As noted above, possums and opossums will attack and eat your chickens. So, YES, simply put, possums will eat chickens. Their strong teeth enable them to tear down prey&rsquo;s bones and flesh - including from dead animals and chickens.</p>
<ul>
<li>While uncommon, possumslike raccoons will eat mature hens(about 20 in a night since they are large &amp; intimidating) but may regularly prey on chicken eggs and their young chicks.
The omnivore animals largely eat and prey on small invertebrates - but if they are occupying the backyard gardens, the possums could hunt your chickens and eggs too -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-possums-eat-cats/">but the possums won&rsquo;t eat the cats</a>
or dogs.

<h2 id="do-possums-steal-and-eat-chicken-eggs">Do Possums Steal and Eat Chicken Eggs?</h2>
<p>Ye
s, possums that will manage to sneak into the chicken coop will (or come across eggs) will eat the chicken eggs - but they&rsquo;ll also prey on adult chickens.</p>
<ul>
<li>My experience: One night I met a large possum in the chicken coop around the bird&rsquo;s nesting boxes.</li>
<li>We noted that the possum had returned and stolen eggs - we also found some of the eggs busted.
But will the possums eat raw eggs? Yes, they&rsquo;ll feed on raw eggs in addition to other foods like
protein dog kibble,
minced veggies,
calcium vegetables, chicken crockpot, and bones.
Also, what smells do the possum hate? Well, these animals won&rsquo;t love
ammonia - so I would recommend you pour some ammonia into that coffee container.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-stop-possums-from-killing-my-chicken">How to Stop Possums from Killing My Chicken?</h3>
<p><strong>1. Remove chicken or pet food�</strong>
Avoid leaving chicken or pet food lying around overnight. Such idle foods tend to attract the possums.</p>
<p>Put the chicken or pet food in some metallic (and air-tight ) containers - this will prevent the mother possum from nesting around and rearing their babies.</p>
<p>The possums and their younglings will eventually take over your spaces - and this will endanger you5r chicken as the adult possums will think that the food belongs to their babies.
<strong>2. Line the Chicken coop with 10-inch tin�</strong>
Line the chicken coop with some 10-inches tin to bar possums eating up the wood-� they won&rsquo;t attack the chicken easily.</p>
<p>So, lining up the chicken structures with tin inside and outside - this is because the possums won&rsquo;t chew on the tin.
<strong>3. Don&rsquo;t Leave Chicken Eggs overnight</strong>
Next, I caution against leaving the chicken eggs overnight in that coop.</p>
<p>This is because the scent of the egg
will attract predators including raccoon&rsquo;s
, skunks, and possums.
<strong>4. Place Mothballs and Ammonia�</strong>
Next, position some mothballs and ammonia (odour or stink) as these will help remove the possum from its hiding area.</p>
<p>So, pour the ammonia onto some coffee container and place a wick (towel or rag) that&rsquo;ll help disperse the stinking fumes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check locations that look like possum shelters and place the mothballs or ammonia
<strong>5. Pour Wolf or Fox Urine repel possums�</strong>
Skunks, raccoons, and possums won&rsquo;t get near that chicken coop or nearby hiding areas that have wolf or fox urine.</li>
<li>You may also use the fox-urine granules (Shake-Away) by the brand name as they&rsquo;ll repel and scare off the rodents and possums.
Besides, you may use human urine to repel the possums around the
garden or yard. Notably, the fresh urine will be bacteria-free and clean.
<strong>6. Set Possum Traps</strong>
Possum traps will also be a great addition to the feature in reducing chicken death and disappearance. Set up this device on areas you suspect possum frequent.</li>
<li>Some baits suitable for the possum trap includeapples, peanut butter, vegetables, berries, and fruit.
But remove these traps around the morning time to prevent catching other small pets or even your chickens.

<strong>7. Fencing�</strong>
Fencing around that yard or garden will also hinder possums from reaching your chicken.</li>
<li>Definitely, their strong teeth won&rsquo;t tear down that fence - but avoid chicken wires as they&rsquo;re too weak.
Further, don&rsquo;t allow drinkable water around your garden or yard as this will attract possums that may attack your chicken.</li>
<li>The chicken will be very vulnerable during the dark hours - while also the possums will also be active at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, do possums eat chickens? YES, possums will occasionally hunt and seat chickens in the backyard.</p>
<ul>
<li>But they&rsquo;ll more probably eat chicks, Bantams (small breeds), and eggs.</li>
</ul>
