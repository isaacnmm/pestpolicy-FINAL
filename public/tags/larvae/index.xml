      <description>What do flea larvae eat?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do flea <a href="/posts/what-do-flea-larvae-look-like/">larvae</a> eat?
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/pest/flea.html">Flea larvae</a>
(35% of the flea population) are the second phase of the <a href="/posts/where-do-flea-larvae-live/">fleas</a>&rsquo; life cycle.
<strong>The short answer is</strong>
<em>flea larvae feed primarily on flea dirt, which is�(1) adult fleas&rsquo;�feces (or undigested blood) &amp; (2) conspecific (or nonviable) eggs - this is unlike other holometabolous larvae.�</em></p>
<h2 id="what-do-flea-larvae-eat">What Do Flea Larvae Eat?</h2>
<p>These tiny
baby fleas
will quickly feel running vacuum, footsteps, and vibrations, after which they&rsquo;ll act dead.
As hematophagous obligate epiphytes, flea larva doesnt require a host to survive or grow.</p>
<h3 id="1fecesfromadult-fleas">1.<strong>Feces</strong>from<strong>Adult Fleas��</strong></h3>
<p>Cat
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-look-like/">flea larvae</a>
have mandibles to chew solid organic matter but won&rsquo;t bite on either cats or dogs.
As highlighted above, flea larvae primarily feed on flea dirt  which is feces (or pre-digested and dried blood) from adult fleas.</p>
<p><strong>Undigested cat or dog blood�</strong>
The blood may have originated from various hosts such as cats and dogs or human beings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, a large quantity of the ingested bloodcomes out in feces undigested ready to give the flealarvae the required nutrients.</li>
<li>Flea larvae wont grow appropriately if they dont feed on flea dirt.
Despite that the
flea&rsquo;s eggs
are laid wet on the host&rsquo;s hair coat, they&rsquo;ll dry out, and over 70% of them will fall off in about 8 hours.
<strong>Hemoglobin with Protein and Iron�</strong>
The blood in flea dirt has a varied amount of hemoglobin essential for flea larvae&rsquo;s growth.</li>
<li>Specifically, Hemoglobin contains 85-89% proteins (from the host&rsquo;s blood protein) that aid larvae&rsquo;s evolution.
Further, Hemoglobin�intensifies�sclerotization and larvae growth due to its high 45-79% iron (from the host&rsquo;s blood iron) content.
<strong>Coils &amp;�spherules (Coils have 32% extra proteins)�</strong>
Feces in the coil shape have� 32% additional proteins than the spherule&rsquo;s form of flea feces.</li>
<li>However, the key to note is that coil-shaped flea feces are mainly ejected by fleas about two weeks old, while the spherule-shaped wastes are from the newly developed flea adults.
Therefore, younger flea larvae will favor the spherule-shaped feces since they are softer and smaller, while those in their elder days will take the coil-shaped feces since it has 32% additional proteins.
<strong>Females Fleas produce more Feces.</strong>
Adult fleas (particularly females) will suck blood about 13.6 �l of host blood, which is significantly higher than their male counterparts (that suck about 5 �l - 6.97 �l�of host blood).</li>
<li>Therefore, female fleas will generate more massive feces, which plays a more significant role in parenting and feeding their larvae.
Also, female Fleas feed on more blood to balance their body metabolism to allow higher egg production.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2non-viable-or-conspecific-flea-eggs">2.�Non-viable or Conspecific flea Eggs</h3>
<p>Besides, undigested host blood, fleas will also feed on non-viable (or conspecific) eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12510898/">recent Hsu MHin recent research</a>concluded that�non-viable flea eggs contributed to the proper development of more than� 90% of the flea larvae into adults.</li>
<li>But who many such eggs would one larva require.
Scientific evidence varies with the larvae eating from 7 - 20 dead &amp; non-viable
flea eggs
per flea larvae.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-scavenging-andcannibalism"><strong>3. Scavenging and�Cannibalism�</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Scavenging�</strong>
Flea larvae�mainly live
in bedding or the nest where they turn around to scavenge for food in the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are worm-looking or legless with their mandibles that will be feeding on flea dirt.</li>
<li>Flea larvae will move around (up to 90 cm) in search of food.
But, they&rsquo;ll be within�16 cm around the flea nest if flea dirt is readily available in that habitat or hatching area. However, flea larvae have a higher probability of dying if they don&rsquo;t get food in three days.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cannibalistic Tendencies? Finally, flea larvae will also cannibalize (or eat one of their own) larvae that are either injured or weakly.
Further, some larva may also eat different�naked pupae or the larval�casings that have been shed.</p>

<h2 id="details-what-do-flea-larvae-look-like">Details: What Do Flea Larvae Look Like?</h2>
<p>It is often much more comfortable recognizing an adult
flea or even a flea egg
, but identifying flea larvae might be a little more complicated.
Before we begin to learn how to spot flea larvae, let&rsquo;s take a brief look at their
life cycle
. Read also;

<em>The Life Cycle of a Flea</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The first stage is the egg; these are small whitish objects around the size of a grain of salt and are notoriously difficult to notice.</li>
<li>Next comes the larvae stage, which we will look at in more depth throughout this article.</li>
<li>The third stage is the pupa when the flea enters into a cocoon and lies dormant for some time.</li>
<li>Finally, the adult flea emerges, and this is what most people are familiar with.
The Flea Larvae
If you think you might have spotted
flea larvae around your home
, there are certain things to look out for, such as;</li>
<li>A tiny worm-like creature is measuring between 2mm and 5mm in length.</li>
<li>The creature will have a whitish color to it.</li>
<li>It will be covered in tiny hairs, which are very light in color.
The flea larvae are known to feed on the flea dust, which is essentially the waste product left behind from the adult fleas, and so you might notice these creatures around areas where flea dust is present.

</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-flea-larvae-hide-out">Where Do Flea Larvae Hide Out?</h2>
<p>The most popular
place for the flea
larvae is near the host animal, so you will often find them either on the animal itself or in areas where the animal is regularly present, such as its bed.
To the naked eye, you might notice tiny little C-shaped objects-these are the flea larvae. If you can spot them at this stage of their development, you are much more likely to tackle the flea problem as a whole.
If you kill them at this stage, this will stop them from hiding in nooks and crannies during the pupa stage, which is known to be much more challenging to tackle.

<p>If you have spotted an infestation of
flea larvae either on your pet or within the home
, you will want to get rid of the pests as soon as possible.
Various ways are very effective at tackling flea larvae head-on. Let&rsquo;s take a look at these now - including
how to control fleas in your yard
.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is essential to treat your pet as soon as you notice any signs of fleas. This can be done quickly over-the-counterflea treatmentsbrought from most stores and pharmacies.</li>
<li>You can also take your animal to the vet who willadminister a flea treatment, but this is only a small part of the process. You must treat the home to rid yourself of allfleas entirely and preventthem from taking over again.</li>
<li>To effectively clear the home of fleas, you should vacuum thoroughly and put all bedding and soft furnishings through a hot wash in the washing machine; this willkill any flealarvae or fleas at other stages of development.</li>
<li>It would help if you were sure to clean inhard-to-reach areas where eggsand larvae may be hiding out, and this process should be repeated regularly for maximum effect. Also, tryfoggers for fleas.</li>
<li>You may need to employ a professionalpest controlcompany to find that the fleas and their larvae are incredibly stubborn.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flea <a href="/posts/what-do-flea-larvae-eat/">larvae</a> are concentrated in places that pets sleep or relax like carpet fibers. Also, the carpet fibers may hinder
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-%5Bfleas%5D(/posts/what-do-flea-larvae-look-like/)/">insecticides like foggers</a>
from easily penetrating and killing the larvae.
<strong>On where do flea larvae live? Fleas larvae will live in those micro-habitats that are dark, with moderate temperature, and high humidity with enough flea food.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**So, in your home, you&rsquo;ll find flea larvae (and over�**80% of the fleas) growing incarpet fibers.</li>
<li><strong>You&rsquo;ll also get fleas larvae around the pet&rsquo;s resting areas - including around dog houses, holstered furniture, floorboard cracks, and pet bedding.�</strong>

<h2 id="requirements-for-the-flea-larvae-to-thrive">Requirements for the Flea Larvae to Thrive?</h2>
<p>The habitat requirements for the flea larvae to thrive - not that these won&rsquo;t be widespread for the flea larvae. These worm-like creatures will require some unique substrates to allow better hatching and maturing.
You&rsquo;ll find such appropriate habitats either outdoors or indoors - but from the eggs in the flea population - just a few will get to the adult stage.
<strong>1. Food</strong>
Flea larvae mainly from the cat fleas don&rsquo;t live like parasites on hosts such as cats and dogs - they&rsquo;re considered
free-living
. But they&rsquo;ll hunt for food in the surroundings with their random foraging habits.
But the worm-like bugs will largely feed on dried feces (waste) dropped by adult fleas. The larvae will also eat younger larvae and flea eggs - but they won&rsquo;t eat organic debris from hosts like cats.
On food-seeking, flea larvae will move around the areas that have food. For instance, they&rsquo;ll move to an area with food (about 90 cm) after they hatch in one without - beating starvation - which can happen in 3 days.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH2KblmOlFo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH2KblmOlFo</a>
<strong>2. Darkness</strong>
Dark areas will be lovely for the flea larvae to thrive. These creatures tend to die when sun-exposed or if they&rsquo;re kept in open locations - this is because there will be low RH and it&rsquo;s hot.
The worm-like creatures tend to escape sunlight by
burrowing deep into clutter, yard leaves
, (or sand), or moving to the shaded places - this is to avoid light.
<strong>3. Ambient Temperature</strong>
Consider the ambient temperatures where the flea larvae will be as it&rsquo;ll affect how the bugs will survive. Their survival will be diminished at temperatures over 95F (35C) and under 55.4F (13C).
Flea larvae will survive best at ambient temperatures of between 27C - 32C (89.6F) and 80.6F. On the extremes low, flea larvae will take around 15C with the ideal temperature being between 25C to 30C.
<strong>4. Relative Humidity</strong>
On relative humidity, flea larvae will die when it&rsquo;s relatively low as the dry conditions cause fast desiccation. So, I note that these bugs require 50% to 95% relative humidity (RH) to survive.
Ideally, fleas require a 75 to 92% RH for great survival but some researchers report that a 60% RH on the lower side can work while 80% RH is also suitable on the higher end.
For relative humidity that&rsquo;s more than 75%, the flea larvae will take in high amounts of water from the surroundings and thus they&rsquo;ll become healthier and larger.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the flea larvae won&rsquo;t live when the relative humidity goes above 95%. But the larvae will also survive at12% RH - dry air provided there is a moist substrate with 1% to 20% soil moisture. &rsquo;
<strong>5. Micro-climates and Micro-habitats</strong>
As noted earlier, fleas larvae will thrive best in protected micro-habitats such as dark and cool areas. This is due to the stable temperature and humidity (great micro-climates) that are moderate.
On larvae movement, the baby fleas are super mobile but lack appendages, feet, or legs - they move through squeezing and relaxing the skin muscles while they&rsquo;re on some dry area.
For distance, flea larvae will move under 15 centimeters to about 46 centimeters on the carpet once it has hatched. But when they move from eggs to growing into a cocoon, the larvae move around 20 centimeters.</li>
<li>But compared to the first instar, the second instar are able to move further - but either way, none of the flea larvae stages will go beyond the eclosion point.
On stimuli, flea larvae will move away from light - considered as negatively phototactic but will move with gravity - described as positively geotactic.
Further, the worm-like creatures are thigmotactic and positively hygrotactic meaning that they react positively to physical contact and high humidity respectively. They&rsquo;ll avoid pet and pedestrian traffic.

</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-flea-larvae-live">Where Do Flea Larvae Live?</h2>
<p><strong>1. Around the House�</strong>
Flea larvae will hide around the house in those protected areas especially under the rugs, and carpet fibers. They may also hide on hardwood floors - in the crevices and cracks.
You won&rsquo;t find the flea larvae on areas with linoleum floors or tiled floors. However, you may find baby bugs under furniture, upholstery, cushions, dirt-floor basements, rugs, and pet bedding.
Around the house, flea larvae will hide around dense shrubs and ground cover where the relative humidity is over 45% always. You&rsquo;ll find them under organic debris like�the soil, leaves, branches, grass.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, notice that the organisms won&rsquo;t go deeper than few millimeters or go deep in places that have soil moisture of more than 7 percent - they&rsquo;ll drown when the soil moisture is over 20 percent.
<strong>2. In the Yard</strong>
Other locations that the larvae will live include the yard or lawns. But the bugs rarely get suitable habitats in the outdoor spaces.
For example, recent research found that just about 4% of flea-infested homes have bugs in outdoor spaces. Such outdoor habits need to have wind protection, a shade, and high humidity for fleas to live comfortably.
So, in the outdoor spaces, you won&rsquo;t find flea larvae around the yard grass, and under trees since these areas have low RH (Relative Humidity).</li>
<li>But fleas and flea larvae will die most duringlate winterand survive best during early fall - times when they&rsquo;ll massively attack your pets.
If the
habitat allows
flea dirt
and eggs to exist, then flea larvae will also survive. The bits from fleas will trigger scratching and irritation - processes that dislodge the flea dirt and flea eggs.
Further, fleas won&rsquo;t survive in a location that has poor drainage, sprinklers, and heavy rainfall, as they&rsquo;ll eventually drown and also wash the flea dirt.
<strong>3. Carpeting�</strong>
Flea larvae (including over 50% of fleas) will burrow into the carpet fibers.</li>
<li>The carpet fibers will protect the bugs from the direct sunlight or desiccating air flow that may kill them.
Carpets that are made to accumulate some dirt at their base will build up food for the flea larvae. The location has moderate ambient temperature and relative humidity - great for fleas.
Further, the carpet offers a canopy to protect the bugs and their larvae from being
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-house-carpets/">exterminated by insecticides</a>
or also mechanical damage such as vacuuming.
The carpets will also hold some organic debris - keeping the larvae food safe and hidden. Also, the bugs tend to coil themselves when they notice disturbances.
<strong>4. Other Rooms</strong>
Further, you may find the immature flea larvae around the carpeted rooms, living rooms, and bedrooms - especially areas that your pets rest.
As they move around the rooms, they&rsquo;ll drop many eggs as they jump to the ground or off the furniture. Check the pet furniture and bedding - or near the human&rsquo;s bed.</li>
<li>Also, inspect outdoor areas that have under structures, animal burrows, crawl spaces, flower beds, pet shelters, and dog houses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on &lsquo;where do flea larvae live?&rsquo;, well, flea larvae will live near places with flea hosts (cats &amp; dogs), and flea dirt, and organic debris including carpets, pet bedding, and the house.</p>
