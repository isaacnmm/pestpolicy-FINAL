<h2 id="buyers-guide---best-drain-snake"><strong>Buyers Guide - Best Drain Snake�</strong></h2>
<p>When shopping for a drain snake, it is common for many customers to become overwhelmed by the many varieties that the market has to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is worth noting that price does not always go with quality. So, be keen not to be fooled by shopkeepers who present the pricey products as the best in quality and performance.</li>
<li>Also, different customers may be interested in different features of a product.
So what you see as the qualifying factor in a product may not be the qualifying factor for another customer. Thus, I find it important to share some of the most important factors to consider when buying a drain snake.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considerationswhen-buying-a-drain-snake">Considerations**�when buying a drain snake**</h2>
<p><strong>1. Cable Length</strong>
Drain cleaners come with varying cable lengths. So, depending on the span of your clogs, the ideal cable should be able to reach them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, your cable length will be determined by theplace you livein. Typically, people who live in a single storied house will require a drain unit with a least 25 ft cable, such as Ridgid 41408.
A 25 ft cable will not be the ideal cable for cleaning a bathroom drain on the second floor. You need a unit with at least 25 ft cable length.
<strong>2. Diameter</strong>
A drain snake should slide freely through the drain piping to reach the clogs. That means the diameter of the cable should always be smaller than that of the drain piping.
Experts usually recommend a difference of at least  to 1 between the snake diameter and the pipe diameter.�If you dont know the pipe diameter, go for a small diameter.
<strong>3. Auger Mechanism</strong>
Every snake needs a means of spinning the cable through the drain. Turning of the cable is what makes it possible to negotiate curves and penetrate clogs.
Avoid units that lack an auger mechanism. The auger mechanism you opt for should be reliable. Otherwise, you might spend a lot of time unclogging your drain or even retrieving the cable from the drain.
<strong>4. Head Type</strong>
Drain cleaners come with either fixed or interchangeable heads. If you opt for a snake with a fixed head, choose one that will tackle your most frequent clogs.
In the case of interchangeable heads, choose those that are easy to change. Below are the most common types of head types used for drain snakes.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Screw head</strong>: Also known as coil head, this type of head allows you to pull the blockage. This is a powerful head for removing blockages such as paper towels and other related products.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting head</strong>: A cutting head is the most preferred head for blockages that require cutting. Most professional plumbers prefer this type of cable head.</li>
<li>**Fixed Head:**This type of head is fixed on the cable and cannot be changed.</li>
<li><strong>Interchangeable Head</strong>: When a drain snake comes with an interchangeable head, it provides you with a way of leveraging different heads to cater to different types of clogs. The good thing is that they are easy to change and do not require special tools to change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-drain-snakes"><strong>How to use the Drain Snakes�</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
We&rsquo;ll take the plumber&rsquo;s snake. Next, I&rsquo;ve loosened the thumbscrew, as this will allow me to pull out the snake.
<strong>2.</strong>
Next, we&rsquo;ll pull out the snake and start pushing it into the drainpipe that&rsquo;s clogged. Continue with this process until you meet so relatively high resistance. This resistance means that you&rsquo;ve reached the drain blockage or a bend in the pipe. Check
flea foggers
.
<strong>3.</strong>
But you need to be about 6 inches from the pipe opening. Once I meet some resistance, I&rsquo;ll tighten up the thumbscrew. Now, I&rsquo;ll spin the auger bit, and it&rsquo;ll drill through the blockage. To do this, I&rsquo;ll hold the handle while pushing forward.
<strong>4.</strong>
Now, hold at the end and loosen the nut, pull out the drain snake more, tighten the nut again and repeat the process to drill through more of the drain blockage.
<strong>5.</strong>
When you feel that you&rsquo;ve drilled through most of the blockage, loosen the thumb screen and pull back the drain snake.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to drain clogs of all types, a drain snake would be an ideal solution rather than paying for a plumber&rsquo;s services be.
And although there are various drain snakes out there, not all of them are suitable for your type of drain clog.
So, it is recommended that you access your kind of drain clog to determine the suitable drain snake for you.
Always go for a drain snake that fits into your drain pipes. Oversize drain snakes will not do a good job or, even worse, will end up damaging your pipes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the
<strong>best shower drain cleaner</strong>
, you can consider factors like effectiveness,
safety
, ease of use, and environmental impact. Selecting the right product will help prevent costly plumbing repairs and keep your <a href="/posts/how-drain-cleaners-work/">drains</a> flowing smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1effectiveness">1.<strong>Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0182VBOJE/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Green Gobbler</strong></a>
, are known for their powerful formulas that quickly break down hair, soap scum, and grease.
Effectiveness is key when choosing a cleaner, as it directly impacts how quickly and thoroughly the drain becomes unclogged. Look for products specifically designed to target your type of clog, whether its due to hair or grease build-up.</p>
<h3 id="2safety-for-pipes-and-septic-systems">2.<strong>Safety for Pipes and Septic Systems</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TS2R1A/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Drano Max Gel Clog Remover</strong></a>
, are formulated to be tough on clogs but gentle on pipes. Using harsh chemicals can damage your plumbing over time, so its important to choose a drain cleaner that is safe for all types of pipes, including PVC and metal.
For homes with septic systems, opt for septic-safe products to avoid disrupting the balance of bacteria essential for the systems function.</p>
<h3 id="3environmental-impact">3.<strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Environmentally friendly options, like
<strong>Biokleen Bac-Out Drain Care Gel</strong>
, offer effective cleaning power without harmful chemicals.
These products use natural enzymes or bacteria to break down organic material in the drain, which is better for the environment and safer for your home. If reducing your ecological footprint is a priority, check for biodegradable and non-toxic labels.</p>
<h3 id="4ease-of-use">4.<strong>Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Liquid-Plumr Pro-Strength Full Clog Destroyer</strong>
, are designed to be user-friendly, requiring no special tools or complicated instructions.
The ease of application can make a significant difference, especially if youre dealing with a

and need a quick fix. Most gel formulas are easy to pour directly into the drain without any mess.</p>
<h3 id="5speed-of-action">5.<strong>Speed of Action</strong></h3>
<p>Some cleaners, such as
<strong>CLR Power Plumber</strong>
, work within minutes, while others might need to sit in the drain for a longer period to achieve full effectiveness. Fast-acting solutions are ideal for emergencies when you need to restore water flow quickly. However, slower-acting solutions can be more thorough and may prevent future clogs from building up again soon.</p>

      <description>Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review? Dont we all hate the common challenge of the slow-moving drain in the kitchen or sink?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review? Dont we all hate the common challenge of the slow-moving drain in the kitchen or sink?
In this post, Ive reviewed the Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria, which is one of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners I recommend for your plumbing systems</a>
. I tested Bio-clean using Friskies cat food that contains 10 % fats, 30 % protein, and the others are mineral substances &amp; carbohydrates.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
You have to note that Bio-clean
Drain cleaner
is a bacteria/ enzyme formula that is eco-friendly. Luckily, itll tear down the clog/ gunk on the inner side of your
drain pipes
(both metal including copper and PVC pipes) but wont damage the pipes.</p>
<h2 id="bio-clean-drain-septic-bacteria-2-review">Bio-clean Drain Septic Bacteria 2 Review</h2>
<p>Therefore, compared to other
drain cleaners that are either highly basic or highly acidic
, thus harming your piping system, this Bio-clean Drain cleaner has only enzymes and natural bacteria thatll break down the organic matter (the drain clog) thats blocking the plumbing system.</p>
<h3 id="safe-and-ease-of-application">Safe and Ease of application</h3>
<p>Youll require a single teaspoonful of the
drain cleaner and dump it into the clogged/)
<a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> or piping system. However, mix the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-unclog-a-bathtub-drain-with-standing-water/">drain cleaner powder with some hot water</a>
to activate the bacteria and enzymes&rsquo; working. Finally, pour your great water drain cleaner mixture directly into the clogged drain.</p>
<h3 id="the-slower-rate-of-action-4-6-hours-overnight-is-better">The slower rate of action: 4-6 hours (Overnight is better)</h3>
<p>Compared to the other drain cleaners such as
Pure Lye drain opener
,
Drano Max Gel Clog Remover
, or the
XIONLAB Safer Drain Opener
that required an allowance of 15-30 minutes to work on the drain clog fully, this Bio-clean Drain cleaner requires about 4-6 hours without flushing with either cold or hot water. This is mainly because The organic enzymes and bacteria have a slow rate of action compared to the basic, acidic or caustic cleaners.</p>
<h3 id="cost-effective-drain-cleaner">Cost-effective drain cleaner</h3>
<p>Bio-clean Drain cleaner is more very safe and cost-effective compared to other drain cleaners available in the market today  due to the en enzymatic mode of action. Bio-clean is highly economical.
It allows about 100 drain treatments per bottle. As noted above, youll only require just one tablespoon to treat your clogged drain. The natural bacteria tend to multiply fast after eating some organic matter in the plumbing system, giving you faster and cheap drain removal.
[amazon box=&ldquo;B001N09KN4&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]</p>
<h3 id="genetically-built-formula">Genetically built formula</h3>
<p>The genetically built formula will consume all the soap scum, oil, grease, hair, and cotton in your clogged drains. Its a unique formula that is a development from the advances in the recent decades biotechnology. The clog&rsquo;s enzymes act by digesting the foreign material in a way just like how humans digest food.
On the other hand, once mixed in water, the bio-clean digest the organic matter, tripling in number by the minute, and release mineral ash, carbon dioxide, and water. Further, the enzymes do not rely on gravity to act and will thus ill love throughout the clogged drain and eat away the organic matter.</p>
<h2 id="bio-clean-safe-for-pipes"><strong>Bio-Clean safe for pipes</strong>?</h2>
<p>I would say that Bio-clean, as they are just natural bacteria and enzymes, wont generate dangerous gases in their action. Bio-clean digests organic materials without heating or generation poisonous fumes.
The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain cleaner</a>
wont harm your pipes as it has not contained caustic, acidic, or alkaline formula. Further, it wont eat away any live tissue as hence its safe for yourself, your kids, or pets in addition to being eco-friendly.
Further, the products of its action are only mineral ash, water, and carbon dioxide. The mineral ash must not make you worry as it&rsquo;s safe and even helps aid plant development.</p>

Today Im explaining how the

cut through standing water and eat up the organic matter in PVC and metal pipes. Recently, I discussed how to
unclog stagnant water in your bathtub
.
<strong>Summary:�Oxidizing drain cleaners (with�nitrate ions) utilize heat and gas to unclog <a href="/posts/best-shower-drain-cleaner/">drains</a> while caustic drain cleaners generate hydroxide ions that clear the drain clog. It produces heat to break down the grease &amp; oil. Here&rsquo;re the top drain cleaners.�</strong>

<h2 id="how-drain-cleaners-work-unclogging-plumbing">How Drain Cleaners Work (Unclogging) Plumbing</h2>
<p>Chemical drain clears produce heat and gas, which may melt the PVC pipes if not used according to label instructions. Further, you must keep the cleaners away from animals or children as they are dangerous if ingested.
The products may burn clothes or char mucous membranes, skin, and eyes. Precautions to take include dont use a plunger, dont

, wearing gas masks and rubber gloves, and ensuring that the room is ventilated.</p>
<h3 id="i-chemical-based-cleaners">(i). Chemical-Based Cleaners</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Drain cleaners</dt>
<dt>(powder, gel, or liquid) in your local store are mainly chemicals substances that function by giving or taking electrons to or from the drain clog, a process that also could produce heat.</dt>
<dt><strong>1. Acidic drain cleaners</strong></dt>
<dd>Mainly, youll not find these types of drain cleaners in your local store. However, they are mainly found with the plumbers due to their high acid (either hydrochloric or sulfuric acid) concentrations.
Their mechanism of action is by introducing hydronium ions (ion H3O+) to the
clogged drain
and thus attracts a majority of the electrons.
<strong>2. Oxidizing�drain cleaners</strong></dd>
<dd>Oxidizing�drain cleaners have nitrates, peroxides, and bleach. This chemical class of cleaners will oxidize the drain clog by extracting electrons from it.
Notably, being heavy compared to water, the chemical drain cleaner will settle at the bottom of any standing water, producing gas and heat that clears the clog.
<strong>3. Caustic�drain cleaners</strong></dd>
<dd>These
types of chemical drain cleaners
have caustic potash and lye.
Being basic/ alkaline types of cleaners, theyll release electrons to the drain clog, reacting with the hydroxide ions to allow the clog&rsquo;s unblocking.
The chemical will produce gas and heat thatll change the drain clog into a soapy and easily dissolvable solution.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="ii-enzyme-based-cleaners">(ii). Enzyme-Based Cleaners</h3>
<p>Caution: dont use enzymatic cleaners combined with chemical disinfectants or bleach since these products will lessen their effectiveness. These natural and effective products will work for you if you love green solutions or simply allergic to chemical cleaners.
The biofilm-eating enzyme cleaners will be great in unclogging
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bio-clean-drain-septic-bacteria-2-review/">drains in septic</a>
systems. Theyll work great with lukewarm water to allow the growth of different bacteria.

are both a health hazard and a nuisance.
The moist conditions including the organic matter in the septic tank allow the drain flies to reproduce fast. But fear not, I&rsquo;ll delve into ways you can use to get rid of drain flies in your septic tank.
Drain flies have a length of about 1/4 inch - they&rsquo;ll love the organic matter in the septic tanks,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/">bathrooms</a>
, sewage systems,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-basement/">basement</a>
, and near drains.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-septic-tank">Details: How to Get Rid Of Drain Flies in Septic Tank</h2>
<p>First, I&rsquo;ll need you to understand the cause of these drain flies. These bugs thrive and reproduce fast in the septic tank due to the moist conditions.
Drain flies will inhabit stagnant water, pipes, and drains. So, it&rsquo;s critical to solve the plumbing issues and septic tank moisture problems.
Check for moth-like, tiny bugs that will be near your septic tank and drains. The pests are brown, gray, or black - but there may also be maggots and larvae.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-an-inspection-and-remove-any-breeding-sites">Step 1: Conduct an Inspection and Remove any Breeding Sites</h3>
<p>First, I recommend you eliminate or remove those drain fly breeding locations. This location will have some decaying sewage and food, and other organic matter- which greatly encourages the breeding of the drain flies.
So, I recommend the process of cleaning the septic tank and drains around it - this will help eliminate the organic matter that would attract and host the bugs.
One method you may use will be cleaning these locations using
drain cleaners such as Bio-Clean
, Green Gobbler, or the Drano Max - these will help you flush out the organic matter that tends to build up in the septic tank and drains.
Besides cleaning the drains and the septic tank, you&rsquo;ll need to eliminate other different locations where the drain flies to breed. Some of these probable areas include fixing those plumbing leaks, and dirty or clogged gutters.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, inspect your spaces (drains, showers,toilets, gutters, or around sinks) using a flashlight to check signs of drain flies. Further, I recommend inspecting the outdoor sewage or drain systems.
Once you&rsquo;ve pinpointed the flies&rsquo; breeding sites, you&rsquo;ll require to fix the plumbing leaks, clean those gutters or drain out the standing water.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-use-drain-fly-traps">Step 2: Use Drain Fly Traps</h3>
<p>After removing those drain fly breeding locations, next,
you&rsquo;ll want to use fly traps
to get hold of any remaining bugs. Some of the approved drain flies include the pheromone traps or the sticky traps.
The pheromone traps employ some scented lure to attract the bugs. These trap&rsquo;s pheromones are created to be like the natural pheromones created naturally by flies - and which they otherwise use in their communication.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pheromones tend to attract the flies and hence they&rsquo;ll get near the trap and they&rsquo;ll get stuck on the sticky traps.
Sticky fly traps employ some sticky substance that&rsquo;ll trap the pests. The sticky substance used in this tool is the trapping item. You&rsquo;ll need to position the sticky drain fly in the right locations where the drain flies tend to land and breed most.</li>
<li>So, I recommend you place these traps near drains, toilets, and sinks - you&rsquo;ll position them near breeding sites, ceilings, and walls.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-apply-insecticide">Step 3: Apply Insecticide</h3>
<p>For a massive drain fly infestation in your septic tank, I recommend you use some insecticide. You may use either foams, dust, or sprays. But for each, adhere to the product description and follow the safety directions such as eyeglasses and ensure the spaces are adequately ventilated.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an effective technique if the other DIY drain fly control methods fail to control the bugs fully. You may have pellets, foggers, or sprays.
I suggested you get advice from a
professional exterminator or pest control technician</li>
<li>those that are near your residence or home.
Further, once you&rsquo;ve applied the insecticide, you&rsquo;ll require to sanitize or clean the spaces to remove the drain flies that are dead and also the residual chemicals.
You may use foam insecticides to treat locations that prove hard-to-reach like inside cracks, and pipes. The insecticide will expand to fill the deep gaps and thus they&rsquo;ll suffocate the bugs.</li>
<li>The dust-form insecticide for drain flies will work by coating the object surfaces while also the chemicals kill the gnats that come into contact with it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-seal-the-drains">Step 4: Seal the Drains</h3>
<p>Also, make sure that you keep great hygiene of your septic tank and the drains. This will hinder more of the drain flies from returning.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require to clean the septic tank and the drains - this will help to get rid of the organic matter - which would otherwise host the drain flies. In addition, cleaning the drain may also require you to employ bacterial treatments.
You must seal the septic tank and the drain to prevent their re-entry and breeding further. You may use a drain cover or plug for this.</li>
<li>Drain plus or covers may be of various sizes and materials including silicone, metal, or plastic - you can get them in the local home improvement shop or hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-hire-drain-fly-exterminators">Step 5: Hire Drain Fly Exterminators</h3>
<p>Finally, if all the techniques outlined above have not helped to remove those drain flies from your septic tank, you&rsquo;ll need to hire a drain fly exterminator.</p>
<ul>
<li>The technician will come with advanced equipment and also expertise that&rsquo;s targeted to specific pests including drin flies.</li>
<li>Such equipment will assist in the clear identification of the drain fly source and also in the efficient control of the infestation.
For the exterminator, you&rsquo;ll prefer, to get one that is experienced in tackling drain flies and also well reputable from client reviews. So, I prefer you enquire for review from family and friends, especially with the local exterminators they&rsquo;ve used.
Get the exterminator to inspect your septic tank, drains, and home in general for drain flies. This will assist in determining the level of infestation and hence knowing the treatment plan to employ -
could be fumigation
or insecticides.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drain flies in drains and septic tanks can be a nuisance. These locations provide an excellent location for breeding - due to the organic matter and water - you can use exterminators, seal drains, apply insecticides, clean the breeding sites, and use drain fly traps.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re tired of the nuisance brought by the tiny nuzzling insects (drain <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-septic-tank/">flies</a> also known as sewer flies) in your basement drains in your residence, it&rsquo;s time we go rid of them!
The basement has many attractants (moist areas and organic material like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-%5Bdrain%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/)-cleaners-work/">sewage</a>
) to these bugs including clogged drains, leaky pipes, and standing water where they&rsquo;ll lay eggs and multiply quickly.
Below, I&rsquo;ve explored some safe and effective methods on how you can remove drain flies in the basement -including ways to prevent any possible infestations.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-the-drain-flies-in-my-basement">Why Are The Drain Flies in My Basement?</h2>
<p>First, how and why did the drain flies get into your basement? Well, as noted earlier, drains flies are attracted to organic material and damp or moist environments. Therefore, your basement may have these conditions and thus promoting the development of these bugs.
A key reason for this is leakage of water in the basement - this may be from some leaking pipes. Also, clogged drains and standing water - will offer moisture and organic material for the drain flies and
gnats to thrive</p>
<ul>
<li>lay eggs, and reproduce.
However, drain flies can also arise from materials that came from outside the basement. Some of these conditions may include the bugs hiking onto pets, or clothing. So, it&rsquo;s important to fix the source of the drain flies and their nutritional source.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-method-of-removing-drain-flies-from-the-basement">7 Method of Removing Drain Flies from The Basement</h2>
<h3 id="1-clean-the-basement-drains">1. Clean The Basement Drains</h3>
<p>First, cleaning the basement drains will help remove the organic matter that builds up - and which acts as a good ground for bugs laying eggs. You may employ DIY or commercial methods and products to clean these drains.
a.
<strong>DIY Drain Cleaning</strong>
The DIY technique I recommend to clean the basement drains is using vinegar plus baking soda - luckily these products are effective but also safe to use around pets and humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply, pour the ingredients into the drains in equal measures - 1 cup of each - vinegar &amp; baking soda.</li>
<li>The chemical will produce bubbles and fizzle as it eats away the organic matter in the drains - so allow it to work its magic for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Finally, once the vinegar and baking soda works its magic, flush it down using hot water.
However, you must repeat the drain-cleaning process regularly - this will hinder the build-up of organic matter. I also recommend the use of drain covers as they&rsquo;ll help hinder the build-up of debris.
b.
<strong>Commercial Drain Cleaning</strong>
You can also use
commercial drain cleaners
to clean the basement drains and this will ultimately assist you to remove the drain flies. The chemicals in the cleaners will dissolve the debris and gunk (breaking it into small particles) that&rsquo;s clogged inside pipes.</li>
<li>But it&rsquo;s important to get a drain cleaner that won&rsquo;t harm your pipes - for example, check if the chemical is appropriate for pipes made of clay, metal, or PVC.</li>
<li>Notably, using a damaging drain cleaner (depending on the pipe type) will harm the pipes and lead to leakages.
Further, ensure to adhere to the manufacturers cleaner usage instructions for safety and effectiveness in cleaning the basement drains. For example, ensure to put on protective equipment such as eyewear and gloves.
Enzymatic drain cleaners would be excellent such as Bio-clean Drain Septic will be safe and not hard on the pipes - besides being eco-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-remove-standing-water">2. Remove Standing Water</h2>
<p>Having standing water in the basement will work to attract and breed drain flies. So, I recommend that you drain all the water including the small water puddles that may have collected in a corner after a cleaning exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you should remove water and clean the faucets and fix any pipe leakages in the house basement. To achieve this, you can use a dry or wet vacuum, mop the floor, or dehumidifier.
Also, examine the basement for any water seepage signs and this will require that you also seal any gaps or cracks. For example, you may also install a French drain system or a sump pump as this will assist you in removing the accumulation of water.
Besides, you can also eliminate the basement dampness and water by removing humidity and enhancing air circulation. Simply install some ventilation system, use fans, and open any available windows for better air circulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-use-sticky-drain-fly-traps">3. Use Sticky Drain Fly Traps</h2>
<p>Next, you can use drain fly traps in the basement to remove those bugs. You can use light traps or sticky traps. Light traps will use UV light to attract the bugs while the sticky substance in sticky traps will get hold and kill the bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fly traps will operate to deuce the drain fly population by catching them. Simple, you&rsquo;ll require to place the drain fly traps near those debasement drains or areas that have moisture.
Fly traps will effectively trap the fly larvae and the adults - however, using this technique is a short-term remedy for the bugs.
You should use this method in combination with other techniques such use of drain cleaners and regular removal of standing water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-use-fly-insecticides">4. Use Fly Insecticides</h2>
<p>Another option would be using insecticides to remove drain flies from the basement. The market has a number of effective insecticides that you can use on these bugs. However, their effectiveness will depend on correct usage and following the product label instructions.
Below are the guidelines and instructions you must follow while using the drain fly insecticides inside the basement area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put on some eye protection, a mask and gloves - and any other recommended protective clothing.</li>
<li>Ensure that the insecticide had ingredients that target drain flies specifically.
Also, considering that the insecticides are chemical based - you&rsquo;ll need to consider critical safety precautions when fighting the drain fly infestation.</li>
<li>So that you or your pet don&rsquo;t intake harmful pesticide fumes, you&rsquo;ll need to properly ventilate the basement.</li>
<li>Check the product instruction for the time to allow before going back to the basement after treating the area using the pesticides.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require to apply the insecticide directly on the moist areas including the drains.
To fully eliminate the drain flies, you&rsquo;ll require to repeat the bu-treatment process regularly or as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, drain flies have proven a nuisance especially when they invade your basement or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/">bathroom</a>
, mainly because these areas have moisture, dampness, and organic matter - conditions that promote the fast breeding of these bugs.
I hope the above DIY and commercially acquired products will help your get rid of the drain flies in your residential or commercial building basement.</p>

just like moths
) will mainly invade areas that have standing water including the kitchens and bathrooms.�In this article, I&rsquo;ll outline all you need to know how to get rid of drain flies in your bathroom.
<strong>But in summary; here&rsquo;s how to get rid of drain flies; Clean the Bathroom Drains,�Pour Boiling Water Down the Drain,�using a drain cleaner (such as Bio-Clean or vinegar + baking soda),�Use Baking Soda &amp; Vinegar,�Address Moisture Issues and Leaks, or�using bleach to clean drains.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="7-easy-ways-how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-bathrooms">7 Easy Ways How To Get Rid Of Drain Flies in Bathrooms</h2>
<h3 id="1clean-the-bathroom-drains">1.�Clean the Bathroom Drains</h3>
<p>To remove the drain flies from the bathroom, begin by cleaning all the spills and the drains. I recommend using a suitable
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner/">drain cleaner</a>
such as Chemical Drain or Bio-Enzymatic Drain to help destroy the organic matter in your drains.
However, incorporating a brush will also assist in removing the debris in the bathroom drains. This process will also help in removing any soap or food debris inside the drains.</p>
<ul>
<li>I recommend you repeat the drain cleaning process severally to reduce the drain flies plus themold and mildew- you may also use dehumidifiers to get rid of moisture.
But it&rsquo;s critical to ensure that the chemical components of the drains are cleaner are safe for your pets and humans in the space. Ensure to adhere to the drain cleaner usage instructions - which may include also wearing eye protection and gloves.
Here&rsquo;s the process to properly use the drain cleaner and get rid of the drain files from the bathrooms and moist areas such as bathrooms.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>First, remove the food waste and moisture (plus liquids) inside the drains - as these will be an attractant to the drain flies.</li>
<li>Cover the bathroom drains using some cloth or towel to avoid the splash of your drain cleaner as the chemicals would corrode the skin or eyes.</li>
<li>Finally, pour the drain cleaner into the bathroom drains and allow it to work on the organic matter for roughly 30 minutes before pouring hot water down.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-pour-boiling-water-down-the-drain">2. Pour Boiling Water Down the Drain</h3>
<p>Next, pour some boiling water into the bathroom drains (ceramic or metallic drains only) to help kill those drain fly larvae - this will be more effective if done about 30 minutes after pouring drains cleaners into the drains.
The water at high temperatures will kill those fly larvae but it&rsquo;ll also flush out the organic matter and other debris from the bathroom drains - these could otherwise attract other drain flies.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, be cautious that you must pour the hot water slowly into the drains to avoid splashing it onto your skin or eyes.
However, this technique of pouring hot water must only be applied to ceramic or metallic drains. This is because the hot water will damage your PVC or plastic pipes.</li>
<li>Hot water is an effective technique against drain flies but will also hinder the emergence of other drainage issues - especially blockages and clogs. This is because the water will dissolve the hair, grease, and soap.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3use-baking-soda--vinegar">3.�Use Baking Soda &amp; Vinegar</h3>
<p>Next, you may use baking soda &amp; vinegar (a combination) to remove drain flies from your bathroom. Baking soda and vinegar will combine to form a chemical compound that&rsquo;ll break down all the organic matter in the drain.</p>
<ol>
<li>The steps to use these ingredients will require you to combine - a 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup of baking soda &amp; vinegar respectively.</li>
<li>Pour this mixture down the bathroom drains - you&rsquo;ll notice bubbles and fizzling. Cover the drain using a rag or plug - this will help trap the chemical reaction inside the drain.</li>
<li>Allow the chemicals to sit in the drain for about 15 minutes before pouring hot water to flush down the drain flies - the chemical reaction will also break down the buildup and debris inside the drains.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll require to repeat the drain treatment process using baking soda and vinegar for a few days to fully get rid of the drain flies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-address-moisture-issues-and-leaks">4. Address Moisture Issues and Leaks</h3>
<p>Drain flies love moisture (or they&rsquo;re attracted to moisture) and thus it&rsquo;ll be advisable to address the moisture issues and leaks you have in your bathroom. This will include addressing the leakage issues under the bathtub or sink - and thus removing any standing water.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin with an inspection of the under areas of the bathtub and sink - check for any moisture or leakage as this may attract the drain flies.</li>
<li>Any leakages or moisture that is noticed in these areas must be eliminated immediately as it would as breading grown for drain flies or the liquid may damage different household structures.</li>
<li>Besides, I also recommend that you dry the mats and wet towels that are in the bathroom once you&rsquo;re done using them or clear them from the bathroom (if the items are wet). Don&rsquo;t leave wet fabrics and items on the bathroom floor or even piled in a corner or a basin - drain flies may breed fast in these conditions.
In addition to not leaving wet items around the bathroom, you&rsquo;ll require to drain any standing water in that space - this may be in the shower, bathtub, and sink.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to address the moisture problems such as fixing any leaking pipes - this will hinder the build-up of moisture that would ultimately attract drain flies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-use-bleach-to-remove-drain-flies-in-your-bathroom">5. Use Bleach to Remove Drain Flies in your Bathroom</h3>
<p>You may also clean the bathroom drain using bleach - it&rsquo;ll disinfect and remove the organisms and bacteria that tend to attract the drain flies.
These are the steps I recommend you use to effectively remove the drain flies from your bathroom using bleach.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, measure out a single cup of bleach and pour it into the bathroom or shower drain - ensure it does not pour onto the edges.</li>
<li>Let the bleach mixture sit inside the shower drains for about 20 minutes - this will be enough time for the chemical to get inside the pipes killing the organisms and bacteria.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to use hot to flush out the bleach, debris, and organic matter that&rsquo;s stuck inside those shower drains.
Finally, inspect if the shower drains still have drain flies - if these pests are still present., I suggest you repeat the application process by trying any of the above methods.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, sewer flies, gnats or drain flies can be a nuisance when they attack your kitchens and bathrooms.
Luckily, you can begin by getting rid of any standing water, unlocking the drains, and using chemicals such as black, drain cleaners, vinegar, and baking soda.
Cheers!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to snake a drain? Sometimes you need a quick fix to your slow-moving drain. Or maybe pouring boiling water down the drain doesn&rsquo;t work anymore?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well,snaking your drainwould be an�excellent option for this! But, while at it, other options includeusing a plungeror<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a>.
In the snaking process, you&rsquo;d use the drain snake (also known as a drain auger, electric eel, or a toilet jack) to destroy clogs sitting down the drain.
<strong>See these drain snakes.</strong>

</ul>
<h2 id="1-how-to-unclog-a-drain-with-a-snake"><strong>1. How to Unclog a Drain with a Snake�</strong></h2>
<p>A
drain snake
consists of a long coiled wire with a spiral spring, usually an inch thick with a handle on the other end. This tool`s working mechanism is the opposite of how a plunger operates.
<strong>Tools required:�</strong>
Hand gloves, Drain Auger, Pipe wrench or pliers or a screwdriver, and Towels or rags. The following are steps to be followed when snaking a
sink drain
.
<strong>1. First, you have to select a small drain snake that is handheld</strong>
. This small drain snake has a round casing that houses the wire that is 25-50 feet long.
<strong>2. Assemble the materials and tools required for the task</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Youll need a bucket, a snake, towels/rags, a pipe wrench, and gloves.
<strong>3. Remove the P-trap</strong>
(this is the curved
pipe under the drain
of your sink). Remove it using a pipe wrench.
Some P-traps are usually installed and may require hands to remove them. Place a bucket to collect water and other materials that may be trapped.
**4. Place the drain snake cable into the pipe coming out of the wall **</li>
<li>Drive it in until some resistance is felt.
In a clog case, the opposition will be squishy, but if the resistance is hard, that might turn, pull the wire, and push it again.
<strong>5. Move the handle in a clockwise manner-</strong>
Once the resistance experienced is squishy; turn the handle of the snake so you can break the clog.
Turning it in a clockwise direction leads to some clogs getting dismantled while others are caught at the edge of the snake.
**6. Retrieve the drain snake from the drain gently. **
This is done to prevent the clog from slipping back into the drain and place them into the bucket. Return the P-trap into its position and tighten the fasteners.
<strong>7. Run water down the sink to check whether the clogs have cleared from the drain.</strong>
When the operation is successful, the dislodged clog takes a few seconds to clear, after which water flows easily. If not successful, you can repeat the snaking operation or call a plumber for further assistance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2how-to-snake-a-shower-drain">**2.�**How to Snake a Shower Drain</h2>
<p>Have you ever found yourself in the bathroom standing in a pool of water, trying to push the water using your legs? Embarrassing right?
Soap residues materials like
hair in the bathtub
may be the root cause of that blockage, and before you call a plumber, here are some tips on how to do the unblocking yourself using a snake.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assemble all the required tools for the unblocking</strong>. Youll need a snake drain, a screwdriver, hand gloves, and towels/rags.</li>
<li>**Using a screwdriver, remove the cover of the shower drain to access the drain. **After accessing the drain, place the snake&rsquo;s end into the drain and drop it until you feel some resistance.
Once some resistance of the clog is felt, gently and slowly move the handle of the snake clockwise.
The clockwise movement helps move the clog further in the shower drainpipe while some materials get hooked on the snake.
In case of any increased resistance, that means you might have hit a bend in the pipe; that could also mean that the snake has caught more clogs; pull it back for a few centimeters, then return it as you turn it in the clockwise direction.</li>
<li>**Remove the drain snake-**Once you feel that the cloghas been successfully hooked at the end, retrieve the snake gently and slowly.</li>
<li>This is done to ensure that the clog does not fall back into the pipe. Turn the snake anticlockwise and ensure the pipe does not get damaged, and no clogged materials are left behind.
Once the snake is fully retrieved, you can use your hands to remove the materials from the drain hooked on the snake; better still, you can use a towel/rag to avoid any harm on the hands and dispose of the unclogged materials in the bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Ascertain that drain is unblocked by pouring water down it</strong>- The water will take a few seconds to drain, and afterward, the water will run quickly.</li>
<li>If the water does not drain quickly, then the drainpipe is still blocked. Repeat the snaking process until the clog clears. If the water still doesnt run, you may consider calling a plumber for further assistance.

.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-a-drain-snake-work"><strong>How does a drain snake work?</strong></h2>
<p>A plunger creates a vacuum to attract the material to loosen or break up a blockage; a drain snake is pushed down the drain to the blockage point.</p>
<ul>
<li>There it breaks up the material, causing the blockage, which is hence flushed out.</li>
<li>The snake also assists in acquiring access to the clog, thereby pulling it out. Snakes may be manually or electronically operated.
Snaking involves selecting the right type of auger for the drain in question, and by the use of small skills and efforts, your drain becomes clear.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-drain-clogs"><strong>How to Prevent Drain Clogs</strong></h2>
<p>Here are some few tips to observe that will save you the agony of clogged <a href="/posts/best-drain-cleaner/">drains</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use a screen tub in the bathroom to prevent the infiltration of unwanted materials into the <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> pipe. The screen tub collects the materials the cause clogging, and hence you should be cleaning the screen tub occasionally.</li>
<li>In line with the prevention, you can catch unwanted materials in the bathroom, including hairs and soap residues, using hands before they go down the drain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You can run hot water in the kitchen sink after use to keep oils off the drain, which causes clogging.
Also, waste disposal in a trash bin instead of the sink helps keep waste that causes blockages away from the drains.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s how to unclog a bathtub drain with standing water.�Lately, Ive been getting many calls from clients who have clogged their bathtubs with excessive hair and soap scum.
I also recently covered how to
unclog a shower drain full of hair
.
*The questions definitely come like this: How do I unclog a bathtub drain with standing water? So, let&rsquo;s get started!� *
<em>Summary: To clear the�bathtub blockage and drain the standing water: use a�Wet-Dry Vacuum (with no filter), use a plumbing snake through the�overflow cover in the bathtub,�plunge the bathtub thoroughly, or finally try one of the�best drain cleaners.�</em>

<dl>
<dt>There is a bathtub clogging issue that you can sort using some chemical</dt>
<dt>drain cleaner</dt>
<dt>. However, some homeowners would prefer going to natural solutions as opposed to chemical clears. Some people fear that chemical</dt>
<dt>drain cleaners</dt>
<dt>may damage the plumbing pipes.</dt>
<dt><strong>Requirements</strong></dt>
<dd>(1) Several screwdrivers (either the standard or fill-ups) depending on the type of screws on your Bathtub Drain. (2) A Flashlight (3) Wet-Dry Vacuum (ensure to remove its filter). Others include a damp rag, Sponge, bucket, and rubber gloves.
Put on your rubber gloves to prevent getting infected with germs or bacteria. Ensure you block the bathtub overflow using your hands or some damp rag.
<strong>Extract all the standing water�</strong>
So, to start, youll need to extract all the topical or standing water above the
drain to have a clean/)
working ground. Now, remove the screws, and this is where you can use the flashlight to see the screws.
<strong>Extract dislodged material - Apply Downward pressure.</strong>
Next up, please put on the wet-dry vacuum (after removing its filter) so that you can now extract any hair, soaps, feminine products, and wires stuck in the clogged drain.
Now point the Vacuum Wand Extension to the clogged drain and press it down to prevent any air from getting in. Continue applying downward pressure on your vac tube, and press it completely before quickly pulling it up to extract that hair and other debris. So, as I noted, the drain stoppages are mainly caused by soap scum and hair.
<strong>Test bathtub drain if it&rsquo;s working well.�</strong>
So, keep the vacuum turned on and completely remove the gunk before testing the Bathtub
Drain clearing
rate. Now, turn on the water to test that all is draining as sometimes youd need to use a roller snake if the drain clog was further down at or beyond the t-trap.</dd>

<h3 id="method-2snake-the-bathtub-drain--plumbing-snake">Method 2:�Snake the bathtub Drain  Plumbing Snake**�**</h3>
<p><strong>�</strong>
Now we come to the difficult plumbing snake on your bathtub. However, if you find this process too difficult, then you should hire a plumber to bring their professional services to unclog the standing water.
<strong>Remove overflow cover and snake.�</strong>
Further, remove the overflow cover above the bathtub. Next, feed your plumbing snake through this overflow cover up to the point you experience relatively high push back.
<strong>Rotate snake anti-clockwise�</strong>
Next up, rotate the snake in an anti-clockwise direction to possibly break down the drain clog. Be keen to feel if the resistance has reduced when you push. If so, now pull the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-snakes/">snake out of the drain</a>
. Repeat this process until the clog is cleared. Finally, flush the drain using hot water.</p>
<h3 id="method-3-thoroughlyplunge-the-bathtub">Method 3: Thoroughly<strong>Plunge the Bathtub�</strong></h3>
<p>Next up is a more physically demanding method that will require you to use a plunge on the bathtub drain. But, youll first require ejecting all the stagnant water on the bathtub. Now, use the screwdriver to eject the screws on the overflow cover�thats below your bathtub faucet.
<strong>Remove the coil and overflow cover.�</strong>
Check the coil and eject all the foreign material and hair. Next, eject the overflow cover of your bathtub completely cover it using the damp rag. However, make sure that the overflow exit is airtight before starting the plugging process.
<strong>Plunge the Bathtub</strong>
Now take your
plunger and start the plunging process on your bathtub drain
. However, its important that you allow yourself enough time and dont give up early as the process is very tasking.
The litmus test for success in the plunging process will be when the standing water complexly and quickly drains away from the bathtub. When this is fully done, youll need to flush the bathtub using some hot water. However, if youre unsuccessful in

<strong>Bacteria</strong>
will easily grow in the damp and wet environment in your clogged bathtub, including the drain. Depending on how long the water has been standing in the bathtub, some green scum, in addition to
mildew and mold
, could develop on top of the water. The water is dangerous to your body and skin and being hazardous for your pets or kids.
<strong>Rats and Mice</strong>
may come drinking or washing in the standing water. This is all fine until such rice and mice carry dangerous diseases to your house as they search for water drinking places.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am sitting here in Suzies house, and she is complaining about her slow draining shower. Suzie happens to have long hair, and indeed, the hair gets loose, goes down the shower drain, mixes with oil,
shampoo
, or soap to form a large ball of hair blockage.�Re

<strong>Summary: To unclog the shower drain, physically pull off the hairballs using a wire coat hanger, pour the�best drain cleaners (liquid or Granulated Crystal cleaner), allow 30-60 minutes &amp; finally flash down the drain using hot water. But, it&rsquo;s essential to install your shower drain in the first place properly.�</strong>
The tools to carry are a shower drain cleaner, long screwdrivers, wire coat hanger, and pliers. However, to prevent shower drain clogs from hair using a shower strainer over the drain or install suction cups to block hair strands. Check these drain cleaners.

<h2 id="step-1pull-up-the-hair-using-a-wire-coat-hanger-with-a-hook">Step 1:�Pull up the hair using a wire coat hanger (with a hook)</h2>
<p>First, put on a pair of rubber gloves to help you avoid those nasty
bacteria down the drain
. Then, unscrew and lift the shower strainer to leave the
drain open
. Next, youll need to straighten the wire coat hanger, bend one of its ends into a small hook - or use a
plumbers drain snake
. �Now, push the wire down the shower drain for a few inches before twisting it round to allow it to catch hair clogs.
Pull the wire out and remove the clogged hair placing it into a trash bin. Now run
water down the drain
to check whether its draining quickly. Repeat the process every time going deeper the drain a few more inches while still increasing the wire hook&rsquo;s size.
Keep repeating this
step until youre sure that youve removed
most of the hair. Next, treat the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain using a great enzyme promoting drain cleaner</a>
. However, hold the wire tightly so that it wont get stuck in the gutter.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-pour-down-a-shower-drain-cleaner">Step 2: Pour down a shower drain cleaner.</h2>
<p>First things first, read the usage instructions on the
liquid cleaner
bottle. This will tell you the number of chemicals to use and the time you&rsquo;ll need to allow for action. Also, ensure you wear goggles and gloves.
<strong>Caution</strong>
:
Avoid mixing the chemicals
as this might result in the production of�poisonous gas.
<em><strong>1. For the Liquid Drain cleaner:�</strong></em>
Now hold the bottle with the liquid cleaner and open its top. Pour the cleaner (as instructed) into the open shower drain.�This will require that you squeeze the bottle to get the liquid out. Next, allow the
cleaner about 30-60 minutes
to act on the clogged drain. But remember, this must follow the label instructions.
The next step on this is to flash out the drain using hot water. However, when you notice that the shower
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/">drain does not clear enough</a>
, you might require adding some drain cleaner and giving it time to work.
<em><strong>2. For Granulated Crystal Cleaner:��</strong></em>
If youre using a granulated crystal cleaner, youll need to follow a different process to unclog the shower drain. However, first, just like with the liquid cleaner, read the label instructions.
For the granulated crystal cleaner, clear all the stagnant water in the shower and drain. Then pour about 2-3 tablespoons of the granular crystal cleaner into the shower drain.
Finally, pour about cold water (about two glasses) into the drain. �Then leave the chemical to act for 35-50 minutes, after which youll only need to pour cold water to flash all the hair and debris in the shower drain.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-clogging-of-your-shower-draining">How to prevent clogging of your shower draining</h2>
<p>Definitely, after unclogging your shower drain, youll now require to stop any factors that could take you back to the slow-moving drain mess. Therefore, in this section, Ill dig into how you can keep your drain cleaner longer and thus have an enjoyable shower time.
**1. Replace worn-out shower strainers: **
First things first, you need to keep your protection system up all the time. This comes down to having a reliable and screwed or corked down shower strainer in the shower drain. Further, it would help if you kept the strainers clean from any hairballs or dirt.</p>
<p>Therefore, the strainer prevents large hair from doing down the drain. Thus you can clean most of the large hairballs using your regular brush or broom after each shower.
However, avoiding falling back to chemical drain cleaners so fast as some could, over time, destroy the drainage pipes. Therefore, the alternative is avoiding drain blockage as much as possible instead of using chemicals every time.
**2. Pour hot water once weekly: **
Take some time once a week to do general
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dont-use-vinegar-and-baking-soda-to-clean-clogged-%5Bdrains%5D(/posts/best-drain-cleaner/)/">cleaning to rid the shower drain of any clogged</a>
hair. Besides washing off any hair after every shower session, youll need to pour some hot water and some <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> cleaner down the drain once per week. The hot water will dissolve oils, greats, and soap solids that could combine with hair to form large balls of clogs.
<strong>3. Don&rsquo;t pour grease and oil into the shower drain:�</strong>
Like your kitchen drain, the shower drain will clog whenever you pour down grease and oil into them. As noted above, grease and oil will help the hair cuttings to come together to form large balls. Therefore, if you think any oils are not safe to pour down the
kitchen sink
, theyre not good for the shower drain.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to have some safe</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051T92C2/?tag=p-policy-20">soap dish</a>
since the soap (dropped down the drain) can help form large hair clogs. It goes without saying too that soap that lies around carelessly could cause slippage accidents.</p>

<h2 id="is-drain-cleaner-acid-or-base---blocked-drains">Is drain cleaner acid or base? - Blocked <a href="/posts/best-shower-drain-cleaner/">Drains</a>?</h2>
<p>Drains could become clogged
from various substances, the most common ones being insoluble solids. Examples include hair, tree roots, and leaves, as well as other solid substances.</p>
<p>Other common causes of drain blockage include food particles. These range from oils and fats that mix with grease and then solidify on the inner surfaces of the drain. Other food materials such as flour, fine-grain cereals, tea bags, and even scum from soaps could cause drain blockages.</p>
<p>The last common cause of clogged drains (
how to snake the drain
) is dirt or corrosion of the drainage system. This especially happens in drain systems that are not regularly maintained, or ones made up of cheap, corrosive materials which easily attract mineral buildup.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-of-the-most-common-drain-cleaners">What Are Some Of The Most Common Drain Cleaners?</h2>
<p>As we have already mentioned,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a>
can be divided into either acids or bases. Common acids include Hydrochloric acid [HCL] and Sulphuric acid [H2SO4]. The following are some of the most popular bases that can be used as

<p>Sodium Hypochlorite [NaClO],</p>

<p>Sodium Bicarbonate [NaHCO3],</p>

<p>Sodium Hydroxide [NaOH],</p>

<h2 id="distinguish-an-acidic-and-a-basic-drain-cleaner">Distinguish An Acidic And A Basic Drain Cleaner?</h2>
<p>Before we get to distinguishing between the acidity and the basicity of drain cleaners, it is important to begin easy by understanding what these terms are.</p>
<p>Acid refers to a sour-tasting, corrosive substance that turns litmus paper red. On the other hand, a base refers to any substance that when reacted with an acid, gives water and salt as the only products.</p>
<p>Basic drain cleaners are mostly those whose chemical formulae end in O or OH. When the last letter is an O, it basically means the substance is an oxide.</p>
<p>When used as a drain cleaner, such substances mainly get rid of the blockage through oxidation. On the other hand, the drain cleaners with chemical formulae ending in OH are also known as alkalis. They are bases that easily dissolve in water, and are often recommended for that very trait.</p>
<p>In order to distinguish between an acidic and a basic drain cleaner, you may need to apply your knowledge of the pH scale. pH, which stands for the power of hydrogen refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions in a substance or compound. The pH scale has values ranging from 0 to 14.</p>
<p>On this scale, cleaners with values closer to 0 are considered strong acids with values closer to but not greater than 7 considered weak acids.</p>
<p>On the other hand, strong bases are located on the opposite end of the spectrum, usually assigned values between 12 and 14. Weak bases are located closer to but not less than 7. Compounds with a value of 7 are considered to be neutral, with water being a common example.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-choose-an-ideal-drain-cleaner">How Do You Choose An Ideal Drain Cleaner?</h2>
<p>Whether basic or acidic, there are certain factors you should put into consideration when choosing your ideal cleaner.</p>
<p>Obviously, you need a drain cleaner that is effective at unclogging all manner of drains. The effectiveness of a drain cleaner will depend on the acidity or alkalinity of the substances primarily clogging your drains.</p>
<p>The cleaner should be able to deal with all manner of blockages, from soapy residues to oils and fats, as well as grease and various protein-based deposits.</p>
<p>You might also want to go for a cleaner that, besides unclogging your drains, also kills fungi, bacteria, and other harmful microorganisms that could potentially be hazardous to the drains.</p>
<p>Another point of consideration is the bleaching and deodorant effects of the drain cleaner. A cleaning agent like sodium bicarbonate is lauded for its great deodorant effects while
sodium hypochlorite has bleaching and insect-killing
properties.</p>
<p>You might also want a drain cleaner that is fairly available. Availability has direct effects on the overall cost of such cleaners. However, when looking for high-end drain cleaners, cost should come at the very bottom of your list of factors to consider.</p>
<p>Last but not least, insist on drain cleaners that leave minimal damage to the environment. First, it should be a cleaner that does not cause any allergic reactions to you, your kids, or even your pets.</p>
<p>Sulphuric acid has been shown to cause damage to PVC pipes. That does not only make them less cost-effective, but the damage could see toxic gases released into the environment.</p>
<p>As a result, you could suffer from respiratory or cardiovascular diseases, not to mention the increase in carbon footprint.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whether you go for acidic or basic drain cleaners, remember that your choice of the most ideal one depends on what you are looking for in a cleaner. Thankfully, there are lots of cleaners in the market, each coming with its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>As the user, be sure to read carefully on the ingredients as well as how to use a drain cleaner. Especially pay attention to any caution notes. This will help avoid any accidents like corrosion. And at the very least, always have protective gear when using any drain cleaner.</p>

      <description>Finding a decent</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a decent
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaner</a>
is difficult. Most options on the market are far too expensive. And those that you can afford are often limited in the functions they can perform.
So you have to purchase multiple types and brands of drain cleaners to sufficiently cater to your homes entire plumbing system.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-thethrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner">+What is the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/THRIFT-T-600-Alkaline-Granular-Cleaner/dp/B00E1N09JO?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=2b4aec92d6fd01239eb8ccd0c93edf67&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner</a>?</h2>
<p>Thrift T-600 is an acid-free drain cleaner. In other words, it can eliminate the organic matter that clogs your <a href="/posts/best-drain-cleaner/">drains</a> without using acidic components.
The Thrift T-600 cleaner stands out because it provides four
cleaning solutions
where other <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">drain</a> cleaners only cater to one or two disparate issues.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-need-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner">+Why You Need the Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner?</h2>
<p>Clogging is unavoidable. Human activity is designed to produce the sort of waste that debilitates a plumbing system&rsquo;s functions. You can neither prevent nor guard against clogging.
Every time you shower, you shed hair. This is particularly problematic if you live in a home with multiple women. But even if the hair wasnt a problem, any bath you take will probably involve soap, shampoo, or some detergent.</p>
<p>Soap scum and bath oils are common causes of clogging. The same can be said for the grease that pours down the drain of your kitchen sink every time you wash your plates after a scrumptious dinner.
Over time, all that grease and soap scum and hair and bath oils will accumulate to create blockages. The symptoms are difficult to miss. You will notice that the water in your
sink drains
slower than usual and that the drain even spits back food particles every once in a while.
If you allow the situation to deteriorate without taking action, your drains will stop working altogether.
Now, people are quick to reach out to plumbers who often waste no time in opening all the pipes and deploying their drain snakes whenever this happens.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/">Drain cleaners</a>
like the Thrift T-600 generally make all that chaos unnecessary. If you hate the mess that the unclogging process attracts, you can pour a drain cleaner down your pipes and sewers and then sit back and wait for it to do all the work.
It sounds like a lazy approach to the problem, but it works. You dont really need any technical plumbing knowledge. Anyone can deploy the Thrift T-600 Drain cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner-do">+What Does the Thrift T-600 Alkaline Based Drain Cleaner Do?</h2>
<p>The Thrift T-600 cleaner comes in a 6-pound bottle filled with dry, odorless crystals. To deploy the cleaner, pour the crystals down the drain and then pour hot water.
The hot water will activate the crystals, and the crystals will liquefy all the hair and the grease clogging your drains.
It is that simple. There are no unique drain snakes required, no plumbers that you need to hire to dismantle and re-configure your pipes.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-the-thrift-t-600-drain-cleaner-so-special">+What Makes the Thrift T-600 Drain Cleaner so Special?</h2>
<h3 id="-pros">+ Pros</h3>
<p>1). You can find plenty of drain cleaners on the market that works on either sewer lines, grease traps, septic systems, or drains. But this product applies to all four areas. Drain cleaners are rarely that multi-functional.
2). The cleaner works so quickly. Expect results in as little as sixty seconds. This is as opposed to other products that require several hours.
3). Despite its efficacy as a drain cleaner that eats hair and grease, the Thrift T-600 will only affect organic matter. It wont eat acrylic, fiberglass, or any other delicate components. As such, you can use it on kitchen and bathroom surfaces without worry.
4). The drain cleaner is not disruptive. Whereas many other drain cleaners produce dangerous fumes, this one doesnt even have much odor. So you can use it in hospitals, schools and the like without causing distress.
5). The product is straightforward to use. Just pour the crystals and then add hot water.
6). The crystal format makes the drain cleaner safer to use.</p>
<h3 id="-cons">+ Cons</h3>
<p>1). The drain cleaner is quite expensive.
2). Even though it is supposed to be less disruptive, the drain cleaner still produces toxic vapors when it is in use. If you come too close to the drain, the vapor will irritate your eyes and nose.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-thrift-t-600-alkaline-based-drain-cleaner-work-on-toilets">+Does, the Thrift T-600 Alkaline, Based Drain Cleaner Work on Toilets?</h2>
<p>This product works so well that it is easy to see why some people might be tempted to use it in their toilet. But the drain cleaner only activates when hot water is applied.
So even if you got the crystals in place, you have no way of running hot water over them in a toilet. More importantly, even the packaging warns you against using the drain cleaner on toilet bowls and garbage disposals.
That being said, if you have the plumbing experience and can afford to pull the toilet up, the Thrift T-600 could work for you.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">+Verdict</h2>
<p>Drain Cleaners might be a dime a dozen today, but it is easy to see why this one draws so much attention.
You wont find that many drain cleaners on the market that come in crystal format, only require hot water to activate, and can liquefy hair and grease in 60 seconds without ruining your polished brass, porcelain, and chrome trim, plastic, or even the metal pipes.</p>
