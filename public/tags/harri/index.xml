<h2 id="2-my-detailed-review">#2: My Detailed Review</h2>
<h3 id="1non-staining-formula">1.Non-staining Formula</h3>
<p>Harris Bed Bug Killer won&rsquo;t stain your clothes, fabrics, or linen. The spray formula won&rsquo;t damage furniture finished despite leaving a residue that&rsquo;ll be active for long.
The long residue effect (7 to 10 days) means that the formula will continue
killing bed bugs
over time and won&rsquo;t require frequent re-application after the first day.</p>
<h3 id="2-suitable-for-indoor-and-outdoor-spraying">2. Suitable for Indoor and Outdoor Spraying</h3>
<p>This product will
kill bed bugs
excellently for both your outdoor and indoor spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would say that you&rsquo;ll require to combine thisspray with bed bugbaits.
However,�Harris
Bed Bug Killer is more effective
in controlling bed bugs in indoor spaces where roaches tend to create their safe havens.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-liquid-spray-formula">3. Liquid Spray formula</h3>
<p>Being a spray formula, this product will be suitable to spray places that
bed bugs are hiding
or have created a bug nest.</p>
<ul>
<li>I found the nozzle to be highly convenient in distributing the liquid.</li>
<li>Luckily, the liquid spray tends to dry out just about 5 minutes after the application.
Therefore, it&rsquo;s great to apply to your bedding, mattresses, and furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-odorless-formula-or-mild-smell">4. Odorless formula (or mild smell)</h3>
<p>In addition to being effective
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dead-bed-bugs/">against bed bugs</a>
, this product is odorless and non-irritating to both human beings and your pets.
However, some customers note that they experience some mild (though non-irritating) smell, which would disapprove of the &ldquo;odorless&rdquo; claim.</p>
<h2 id="3-my-experience">#3: My Experience:</h2>
<h3 id="1-deltamethrin-irritates-the-skin">1. Deltamethrin irritates the skin</h3>
<p>Harris Bed Bug Killer contains the Deltamethrin that tends to irritate the human skin, particularly the eyes, and thus you must take care when spraying or use goggles.
However, the Deltamethrin in this product is less toxic if minimal amounts are eaten or ingested, and that person would tend to vomit a lot to remove the poison.</p>
<h3 id="1-bed-bugs-are-resistant-todeltamethrin">1. Bed bugs are resistant to�Deltamethrin</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common fact that current bed bugs are continually developing resistance against Deltamethrin. Therefore, at the usual dosage, the bed bugs will still endure.
Recent
<a href="https://www.npmapestworld.org/default/assets/File/newsroom/magazine/2015/nov-dec_2015.pdf">research</a>
shows that over 85 percent of the cockroaches don&rsquo;t die from exposing them to Deltamethrin-containing pesticides while also ranking bed bugs as the worst pests.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ve reviewed Harris Boric Acid powder as an effective roach killer. Harris Boric Acid is a historic roach control method, at least the composition&rsquo;s chemical side.
In addition to killing roaches, the boric acid powder will also exterminate other bugs such as silverfish, palmetto bugs, and water bugs.
Boric Acid is highly effective in killing roaches yet also budget-friendly and thus topping the
best roach killers
available today.

<h2 id="special-lure-attractant">Special lure/ Attractant</h2>
<p>Harris
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">boric acid contains a unique lure thatll attract the roaches</a>
to the poison and trick it into feeding o its death. Further, the <a href="/posts/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">cockroaches</a> tend to carry the boric acid back to their nests, causing the secondary
kill effect on the whole roach
colony.
The included straw has a tube-like design thatll allow the homeowner to place the
roach killing
powders to the deepest of the cracks and crevices.�But, being a chemical, boric acid must not be ingested by humans, pets, and livestock as it can be poisonous to them.</p>
<h2 id="condensed-milk-mixture"><strong>Condensed milk mixture�</strong></h2>
<p>It would help if you mixed the boric acid roach killer with condensed milk, creating a thick paste thats highly attractive to top efficiency roaches. This will help confuse some roaches and bugs that will readily avoid eating some
roach baits
with a specific smell, color, or shape.
This roach powder offers high-efficiency rates where you can see dead roaches two days after being applied in the right locations.</p>
<h2 id="harris-boric-acid-works">Harris Boric Acid works</h2>
<p>Youll find this boric acid very simple to use in
killing roaches
and other bugs. On application, youll need to pour a portion of the roach powders into the designated surface. The killers lure will attract the bugs and hence allow the chemical to kill them on contact.
The cockroaches will be dead in the next 48 hours after getting into contact with the boric acid. As noted above, the chemical has a long residue effect lasting even for five days.
Youll need to treat the areas that are difficult to reach, such as under the sofa set, on countertops, in cupboards, and under the refrigerators. Harris Boric Acid is EPA registered, which means its suitable and safe for home use.</p>
<h2 id="is-boric-acid-roach-killer-safe-for-humans--pets">Is Boric Acid roach killer Safe for Humans &amp; Pets?</h2>
<p>Despite that this roach killer is highly toxic to roaches and other insects such as
fleas
and
bed bugs
, the products have low-toxicity levels that would not poison humans and pets (either cats or dogs).
Therefore,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pet-safe-roach-killer/">roach acid will be safe around pets</a>
and humans if it&rsquo;s in low dosages. Further, boric acid causes no carcinogenic impacts on the roaches. However, the boric acid powder must not be used near breastfeeding or nursing women.
Ingesting high amounts of the roach acid powders can cause a coma, seizures, tremors, skin rashes, and diarrhea - and thus, care is paramount. Further, the roach
killing powder
may trigger a burning or irritating feeling on your skin and eyes.
Therefore, when making the boric acid application, you&rsquo;ll need to wear protective goggles and gloves to safeguard and block your eyes, mouth, and nose. However, exposure to low levels of boric acid may cause hives, rashes, burning sensation on your nasal passages, and dry throat.</p>
<h2 id="compareborax-vsboric-acid"><strong>Compare�Borax vs.�Boric Acid�</strong></h2>
<p>First things first, both borax and boric acid are extracted from the mineral boron. Further, you can both of these chemicals to kill roaches and other insects.
But borax is used in toothpaste, laundry detergent, or
dish soap
and kills mildew and molds as a suitable fungicide.
Therefore, borax incorporated in the regular use products comes in low quantities and will pose minimal risk to both pets and human beings. However, you must follow the product label instructions before using this boric acid powder to kill insects such as roaches.</p>
