      <title>Best Way to Apply Thermal Paste to Cpu</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/best-way-to-apply-thermal-paste-to-cpu/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/best-way-to-apply-thermal-paste-to-cpu/</guid>
      <description>The right choice of thermal paste is critical for optimal CPU temperatures.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The right choice of thermal paste is critical for optimal CPU temperatures.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, the thermal paste application leads to different outcomes, which could include damage to your CPU and motherboard.</li>
<li>Therefore, in this article, I discuss the best way to apply thermal paste to the CPU.
Youll need to apply the Thermal Interface Material (thermal paste) either when upgrading your CPU or building a new PC.
But why so? The thermal paste helps in heat dissipation from the PC heat sink and the CPU die. I would recommend the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0087X728K/?tag=p-policy-20">Arctic Silver 5 AS5-3.5G Thermal Paste</a>
on Amazon and I will be using it in this case study.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, I recently upgraded the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-motherboard-i5-6600k-cpu/">motherboard for my i5 6600k CPU</a>
and thus I expect optimal gaming experience: Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, Observer, and Call of Duty: WWII.</p>
<p>Before conducting extensive research and test on thermal paste application, maybe like you, I only overhead of Rice, X, Pea, Straight-line application methods. This left me confused with the many opinions out there.
<strong>In summary:�</strong>
**However, if you need a straight answer: The best method to apply the thermal paste on your gaming CPU is the pea-sized dot&rsquo; technique. **
**In this method, you will apply a pea-sized - not too much - amount of the thermal compound in the middle of the CPUs surface and screw back the heat sink on top of it. **
**Therefore, the thermal paste will spread naturally in a round or oval shape evenly over the CPU cores. Manually spreading would lead to the formation of air bubbles. **</p>
<h2 id="how-important-is-thermal-paste-to-your-cpu">How important is thermal paste to your CPU?</h2>
<p>So, do you really need the grey weird-smelling paste on your CPU? Why bother using the paste when the heatsinks already look very impressive?</p>
<p>Well, heres why: most heat sinks will not sit flat on the CPU since they could be concave or convex and thus leave some space where the processor and the heat sink will not have adequate contact.</p>
<p>Also, despite that the heat sink and the CPU would be lying flat on each other, their surfaces could be rough at the microscopic level and thus will not sit totally flat on each other, which would leave air pockets between the two surfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, the air is a poor conductor of heat and thus the air gaps will not allow the CPU and the heat sink to touch more directly.
The thermal material is made from special conductive materials such as almost 100% pure micronized silver and Thermal conductance greater than 350 000W/m2, which conduct heat better up to the heatsink.
<em>So, here is a very common question related to thermal paste: Can you use toothpaste as your thermal paste aiming to save money?</em>
NO!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thermal paste, unlike toothpaste, is a heat-conducting material that contains some metals  or probably powdered silver in the expensive paste brands.</p>
<p>However, do not worry since thermal paste like Arctic Silver 5 has higher-quality compounds that allow it to be non-conductive despite using metal but youll also need to keep it away from the metal contacts.</p>
<p>High-quality ceramics can help in cooling and are cheaper, which makes them good for sub-zero cooling.</p>
<p>However, you can also use silicone thermal pads that will sit fully between the CPU and the heat sink.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-thermal-paste-should-you-apply">How much thermal paste should you apply?</h2>
<p>Is there anything like too little or too much thermal paste application?</p>
<p>Yes, applying too uneven or little thermal might make some of your CPU cores run hotter compared to the rest.
**But; **
If you apply uneven or too much thermal paste, you might see some gas bubbles in the space separating the heat sink and the CPU.
<strong>Finally, onto our main discussion: Thermal Paste Application</strong></p>
<h2 id="best-way-to-apply-thermal-paste-to-the-cpu">Best way to apply thermal paste to the CPU</h2>
<p>First things first:</p>
<p>You should know that the thermal compound application method can vary reliant on the kind of heat sink you are using.</p>
<p>For example, the heat sink that is heat pipe-based could require a different application method of the thermal paste compared to the heat sink that utilizes the direct plate-based method.</p>
<p>However, check the heat sink guide or manual since the vendors always test the setup and determine the method that achieves the optimum temperature.</p>
<p>Despite that you could be tempted to purchase some better performing thermal paste, you should know that various pastes have different viscosities, compositions, and densities, factors that will affect how it is distributed.</p>
<h3 id="application-process"><strong>Application process:</strong></h3>
<p>The thermal compound will come in a syringe, which will be very suitable for the paste application process.</p>
<p>Clean up the processor top to remove any dirt.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will apply paste that is pea-sized or the size of capacitors on your motherboard.</li>
<li>However, ensure that you apply reasonable paste that will spread well on the CPU and heat sink to avoid direct contact with the metal parts.
The rule of thumb is that is less thermal past is always better since too much of it would hinder the thermal cooling capability of the heat sink.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now: Check the video</p>

<p>Your Raspberry Pi will not come with a case unless you go for the bundled offer. However, to protect your Raspberry Pi, it is vital that you install a case for your Raspberry Pi.
Factors to consider while selecting the Raspberry Pi case are design, easy access for your board, port access, and durability.
Please choose a case that Raspberry Pi that has a heat sink. Notably, I will select the Raspberry Pi case that will not require screws and screwdriver to safeguard.</p>
<h3 id="2-install-sd-card-image-for-retropie">2. Install SD-card image for RetroPie</h3>
<p>RetroPie is a Raspberry Pi software bundle, combining projects such as

, which is Raspbian created by Linux.
Notably, you&rsquo;ll find it easy to start with RetroPie through an installation of the SD image that is a suitable system created over the Raspbian OS.
RetroPie combines suite utilities and tools to make it easy to run ROMs for different old-fashioned gaming stages.�However, your Raspberry Pi will not have its internal hard drive, and thus you&rsquo;ll need to employ a microSD card to store the RetroPie files and operating system.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll require to
<a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">download</a>
the appropriate version of the SD-Card Image. However, note that you&rsquo;ll find two kinds of SD-Card Image:</p>

, particularly SDXC (64GB and above), to fat32 is usually the first step while using the tiny computing system for
<strong>Pi 3 projects</strong>
. Back up all the important data or files on your computer or on an external device.</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, I was using DISKPART but now I have found better ways. But under what circumstances would you need to <a href="/posts/format-sd-card-to-fat32/">format</a> the Raspberry Pi SD card?
(1) To increase storage capacity because of pre-partition (2) To remove a preloaded Operating System and install another one (3) To clean any corrupt software and files from the card.

<h3 id="1-how-to-format-sd-card-fat32-in-windows-10">1. How to Format SD card FAT32 in Windows 10</h3>
<p>First, maybe you already know that Windows with an inbuilt format utility. However, this format utility will not format any FAT32 (USB drive or SD card), which is usually bigger than 32GB.
Notably, if you need to format the FAT32 partition and right-click the SD card in windows on file system format, it only shows just the exFAT and NTFS options.</p>
<p>Maybe you love using the command line top covert the 32GB card to FAT32. But this is not possible for anything larger than 32Gb. It&rsquo;ll get to 90% and say it failed.
Therefore, for our formatting purpose today, well not be going to the windows inbuilt format utility.
<strong>Step 1:</strong>
Purchase a compatible Pi 3 SD card, specifically a Micro SD card.
Further, you may purchase a Raspberry Pi 3 starter kit, which comes with an SD card. Therefore, if the SD card size is larger than 32 GB continue to step 2 where we convert it to FAT32.
<strong>Step 2:</strong>
Format the SDXC Card (64 GB or larger) for Pi 3.
Note that SDFormatter will not format your SD card whose capacity is bigger than 32GB. Therefore, youll need to download other software such as the
<a href="http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm">fat32format</a>
. Other options of the FAT32 Format tool, but not so easy to use, are
<a href="http://www.easeus.com/partition-manager/epm-free.html">EaseUS Partition</a>
or�the
<a href="http://www.minitool.com/partition-manager/partition-wizard-home.html">MiniTool Partition Wizard</a>
.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the FAT32 Format tool (guiformat.exe download) by ridgecrop consultants. Run the tool on your computer. Note, you&rsquo;ll not need to install anything!</li>
<li>Note that the GUI version of your downloaded FAT32 Format tool will be akin to the windows built-in format tool.</li>
<li>Run the downloaded formatter tool while the &ldquo;FORMAT SIZE ADJUSTMENT&rdquo; is adjusted to be &ldquo;ON&rdquo;, to delete all the micro-SD card partitions.</li>
<li>Then, now you can pick the drive you wish to format (the letter for the SDXC Card) as shown on This PC and run the guiformat.exe tool (FAT32 Format). Ensure all other options are at the default and hit &ldquo;Start&rdquo;.</li>
<li>However, FAT32 Format will not conduct disk integrity checks for your SDXC Card after formatting.</li>
<li>Therefore, after formatting the SD card, youll need to run this command*&ldquo;chkdsk /R x:&rdquo; in this case, youll replace the letter *&ldquo;x:&rdquo; with the name of the SD card drive. Or you can use the<a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/">SD Formatter</a>to make sure the partitions are totally deleted. Take some break, this process could take time to finish!</li>
<li>After you are done, you can now go ahead to thePi 3 Operating System Installation.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-how-to-format-sd-card-to-fat32-on-mac"><strong>2. How</strong>** to format SD card to fat32 on mac**</h3>
<p>Unlike Windows, Mac OS X has inbuilt formatting tools to enable you to format your micro-SD / SD card to FAT32.
However, note that the SD card partition could be named MS-DOS or FAT.
So, who do you format the SD card to FAT32?
<em>Step by Step:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the SD card or the SD card adapter holding the SD card to the Mac computer</li>
<li>Click and open the Disk Utility.</li>
<li>Select the SD card storage on the left panel.</li>
<li>Click and alter it to the erase tab.</li>
<li>Go to the Volume Format and hit the erase option</li>
<li>Confirm the action by hitting Erase</li>
<li>After the formatting is completed, shut your Disk Utility.Read Also:Recliners for Sleeping</li>

<h3 id="3-how-to-format-128gb-sd-card-fat32">3. How to Format 128GB SD card FAT32</h3>
<p>Equally, like the other SD cards with the exFAT32 partition format (any with a capacity over 32GB) the
<strong>128GB</strong>
SD card will not be formatted by the Disk Management and Diskpart utility in windows.
Therefore, youll only get errors such as these:</p>
<ol>
<li>For Command Prompt  volume is too large for FAT32</li>
<li>For Disk Management  Windows is unable to complete drive format
Therefore, youll also need to use another software to format the 128GB SD card.
For Windows 10 and other Windows, you can download the
<a href="http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm">Formatting Tool</a>
for the effective formatting of the 128GB SD card.
Step By Step:
Caution: As I have noted above, youll need to back up all the important files and data that are in the 128GB SD card you want to format.</li>
<li>Insert the 128GB SD card to the PC using the card reader (for the micro-SD card only).</li>
<li>Download, install and start the<a href="http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm">Formatting Tool</a></li>
<li>Check the Formatting Tools main windows and notice the SD card showing behind your current hard drive.</li>
<li>Click on the SD card (Right-click) and hit the format partition button</li>
<li>Check the appearing window and select the FAT32 partition and hit ok</li>
<li>Click Apply to format.</li>

<p>Despite that Nintendo Switch is, by default, compatible with MicroSDHC cards, an additional update allowed it to support the MicroSDXC cards.
So, what are the differences being the SD-XC vs SD-HC Micro cards? I highly regard the SanDisk SD card technology, and I discovered an
article discussing SD-XC vs SD-HC cards
.
The SD-HC card will hold a maximum of 32GB while the SDXC cards can extend to about 256GB. With a minor update, your Nintendo Switch will support the SD-XC cards.
Therefore, if you will be downloading a massive amount of Bytes in form of programs, games, files, and data such as Virtual Console and eShop, then you might need to purchase the SD-XC micro-cards.</p>

<li>For example, a 64GB micro card will be enough if you rarely buy Virtual Console titles and eShop.</li>
<li>However, for regular downloading of Virtual Console titles and eShop, you might need to go for the 128GB card. For Nintendo Switch, ensure that the SD card is at least class 10 speed graded.</li>
<li>However, the UHS (1, 2, or 3) class grade will also work on Switch but the class will automatically change to class 10 if your device is not UHS class compatible.

<h3 id="what-type-of-memory-card-does-yournintendo-switch-use">What type of memory card does your�Nintendo switch use?</h3>
<p>First, before thinking of installing the microSD card to your Nintendo Switch, you must ask a very important question: Do I go for an SD card or a microSD card?
Well, it is critical to ensure that the microSD cards are compatible with your Switch.
Your Nintendo switch will only support a maximum of 2GB microSD cards, 4GB-32GB microSDHC cards, and 64GB or more capacity for the microSDXC cards. However, check the compatible Nintendo Switch SD cards you can pick.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-maximum-nintendo-switch-internal-storage">What is the maximum Nintendo Switch Internal Storage?</h3>
<p>Your Nintendo Switch will only come with 32 GB as its internal storage capacity.
However, some of the above internal storage space is kept for critical system functionality.
Despite that Nintendo Switch games are not so large, it is believed that practically the internal storage space is about 25 GB.
Adding some storage space through the MicroSD Card can help you store more digitally downloaded games.
Some of the game downloads (and their capacity) include:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/disgaea-5-complete-switch">Disgaea 5 - 5.92 GB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - 7 GB</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="is-a-micro-sd-card-important">Is a Micro SD Card important?</h3>
<p>Simply stated, all of you switch fans will require the extra external storage for the switch to store the extra games.
Therefore, if you need to play extra third party games on the switch, you will definitely need to have a large Micro SD card.
The Switch games that are digital download will take up more space and thus will not fit in the internal storage of the switch.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-the-storage-space-runs-out">What if the storage space runs out?</h3>
<p>Despite that you could have added a microSD card to your Nintendo Switch, you might not have achieved an adequate performance boost.
In such a case, you are left with key options:
Option A: Delete all the games that you are done with or you are unlikely to use it in the coming day. However, the good part is that you can go back online and download the same games when you require them and have adequate space.
Option B: The other great option is to move your switch games to another external storage or other microSD cards for convenience.
In this article, I have covered how you can install and remove the microSD card from the Nintendo Switch console.
If you need extra storage space for the exciting digitally download games, youll need to buy additional storage space.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, Ill outline the�best Nintendo switch sd card that you can purchase today. Further, we have categorized the SD cards according to their storage capacity: 64GB, 128GB, and 200GB.

<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>On-board LAN was a critical aspect of the Raspberry Pi Model 3 that required a significant overhaul.
The model 3 B+ now has the 10/100/1000 Gigabit LAN controller as opposed to just the 10/100 controller. Therefore, the in-build port will not be capped at 100 Mbps (practically ~93 Mbps). Model 3 B+ will thus give you more bandwidth, and you won&rsquo;t need gigabyte networking like before.
Due to the improved Raspbian OS and the Pi 3 B+&rsquo;s better power, the initial impression with the B+ is excellent.
The test results showed an improvement in the processing power, such as fast USB data transfer and better benchmarks performance.
Its CPU has a heat spreader at its top, and thus the processor won&rsquo;t throttle its performance. However, the wireless and wired benchmark test showed no significant difference from the previous Pi 3 that has inferior features.</p>
<h3 id="exposed-circuits-design"><strong>Exposed Circuits design</strong></h3>
<p>My first impression of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ is an excellent-looking circuit board that measures 0.63<em>3.5</em>2.2 in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, all the components are visible: 40-pin GPIO input/output connector and the 1.4GHz ARM processor.
Also, the board includes a micro-SD slot, 3.5mm audio output, HDMI, Ethernet, four USB 2.0, and a micro-USB connector.

<strong>Amazing Speed Boost</strong>
Just like Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, the all-new Model B+ has a 64-bit processor and in-built wireless connectivity.</li>
<li>Despite not having not many additional features, the Model B+ has some unique tasks that will be completed much more comfortably.</li>
<li>For example, with the processor upgrade that allows faster speeds, it&rsquo;ll be easier to complete tasks that require enormous computing power, such as creating a home-theatre PC.
Further, despite having the same 1GB memory, the Model B+ comes with a 200MHz faster CPU.
On the negative side, however, Pi 3 Model B+ could not effectively play the YouTube 1080p video. However, you may install VLC through different apps or command lines to play SDcard-loaded HD video.
PROS</li>
<li>Superior networking and faster processor</li>
<li>Highly customizable and easy to install
CONS</li>
<li>Ethernet port won&rsquo;t attain the 1Gbps top speed described.
I used benchmarks from the browser to assess the significance of the 200MHz CPU speed increase.</li>
<li>First, I used the JavaScript Sunspider 1.0.2, and it took 1.92 seconds. Notably, the above is double the speed of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B that takes 2.77 secs.

<h3 id="requires-some-add-ons"><strong>Requires some Add-Ons</strong></h3>
<p>If you are utilizing the Raspberry Pi in complex projects, you must add components such as a Pi case, fans, and heat sinks.</p>
<ul>
<li>To create an excellent first computer, you&rsquo;ll need a case that has top ports&rsquo; cut-outs, and that will be easy to dismantle whenever required.</li>
<li>Also, you can include a PoE hat adapter to power up the Raspberry Pi through the Ethernet cable-supplied power, mainly when used with motion detectors.
Model B+&rsquo;s Ethernet port will allow the gigabit transfer speeds with speeds going up to 315Mbps. Your WiFi radio will do superior in Model B+&rsquo;s 5GHz band.</li>
