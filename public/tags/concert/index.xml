      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert">Live concerts</a>
have diverse lighting conditions with fast-paced events &amp; excessive flickering or lighting. Thus, you&rsquo;ll require a camera that is very portable, and that offers high power in addition to ISO sensitivity.</p>
<p>Summary: To take exceptional pictures or shoot great videos in concerts, use either
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009B0MZ8U/?tag=p-policy-20">Canon EOS 6D DSLR</a>
or
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I1CPA0O/?tag=p-policy-20">Nikon D5300 24.2 DSLR</a>
as the best camera for concerts.
Otherwise, if you&rsquo;re low on the budget it&rsquo;s allowable to take your mobile phone (even with the basic built-in camera and some
concert earplugs
) to concerts and live shows.</p>

.
Further, for video, this Canon EOS 6D will show 1080p HD quality videos. Hence, the full-frame (bigger sensor) &amp; continuous shooting features are the key reasons why the Canon EOS 6D.
It borrows heavily from the Canon EOS 60D. Full frame, in this case, means that the sensor is as big as a 35-millimeter film  in comparison to the APS-C sensors that are in most consumer DSLRs.</p>
<h3 id="2-canon-eos-6d-202-mp-digital-slr-camera---2-pick">2. Canon EOS 6D 20.2 MP Digital SLR <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009B0MZ8U/?tag=p-policy-20">Camera - #2 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Canon EOS 6D is a top full-frame (but affordable) digital SLR concert camera  topping on the Best Camera for Concerts. Its a traditional removable lens camera.</p>
<p>Therefore, the bigger sensor will collect more light and shoot better images. It has a DIGIC 5+ image processor and 20.2MP CMOS sensor (full-frame), which makes me classify it as a great kit for live shoes and on-the-go photo shooting and filming. Also, it has manual controls that will enhance a smoother video recording in addition to a fast speed in capturing images.
The wi-fi capability will enable you to control the camera from an Android or Ios phones. With the app launched you can control the aperture, ISO, and you can even adjust the exposure compensation. Further, on the screen, you have a screen confirmation box that you can move for focus and finally press the shutter button.
Interestingly, this camera will shoot at 4.5 frames/ sec and give you high-quality images  which will work great for continuous shooting on your live shows or concerts.

processor, which means a higher resolution to give you excellent shots in live shows or concerts.</p>
<p>Hence, when you take images, you can easily blow them up or make them big or even crop. Its possible to print even on 11 by 16 while still achieving top clarity. With its optical viewfinder, you can create pictures that are centered or even off-centered.</p>
<p>When hand-shoot the concert events, this Nikon D5300 gives a high continuous framerate (5 frames per second). Also, it has a highly accurate autofocus system (specifically a 39 point autofocus system) that effectively tracks the subject  in addition to being smoother and quieter.
Its lens can shoot anything from the landscape, close up leaves, and anything in between. On video filming, the Nikon D5300 has pixels that allow top fluidity and smoothness if you just switch on the live view.

<p>Pocket size cameras (digital camera kind) such as Canon IXUS 185 or Sony Cyber-shot WX220 taking decent photos and video (some even 4K).
They are small and offer great portability. But, they wont match the quality offered by mirror-less camera or DSLRs. Check these

<h3 id="2-mirrorless-cameras"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera">2. Mirrorless cameras</a></h3>
<p>Mirrorless cameras (compact system cameras (CSCs)), unlike the DSLRs, come with no mirror (but have and interchangeable lenses).
But, you&rsquo;ll need a higher budget compared to DSLRs. They have faster processing and superior autofocus with the electronic optical viewfinders - with a compact &amp; sleek design.</p>
<h3 id="3-dslr-digital-single-lens-reflex-cameras"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera">3. DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) Cameras</a></h3>
<p>DSLR (such as Canon EOS Rebel T7i/800D or Nikon D5600) blend the digital imaging sensor and single-lens reflex devices (with reflex design scheme) &amp; optics. Check the

<p>But high-fidelity earplugs will block excessive noise while allowing music with fit tonal quality to get to your ear.
Summary: I recommend either the

plugs or
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076VTXWBP/?tag=p-policy-20">EarPeace HD</a>

The 2 models (

) are great for high-level sound, nightclub, musical instrument (amps), or band songs.</p>

<p>This Eargasm High-Fidelity takes the top spot for the best earplugs for concerts. You no longer have to sacrifice getting the great sound as you use low-quality earbuds for ear protection  just get the Eargasm high-fidelity earplugs.</p>

Itll allow you to turn down the volume of various ambient sounds - to safe and comfortable levels. Interestingly, itll do nose-reduction to highs even of 21 decibels.
Despite not having distinguishable filters, these earplugs will produce amazing sounds and music from either a live performance or band.
Explicit Blocking compared to Filtering
As noted above, great earplugs must be more compared to ordinary foam earplugs or an earmuff (that block noises and sounds only through mechanical means)  which fits these Eargasms earplugs are not.
Eargasms earplugs will filter noise and allow only the appropriate sound to reach your ear canal. For band members and other musicians, the noise filtering features (as opposed to just mechanical sound blocking) can promote good performances.

<p>Attention concerts goers, musicians, or people in areas with loud music  forget your regular earplugs that tend to muffle sound and wont plug into your ear.
Its time for serious audio-engineering - get the Earasers Hi-Fi earplugs to deliver adequate mid-range but prevent shrill noises.</p>

It has a Smart Seal and soft silicone design that will take the sharpie of the ear canal to give your comfortable listening experience even in concerts and live shows.
Earasers Hi-Fi earplug will simply attenuate the sound, using Smart Seal, at the lower level and hence it remains clear with no distortion or muffling.
Its acoustic filter uniformly reduces the noise levels over the sound spectrum (at last the audible range). Further, they are easy to fit and will give you a top comfort.

<p>When youre going for your concerts, earplugs offer you protection against the deafening sounds and noises that could cause hearing loss.
Notably, youll be exposed to about 100 - 120-dB of sound in the live music concerts  sound levels that might cause instant hearing loss. Therefore, its wise to earplugs for health reasons.</p>
<p>Flanged Earplugs -
These flanged earplugs (high-fidelity earplugs) come with rims or lips in their cone shape to help build a strong sound seal in your ears canal.
However, these earplugs tend to be uncomfortable to wear for an extended time. Otherwise, if you insert them well to your ear, you can achieve an excellent sound seal.
Foam Earplugs -
This type of earplug is budget-friendly and is tend to fit ears universally.
Compared to the flange type, youll need to compress and insert these foam type earplugs to your ear canal to achieve top-level decibel reduction. But, you might find them less effective, comfortable, or poorly fitting compared to the custom or flange earplugs.</p>
