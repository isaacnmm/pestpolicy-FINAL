As a precaution, keep the sprayed areas and the spray itself away from the reach of children and pets.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective for roaches and other insects</li>
<li>Odourless and leaves no stains</li>
<li>Provides four-months residual effects</li>

<p>Harris roach powder is one of the best boric acid powders used for eradicating roaches.</p>
<p>Packed in 16 oz. Bottles, this bait possesses an irresistible allure that attracts roaches from all corners of the house. Its also an ideal solution to most of the other household pests.
The main ingredient in this best roach powder is boric acid, a substance that kills roaches within 72 hours of application. Plus, it has a residual effect of up to several weeks. This is an advantage because it will kill roaches that hatch even after you have sprayed.
Unlike other roach powders in the market, Harris boric acid roach bait powder is easy to apply. It has a long straw that allows you to apply the powder into crevices that are otherwise unreachable with your hands. Thus, you will be sure to cover all those small openings, which are often the favorite hideouts for these creatures.
The powder has the potential to attract roaches with its food-grade ingredients but kills them shortly with its toxic boric acid. Its, however, odorless and does not stain the surfaces it is applied on.

<p>Black Flag Roach Motels are small boxes whose ingredients lure cockroaches and traps them until they die.</p>
<p>They are the best traps for the eradication of roach infestation both indoors and outdoors. The boxes contain a strong adhesive mixed with an attractant that is irresistible to cockroaches.

The contents of the ingredients smell like maple syrup. It isnt something unbearable unless you want to stick your nose there!
The boxes are closed, making them safe for kids and pets. Moreover, the ingredients are non-toxic and pesticide-free. You can place the boxes away from kids and pests to bar them from interfering with them and limiting their effectiveness.
The adhesive remains effective for several months as long as it doesnt get clogged with dead bugs. The attractant lasts 2-4 months. For best results, replace the boxes after four months even when the adhesive is not full of dead bugs.
Remember that Black Flag Roach Motels stand a better chance of eradicating roach population when used alongside contact killers like Advion Syngenta Roach Killer Gel Bait.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attracts and catches roaches effectively</li>

<p>Combat roach bait station does exactly what it promises. Exterminating the entire roach population.</p>
<p>It is the ideal pesticide for killing all commons types of roaches and small pests like ants, fleas, crickets, weevils, beetles etc.
The Fipronil inherent in this combat roach bait gives it an edge over other similar products. A typical bait station contains a mixture of luring food and the pesticide. When ingested by roaches, Fipronil acts on the insect slowly but effectively.
Thus roaches that eat the bait have enough time to return to their hard-to-reach areas and infect other roaches with Fipronil. Fipronil is spread through contact or through feeding on carcasses or feces. This active ingredient is non-detectable and has a residual effect of up to 3 months.
Another advantage with Fipronil is its ability to act even on large cockroach infestation. Notably, the combat roach killer is an excellent remedy for the German roach. Whats more, combat roach bait station will get rid of even the peskiest roach infestation when appropriately used. Like any other pesticide, remember to keep combat roach bait away from kids and pets.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective and long-lasting</li>
<li>Can be used to exterminate a whole colony</li>
<li>Leaves no stains</li>
<li>Easy application</li>
<li>Can be spread by other roaches</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slowly acting</li>
<li>Must be kept away from children and kids</li>

<p>Invicta gold cockroach gel is the ultimate pesticide for getting rid of the tough German roaches out of your house.</p>
<p>This ready to use cockroach gel comes in a pack of 4 35 grams tubes and a plunger. Its active ingredient is Imidacloprid, a very potent insecticide for exterminating the tough German cockroaches.
The limitation of this gel to German roaches may seem like a downside. But again, it makes sense, owing to the persistence and averseness of German roaches to pesticides.
Professional pest exterminators recommend using Invicta gold roach bait together with another bait to kill all roach species in your house.
In addition to its active ingredient, Invicta contains 11 different types of attractants, which make irresistible to German cockroaches.
The gel can be used to get rid of roaches even in small cracks and other unreachable areas. In addition, Invict roach gel lasts up to 3 months.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kills German roaches</li>
<li>Highly potent attractants</li>
<li>Non-disgusting odour</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>

<p>I have already reviewed the best cockroach killers in the market. But theres one more thing! Lets look at some of the considerations you should bear in mind before you go shopping for cockroach pesticides.</p>
<h3 id="strength"><strong>Strength</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strength">¶</a></h3>
<p>Usually, the strength of cockroach killers depends on the form in which it takes.
While some pesticides last for a few weeks, others may last up to a year. Traps last longer than sprays, while sprays last longer than powders.</p>
<h3 id="targeted-pests-">**Targeted Pests **<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#targeted-pests-">¶</a></h3>
<p>Not all pesticides are formulated for cockroaches. So when buying pest killers, choose the ones that are meant to attract and kill cockroaches.
Even better, choose pesticides that are formulated to eliminate other pests in addition to cockroaches.</p>
<h3 id="usage-">**Usage **<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#usage-">¶</a></h3>
<p>Normally, most cockroach pesticides are formulated for both indoors and outdoors. If your pesticides are targeted in areas that serve food, a lot of care should be taken not to poison the foot.
Where possible, buy pesticides whose ingredients are food-grade. Besides, follow the directions carefully.</p>
<h3 id="count"><strong>Count</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#count">¶</a></h3>
<p>Just as cockroach infestations come in different extents, so do pesticide quantities. The counts are other depending on the nature of the product.
Typically pesticides are available in tubes, liters, dozens, etc. So, depending on the extent of your roach infestation, you need to know how much you require.
For example, you may talk of 3 tubes of gel, two dozen bait traps, 5 liters of spray, etc.</p>
<h3 id="pets-and-kids-safe"><strong>Pets and kids Safe</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pets-and-kids-safe">¶</a></h3>
<p>Kids and pets will be curious whenever they see something new in the house. Therefore cockroach killers can be very dangerous when not used properly.
Its however, advisable to buy roach killers that do not pose a lot of danger to kids and pets. Follow the directions of any pesticide carefully to ascertain the threats.</p>
<h3 id="dimensions-">**Dimensions **<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dimensions-">¶</a></h3>
<p>When dealing with cockroach traps, the size of the trap matters a lot.�Small-sized traps are better because they dont look clumsy around the area or along walking paths. For gels and sprays, size does not matter.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>You dont have to live with cockroaches anymore! Its not the right time to call a professional exterminator, either. With the right kind of pesticide, you can say goodbye to roaches and other small pests in your house.
