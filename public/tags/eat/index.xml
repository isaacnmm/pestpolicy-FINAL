      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Cats <a href="/posts/do-flying-termites-eat-wood/">Eat</a> Lizards? Have you ever met lizards and cats together in your home, yard or compound? Can your lizard and cat pet live together? It is interesting to find how cats go along with lizards in your place? So, do cats eat lizards?
<em>The direct answer is YES! Cats will eat lizards. Cats are great lizard predators. They will hunt, kill and eat lizard either by cutting it into pieces or swallow it whole (for the small sized cats).�</em>
<em>Cats prefer eating smaller lizards such as geckos, skins and Savannah�lizards. However, depending on the species, cats may not be safe after eating lizards. Some species such as salamanders and juvenile blue-tailed skinks secrets poison in their skin, which may kill your cat if eaten.�</em>

<em>Though house lizards (gecko) may not have venom or poison, they carry parasites (liver flukes), pathogens and bacteria (salmonella) which affect adversely on the health of your cat when eaten.</em>

<h2 id="details-do-cats-eat-lizards">Details: Do Cats Eat Lizards?</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-do-cat-eat-lizards">1. How Do Cat Eat Lizards</h3>
<p>Cats normally hunt and kill the lizards before eating them. The cat will cut (using its teeth-canines) lizard into parts for easier swallowing. Also, the cat can tear the soft flesh from the body meat of the lizard. Main parts of lizards that are usually fed on by the cats include the body meat, limbs and the tail. When feeding on the lizards, cats do not remove lizards skin (which is infectious in some lizard species).
Most cats do not eat the Head of lizard unless when they swallow lizard whole (which is a rare case). Small cats dont eat the lizards bones. You will, probably, find bones leftovers where the cat was feeding.
Cats dont hunt lizards as a group unless when training their kitten. You are not likely to spot cats feeding since they hide mostly.�After killing the lizard, cat begins by eating the tail since its soft, fatty and its caudal bones can be chewed together with meat easily.</p>
<h3 id="2-which-lizards-do-cats-eat-most">2. Which Lizards Do Cats Eat Most?</h3>
<p>Your pet cat may not be selective when hunting lizards for food. However, most cats have been found to hunt more some of the following lizard species:</p>
<ol>
<li>**House lizards (Gecko).**These lizards are readily available at many homes and are safer when eaten by cats (not toxic/poisonous, contains no venom).</li>
<li>Moreover, geckos do not run faster when escaping in case of danger and their defense mechanism against cats is weak (mild bite and hiding) as compare to other lizards such as Tree crocodile monitor, which attack its predators.</li>
<li>**The savannah Lizards.**These lizards are small in size and are found in subtropical climate. Your pet cat will mainly go hunting them in the fields. Savannah lizards are quick to catch since they do not run fast.</li>
<li><strong>Nile water monitors</strong>. These love water bodies in rivers and pods around your home or region. Cats hunt them even though they get wild during capture. These lizards are safe and non-venomous.

<h3 id="3-which-lizards-are-poisonous-to-cats">3. Which Lizards Are Poisonous To Cats?</h3>
<p>The following lizards are poisonous to your pet cat when eaten.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Mexican Bearded</strong>These lizards are found in Southern United states and are highly venomous. The roots or Mexican Bearded lizards have venom glands that releases poison every time it bites your cat. The poison lowers the blood pressure of the cat and prevent blood clotting. Moreover, the cat face walking challenges, breathing, have frequent pooping and urination and generates inability to meow after eating Mexican bearded lizards.</li>
<li>**Gila Monitor lizard.**This lizard is known attack and bite cats in defense. Its poison is severe than that of Mexican Bearded lizard and its poisonous teeth paralyzes the cat on injection. Their skin also house bacteria that causes severe infection on your cat.</li>
<li>**Komodo dragon.**This lizard is able to attack and kill cats on approach immediately. It has poisonous glands that release killing venom on biting. Cats bitten by die in minutes. Most cats fear hunting the Komodo dragon. In fact, Komodo dragon is known to kill human beings.</li>
<li>**Juvenile blue-tailed skinks.**The skinks secrets poison in their skin, which kills the cat when eaten. Cats are highly attracted to blue tailed skinks and often prey on them. The skinks dont run fast in case of attack (they are easily caught by cats).</li>
<li>They have poisonous skin (skin produces poison) which kill cats when eaten. Salamanders have smooth soft skins and are usually swallowed whole by cats. Salamander dont escape faster and thus are easily caught by cats (predators).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-it-safe-for-cats-to-eat-lizards-what-are-the-dangers">Is it safe for cats to eat lizards? What are the Dangers?</h2>
<p>Most lizards are not toxic to cats when eaten (they are therefore safe). The body meat of lizard do not contain any poison that may affect the health of your cat. However, some lizards such as Komodo dragon and Gila Monitors have poisonous gland at their tooths root, which inject venom to its prey (cat) on attack thus paralyzing or killing it.
Though the lizards meat may not be poisonous, it may post the following dangers when eaten:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Get Liver Flukes. **Lizards such as skinks, savannah and geckos have liver flukes in their elementary tracks. These flukes do not affect these lizards. However, when your pet cat eats lizards, the liver flukes are transferred into the cats digestive canal from where they move up the liver to the gall bladder.</li>
<li>The liver flukes cause liver inflammations and block the bile duct of your cat leading to death.<em>Some symptoms of liver flukes</em>in your pet cat include yellow eyes and skin, vomiting, diarrhea, Lethargy, loss of appetite and swelling of abdomen.</li>
<li>**Acquire Salmonella Bacteria. **The skin of house lizard (gecko), skinks and bearded lizard house bacteria such as Salmonella. The salmonella bacteria may not cause sickness on a healthy cat. However, when the cat fall sick, the bacteria will accelerate the illness.</li>
<li>**Skin Infections.**The under skin of skins, Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, house lizards etc. have pathogens which cause severe skin infections on your pet cats.

<h2 id="how-do-lizards-protect-themselves-from-cats">How Do Lizards Protect Themselves From Cats?</h2>
<p>Lizards have various mechanisms of protecting them from their predator. These ways include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Running Away.**Most small sized lizards such as Gecko, skinks and savannah lizards run away in case of the attacks. However, they may not run very fast, but their swift enables them to reach their hideouts safely.</li>
<li>Inflate their Bodies. Lizards such as Thorny devil and Horned toad lizard inflates their bodies to appear big so as to scare away their predators. Bearded dragon is able to puff their throat out making them bigger thus scaring their predators.</li>
<li>**Autotomy.**This an act where the lizard is able to carry out self-amputation of tail. Lizards such as leopard geckos and house lizards are able to cut off its tail in case of danger. The cut tail is used as a bait or a mechanism that stops the predators (scare/confuse) from following them further.</li>
<li>** Fighting. **Monitor lizards such as Tree Crocodile monitor and Gila monitors are famous of fighting against their assailants. The Komodo dragon and Green Iguana use their tail to knock down their enemies.</li>
<li>**Using venom/biting.**Venomous lizards such as Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, Mexican Bearded lizards and the Tree Crocodile have venom in their teeth roots, which paralyses their prey on biting.</li>
<li>**Camouflaging.**Lizards such as chameleons are able to change color to match their hideouts. Small lizards are brown, grey or black colored, which camouflage well with their environment such as back or trees, rocks or sand. Some lizards such as bearded lizards and Gila monitors camouflage to send a warning signal to their predators.</li>
<li>**Hissing.**Frilled dragon opens its frills and produces a hissing sound, which frightens the predator and also makes it look more dangerous.</li>
<li>Squirting blood from their eyes. Pygmy short horned lizards squirts their blood from their eyes when they spot a predator. This make their eyes to enlarge thus scaring away their predators.</li>
</ol>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below I&rsquo;ve tackled this questions - &ldquo;do cockroaches eat bed bugs?&quot;�Most people dread from the disgusting sight of domestic cockroaches.</p>
<p>Natural/biological pest control remedies like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-eats-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/)/">Bed Bug Predators</a>
have now become popular. So, do roaches <a href="/posts/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">eat</a> bed bugs?
**Simple answer, YES  Cockroaches are known predators of bed bugs, which wreak havoc in millions of homes. However, only some species of cockroaches eat bed bugs. **
<strong>Particularly the American and the German cockroaches are very fond of feasting on bed bugs. Others cockroaches that eat bed bugs include the oriental and the brown-banded cockroaches.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-cockroaches-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>Details: Do Cockroaches Eat Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>It is very uncomfortable to have bed bugs inhabit your home. They hide in furniture, pillows, clothing and luggage near their human host. Bed bug bites cause unbearable irritations and allergic reactions to human bodies.</p>
<p>However, cockroaches can save you from these bites by feasting on these nocturnal insects. Both insects emerge at night after you switch off the lights. In their four hours of actively scavenging for food, cockroaches will feast on bed bugs before they even get a chance to feast on human blood.</p>
<p>To roaches, bed bugs seem like a nice snack. You might wonder how roaches are able to locate bed bugs. They have acute sensory and survival instincts that enable them to easily locate and feed on bed bugs.</p>

<h2 id="which-cockroach-species-eat-bed-bugs"><strong>Which Cockroach Species Eat Bed Bugs?�</strong></h2>
<p>Several species of cockroaches are very fond of eating bed bugs. The most common bed bug-eating cockroaches include the German and the American cockroaches. Others in the list are the oriental and the brown-banded cockroach.</p>
<h3 id="1-american-cockroach-waterbug"><strong>1. American cockroach (waterbug)</strong></h3>
<p>Its the largest household roach in America. They are fond of fermenting material, but will feed on almost any kind food. When indoors, they feed on crumbs that scatter on the floor, under appliances, behind kitchen cabinets and insects such as bed bugs.</p>
<p>Their typical outdoor diet may include, small insects, decaying leaves, fungi, algae, etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-german-cockroach"><strong>2. German cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>German roaches are almost the size as American ones. They will eat anything that has nutritional value including other pests like bed bugs. They easily find their way into new houses by getting a ride in cartons, bags and second-hand appliances
<strong>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="do-cockroaches-hunt-bed-bugs"><strong>Do Cockroaches Hunt Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>Just like bed bugs, cockroaches come out to search for food during the night. So, theyre likely to hunt and feed on bed bugs as they search for something to eat. The two insects have adapted to feed at night as a way of avoiding predators and enemies like us.</p>
<p>At night, when everyone is asleep, therere fewer disturbances and these insect know its their time to eat. If they were to feed during the day, you would of course be their greatest threat. But, at night, these creatures will feed uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Cockroaches will harbour in your mattress and furniture, making them very close to the bed bugs that are waiting for you to sleep in order to feed on your blood. Usually, cockroaches will hunt on these bed bugs as they emerge from their hideouts.</p>
<p>Since they will have to cross walls from their hideouts to get to their human host, they became easy targets from the active cockroaches.</p>
<h2 id="are-cockroaches-a-sign-of-bed-bugs">Are Cockroaches a Sign of Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Once cockroaches get into your house, they will stick there as long as there is something for them to eat or until you exterminate them. You probably know that roaches can eat anything that they come across. They scavenge for anything from food to things like paper, wood and glue.</p>
<p>If theres nothing for them to eat, including bed bugs, roaches will quickly leave your house and go hunting for food. That means, if roaches have nothing else to eat and you have bed bugs, it possible that they will stick around.</p>
<p>However, you cant have a scenario where cockroaches have nothing to eat at all. And since they dont depend on bed bugs as their main diet, roaches will stick in your house whether you have bed bugs or not.</p>
<h2 id="cockroaches-vs-bed-bugs--which-is-easier-to-control"><strong>Cockroaches Vs. Bed Bugs  Which is easier to Control?</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches are simpler to kill because of their tendency to eat any food or even non-food substances. So, if you lay poison baits or traps having food, it is possible to kill cockroaches. A good example of a cockroach trap is bait traps with glucose. Since they love to eat sweet things, glucose will easily lure them into your poison baits or traps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bed bugs only feed on blood from warm blooded animals. So you wont expect them to be lured into baits and traps meant for cockroaches. However there are traps and lures for bed bugs.</p>
<p>One of the best method to kill roaches and bed bugs, is to use heat treatment.</p>
<p>In heat treatment, your house is heated to temperatures above 120C, so that no bed bug or cockroach can survive. The bugs are exterminated quicker with increase in temperatures. It requires professional equipment and expertise to heat the room to the required temperatures.</p>
<p>Not only will you effectively kill bed bugs and cockroaches. If other pests including ants, flies and termites reside in your house, they will also die during the heat treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the available pesticides can be used against roaches and bed bugs. A good example is permethrin.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-roaches-to-kill-bed-bugs"><strong>Disadvantages of Roaches To Kill Bed Bugs</strong></h2>
<p>While cockroaches can help you kill bed bugs in your home, they could escalate into a real problem. These creatures are known to be survivalist and can multiply rapidly in a very short period. Dont be tempted to depend on them to kill bed bugs in your house. Just like bed bugs, roaches are equally difficult to rid of.</p>
<p>Roaches are also associated with a lot of contamination in our houses. They are known to pass on germs that may cause diseases such as gastro-enteritis and dysentery in humans. Other diseases that may be transmitted through these creatures include, salmonella and stomach related illnesses.</p>
<p>These diseases become possible when roaches leave their pathogenic infected faeces or secretions on surfaces and food substances.</p>
<p>Cockroaches also cause asthmatic reactions among children and the elderly during their regular molting.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do cockroaches eat bed bugs? NO. The fact that cockroaches eat bed bugs does not make them a reliable pest control method. You have noticed that bed bugs dont constitute the main diet for cockroaches.</p>
<p>Cockroaches feed on almost anything they come across. That means, they dont go hunting for bed bugs wherever they are.�Obviously, you cant resolve to have enough cockroaches to feed on the bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>You would end up with a hoard of roaches, hence creating another problem. Furthermore, bed bugs reproduce very rapidly and will replenish their population in a matter of time.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, these natural predators will never make a difference to your bed bug infestation. The best solution is to adopt some of the well-known methods like pesticides, bait traps or the DIY bed bug controls.</p>

      <description>If you have seen flying termites around your home, you probably have a lot of questions in mind.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have seen flying termites around your home, you probably have a lot of questions in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do flying termites eat wood? Though most people confuse flying termites with flying ants they are clearly different.
<strong>So, do Flying Termites Eat Wood? Flying termites do not eat wood but only fly out to mate and reproduce and to form a new colony. In this flying termite stage, they only survive in that state for nearly an hour or two before their wings fall off and they seek a nest to lay their eggs.�</strong>
<strong>But, when they shed wings, they cause destruction by burrowing into woods or establish nests where they start their next life cycle - know how to control termites.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Flying Termites Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-flying-termites---know-these-insects"><strong>What Are Flying Termites - Know these Insects�</strong></h2>
<p>Flying termites are part of the termites life cycle and part of the larger insects family. They are winged and also are the reproductive part of the termites cycle. They are known as the alates.
If you have never seen flying termites, you are most probably going to confuse them with the flying ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alates have 4 wings of the same size with a pair on each side. Their thorax and abdomen are almost similar in size and the waist is thick. The antennae are straight with a 3/8 inch long body that can reach even  inch wide.</li>
<li>There are 3 major species of the alates that include subterranean termites, damp wood, and Formosan termites.</li>
<li>From the 3 species, Formosan alates cause more destruction than other species. Dampwood alates are also known to destroy anything woody including furniture, books, and rotting pieces of wood.
Therefore, every time you see flying termites, you need to raise an alarm over an incoming or an already existing infestation in your home.

</ul>
<h2 id="where-can-you-find-the-f"><strong>Where can you Find the F****lying Termites?�</strong></h2>
<p>The flying termites come from an already established nest to go mate and reproduce. After mating, their wings fall off as they seek a new nest to start another colony.</p>
<ul>
<li>They burrow underwood and other suitable places for the next colony.</li>
<li>When they are successful, they reproduce and the cycle continues
There are different species of flying termites and each species has a different swarming season.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-do-flying-termites-swarm"><strong>When do flying termites swarm?</strong></h2>
<p>The major reason why flying termites come out from their colonies is that they are out to mate. However, there are different species with different swarming seasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see a swarm of termites in broad daylight during the spring season, these are the subterranean species.</li>
<li>If the infestation is during the late summer, the swarm is from the dry wood species they also like appearing in the evenings.</li>
<li>They are very fond of artificial lights and will storm into your house in case you leave your windows and doors open.</li>
<li>Lastly, damp wood species like swarm during summer but also like hiding under damp wood and rotten pieces of timber.
When the summer season is on, damp wood species also like entering our houses like swollen balloons if the windows and doors are open.� Use window shields to prevent these termites and other insects from getting into your house.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-flying-termites-live"><strong>How Long Do Flying Termites Live?</strong></h2>
<p>Flying termites dont survive for long in this nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes approximately 1 hour as they mate and drop off their wings to look for nests where they can reproduce.
The maximum they can take in this state is 2 hours.

</ul>
<h2 id="flying-termites-in-the-house-what-should-i-do"><strong>Flying Termites In The House-What Should I Do?</strong></h2>
<p>The flying termites you see around are completely harmless to you as a person. They dont bite nor do they sting.
But there is a reason to get worried because they are either looking for a nest to establish or there is already an existing nest within your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>If nothing is done, they can be built nests in your attic, ceiling, underground foundation, or any other place within your home.
In the meantime, you need to lock up your windows and doors to prevent their entry into your house. Turning off the lights also helps control those that are attracted to light.
If nothing is done, these flying termites will establish a nest-a a new queen will be formed and this could mean termite infestation. The damage to timber, books, ceiling, and furniture among other things they come around.
Next time you get a swarm of flying termites consult a pest control expert who knows the best way to eliminating them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-flying-termites"><strong>How Do You Get Rid Of Flying Termites?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have noticed these flying termites, its a signal that you need to take action against insect control in your area.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an indication that the termites have been hiding in your vicinity and are now going to multiply even more.</li>
<li>Flying termites are actually hard to control because they appear within a very short time and quickly disappear into their nests after mating.
The queen is also very much protected and killing it is hard making it impossible to control the rest of the termites. It will continue laying eggs and releasing more termites into your house.
Using pest control products may work but a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">professional pest control expert</a>
will do a much better job in eliminating them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do flying termites eat wood? No, they dont but they are indications of more destruction to come.</p>
<ul>
<li>This winged stage is normally short for the termites where they mate before wings fall off and they look for the best place to make a new colony.</li>
<li>Though this stage does not cause any destruction, it leaves an alarm of what awaits you if you dont take immediate action to control them.
Expect different flying termites to come out in different seasons depending on their species. They are also attracted to different things depending on their species i.e. artificial light, damp wood among others.
That said and done, there are many available means to
control the termites invasion
. However, the best option remains engaging experts in pest control for the complete elimination of the termites in your home.</li>

<em>In summary, do lizards eat bed bugs? Yes, lizards (particularly geckos or house lizards) will kill bed bugs - but won&rsquo;t be an effective pest control remedy.�</em>
<em>However, Bed bugs are fast reproducers and hence lizards won&rsquo;t keep up to feed on the bugs with their quick multiplication just�like with other house pests.�</em>

<li>Bed bugs have an average body length of about 1 to 7 mm - and hence they&rsquo;re visible - they&rsquo;ll also jump onto household items, pets, and clothing.</li>
<li>If there bed bugs (pests) around your house - maintain great hygiene - including in the urban area.
But can multiple lizards exterminate the bed bugs? Well, yes, lizards and geckos will feed on lizards but may also leave mess and droppings.

<h2 id="any-dangers-feeding-bed-bugs-to-geckos">Any Dangers Feeding Bed Bugs to Geckos?</h2>
<p>For any lizards that are allowed to fend for themselves around your house, as a pest control measure, you won&rsquo;t experience any problems - but not when
adopted as a pet
.
Therefore, feeding the lizards with bed bugs (that are brought from elsewhere) may not be a great idea since bed bugs are known to hold organisms causing bacterial infections.</p>
<h2 id="issues-with-using-geckos-to-control-bed-bugs">Issues with Using Geckos to Control Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>So, if any homeowner considers employing geckos of house lizards to eat bed bugs, they must be prepared to control different issues related to that.</p>
<h3 id="1-gecko-feces">1. Gecko Feces</h3>
<p>Involving house geckos to control bed bugs will lead to different issues with undesirable effects including leaving feces on different surfaces.
The lizard droppings will be concealed in hard-to-find or dark places - near or around the kitchen cupboard that won&rsquo;t be moved regularly.
The feces may be hidden in areas that are hard to notice - and you&rsquo;ll notice this issue when you see flies swarming in some specific dark or partially hidden places.</p>
<h3 id="2-damaging-household-devices">2. Damaging household devices</h3>
<p>Further, the geckos may equally cause damage to your household devices including electronics.
This may cause losses in terms of malfunctioning devices - due to electrocuted lizards.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-pests-to-feed-to-your-geckos">Alternative Pests To feed to your Geckos?</h2>
<p>Some homeowners believe that any uninvited insect must be exterminated using chemical methods - but to control the
intruder
, you can use different creepy-crawlies.</p>
<h3 id="1-mosquitoes">1. Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>There are alternative pests that you may feed to your lizards - house lizards won&rsquo;t only feed on bed bugs but will also attack the small pests running around your house and
yard
.
Lizards are largely diurnal, and they won&rsquo;t eat numerous mosquitoes, but will opportunist capturing of the pests. But toads and frogs crepuscular &amp; nocturnal) eat more mosquitoes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLBtiyLAgAU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLBtiyLAgAU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
Lizards love mosquito diets - they&rsquo;ll simply stick out their sticky tongue and feed on the bugs. But lizards may not be welcome in homes that have small rodents,
cats
, and dogs.
Therefore, for houses that have pets, you&rsquo;ll require to acquire the services of some expert exterminators for the
control of the mosquitos
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, lizards (many amphibians) tend to be very creepy particularly in the house basement. Lizards may also bring diseases - they love damp and warm environments.
Therefore, to help control mosquitoes, you may avoid killing the lizards you notice around your home, pantry, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-mice-and-rats">2. Mice and Rats</h3>
<p>Mice and rats will create a great food source for geckos in your spaces - even in the rented spaces - but they&rsquo;ll mainly eat the young ones and rat litter.
Geckos will efficiently predate on mice and rats - geckos mainly hide in dark areas - and they&rsquo;ll feed on the pinkies - young rats particularly while their mother rat is away.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqMRsTMiwI&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqMRsTMiwI&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
You&rsquo;ll find the lizards hanging around dark places - locations where you also get mice and rats and their younglings. Thus lizards get to snack on the pests and their�pinkies.</p>
<h3 id="2cockroaches">2.�Cockroaches</h3>
<p>So, will geckos feed on cockroaches? Well, yes geckos and house lizards will also eat roaches and their larva. But they occupy different places - roaches love places near the ground.
On the other hand, geckos occupy spaces that are higher above the ground - they love dark, damp, and equally cool places. But house lizards will occupy dark places - also loved by cockroaches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-cockroaches/">Animals that Eat Cockroaches</a>
Centipedes will feed on house lizards - the bug&rsquo;s wriggly motion will attract lizards that snatch them fast. You&rsquo;ll get the centipedes around the house on wood beams and other wooden fixtures.
Lizards will also feed on termite swarmers that move in colonies - they have wings and hence will fly as swarmers.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="will-housegeckos-eat-bed-bugs-in-captivity">Will House<strong>Geckos Eat Bed Bugs in captivity?�</strong></h2>
<p>So, will house geckos feed on bed bugs while they&rsquo;re in captivity? Well, yes, geckos (even when in captivity) will munch different pests including bed bugs, cockroaches, silkworms, or waxworms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, while the geckos are in captivity you&rsquo;ll need to provide additional food and meal supplementation like vitamins.</li>
<li>But ensure to check the size of the pests and insects you&rsquo;re giving to the geckos to avoid choking - they must measure a maximum of the distance between the gecko&rsquo;s eyes.
In addition, live crickets must not be allowed into the
gecko&rsquo;s enclosure space
since they actually nibble and bite on your humble pests.
On gecko thirst for water, mist water in the pest&rsquo;s enclosure. So, don&rsquo;t pour water simply into some dish since the geckos will quench from water droplets on leaves and tree branches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question &ldquo;do geckos eat bed bugs&rdquo;, Yes, geckos will feed on bed bugs but they may also bring salmonella and also leave damaged devices and drop feces.</p>

<ul>
<li>**Well, do Geckos <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-roaches/">eat</a> cockroaches? Yes! Geckos are naturally insectivorous pets and would feed on cockroaches as much as they can. I****t would not be advisable to feed your geckos with cockroaches that are fetched directly from the field as they may be contaminated, poisonous, or venomous. **</li>
<li><strong>Usually, you should be able to identify the right cockroach species, especially ones recommended by the vet, when feeding your geckos.</strong>
Alternatively, you can buy commercial roaches from the nearest center or breed some at your home place. Geckos have no feeding limit, they can overheat if not controlled.

<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-cockroaches">Details: Do Geckos Eat Cockroaches?</h2>
<p>Geckos are typically insectivorous, they feed on insects for food. Cockroaches are common insects that are mainly proteinous in nature and guarantee nutritious/whole meals for your geckos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike human beings, gecko hunt captures and swallows the cockroach without chewing.</li>
<li>However, for baby geckos, they usually feed on small cockroaches (between 1 to 4 inch long).
Contrary, adult geckos can eat large cockroaches without any challenges. Cockroaches contain protein, fat, fluid, and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, copper, and potassium.
Upon feeding, your geckos acquire dense protein nutrients necessary for bodybuilding - building up body tissues, muscles, and replacing worn-out cells. Further, minerals such as calcium and iron will strengthen your pets&rsquo; bones - enabling them to carry their body weight.</li>
<li>Cockroach fat is a great source of energy for your geckos. However, too much of it may lead to obesity if the feeding is not monitored.</li>
<li>The cockroach wings have a strong network that acts as roughages, thus when eaten would prevent your geckos from constipation.
Commonly, geckos can be used as a biological insects control in your home place. However, this would not be good practice and geckos should not be fed on directly caught cockroaches for these reasons:</li>
<li>Open field cockroaches may have germs</li>
<li>Cockroaches may be contaminated or poisonous (consult your vet for the right cockroach species)</li>
<li>The cockroach may have pesticides, which are dangerous to your geckos</li>
<li>Roaches may have poisonous bacteria or virus
It&rsquo;s therefore always necessary to pre-treat your cockroaches (those caught from open fields) before feeding them to your geckos.
In addition, you need to supplement cockroaches with enough water when feeding to avoid choking or constipation, which is very common - this can kill your geckos very fast.
Commercially purchased cockroaches (from a vet or certified outlets) are highly recommended since they are less prone to health problems - they have no or limited health risk to your geckos.
Alternatively, you can breed cockroaches at your home place for geckos - this limits chances of contamination.

<h2 id="what-is-alternative-food-for-geckos">What is Alternative Food for Geckos?</h2>
<p>Apart from cockroaches, you can feed your geckos with the following meals;</p>
<h3 id="1-mealworms">1. Mealworms</h3>
<p>Live mealworms are known to provide a great source of fat (13%), protein (20.4%), moisture (62%), and fiber, which is about 2%.
When dried, mealworms offer 53% protein, 6% fiber, and 28% fat for your geckos. When feeding your geckos with dried mealworms, it&rsquo;s advisable to supplement them with water to avoid choking.
Though slightly expensive, mealworms provide a great source of energy for your geckos.
However, too many mealworms (daily feeding) will cause obesity (to your geckos) if not monitored. Breeding mealworms in your home is highly recommendable in order to lower the overall feeding cost.</p>
<h3 id="2-crickets">2. Crickets</h3>
<p>Crickets are a major source of meals for geckos in most places as they offer a great source of fat, necessary for energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, crickets have minerals such as zinc, potassium, copper, iron, magnesium, biotin, folate, and pantothenic acid.
Also, crickets are preferentially loved by geckos due to their taste and guarantee unmatched satisfaction to your pets - no health complications.
Further, crickets are rich in vitamins such as vitamin A, B, C, K, D, and E for geckos&rsquo; protection against diseases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-flies">3. Flies</h3>
<p>Geckos hunt for house flies largely in the house to substitute other insects such as mosquitoes - house flies are a great source of protein and fat, especially at the larva stage</p>
<ul>
<li>Flies such as fruit flies are highly recommended due to their superior nutritional value in iron, magnesium, and calcium.
Moreover, fruit flies can also be purchased locally or bred at your home easily - just leave decomposition fruits hanging in your geckos&rsquo; house for a week or so (fruit flies will just come and multiply).

</ul>
<h3 id="4-superworms-and-waxworms">4. Superworms and Waxworms</h3>
<p>Superworms are rich in vitamin c (191mg/kg) and riboflavin. More so, super worms have dense protein nutrients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Waxworms are best known for moisture addition (58%), fat, and proteinous nutrients.</li>
<li>Furthermore, waxworms have great calcium(243mg/kg) and phosphorus (1960mg/kg) mineral contents.
NB: When feeding your geckos with any of these meals, it&rsquo;s advisable to control feeds in order to avoid challenges associated with overeating - obesity, inactivity, intestinal problems, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-much-do-geckos-eat">How Much do Geckos Eat?</h2>
<p>Generally, we may not ascertain exactly how much you feed your geckos due to varying sizes and climatic conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, we can always come to a common ground that your geckos should feed until their bellies/stomachs become flat.</li>
<li>Otherwise, beyond that point, your geckos will be overfeeding, which is risky for their health.
When feeding your geckos, it&rsquo;s at this point you monitor how much they have eaten before their tummy/stomach got flat and then settle for that quantity as a control point.
Basically, we usually recommended that you give your geckos feeds for 10 to 15 minutes on average for two to three times a day at most. Ensure water is always available at geckos&rsquo; house.
Baby geckos should be fed regularly than adult geckos since their metabolism is high due to cell division</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-overfeed-your-geckos">What Happens When You Overfeed your Geckos?</h2>
<p>Overfed geckos have the following problems:</p>
<h3 id="a-overweightobsess">a. Overweight/Obsess</h3>
<p>Geckos continuously gain weight, especially if fed with fatty food like mealworms often. The extra weight makes it impossible for geckos to move about.</p>
<h3 id="b-intestinal-problems">b. Intestinal Problems</h3>
<p>Your geckos will not be able to carry out normal digestion due to blockage of the alimentary canal.
This will affect the process of opening bowels as well. Further, you will notice that your geckos are either having diarrhea or constipation.</p>
<h3 id="c-inactivity">c. Inactivity</h3>
<p>Your geckos become inactive when they overeat- they fail to walk about like others or exercise.
This condition is attributed to the fact that the extra weight becomes a burden to your gecko - it avoids dragging along.

<h3 id="d-death">d. Death</h3>
<p>Overfeeding may result in the death of your geckos due to long-term inactivity.
If the obesity is not attended to in time, your geckos will suffer from skeleton/bones deformation, and destruction of internal tissues, which lead to death eventually.</p>
<h2 id="what-shouldnt-you-feed-your-geckos">What Shouldn&rsquo;t you Feed Your Geckos?</h2>
<p>The following food should never be fed to your geckos:</p>
<h3 id="1-vegetables">1. Vegetables</h3>
<p>As highlighted earlier in this article, geckos are insectivorous reptiles and should therefore be fed on nutritious insects only.
Vegetables are not a meal for geckos - in fact, geckos won&rsquo;t even eat vegetables whatsoever - unless mixed with insects, which is not the right thing to do.</p>
<h3 id="2-fireflies-or-lightning-bugs">2. Fireflies or Lightning Bugs</h3>
<p>Fireflies or Lightning Bugs are dangerous and poisonous insects that lead to death in a couple of minutes when swallowed (by geckos).
Actually, the toxic chemical in fireflies (lucibufagins) paralyzes geckos before death occurs.</p>
<h3 id="3-fruits">3. Fruits</h3>
<p>Avoid feeding your geckos with any type of fruits whatsoever.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though some geckos may attempt to feed on fruits such as berries, grapes, and melons, most geckos won&rsquo;t eat them at all.
Fruits such ad starfruit, rhubarb, and avocado are dangerous for your geckos and may cause serious health conditions.

</ul>
<h2 id="why-are-my-geckos-not-eating">Why are My Geckos not Eating?</h2>
<p>Your geckos may fail to eat due to either of the following reasons:</p>
<h3 id="a-sickness">a. Sickness</h3>
<p>When sick, geckos lose appetite for food, thus refusing to eat. In such a case, you will need to contact your vet to assess the matter immediately.</p>
<h3 id="b-cold-weatherenvironment">b. Cold Weather/Environment</h3>
<p>Geckos are cold-blooded animals/reptiles - their body temperature is not able to vary with changes in the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>When placed in a very cold place, geckos tend to be very inactive and won&rsquo;t even eat as well.</li>
<li>Most geckos seem to be hibernating during cold weather and thus fail to eat in the process.
Consider relocating your geckos to a warmer place and observing eating trends.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-too-much-fecal-matter">c. Too Much Fecal Matter</h3>
<p>If you place a meal on feces, be sure that your geckos won&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<ul>
<li>The smell irritates geckos, thus making them hate the meal eventually.</li>
<li>Soiled beddings should be cleared and dried regularly before any meal is given.
Further, you should geckos&rsquo; feed in a basin and not pour food directly onto the floor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-vision-impairment">d. Vision Impairment</h3>
<p>If you place food and your geckos are not eating, there is a high possibility of Vision Impairment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try changing the food location and assess if geckos would locate the meal.
Your geckos may have eye problems such as retrobulbar or corneal - consult a veterinarian for treatment soonest if you notice such a problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e-injuries">e. Injuries</h3>
<p>Any injury on your gecko instills severe pain, which may make it lose appetite.
Actually, bleeding sores and open wounds need to be dressed as soon as they are noticed in order to avoid further damages to their skin.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on the question, do Geckos eat cockroaches? The simple answer is yes. Geckos are insectivorous reptiles, which acquire nutrition from insects such as roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike human beings, geckos swallow entire cockroaches upon hunting.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that geckos have no feeding limit.
Therefore, they can overheat (as long as the food is available), which may cause problems such as obesity with time. A controlled feeding program should be followed in order to avoid such health challenges.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been disturbed by colonies of roaches in your place and wonder which animal can eliminate them naturally? You may even be compelled to find out if some of your pets can eat cockroaches.</p>
<p>Do you own a pet <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs/">Gecko</a> (house lizard) or have you spotted one in your house, yard or zoo? Well, in this article, we shall delve into close predation of gecko on roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>**So, Do Geckos <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a> Roaches? The direct answer is YES. Geckos hunt and eat roaches in your home, yard, or zoo. **</li>
<li><strong>But, it&rsquo;s not advisable to feed your Geckos on cockroaches from your house or caught outside in the fields since these roaches contain bacterial infections, parasites, and germs, which may affect their health adversely.</strong>
<strong>�Geckos will eat any species of roaches (unselective) though they prefer eating Dubia roaches. They also hunt and eat mosquitoes, ants, rats/mice, swarmers, crickets, locusts, and centipedes in your place.</strong>
Lets get into the details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-roaches">Details: Do Geckos Eat Roaches?</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-do-geckos-eat-roaches">1.� How do Geckos Eat Roaches?</h3>
<p>Geckos hunt and eat roaches as one of their main meals. When hunting, Gecko approaches the roach or a colony of roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, it focuses on a specific cockroach after which it shoots its head and captures it with the mouth (its rear legs give it ample momentum to reach its prey on time).</li>
<li>A Gecko would slowly turn the captured roach with its mouth to ensure that the roachs head is inside the mouth fully  this helps in fasten suffocation process, which is one of the ways Gecko uses to kill the roach.
The Gecko will then try to push the roach further (using its tongue) into its mouth. It will take 1 to 3 minutes for Gecko to swallow whole one roach.</li>
<li>Alternatively, some species of Gecko such as Leopard Gecko prefer to cut (using its teeth) the roachs head first and feed on the body later.</li>
<li>When eating roaches, Gecko does not use its legs to hold on roach for better grip like cats do  gecko uses its mouth entirely for grasping and holding roach into place.
Once Gecko eats a roach, it pauses for 1 to 3 minutes before eating another one  this helps it recover hunting energy and breathe enough air, which it uses to suck in roach when swallowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Geckos will rarely eat a roach from the abdomen  they always eat it from the head. In addition, Geckos eat every part of a roach including the wings.</p>
<h3 id="2-species-of-roaches-that-geckos-eat">2. Species of Roaches That Geckos Eat.</h3>
<p>Geckos do not select when hunting roaches for food. However, research shows that, in a colony of roach species, Geckos tend to feed on Dubia roaches more and often than other species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study has revealed that Dubia roaches have tasty components and a higher level of calcium than other roaches  something that attracts Geckos to prey on them preferentially.</li>
<li>Also, Dubia roaches lack wings (female Dubia roaches) thus making it easier for Gecko to swallow them whole.
Though American roaches, German roaches, and Oriental roaches are the most common at-home are highly likely to be preyed on by Geckos, they post-feeding challenges to them.</li>
<li>They have scary legs and long wings that make swallowing problematic.
Moreover, these roaches cause health problems to Geckos when eaten thus becoming less popular and prioritized food species.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-how-many-roaches-can-gecko-eat">3. How Many Roaches Can Gecko Eat?</h3>
<p>An adult Gecko can eat 2 to 6 (maximum) roaches in a given meal. Some Geckos will feed on two roaches at a time and eat a total of seven roaches in a given day.</p>
<p>However, the number of roaches eaten by Gecko per day may change slightly according to the size of the roach being eaten  Geckos eat smaller roaches than bigger ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Young/baby Gecko can/will eat 2 to 4 roaches in a meal on a given day. Normally, most Geckos feed for 10 to 17 minutes  this time is enough for them to have eaten to their satisfaction.</li>
<li>If you have a pet gecko, it is important to feed it just enough (overfeeding will make your gecko inactive).
Baby geckos should eat a few roaches 2 to 3 times in a given day. (It is not advisable to feed your pet geckos daily  alternate or skip some days).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-are-roaches-bad-to-gecko-when-eaten">4. Are Roaches bad to Gecko when Eaten?</h3>
<p>Though most geckos feed on any roaches around your place (unselective), most roaches found in homes (e.g. American roaches, German roaches, and Oriental roaches) cause health problems to geckos when eaten.</p>
<ul>
<li>They carry parasites, germs, and bacteria in them that cause infections and sickness to your Geckos.</li>
<li>The Salmonella bacteria found on/under the wings of these roaches cause scary and infectious skin on your Geckos.
Parasites such as Trichuris (11.97%), Eimeria (2.73%), Capillaria (6.16%), Toxocara (4.86%), Hook Worm (4.86%), and Ascaris (33.76%) were found both on external and internal parts of roaches after close lab examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Germs from pesticides or control chemicals that may be sprayed in your house or out in fields easily stick on the wings and body of roaches  this will find their way into the gecko digestive tract when eaten thus affecting its health.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-can-your-house-gecko-eat">What Else Can Your House Gecko Eat?</h2>
<p>A Gecko eats mosquitoes in your house or yard by extending its tongue out for the mosquitoes to land and get stuck. A Gecko can also shoot out its tongue out to catch a flying mosquito.</p>
<h3 id="1-ratsmice"><strong>1. Rats/mice.</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from roaches, geckos also hunt and eat rats and mice in your house or compound.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gecko may not kill big rats or mice; however, it feeds on baby rats/mice at their nest.
Geckos help a lot in controlling these organisms. However, the feeding rate is low  you need another alternative control method too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-crickets-and-locusts"><strong>2. Crickets and locusts.</strong></h3>
<p>Field geckos hunt crickets and locusts more than the roaches. Study shows that crickets have a high nutrition value (protein).</p>
<p>The Geckos hunts crickets in their hideouts (holes) by use of their mouth or sticky tongue.</p>
<p>Geckos catch centipedes along the wooden structures in your house or yard using their mouth and swallow them whole.</p>
<p>Swarmer produced by termite colonies in your house or fields is often eaten by geckos. Gecko uses its tongue to stick swarmers and swallow them whole.
<strong>3. Worm substrates e.g. mealworms</strong>
.</p>
<p>You can feed your pet gecko with some of the locally bred organisms such as hornworms, mealworms, silkworms, and super worms.</p>
<ul>
<li>These organisms have a high level of fat that is dangerous for geckos in excess (causes geckos to fatten faster thus leading to walking problems).
Such meals should be fed in fewer quantities and be supplemented often with vet-approved roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-you-avoid-giving-your-gecko">What Should You Avoid Giving Your Gecko?</h2>
<p><strong>1. Vegetables and Fruits</strong>
.</p>
<p>Geckos are insectivorous reptiles. They should not be fed on fruits, vegetables, or any plant extracts/substances.</p>
<p>This causes stomach upset in them though most of the geckos wont feed on such substrates.
<strong>2. High-level fatty insects (Mealworms).</strong>
It is risky to feed your pet Geckos on large quantities of mealworms, hornworms, silkworms, or any high-level fatty insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat from these organisms is stored (not digested) in the adipose tissues (skin layer/beneath the skin) at the tail and stomach regions.</li>
<li>The fattened Gecko becomes docile/inactive and unable to walk normally  this may lead to death with time.
Highly fatty feeds should be fed to your pet gecko once or twice a week and also in less quantity. Supplement insects such as roaches and crickets should accompany the highly fatty gecko feeds.
<strong>3. Ants and Mosquitoes</strong>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid feeding your pet gecko with ants or mosquitoes. Although geckos eat them, these insects cause though and stomach irritation, which may even call for veterinary attention.
<strong>4. Scorpions and termites.</strong>
Scorpions, termites, and safari ants are risky meals for your pet gecko since they attack, bite and instill injuries on its mouth and skin.</p>
<p>Though at times Geckos are able to overcome and eat them, it is advisable not to offer them as food to geckos.
<strong>5. Light insects.</strong>
No insects that produce light (fireflies) should be fed to geckos. They contain toxic chemicals that will harm your pet Gecko.</p>
<p>It is highly recommendable to seek your vet advisory for various types of commercial gecko feeds available to ensure that you always offer the right diet and quantity to your pet geckos at the right time (proper feeding time).</p>
<p>You can also visit gecko feed retailers at the local center/distributors around you.</p>
<p>NB:
<em>Ensure that all your gecko commercial feeds are vet-approved.</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The gecko is an insectivorous reptile that feeds on roaches as one of its meals.</p>
<ul>
<li>They hunt and capture these insects with their mouth before swallowing them whole or slicing them into pieces and then swallowing.</li>
<li>It is not advisable to feed your gecko with roaches in your house or caught from the fields since they usually have germs, bacteria, and harbor infectious parasites.
Gecko can also feed on crickets, ants, locusts, rats, swarmers, and centipedes.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that possums eat cats is largely a misconception. Possums, being opportunistic omnivores and scavengers, primarily feed on fruits, insects, and small animals like rodents.</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not actively hunt cats, and while they might scavenge the remains of a deceased cat, they do not pose a direct threat to living, healthy ones.
Possums are more likely to compete with cats for food than to attack them. This article explores <a href="/posts/do-possums-eat-chickens/">possum</a> behavior, their dietary preferences, and the nature of their interactions with domestic cats, offering reassurance to pet owners and tips to prevent unwanted encounters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possum-diet-what-do-they-eat">Possum Diet: What Do They <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a>?</h2>
<p>Possums are omnivores, which means they eat a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-opossums-eat/">variety of plant and animal matter</a>
. Their diet is highly opportunistic, often dictated by what is easily available in their environment. In the wild, possums typically consume:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fruits and berries</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insects and small invertebrates</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rodents and small birds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Carrion (dead animals)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vegetables and grains</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eggs but not chicken</strong></li>
<li><strong>Small reptiles and amphibians</strong>
In urban areas, possums may forage through garbage cans and eat pet food that is left outside. They are scavengers by nature, which means they are more likely to feed on what they can find rather than actively hunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to understanding their dietary habits is that possums are not hunters in the traditional sense. Instead, they forage and will eat whatever is most accessible and easy to catch or find, including plant material, insects, and small animals.</p>
<h2 id="possums-and-cats-understanding-the-interaction">Possums and Cats: Understanding the Interaction</h2>
<p>The idea that possums eat cats is largely a myth. Cats are much larger than most of the typical prey items that possums eat. In fact, adult cats are far too big and capable of defending themselves, making them an unlikely target for a possums diet.</p>
<p>While possums may be opportunistic eaters, they do not have the predatory skills or desire to hunt down a living, healthy cat.</p>
<dl>
<dt>There are, however, a few scenarios where a possum and a cat might interact:</dt>
<dt><strong>1. Competition for Food</strong></dt>
<dd>If a possum and a cat are both foraging in the same area, such as near an outdoor food dish, they may compete for resources. Possums may try to eat leftover cat food, but this does not indicate predation. The possum is simply scavenging what it can find.
<strong>2. Scavenging Behavior</strong></dd>
<dd>In very rare cases, a possum may be found eating a deceased cat. However, it is important to stress that this does not mean the possum killed the cat. As scavengers, possums will eat carrion, and if they come across a dead animal, including a cat, they may consume it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>This can lead to the misconception that possums hunt cats, but they are merely feeding on an already deceased animal.Possums live an average of 1 to 2 years but<a href="https://opossumsocietyus.org/general-opossum-information/">can do up to 4 years</a>, but don&rsquo;t kill them - mainly when you see their destructive habits.</li>
<li>This can lead to the misconception that possums hunt cats, but they are merely feeding on an already deceased animal.Possums live an average of 1 to 2 years but<a href="https://opossumsocietyus.org/general-opossum-information/">can do up to 4 years</a>, but don&rsquo;t kill them - mainly when you see their destructive habits.
<strong>3. Defensive Reactions</strong>
: If a cat and possum were to get into a confrontation, the possums instinct would not be to attack but to defend itself. Possums often employ a defense mechanism known as &ldquo;playing possum,&rdquo; where they feign death to avoid aggression from predators. In some cases, if a possum feels cornered, it may hiss, growl, or show its sharp teeth to scare off a potential threat, but it would not go on the offensive unless absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-possums-arent-a-threat-to-cats">Why Possums Aren&rsquo;t a Threat to Cats</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why possums dont pose a significant threat to cats:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Size and Strength</strong>: Adult cats are generally larger, faster, and stronger than possums. In a physical altercation, a healthy cat would likely come out on top, or at the very least, would be able to escape without serious injury.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Differences</strong>: Cats are predators by nature and tend to be territorial. On the other hand, possums are scavengers and generally prefer to avoid confrontation with larger animals. When faced with a cat, a possum is more likely to flee or try to scare the cat away rather than attack.</li>
<li><strong>Dietary Preferences</strong>: Possums have no real interest in hunting down and consuming large animals like cats. Their natural diet consists of smaller prey and scavenged food. While they may consume carrion if they find it, this is far different from actively seeking out and killing a cat for food.

</ol>
<h2 id="what-should-pet-owners-do">What Should Pet Owners Do?</h2>
<p>While possums dont pose a direct threat to cats, pet owners may still want to take precautions to minimize interactions between the two animals. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep Pet Food Indoors</strong>: Avoid leaving pet food outside, especially overnight, as it can attract possums and other wildlife.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Garbage Cans</strong>: Since possums are scavengers, they may try to get into unsecured garbage cans. Keeping lids tightly closed will discourage them from foraging in your yard.</li>
<li><strong>Supervise Pets Outdoors</strong>: While possums arent likely to harm your cat, its always a good idea to supervise your pets when theyre outdoors, especially at night when possums are most active.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Attractants</strong>: Possums are drawn to food sources, so removing things like fallen fruit, bird feeders, and compost piles can help prevent them from frequenting your property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the notion that possums eat cats is largely unfounded. While possums are opportunistic feeders and scavengers, their natural diet does not include live, healthy cats.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are more likely to forage for fruits, insects, and small animals or scavenge for dead animals. Interactions between possums and cats are usually driven by competition for food rather than predation.
Pet owners can reduce the likelihood of encounters by taking simple precautions, but overall, possums are not a significant threat to household pets.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe some chicken (plus chicks) and their eggs have recently disappeared from their coop. Recently, there have been some native opossums
*(Didelphis Virginiana) and dead chickens *
around - well, these are scavengers.
So, you&rsquo;re wondering really &lsquo;do possums eat chickens?&rsquo; Well, Yes, possums will scavenger and eat chickens (including fully-grown hens) and other easy food sources like chicks and eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The adult <a href="/posts/do-possums-eat-cats/">possum</a> weighs 4 to 15 lb and measures about 21 to 36 inches in length - about the size of your house-cat. They have 50 pointed and sharp teeth with a white mouth (&amp; face) with grey or white fur.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll also notice that they have a hairless tail, black eyes, and pink nose, and pointed faces.
To repel the possums, you may position ammonia-coaked rags near the chikcen coop or spray any of these rodent repellents&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Ammonia to Repel Possums&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="do-opossums-or-possums-eat-chickens">Do Opossums or Possums <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a> Chickens?</h2>
<p>As noted above, possums and opossums will attack and eat your chickens. So, YES, simply put, possums will eat chickens. Their strong teeth enable them to tear down prey&rsquo;s bones and flesh - including from dead animals and chickens.</p>
<ul>
<li>While uncommon, possumslike raccoons will eat mature hens(about 20 in a night since they are large &amp; intimidating) but may regularly prey on chicken eggs and their young chicks.
The omnivore animals largely eat and prey on small invertebrates - but if they are occupying the backyard gardens, the possums could hunt your chickens and eggs too -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-possums-eat-cats/">but the possums won&rsquo;t eat the cats</a>
or dogs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjSg16J1wyo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjSg16J1wyo</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-possums-steal-and-eat-chicken-eggs">Do Possums Steal and Eat Chicken Eggs?</h2>
<p>Ye
s, possums that will manage to sneak into the chicken coop will (or come across eggs) will eat the chicken eggs - but they&rsquo;ll also prey on adult chickens.</p>
<ul>
<li>My experience: One night I met a large possum in the chicken coop around the bird&rsquo;s nesting boxes.</li>
<li>We noted that the possum had returned and stolen eggs - we also found some of the eggs busted.
But will the possums eat raw eggs? Yes, they&rsquo;ll feed on raw eggs in addition to other foods like
protein dog kibble,
minced veggies,
calcium vegetables, chicken crockpot, and bones.
Also, what smells do the possum hate? Well, these animals won&rsquo;t love
ammonia - so I would recommend you pour some ammonia into that coffee container.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-stop-possums-from-killing-my-chicken">How to Stop Possums from Killing My Chicken?</h3>
<p><strong>1. Remove chicken or pet food�</strong>
Avoid leaving chicken or pet food lying around overnight. Such idle foods tend to attract the possums.</p>
<p>Put the chicken or pet food in some metallic (and air-tight ) containers - this will prevent the mother possum from nesting around and rearing their babies.</p>
<p>The possums and their younglings will eventually take over your spaces - and this will endanger you5r chicken as the adult possums will think that the food belongs to their babies.
<strong>2. Line the Chicken coop with 10-inch tin�</strong>
Line the chicken coop with some 10-inches tin to bar possums eating up the wood-� they won&rsquo;t attack the chicken easily.</p>
<p>So, lining up the chicken structures with tin inside and outside - this is because the possums won&rsquo;t chew on the tin.
<strong>3. Don&rsquo;t Leave Chicken Eggs overnight</strong>
Next, I caution against leaving the chicken eggs overnight in that coop.</p>
<p>This is because the scent of the egg
will attract predators including raccoon&rsquo;s
, skunks, and possums.
<strong>4. Place Mothballs and Ammonia�</strong>
Next, position some mothballs and ammonia (odour or stink) as these will help remove the possum from its hiding area.</p>
<p>So, pour the ammonia onto some coffee container and place a wick (towel or rag) that&rsquo;ll help disperse the stinking fumes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check locations that look like possum shelters and place the mothballs or ammonia
<strong>5. Pour Wolf or Fox Urine repel possums�</strong>
Skunks, raccoons, and possums won&rsquo;t get near that chicken coop or nearby hiding areas that have wolf or fox urine.</li>
<li>You may also use the fox-urine granules (Shake-Away) by the brand name as they&rsquo;ll repel and scare off the rodents and possums.
Besides, you may use human urine to repel the possums around the
garden or yard. Notably, the fresh urine will be bacteria-free and clean.
<strong>6. Set Possum Traps</strong>
Possum traps will also be a great addition to the feature in reducing chicken death and disappearance. Set up this device on areas you suspect possum frequent.</li>
<li>Some baits suitable for the possum trap includeapples, peanut butter, vegetables, berries, and fruit.
But remove these traps around the morning time to prevent catching other small pets or even your chickens.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcqgdEfsyQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcqgdEfsyQ</a>
<strong>7. Fencing�</strong>
Fencing around that yard or garden will also hinder possums from reaching your chicken.</li>
<li>Definitely, their strong teeth won&rsquo;t tear down that fence - but avoid chicken wires as they&rsquo;re too weak.
Further, don&rsquo;t allow drinkable water around your garden or yard as this will attract possums that may attack your chicken.</li>
<li>The chicken will be very vulnerable during the dark hours - while also the possums will also be active at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, do possums eat chickens? YES, possums will occasionally hunt and seat chickens in the backyard.</p>
<ul>
<li>But they&rsquo;ll more probably eat chicks, Bantams (small breeds), and eggs.</li>
</ul>

      <description>A bed bug infestation in your spaces may be</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bed bug infestation in your spaces may be
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4080563/">challenging to control</a>
; you&rsquo;ll require professional help and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-vacuum-for-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-cockroaches-eat-bed-bugs/)/">top-quality bedbug control equipment</a>
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">natural bed bug predators</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the ban of DDT and other synthetic pesticides some 40 years ago, bed bugs have been noted to make a major comeback.
The technique chosen may have different side effects and effectiveness. So, below I&rsquo;ve discussed the issue of &ldquo;do spiders eat bed bugs?&rdquo;
<strong>In summary, YES, most spiders (especially the Cobweb <a href="/posts/spider-bite-vs-bed-bug-bite/">spider</a> and Philodromid crab spider species) will eat bed bugs and all the insects that get trapped in their webs.�</strong>
<em>So, let&rsquo;s check the details!�</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs-what-spider-species">Do Spiders Eat Bed Bugs? What Spider Species?</h2>
<p>Well, maybe you should not get worried when you find that spider around the house - as they may actually help you not just control flies but also bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Philodromid and cobweb spider species are the two main species that are known to trap and eat bed bugs; these spider species are common all over America.
Despite that spiders will feed on bed bugs, it&rsquo;s impossible for these creatures to feast on all the bed bugs (in all life stages such as the
Baby Bed Bugs
).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-will-philodromid-crab-spidersfeed-onbed-bugs">1. Will Philodromid Crab Spiders�Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>The Philodromid crab spiders may be physically and in features similar to the crab (both front and rear); this is a very common spider species both in America and all over the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Philodromid (Thanatus flavidus) spider will mainly inhabit the outdoors but may sometimes get into the house.
These spiders will get into the house with the mission of hunting and eating those small insects including bed bugs. However, the phildromids will not employ webs to trap the bed bugs.</li>
<li>So, how do they catch the bed bugs? Well, the phildromids move faster than bed bugs and thus they&rsquo;ll hunt them down, inject some venom into their body and eat them.
The Philodromids are distributed all over the globe including Canada, North America, Asia, South America, Europe, and even Africa.
Since these spiders will take residence in the wild and the house, they&rsquo;ll hunt those many insects and flies by injecting venom into their bodies.</li>
<li>When the Philodromids aren&rsquo;t indoors (which is most of the time), these spiders will hide under grass and undergrowth in your garden or yard</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-will-cobweb-spiderfeed-onbed-bugs">2. Will Cobweb spider�Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>The Cobweb spiders will also be helpful in feeding on the bed bugs around your house; at least that&rsquo;s a positive use for the spiders that you fear.</p>
<ul>
<li>These Cobweb spiders will create their webs on the house corners and they&rsquo;ll use the structures to trap the various insects including bed bugs.
However, there are some cobweb spiders that are poisonous and hence we might not want their services in eating bed bugs around our houses.
Thus, I advise you get a professional spider or pest exterminator to check the type of cobweb spiders that are in your residence, yards, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-willjumping-spidersfeed-onbed-bugs">3. Will**Jumping Spiders�**Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>There are over 600o jumping spider species globally. The food they take includes crawling insects - both those that live outdoors or even indoors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, if the spiders are in the indoor spaces, they&rsquo;ll also feed on bed bugs among other insects.
If the jumping spiders are living in the outdoor spaces, they will feed on flies, grasshoppers among other insects.
The jumping spiders will mainly Hunt in the daytime since they have a great sense of sight.</li>
<li>These spiders can be found in those unique house corners where it will be difficult for one to notice them easily.
The jumping spiders may be considered to be slow spiders. Thus, they will eye their prey such as the bedbugs from a distance and jump to eat them.</li>
<li>The jumping spiders may even jump up to 30 times their body length and thus the witch many of the insects.
An interesting point that you will note is that the jumping spiders may also Hunt other spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-will-cellar-spiders-feed-on-bed-bugs">4. Will Cellar Spiders Feed on Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>So on the question of whether cellar spiders will feed on bedbugs, I am happy to note that these spiders, like other spiders above, will also eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>On their body structure, the cellar spiders look like the harvestman (<a href="https://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html">Daddy-Long-Legs</a>) but they have venom and also create webs.
To know whether you have them in your house you need to check any of their carcasses that may be on webs.
However, the cellar spiders will not chew bed bugs. They will simply inject venom into the body of the bedbugs and swallow them whole.</li>
<li>The bedbugs among other insects will be digested by the digestive juices that are found in the cellar spiders.</li>
<li>However, the cellar spiders and their webs sometimes get out of hand and you might need to control them.
For this, I recommend that you contact your local pest exterminators or get some certified technicians that will control
both the webs and the spiders
.
But most of the time you might not need to control this by the cellar spiders.</li>
<li>This is because these spiders will help you also control other insects including mosquitos, flies, or moths in the garage shed, yard, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-avoid-spiders-in-controlling-bed-bugs">Why Avoid Spiders in Controlling Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>In this section, I will outline reasons why you should avoid using spiders in controlling bed bugs in your spaces.
<strong>1. Spiders Feed on Many Insects</strong>
We&rsquo;ve noted that spiders can act as great natural predators to eat those spiders that are in your spaces.
However, it is also clear that spiders may not effectively reduce the whole bed bug population.
This is because spiders will not just feed on bedbugs but will consume a range of insects to satisfy their dietary needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, as you wait for the spiders to feed on their whole bed bug population, they will be elsewhere feeding on other insects.
Thus, the spiders will not significantly reduce bed bugs in your house.
<strong>2. Spiders are Feared�</strong>
The next issue in using spiders to control bed bugs is that spiders are generally feared by most homeowners.</li>
<li>So, it will be unimaginable that you&rsquo;ll keep so many spiders to control bed bugs in the house.</li>
<li>Finally, after controlling the bedbugs, you could have a major spider problem in your spaces.
Therefore, most of us will avoid spiders due to fear and also avoid creating a spider&rsquo;s problem in the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the spiders could also frighten those in your house as they&rsquo;ll generally hide around the coaches, sofa sets, and near your bed.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re not confident enough to be seeing spiders roaming around you may need to avoid them in controlling bed bugs.
<strong>3. Spider Webs are Unsightly�</strong>
Finally, you may notice that spider webs may make your spaces look unsightly and shaggy.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, most of us hate the job of removing the spider webs from various corners of our houses.
Therefore, if you hate the site and the work that comes with spider webs, you might need to exterminate them instead of using them as natural predators for the bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-other-predators-for-bed-bugs">Any Other Predators for Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>As an expert, I have to note that there are other natural predators that you can use to control spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, you must take into consideration that some of these predators may also the household pests.
First, I have to note that pets such as cats and dogs will only eat bed bugs by accident.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-lizards">1. Lizards</h3>
<p>Lizards such as geckos are notable predators that can eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike spiders, lizards are considered harmless and cute but may also eat most insects including bed bugs.</li>
<li>However, if you&rsquo;re not keeping the results as pets, you may need to check the lizard population as too many may be unpleasant.
A key disadvantage with the lizards, just like with spiders, is that you might need to keep too many of them, and finally, they&rsquo;re not removing the whole bed bug population.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cockroaches"><strong>2. Cockroaches</strong></h3>
<p>Some cockroach species, such as the German and the American (which are very common) are known to eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, spiders including the Oriental and the brown-banded species will eat many insects.</li>
<li>However, just like with the other natural predators, cockroaches have their large share of problems while controlling bed bugs.
For example, cockroaches will reproduce fast and hence leave you with another pest control issue.
Alternatively, you may need to use techniques and an appropriate pace that will control both the bedbugs and the cockroaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-pharaoh-ants">3. Pharaoh Ants</h3>
<p>Ant experts have concluded that the pharaoh ants are an appropriate species that we can use to target and control bed bugs.
One unique benefit is that ants may be used as a giveaway and hence they&rsquo;ll draw the experts to locations that bed bugs could be hiding.
Pharaoh ants are a major natural predator for bed bugs. Other species of arms that you can use include their fire ants and the Argentine ants.
However, a disappointing fact with these predators including ants is that they won&rsquo;t be effective to remove bed bugs.
These animals will mainly feast on bed bugs especially when the population is high but they won&rsquo;t make a major difference in controlling the bed bug population.
So, the major advantage is that you can use the bed bugs to pinpoint locations that bed bugs have burrowed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>In conclusion, spiders are considered as natural predators for bed bugs but using them may prove inefficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, the method could make you neglect professional help that can help reduce the bed bug population rapidly.</li>
<li>Also, bed bugs are creative creatures that will hide even in small crevices and cracks to stay off predators.
In fact, you might need a very large population of spiders to significantly reduce the bug bed bugs in your house.
Therefore, instead of using spiders to control bed bugs, using
professional spiders exterminators
may be the best option.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dietary choices in Islam are deeply rooted in the principles of halal (permissible) and haram (forbidden) as prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. These principles guide Muslims in their food selections, ensuring that what they consume aligns with their religious beliefs.</p>
<ul>
<li>In recent times, the question of whether it is halal to eat insects, including <a href="/posts/are-crickets-decomposers/">crickets</a>, has gained attention due to scientific interest in alternative protein sources and ethical concerns regarding sustainable food practices.
In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the intricate and nuanced
<a href="https://seekersguidance.org/answers/shafii-fiqh/what-insects-are-permissible-to-%5Beat%5D(/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/)-according-to-the-shafii-school/">halal status of consuming insects</a>
, drawing insights from Islamic jurisprudence, scientific research, and diverse opinions within the major Sunni Islamic schools of thought.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-halal-status-are-insects-including-crickets-permissible">The Halal Status: Are Insects, Including Crickets, Permissible?</h2>
<p><strong>In the general framework of Islamic dietary guidelines, consuming insects such as crickets is considered halal.</strong>
This conclusion is based on several factors, including the absence of explicit prohibitions in the Quran and Hadith regarding insect consumption such as
<a href="https://www.bugsolutely.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Fatwa-Consuming-Word-and-Cricket.pdf">grasshoppers</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, as with many aspects of halal dietary choices, the issue is more complex and nuanced than a simple yes or no answer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="islamic-schools-of-thought">Islamic Schools of Thought</h3>
<p>Among the four major Sunni Islamic schools of thought (Madhabs), there are differing opinions on the permissibility of eating insects:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Hanafi School:**Hanafi scholars generally hold the view that consuming bugs and insects is forbidden (haram).</li>
<li>**Maliki School:**Conversely, scholars within the Maliki school accept the consumption of insects, including crickets.</li>
<li>**Shafi&rsquo;i and Hanbali Schools:**Scholars from the Shafi&rsquo;i and Hanbali schools exhibit a nuanced stance, permitting the consumption of certain insects while prohibiting others. The specifics may vary among scholars within these schools.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5IL49FL9r0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5IL49FL9r0</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-role-of-source-and-preparation">The Role of Source and Preparation</h3>
<p>The halal status of insects hinges significantly on their source and how they are prepared. Just like any other food, insects must be sourced from reputable and halal sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>This ensures they are raised and harvested in compliance with Islamic principles - acccording to the<a href="https://www.isahalal.com/news-events/blog/eating-insects-halal">Islamic Services of America</a>.
Furthermore, proper hygiene and preparation techniques are vital to maintaining the halal status of insects. This entails avoiding cross-contamination with haram (forbidden) substances and adhering to appropriate processing procedures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-significance-of-intention">The Significance of Intention</h3>
<p>In Islam, the intention behind consuming any food carries great importance. Muslims are encouraged to have a sincere intention when eating, focusing on nourishment and gratitude for the sustenance provided by Allah. This principle extends to insect consumption as well.</p>
<h3 id="ethical-considerations">Ethical Considerations</h3>
<p>From an ethical standpoint, it&rsquo;s essential to acknowledge that insects are an integral part of the natural food chain. In many cultures worldwide, insects have been consumed for centuries, and they offer a sustainable protein source.
The environmental benefits of insect consumption, such as lower carbon footprints compared to conventional livestock, align with contemporary concerns about ecological sustainability.</p>
<h2 id="the-quranic-perspective">The Quranic Perspective</h2>
<p>The Quran does not explicitly mention insects as a forbidden food.
However, it does emphasize cleanliness and the avoidance of what is considered filthy or impure. This raises a thought-provoking question: What if insects, such as worms, are farmed in a clean and controlled environment?
For instance, Bombix Mori silkworms are cultivated in a controlled environment and are exclusively fed with green leaves from mulberry trees. This scenario prompts contemplation on whether insects reared in such conditions, devoid of impurities and contamination, could be considered halal.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-insights">Scientific Insights</h2>
<p>From a scientific perspective, insects, including crickets, offer several advantages as a source of protein. They are rich in protein, low in fat, and contain essential vitamins and minerals.
Additionally, insect farming demonstrates greater environmental sustainability compared to conventional livestock farming. This aligns with concerns about the ecological impact of food production.

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="q1-are-there-specific-guidelines-for-slaughtering-insects-in-islam">Q1: Are there specific guidelines for slaughtering insects in Islam?</h3>
<p>No specific guidelines for slaughtering insects exist in Islamic jurisprudence. Traditional slaughtering principles primarily apply to larger animals such as cattle, sheep, and poultry.</p>
<h3 id="q2-can-insect-based-products-be-considered-halal">Q2: Can insect-based products be considered halal?</h3>
<p>Insect-based products, such as cricket flour or protein bars, can be considered halal if they meet the same criteria as whole insects. This includes sourcing, processing, and avoiding cross-contamination with haram substances.</p>
<h3 id="q3-are-there-any-countries-or-regions-where-insect-consumption-is-more-common-among-muslims">Q3: Are there any countries or regions where insect consumption is more common among Muslims?</h3>
<p>While insect consumption is not widespread in many Muslim-majority countries, it is gaining popularity in some regions as people become more open to exploring alternative protein sources.
Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-crickets-good-or-bad/">Are Crickets Good or Bad?</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the question of whether it is halal to eat crickets and other insects is multifaceted and nuanced. While the Quran does not explicitly forbid their consumption, differing opinions exist among Islamic scholars, reflecting the diversity of perspectives within the Islamic community.
Ultimately, the permissibility of eating insects is contingent on various factors, including source, preparation, intention, and ethical considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>As individuals navigate this topic within their cultural and religious contexts, consulting with local religious authorities or scholars for specific guidance is advisable.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the consumption of insects offers a promising avenue for sustainable protein sources, aligning with the broader environmental and nutritional concerns of our time.
As we delve deeper into this complex issue, it becomes evident that the halal status of insects is not simply a matter of black and white but one that requires careful consideration and informed choices.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering which animals will eat bed bugs (Hemiptera), read on to get the details. But you might not want some of these
<em>natural bed bug enemies</em>
around your home - maybe geckos? or Ants?
<em>So, what animals or insects will eat bed bugs? Well, common bed bug killers include ants (fire, argentine, or pharaoh ants), masked hunters, centipedes, spiders, cockroaches, and lizards such as geckos.�</em>
<em>With mattress encasements for bed bugs, it&rsquo;s possible to watch for bed bugs and also reducing the possible hiding spaces in your box spring or mattress. The bugs undergo metamorphosis - from egg to nymph - it has no larval stage.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>NB: Cats and dogs won&rsquo;t eat bed bugs - maybe by accident but dogs mayassistin searching for bed bugs- canine scent detection.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Bed Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-animals-eat-bed-bugs---bed-bug-predators">Details: What Animals Eat Bed Bugs? - Bed Bug Predators</h2>
<h3 id="1-masked-bed-bug-hunter">1. Masked Bed Bug Hunter</h3>
<p>Some of the natural bed bug enemies might be dangerous to bring into your spaces - so it would be best to hire
professional exterminators
to control both the adult and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/baby-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/what-eats-bed-bugs/)/">ba</a>
by bed bugs
.
These Masked hunters are even described as assassin bugs that&rsquo;ll colonize areas that are dry and warm - your home will be an excellent destination. These flying bugs will measure roughly 17 - 22 millimeters (with some gray or brown).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqfXiJxwuvg&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqfXiJxwuvg&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
These
bed-bug
hunters will mainly hide around dust - the location where their nymph will form. They&rsquo;ll have that symbiosis association with pigeons and bats - which they take like their food.
The predator masked hunter will eat many insects and bugs such as bed bugs - but it&rsquo;s not advisable to introduce the masked hunter into the home as a portion of their subspecies may bring disease to humans.
Further, Masked hunters could bite humans when they consider that they&rsquo;re threatened. They&rsquo;ll cause a painful bite - comparable to a
snake bite
. Masked hunters could overrun your home - as advised by entomologists.
So, to both monitor or trap those nasty bed bugs, I recommend using some great
bed bug traps</p>
<ul>
<li>the red and black colors will attract the bugs.</li>
<li>In summary, the Reduvius personatus will feed on bed bugs - they&rsquo;re in multiple United States&rsquo; regions. Being nocturnal feeders, they&rsquo;ll attack the bed bugs as they emerge during the night.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cockroach">2. Cockroach</h3>
<p>Roaches
are common animals that you can use to fight those bed bugs in your residence. Cockroaches will mainly settle in the house around areas (the quiet places) like pantries, cupboards, and kitchens.
Roaches are effective bugs against bed-bugs but most people don&rsquo;t recommend them as the solution for bed bugs menace. Also, they&rsquo;ll inhabit sewers and other dirty places eating food, garbage, and junk - check
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">quality drain cleaners</a>
.
Further, roaches will love dirty homes as they&rsquo;ll easily get bread crumbs and leftover food - but they won&rsquo;t be super effective against bed bugs like foggers, traps, and
sprays
.
Despite that roaches will east the bed bugs, the rate of exterminating them is too slow while the bed bugs reproduce too fast. Also, roaches tend to bite humans and contaminate their food.
But as
natural scavengers
, roaches will eat both bed bug eggs and their adults - but it won&rsquo;t be possible to exterminate the entire bed bug colony since the
<a href="https://www.terminix.com/blog/bug-facts/how-fast-do-bed-bugs-spread/">bed bugs do fast reproduction.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In summary, roaches will predators on bed bugs - as they&rsquo;ll feed on most things that&rsquo;ll act like food - but they won&rsquo;t eat and eliminate the whole colony of bed bugs in the house.</li>
<li>Thus, it is better to employ chemical bed-bug killers or even engage a professional exterminator to clear the whole colony of bed bugs in your residence and house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-pharaoh-ants">3. Pharaoh Ants</h3>
<p>From all the ant species, pharaoh ants are the best documented to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-ants-kill-bed-bugs/">kill or attack bed bugs</a>
. Further, they&rsquo;ll draw attention or pinpoint (give away) the specific hiding areas of the bed bugs.
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_ant">Pharaoh ants</a>
consider bed bugs as a great diet - but they&rsquo;re threatening to humans. The ants will help manage large bed bug infestations - the 1/16-inch workers will be honey-colored.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okbWPcx-ug4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okbWPcx-ug4</a>
The ants are fast in reproducing - with a female laying roughly 400 eggs over its whole lifetime. They have distinct trails - and they need humid and warm conditions - and will love fats and sugars.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pharaoh ants eat many objects such as bed bugs (plus their eggs) and clothing but will also transmit illness.
Pharaoh ants look yellow-brown and are fast reproducers but will also spread diseases such as dysentery and salmonella - and thus you must be cautious when using them for bed bug control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-red-imported-fire--argentine-ants">4. Red-Imported Fire &amp; Argentine Ants</h3>
<p>Fire ants will inhabit sunny and warm areas - while the red-imported fire ants will measure about 1.6 mm - 5 mm. They are known to feed on telephone wires - specifically the rubber insulation.
Their excruciating and potent sting will kill most young animals including bed bugs. The ants&rsquo; alkaloid venom will leave white pustules and red bumps - these are very irritating.
On the other hand, Argentine Ants will measure roughly 2.2 mm - 2.8 mm - the invasive ants will inhabit home foundations, ground debris, and moist or damp mulch.
During the cool weather, Argentine Ants will get into cracks and gaps around your house to get shelter - but they&rsquo;ll also attack and exterminate bed bugs.</p>
<h3 id="4thanatus-flavidus-spider">4.Thanatus Flavidus Spider</h3>
<p>Thanatus flavidus (Philodromidae) is a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/">spider species that are effective in controlling bed bugs</a></p>
<ul>
<li>besides heat treatment, fumigation, and pesticides. They&rsquo;re native to Greece, Ukraine, and Russia.
The legend spider - as described by
<a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737831,00.html">Time Magazine</a>
, cleared the bed bugs infestation that was in Athens, Greece in 1929. They&rsquo;ll catch the bloodsuckers by their backs to remove their body fluids.
This Thanatus flavidus isn&rsquo;t toxic to humans - and hence are better suited to be in the house compared to kissing bugs, cockroaches, and ants. Other predator spiders include jumping spider, running crab spider, and the wolf spider.</li>
<li>Spider bites won&rsquo;t spread infections to humans and won&rsquo;t also invade your bedroom.
Bedbugs came back after the prohibition of synthetic DDT pesticides mainly in Europe and the United States - they attack warm-blooded animals and suck their blood.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-house-centipedes">5. House Centipedes</h3>
<p>The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutigera_coleoptrata">House Centipedes</a>
are hated by humans but they&rsquo;ll also eat many invertebrates including cockroaches, bed bugs, termites, and spiders.
The centipedes (that have a body that&rsquo;s yellowish-brown) are considered disgusting by most people but the house species will eat bed bugs.
These bugs have flattened and long bodies - that&rsquo;ll go up to1-1/2 inches in length. Each of their body section has a (thread-like, slender, and long) pair of legs - that have some white and black banding.</p>
<ul>
<li>The centipedes have well-developed and large eyes - they&rsquo;re beneficial and harmless to humans but will predate on insects, bed bugs, ants, silverfish, cockroaches,termites, spiders, andNo See Umstoo.
The thirty legged arthropods measure about 15 centimeters in body length - they&rsquo;ll hunt bed bugs and cockroaches. They might cause painful and poisonous bites - that look like bee bites.</li>
<li>House dust mites will also predate on bed bugs besides eating mold, animal and human skin flakes.
Further,
geckos will attack
and exterminate bed bugs - but the lizards will need special humidity, light, and heat conditions.</li>

<p>But how are roach eaters helpful? These bugs will trim down the roach population. They&rsquo;ll invade them in their ecosystem or natural habitat including
bugs in your backyard
.</p>
<h3 id="1-birds--the-avians">1. Birds / the Avians</h3>
<p>Despite that birds won&rsquo;t naturally feed on cockroaches, mainly because the roach adults, nymphs, and indoors will be hiding in moist, warm, and dark areas.
You&rsquo;ll get the roaches around the kitchen, bathroom, and attic - and hence they could be hiding from predatory birds. But birds will still pick them from around sewers - consult aviculturists.
But ensure to use expert bird keepers for your aviary birds to reduce chances of contamination or poisoning. Avoid using insecticides for roaches around feed mills and chicken farms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, to feed the roaches to the bird, ensure to fatten the bugs using roughage and vitamin C - including nutritious fruits and food.</li>
<li>Birds that will feed on roaches include Starlings (some species), Rail (Slaty-breasted Rail), Pheasants, Peafowl, Parrots (some species), Owls (Scops Owl), and Orioles.</li>
<li>Other birds include Mynas (many species), Makholas, Laughingthrushes, Junglefowl, Jays, Coucals, Babblers, Collared Kingfisher, and Oriental Magpie-Robin.

<li>Makholas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-dogs-and-cats">2. Dogs and Cats</h2>
<p>Normally, it is not okay to feed roaches to your cats and dogs. But roaches with poisonous insecticides (high dosage or through eating many roaches) are toxic to the pets.
Thus, keep cockroach
poisons and toxins off your spaces if you intend to feed roaches to your domesticated pets - dogs and cats or other household pets.
But indoor pets such as dogs and cats will also hunt to prey on different insects including roaches. But feral cats will equally roam the streets hunting birds, rats, and mice plus cockroaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats will achieve great satisfaction while hunting for roaches - but this may be disrupted by issues such as ingesting pesticides or digestive issues.
But why will dogs and cats hunt for roaches? Well, dogs and cats (including domesticated ones) will exercise their hunting impulses and the bug&rsquo;s hard-shelled texture ensure it&rsquo;s easy to capture.
Dogs and cats may also feed on roaches as a diet to help recover from diseases such as PICA or anemia. PICA could lead them to eat non-food objects due to psychological compulsion or boredom.</li>
<li>But the cats will<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/">snack on the roaches</a>- but may get choked or hurt in their throat due to the bug&rsquo;s exoskeletons that is hard - if not adequately chewed.
Despite that dogs and cats will actively hunt plus eat roaches, it&rsquo;s advisable to keep this away to reduce chances of digestive hazard or choking.
Will cockroaches be drawn to litter? Yes, roaches may get drawn to the litter depending on the litter box in question (like corn, beets, or wheat) - so they might not get new silica-based, sand, or clay litters.</li>
<li>On rodents including rats and mice, you may use monitoring traps (the sticky type) and this reduces the chances of entangling - leaving antennae, legs, and head.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3beetles">3.�Beetles</h3>
<p>Silverfish and beetles (and beetle larvae) are among the best roach predators - they&rsquo;ll hunt for the bugs and feed on them - plus controlling pests like the
<a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/7250.html">Hemlock-Woolly Adelgid</a>
.
But it&rsquo;s not advised to drop
<a href="https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/insects/predatory-beetles">predatory beetles</a>
into the house - these are the bugs that will feed on roaches; checkered beetles, lady beetles, rove beetles, and soldier beetles,�ground beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood-boring beetles (and their Larvae) will equally cause some amount of damage on your structures with carpet and wood, inside sheds and houses.</li>
<li>Beetles have mandibles that&rsquo;ll chew dead organisms, your cloth, carpet, and leather. They may damage things in the property including light-colored petals and plant-based fibers.
So, to control both the roaches and beetles, ensure to maintain clean surfaces - including water and food. Also, keep all the garbage airtight and locked.
Seal up all the cracks (on door frames) and openings that roaches and other insects may use to enter the house. Use natural repellents such as garlic, cucumber slices, and bay leaves for roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-opossums">4. Opossums</h3>
<p>Yes, Opossums are
<a href="https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/wildlife/the-virginia-opossum-our-only-native-marsupial/">extreme omnivores</a>
that will hunt and feed on roaches largely found in North America - they&rsquo;ll also eat garbage, worms, and roadkill.
They&rsquo;ll bear
<a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/marsupial/marsupial.html">semi-</a>
<a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/marsupial/marsupial.html">developed and small young ones</a>
that they&rsquo;ll hide in their belly pouches until when ready to move. The
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/group/opossums/">average-weighted Opossums (weighing 8-13 lbs</a>
) may also transmit rabies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, yes opossums can be beneficial organisms despite being catatonic-like and creepy animals - and are greatnature&rsquo;s exterminators.
Opossums will equally feed on frogs, insects, snails, slugs,
moles
, spiders, rats, and mice. They&rsquo;ll feast on those bothersome critters roaming your yard.
Further, Opossums love eating weeds (
check these weed killers
) and dead plants in your garden. These include the decaying or wilting plant matter as opposed to the fresh crops.</li>
<li>The opossum will equally feed on carrion (<em>dead creatures</em>) including decaying creatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-lizards">5. Lizards</h3>
<p>Lizards (including leopard geckos,
monitor�lizards
, and
bearded dragons
) will feed on roaches to acquire additional nutrition. Also, check with iguanas and geckos to control roaches.
Geckos and lizards will inhabit warmer areas (being cold-blooded animals) and some humans may pet them - but will also feast on cockroaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Geckos will maul on the roaches in the house but if the bugs are many I suggest chartering a professional as opposed to bringing more geckos.
Lizards (including iguanas or geckos ) will feed on insects including cockroaches.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRJboAboJfo&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRJboAboJfo&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
Other roach predators:</li>
<li>Some roach predators such as lizards, frogs, and toads will reach the bugs using their�sticky and long tongues - and ultimately crushing the roaches using the strong jaws.</li>
<li>Wasps also lay eggs that hatch into larvae that&rsquo;ll eat the roaches while also the spores of the entomopathogenic fungi will attack cockroaches to exterminate them within weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6frogs">6.�Frogs</h3>
<p>Frogs such as the popular
<a href="https://animaldiversity.org/site/accounts/information/Pseudacris_crucifer.html">Spring Peeper</a>
and
<a href="http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Lithobates_pipiens/">Northern-Leopard Frog</a>
will eat roaches - you&rsquo;ll find them in wet environments, lakes, and ponds.
Other frog species like the
<a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/whites-tree-frog">White&rsquo;s tree</a>
(found in New Guinea and Australia) will feed on roaches. They measure about 3 to 5 inches living in woodland or grassy areas - they&rsquo;re nocturnal.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXLafCdhw8&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXLafCdhw8&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
The dull-brown frogs will easily camouflage in the house and yard spaces and thus easily capture the roaches, small bugs, and also beetles for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the daytime, the Spring Peeper will hide from spiders, roaches (nocturnal bugs), flies, ants, and beetles but will capture them at night.
Further, toads (they&rsquo;re gray or dull brown) will slay roaches in the apartments and will mainly occupy backyards and places with shelter or water. But also red imported fire ants will eat roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-spiders">7. Spiders</h3>
<p>Spiders will eat cloth moths, mosquitoes, and roaches among other indoor pests. But you&rsquo;re required many spiders to effectively control a massive roach infestation.
But some homeowners will rear domesticated spiders and these
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-spiders-eat-cockroaches">take cockroaches</a>
for their food. Spider species including
<a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/spiders/giant_crab_spider.htm">Brown Huntsmans</a>
will also feed on roaches.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LiALjybcJA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LiALjybcJA</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Eating the adult roaches plus their larvae, the natural predators will ensure the bug population is checked. For instance, spiders and
some ants will prey
on bug roaches.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do bearded dragons eat? For a healthy life, it is important to feed your bearded dragon with a proper balanced diet. As a
smart omnivore
, this dragon either eats fruits, plant or animal products/ supplements.
Maybe you have come across a bearded dragon in the fields, zoo or probably own one and wonders what this reptile eats.
*So, what do Bearded Dragons Eat? Well, these reptiles feed on fruits such as tomatoes, apples, guavas, bananas, berries, figs, watermelons, mangoes, papayas, grapes, kiwi, apricots, pears or plums. *
<em>Bearded Dragons can also feed on vegetables/greens such as cabbages, celery, sweet potatoes, peas, green beans, courgette, butternut squash, okra, bell pepper, clover, turnip green, mustard green, coriander or collard/ kales.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-do-bearded-dragons-eat-7-tips">What Do Bearded Dragons Eat? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>Also, you can feed your bearded dragon with animals like crickets, earthworms, cockroaches, mealworms, waxworms, butter worms, Dubia roaches, silkworms, locust or king worms.</p>
<h3 id="1-fruits-eaten-bybearded-dragons">1. Fruits Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-tomatoes"><strong>a. Tomatoes�</strong></h4>
<p>Tomatoes are ideal meal for your bearded dragon
as they are the main source of vitamin A, which promotes good vision, skin development and protein synthesis.
However, it is dangerous to feed your dragon with excess of these fruits. Tomatoes contain oxalic acid (not easily excreted) which inhibits absorption of calcium needed for bone development.
Importantly, avoid feeding your pet bearded dragon with tomatos leaves, stem or flowers since these parts contain alkaloids such as solanine and tomatine, which negatively affects its health, and alter its physiological processes greatly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSH8c6AZ1k&amp;amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSH8c6AZ1k&amp;amp;t=2s</a></p>
<h4 id="b-apples"><strong>b. Apples�</strong></h4>
<p>Apples for bearded dragons
are an essential fruit as they contain 1% of vitamin A, 5% of Vitamin K and 14% of vitamin C, which enhances good vision and development. When feeding, it is necessary to peel the apples and slice them into sizable pieces that can be chewed and swallowed smoothly without chocking the lizard.
Apples have high-level Calories (95%) and 4g fibers per fruit that will boost your dragons energy and reduce indigestion problems.
Moreover, apples large quantities of magnesium and potassium minerals, which improves development and immune system of your Breaded Dragon.</p>
<h3 id="c-bananas"><strong>c. Bananas�</strong></h3>
<p>Peal your bananas and slice them into small pieces before feeding your bearded dragon if unripe. Most beardies wont eat banana peels unless they are grown under natural care.
You should feed your pet beardie with banana occasionally (maybe once or twice a month). Why because, bananas contain high levels of phosphorous that binds the calcium in the body (inhibits its intake) and thus may end up causing metabolic bone disease (calcium deficiency disease).</p>
<h3 id="d-berries"><strong>d. Berries�</strong></h3>
<p>Berries such as blackberries, raspberries, strawberries or blueberries can be fed to bearded dragon as they add extra water content to the blood stream. In addition, berries contain rich fiber-networks that improves digestion process - just like the
<em>cantaloupe.�</em>
Berries should be fed directly without peeling or mashing. However, wild picked berries should be cleaning thoroughly before feeding or you avoid them since they may contain toxins or harmful pests.
Blackberries are slightly harder and can be split for easier swallowing.�Blueberries should be given occasionally since they contain oxalates that binds calcium leading to metabolic bone disease.
<strong>e. Papaya and watermelon</strong>
Papaya and watermelon contain sugary taste that attracts your beardies for extra feeding. They have strong fiber content that prevents your beardie from constipation. You can also
feed your bearded dragons with cucumber
.
Though necessary, the excess water content found in these fruits may be dangerous as they may lead to over hydration and runny poo.�Therefore, it is recommended that you supplement these fruits with main meal and use them occasionally (twice per month).
<strong>f. Cherries and plums</strong>
Cherries have high level of potassium necessary for fluid balance regulation and blood pressure reduction. However, excess eating may lead to calcium inhibition and thus cherries should be fed once per week as a supplement to main meal.
Apart from water content addition, plums have fibers that help prevent constipation. It also contain iron, calcium and magnesium minerals necessary for growth and development.
It is necessary to remove the central seeds found in cherry and plum as they may cause impaction to your bearded dragon.
<strong>g. Grapes and mangoes</strong>
Grapes contains a high level of
calcium necessary for bone strengthening
. You will need to slice them into small pieces for easier swallowing.
Grapes also have fair level of oxalate and phosphorous thus should be supplemented with other main meal.�Like grapes, mangoes have fibers that help in digestion of your beardie.
The sugary component in mangoes makes them favorite to beardies. However, these fruits have high level of oxalate that binds and inhibits calcium absorption. They should, therefore, be fed twice or thrice per month and be supplemented with other main feeds.</p>
<h3 id="2-vegetablesgreenseaten-bybearded-dragons">2. Vegetables/Greens�Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-cabbages"><strong>a. Cabbages</strong></h4>
<p>Cabbages are essential meal for your bearded dragon
since they contain high-energy content (113kJ). They also contain strong fibers (prevents constipation), water and vitamin A, C, &amp; K necessary for growth and development.
Moreover, magnesium, iron, zinc and manganese minerals are also plenty - just like
broccoli for bearded dragons
. Notably, cabbages have high level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (2:1) which prevents occurrence of metabolic bone disease.
Ensure that green or red cabbages are thoroughly washed (to remove harmful chemicals or insects) and sliced into sizable pieces before feeding your bearded dragon.�Minimize use of purple cabbages since they are highly acidic.</p>
<h4 id="b-sweet-potatoes"><strong>b. Sweet potatoes</strong></h4>
<p>Normally,
bearded dragons dont eat
raw sweet potatoes. They may feed on peels, but occasionally. Actually, raw sweet potatoes are great challenge to chewing as most beardies swallow food as a whole.
However, these lizards will eat mashed or cooked sweet potatoes.
You can also supplement your beardies main meal with sweet potatoes vines, which should be chopped well. But
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrots/">bearded dragons can also eat carrots</a>
.
The relative level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (1:1.56) make it inappropriate to use sweet potatoes as daily meal.
Sweet potatoes vines have rich fiber networks that help in preventing constipation.</p>
<h4 id="c-green-beans-and-peas"><strong>c. Green beans and peas</strong></h4>
<p>Green beans and peas are ideal meal for your beardies as they contain high-energy content (131 kJ), vitamins A, C&amp;K as well as calcium, magnesium and iron minerals.
You can either feed your beardies with green pods or vines, which need to be chopped into small sizes first.�The relative calcium to phosphorous ratio of these greens means that they can only be used occasionally (once or twice per week.).
Beans or peas pods and vines have rich fiber content, which will help prevent your bearded dragon from indigestion problems.�You need to clean green peas and beans before feeding your pet bearded dragon so as to remove any toxic chemical or poisonous insects (fireflies).</p>
<h4 id="d-corianders-or-kales"><strong>d. Corianders or Kales</strong></h4>
<p>Corianders are rich in fibers, vitamin (A, C, E&amp;K) and minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, copper and phosphorous.�This occasion meal should be fed once per week. The relatively high calcium: phosphorous ratio means that overfeeding/excess use will lead to metabolic bone disease.
Kales are rich source of vitamin K and C as well as magnesium mineral. Kales also have thiamine that boost the immunity of your beardie. However, these green should only be supplemented with the main meal.
Notably, corianders or Kales are acidic in nature thus will alter the pH of digestive track leading to indigestion problems.</p>
<h3 id="3-animals--animal-products-eaten-bybearded-dragons">3. Animals / Animal Products Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-crickets-and-locusts"><strong>a. Crickets and Locusts</strong></h4>
<p>Crickets and locusts are staple insects to feed your bearded dragon. They have high level of proteins necessary for growth and development of your pet lizard.
Crickets and locusts also contain a large quantity of iron needed to strengthen teeth and bones. When feeding your beardie, remove the legs to allow easier swallowing and slice large locust where possible.
Baby beardies should only be fed with small locust/crickets (1-10 days).</p>
<h4 id="b-earthworm"><strong>b. Earthworm</strong></h4>
<p>Earthworms are major source of calcium for your bearded dragon. They are also fatty, thus should not be used as the main diet  too much fat accumulation will make your pet docile.
Purchase earthworms from vet approved vendors.
Avoid feeding your beardies with wild picked earthworms, as they may be poisonous.</p>
<h4 id="c-silkworm"><strong>c. Silkworm</strong></h4>
<p>Silkworms have soft bodies that make its swallowing easier. They contain high protein and calcium level needed for growth and development.
Bearded dragon (of any age) can be fed using silkworm as basic diet. Actually, you can use silkworms as main meal since they contain low-fat levels and are highly nutritious.
Silkworms also contain minerals such as magnesium, iron, sodium as well as vitamin B1, B2 and B3 that help boost immunity.</p>
<h4 id="d-mealworm"><strong>d. Mealworm</strong></h4>
<p>The tasty mealworms are known to be the most favorite of bearded dragons meals. They contain high fat level and thus should be used occasionally with other feeds such as fruits and vegetables.
Mealworms should be fed, mostly, to beardies aged 5-6 years.�Though Mealworms contains proteins and calcium, the quantity is quite low as compared to silkworms and earthworms.
<strong>e. Waxworm</strong>
Just like mealworms and silkworms, waxworms are fatty meals that should be fed to your bearded dragon occasionally in order to avoid abnormal weight accumulation, which may make it inactive.
Supplement 2-12 waxworms with vegetables and fruits per week. Waxworms are best diet for fattening young beardies.
<strong>f. Dubia roaches</strong>
Dubia roaches are the best insect meal for your bearded dragons as they contain 50% proteins (necessary for growth) and 61% moisture content. They have fairly soft bodies, which make your breaded dragons chew and digest them easily.
Unlike crickets, Dubia roaches have high calcium: phosphorous ration and thus enhance prevention of metabolic bone disease.�The top benefits of Dubia roaches is that they are quiet, never jump a lot, dont smell, live longer and are easier to breed.
What Can&rsquo;t Bearded Dragons eat? Which Foods Do You Avoid From Feeding Your Bearded Dragon?�Breaded dragons are very sensitive to some meals. You need therefore need to be very cautious of every diet you feed them. Avoid feeding your bearded dragon with some of the following meals:
<strong>g. Oranges</strong>
Oranges have high quantity of citric acid that causes throat discomfort and hurt burn. In addition, too much accumulation of acid content will inactivate digestive enzymes reaction leading to indigestion problems.
Oranges also have excess sugars that may cause tooth decay and excess diarrhea to your bearded dragon.
<strong>f. Avocados</strong>
Though avocados have good fiber content, they shouldnt be fed to bearded dragons since they contain excess oxalate that binds calcium and prevent its absorption in digestive track. This may lead to metabolic bone disease at long run.
**g. Rhubarb **
Rhubarbs have high content of oxalic acid and nephrotoxin that damages the kidneys of your bearded dragons when eaten. They also cause watery diarrhea and muscular weakness of beardie.
In case of consumption, seek immediate assistance from a veterinary.
<strong>h. Spinach and beet tops</strong>
These vegetables have chemical that binds calcium in the digestive system thus inhibiting it from absorption into the bloodstream. This, with time, may lead to calcium deficiency that cause metabolic bone disease.
<strong>i. Lighting insects</strong>
All insect that glow (produces light) such as fireflies should be avoided as they contain toxic chemical, which may poison/kill your bearded dragon when eaten.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-to-feed-on-bearded-dragons">What Not to Feed on Bearded Dragons</h2>

<h2 id="what-do-baby-bearded-dragons-eat">What do Baby Bearded Dragons eat?</h2>
<p>Baby Bearded Dragon will need a special care through proper feeding habit and health attention (use vet for regular medical check-up).
It is important to feed your baby beardie with more insect (especial Dubia roaches) than vegetables. Insects contains high protein level, fat and minerals that is needed at the young stage for growth and development.
Fruits such as grapes, peeled bananas and berries should be supplemented with mealworms or silkworms to boost the breadies feeding habit.
Though baby bearded dragon do eat vegetables, normally they climb on them when left in the cage. You will need to mix vegetables with some insects and monitor the feeding for 10-15 minutes.
Feed your baby beardie 1-2 times more that you feed adult ones. A baby bearded dragon aged 4-16 years should eat 40-60 insects per day. At juvenile stage, supplement their main diet with calcium and multi-vitamins powder to boost their growth and immunity.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-feed-a-bearded-dragon">How to Feed a Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>When feeding breaded dragon, it is necessary to follow the following steps and instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never feed your bearded dragon with dead insects. Always introduced live insect in the cage and allow the beardie to hunt  this create an exercise chance and boost its psychology.</li>
<li>All vegetable feeds should be washed thoroughly; freshly chopped and fed while wet water ease swallowing and reduces dehydration.</li>
<li>When feeding your bearded dragon, ensure that the chopped pieces are lesser than the space between its eyes.</li>
<li>Feed your bearded dragon for a given period (10-20minutes) and then carry the leftovers. Most of these beardies never stop eating - they may end up being docile because of excess feeding.</li>
<li>Peel and chop all fruit meals that you feed your bearded dragon.</li>
<li>It is necessary to mix vegetable/fruits with insects when feeding your bearded dragon to improve the nutrition level.
Never feed your bearded dragon directly into its mouth (this may cause health complication or impaction). You should, therefore, place all the meals in a dish to allow self-feeding unless the beardie is sick and needs medical attention.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded dragon can eat either fruits (apple, grapes, berries), vegetables (cabbages, green beans, corianders) or animals such as crickets, roaches, silkworms and locust.
Avoid feeding your beardies with avocados, rhubarbs, spinach, onions or fireflies as they negatively affect their health. Mix plant diet with animal feed to improve the nutritional value.
You will also need to supplement meals with calcium and multi-vitamin powder to boost growth and immunity of your bearded dragon further. Importantly, do not overfeed your dragon as they end up being docile.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Groundhogs are underground rodents that spend most of their lives in underground tunnels. They spend a lot of time burrowing and coming out in the open to look for food.� But what do groundhogs <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> to survive underground?</p>
<ul>
<li>**Groundhogs are omnivorous that&rsquo;ll eat both plants and animals. But in most cases, groundhogs eat vegetables, grass, fruits, alfalfa, clovers, soybeans, dandelion, and apples, and other garden plants. **</li>
<li><strong>Groundhogs tend to be more herbivorous than they are carnivorous though on some rare occasions, you will find them eating insects.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Repellents for Groundhogs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Groundhogs greatest enemy is the human being but their damages in the garden cannot be ignored. Related:

</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-do-groundhogs-eat">Details: What Do Groundhogs Eat?</h2>
<h3 id="1-plants-fruits-and-vegetables"><strong>1. Plants, Fruits and Vegetables</strong></h3>
<p>When we talk about groundhogs feeding on vegetables, plants, and fruits, what are their favorites? These fruits are apples, raspberries, hackberries, mulberries, and other types of berries.
Others are cloves, dandelions, alfalfa, maple leaves among others.
Before we can get to know what groundhogs eat, maybe we can have a brief understanding of what groundhogs really are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Groundhogs are basically rodents that belong to a family of squirrels known as marmots. They are also referred to as woodchucks or whistle pigs because of the whistling sound they make trying to warn the rest of incoming danger.</li>
<li>Groundhogs are found in the eastern and the central part of the United States. They like to live in woodlands and transitional areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cultivated-crops"><strong>2. Cultivated Crops</strong></h3>
<p>Groundhogs can also prove to be disastrous on cultivated crops like lettuce, corn, legumes, soybeans, broccoli, peas, and others
It is mostly these cultivated crops that will capture a farmers interest in eradicating the groundhogs. This is because of the damage they do to the crops and also to the garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>But even so, they spent most of their time underground burrowing and looking for food. Their tunnels can go as deep as 6 ft. under and can stretch up to 25 ft. but with multiple entrances. These burrows are where they call home and even reproduce from these places.
Though groundhogs are omnivorous, they tend to feed more vegetables and fruits, especially from our gardens. They will cause damage as they burrow through the garden leaving all your plants dead and weathering.
Apart from the vegetable, groundhogs will also destroy your carrots and other cultivated crops. For a better understanding of the groundhogs, we can break down their diet into different categories.

<h3 id="3-animals-insects-and-pests-">**3. Animals, Insects, and Pests **</h3>
<p>It is rare to find groundhogs feeding other animals and pests but when available, they dont hesitate to eat them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some of the delicacies that groundhogs eat. Crickets, snails, bugs, grasshoppers, bird eggs, juvenile birds among smaller animals.
However, the groundhog&rsquo;s diet is also greatly affected by seasons and daily weather. This is because weather directly affects the food that is available for the rodents.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-groundhogs-diet-during-seasons">A Groundhogs Diet during Seasons</h2>
<h3 id="1-spring-and-summer-">**1. Spring and summer **</h3>
<p>These two seasons there is plenty of food and groundhogs have the opportunity to enjoy whatever they want. They feed on their favorite vegetables, fruits, and cultivated crops.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also feed on grasshopper snails and also other insects that are available.
During this season, they feed either in the morning or the evening hour and spend the rest of the daytime hours hiding underground.

<h3 id="2-autumn-">**2. Autumn **</h3>
<p>In this season, things start changing and food start becoming scarce and groundhogs turn to insects and other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to their limited options, they also eat tree backs and leaves and a supplementary.</li>
<li>Additionally, it is this season that the groundhogs get an opportunity to eat lots of protein from the animals and insects too.
This is the reason they start storing food on the burrows as they prepare for the winter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-winter-">**3. Winter **</h3>
<p>This is an inactive stage for the groundhogs and they are not so much involved in food hunts.
They live in the tunnels and feed on the food in the store. In this period they fed less as compared to other seasons to save on energy and food.

<h2 id="how-to-protect-your-garden-from-groundhog">How to Protect Your Garden from Groundhog</h2>
<p>Groundhogs love to live where there is woodland and at the edges of forested areas. They will occasionally come out of the tunnels into our gardens to look for a look. As I said, they like feeding on cultivated crops.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can really be a nuisance on your farm but there is always a way to tame them.</li>
<li>Timely harvesting. If you want to avoid losses and damages done by groundhogs, ensure your crop is harvested on time.</li>
<li>Groundhogs also love eating the legume and cloves when they are natured but timely and proper harvesting will have them lose the most of reaping where they have not planted.
Using peppermint on the crops. Pepper and groundhogs are like water and paraffin, they dont mix. Therefore if you use it on the crop or pour around the border, this will be a nice way of keeping them off. Afterward, you can wash off the pepper, if you are not a fan.
Erecting a wall around your garden. This will help secure their entry into your garden to cause destruction. To be on the safer side, you need at least a wall of 3-4 ft. high where the groundhogs cannot hump.
Using repellents. There are available in most retailers. You can use the electronic pest repellent or a normal groundhog repellent.
Removing logs within your garden will stop attracting them. Like earlier mentioned, they like to live around woody areas and this will serve the same purpose.

<p>What do groundhogs eat? They are omnivorous but have a high preference for vegetables, fruits and plants as compared to animals, insects and pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of their nature to burrow and live underground, and fear for human beings, they like to come out and feed either in the evening or in the morning.</li>
<li>Their feeding pattern and diet is also greatly affected by weather patterns and will hide food in the tunnels for the winter season.
That said done, they are a great threat to our farming activities and measures should be applied to ensure their damage is controlled.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opossums are omnivores, meaning that they <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> both plants and animals - like humans. But really, what do opossums eat? Opossums need a balanced diet of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to maintain good health.
<em>A natural diet for an opossum would be lots of insects (insects are high in protein), small mammals (high in fat), and the occasional fruit or nut (high in carbs). They need a very high calcium diet (which can be found in plant products).�</em>
<em>In captivity, opossums/ possums eat different foods including vegetables and dog food. But in summary, their diet can be leafy greens (like kale &amp; spinach), grains (like oats &amp; rice), and fruits (like oranges &amp; apples).�</em>

<h2 id="possum-diet-what-do-opossums-eat">Possum diet; What Do Opossums Eat?</h2>
<p>Virginia possum is the most common possum (among the over 60 possum species) as it&rsquo;s a wild scavenger. The opossums will eat during the night and dawn hours - they are nocturnal animals.</p>
<h3 id="1-opossums-eating-mice-roach-and-ants-">**1. Opossums Eating Mice, Roach, and Ants **</h3>
<p>Opossums can be beneficial as they&rsquo;ll feed on those annoying rodents and pests - including mice,
moles
, roach, and ants. The possum menu varies because they&rsquo;ll feed on different parasites!
The opossum is a scavenger - so they&rsquo;ll eat insects (e.g., bees), small reptiles (e.g., snakes) as well as plant material like fruits or leaves from trees. They also will consume bird&rsquo;s eggs if available.</p>
<h3 id="2-do-opossums-eat-plants">2. Do Opossums Eat Plants?</h3>
<p>Opossums will eat plants and nuts - but this is not their primary food source. The animals, despite being an omnivore (eat meat), they are really more herbivores.
They need a lot of calcium in their diet; it&rsquo;s needed to help form bones or teeth, but opossum mothers pass on calcium-rich milk while nursing the babies until weaning around six weeks old.
The animals also consume small amounts of grasses as well as leaves which they&rsquo;ll find near water sources. They also consume plant material like fruits or leaves from trees.
Any insects they happen to come across while foraging is then consumed too as well. The animal&rsquo;s diet changes seasonally, depending on what food sources are available (e.g., more fruit when there are different varieties of it).
**3. Eat Dead Weeds and Plants **
Opossums will also eat dead plants and weedy vegetation - this gives them a high quantity of calcium in their diet to maintain bone density. They&rsquo;ll feed on the plant matter that is decaying - as opposed to the well-nourished plants.
Consumption of animals will result in poor quality meat due to the high levels of uric acid which causes arthritis. Opossums do not produce an enzyme called uricase, so this substance builds up more quickly than other mammals such as dogs.
The same applies if the opossum consumes insects with hard exoskeletons or bones (e.g., bees). These types of foods may cause stomach ulcers and reduce calcium absorption for the animal.</p>
<h3 id="4-opossums-feed-on-carrion-">**4. Opossum&rsquo;s Feed on Carrion **</h3>
<p>Opossums are nocturnal omnivores - they&rsquo;ll feed on a variety of plant and animal matter (including carrion). They&rsquo;ll also eat roadkill and other
*dead animals that you find on the road or in the wild. *
Opossums have an excellent sense of smell and can find food in areas where other animals are unable to. This is because they will eat anything, no matter how rotten it may be - this includes bones, hair, fur, or teeth.
Insects that Opossums Eat: Spiders (dead) Termites Wax worms Beetles Ants Grasshoppers Crickets Fleas Caterpillars Slugs Moths Earthworms Butterflies
The opossum&rsquo;s low-quality meat doesn&rsquo;t affect its ability to digest the insects listed above well as their tough exoskeletons don&rsquo;t seem to
*bother them too much. *</p>
<h3 id="5-what-do-possums-eat-in-the-garden-insects">5. What do possums eat in the Garden; Insects</h3>
<p>What do possums eat from my yard? Opossums feed on a variety of food sources including meaty foods (rodents) such as squirrels or mice to more plant-based fare consisting of berries that grow wild in woodlands or forested areas.
A possum&rsquo;s diet is omnivorous. Possums like eating dead animals as well as vegetables; such as tomatoes and potatoes. They have a variety of food in the garden, including; dead animals, snakes, toads, rodents, garden slugs, and pests.
Insects that opossums generally consume include spiders (dead), termites, wax worms, beetles ants, grasshoppers, crickets, fleas, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, earthworms, butterflies, slugs, frogs, and lizards.
Insects are high in calcium and protein. They will eat any bugs they can find in the garden, like; ants, spiders (dead), slugs, frogs, termites, and beetles.
<strong>6. Do the Eat Snakes</strong>
Do possums eat snakes: Yes! The opossum has some blood protein that makes them safe from the snake&rsquo;s venom- and thus they tend to eat snakes.
The opossums are not bothered by the snake&rsquo;s venom - and so they will consume a rattlesnake, toads and thus save themselves from death by snakebite. The animals will eat snakes&rsquo; just like they do with frogs or slugs.
In fact, scientists are delivering and anti-venom for use on humans - taking advantage of the special feature of the opossums&rsquo; blood. Ty these

<h3 id="7-opossums-will-eat-garbage"><strong>7. Opossums will Eat Garbage</strong></h3>
<p>The animals will go through the trash bin and eat garbage if they are hungry. Despite that the Opossums will hunt down the household pests (free pest control) - it can get messy when they ransack the garbage area.
They are attracted by the garbage smell, and they will drink milk, juice, or soda if it is available. But this can be a problem when the opossums run down the garbage bins and bags to scatter the trash all over your yard as they look for food scrapes.
Opossums love garbage disposals; just like raccoons and they&rsquo;ll do what it takes to get their paws on a tasty meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums are opportunistic feeders, meaning they will eat whatever is readily accessible - for example if there&rsquo;s food spilled over the side of a garbage can, an opossum will climb up and fetch it so long as he or she doesn&rsquo;t encounter too much danger in doing so.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;ll scavenge through your trash cans at night looking for any edibles that may have been thrown out from dinner preparations earlier in the day (garbage disposals do not deter them).
Garbage contains various items including pet foods that can be eaten by opossums - but you must also

.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-opossums-can-eat-fruit-and-vegetables">8. Opossums Can Eat Fruit and Vegetables</h3>
<p>The opossum will also consume fruit, vegetables, nuts, berries, and eggs. Some of the vegetation that they&rsquo;ll eat includes corn kernels, pecans, apples, or beans - but not all possums are vegetarians.
They&rsquo;re omnivores so these animals can be either plant-eating or meat-eating; it is simply a matter of what&rsquo;s available to them. This means an Opossum may go out into your garden looking for tomatoes if you have plants in there&ndash;but then come back inside when he sees some bacon cooking on the stove!
They are attracted to fruit trees because of the availability of food - but there may not be a lot left on the ground once they&rsquo;ve eaten what was within reach.
They eat apples, oranges, grapes, figs, and persimmons as well as blackberries that have fallen from vines into overgrown bushes near their homes.
There have also been reports of opossums eating fruits with high sugar content such as peaches and plums - which can cause diarrhea in other animals who forage at commercial fruit bins (especially pigs).
This scavenging animal has learned to adapt its diet over time as conditions change because their environment changes too.</p>
<h3 id="9-pet-food-can-make-opossum-diet">9. Pet Food can Make Opossum Diet</h3>
<p>Cat or dog food is something Opossums would eat on their own if left to scavenge, but it is also food that can provide them with the nutrition necessary to survive in captivity and will sustain them during rehabilitation when in need of supplemental feeding.
Opossums will eat
<a href="http://agrilifecdn.tamu.edu/txwildlifeservices/files/2016/08/Opossum.pdf"><strong>pet food</strong></a>
in urban areas, particularly when left outside the homes - particularly since there is not much roadkill and wildlife to forage. So, these animals will prowl around your property at night hunting for pet food.</p>
<h3 id="10-what-wont-opossums-eat">10. What Won&rsquo;t opossums Eat?</h3>
<p>Outline the possum menu: Outlining what opossums eat is just as important as what they do not consume! Here are some foods that Opossums Don&rsquo;t or Won&rsquo;t Eat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corn on the cob (they don&rsquo;t have teeth)</li>
<li>Dog feces (it might contain worms if it has been left out in rain)</li>
<li>Human corpses from cemeteries (again because of possible worm infestation). They do however feast on roadkill! What Do Possums Eat Bugs? The possum tends to go through periods of activity at</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its very discouraging when you use the commercial as well as DIY bed bug solutions but still have bed bugs crawling in your house.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could be wondering whether bed bugs have natural predators which can used to control their population. So, What eats bed bugs?
<strong>If you need a quick answer, bed bugs have many natural predictors that will readily kill and eat them. For example, spiders, cockroaches, masked hunters, house centipedes - Some are household pests.�</strong>
So, lets get started!</p>
<h2 id="what-eats-bed-bugs">What Eats Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the use of natural predators will not have a significant effect on the bed bug population.</p>
<p>This is because natural predators have other sources of food and will therefore not go hunting for bed bugs. In addition, bed bugs reproduce rapidly. So, its difficult for predators to wipe them out.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-masked-hunter">1. The Masked Hunter</h3>
<p>The masked hunters have been characteristically named the masked bedbug hunters because of their tendency to hunt and feed on bed bugs.</p>
<p>Standing at between 17 and 22 mm long, masked hunters are non-native to the United States, but have spread across many states.</p>
<p>Their color ranges from dark brown to black and have wings for flying. Masked hunters typically inhabit warm places. In cold areas they live indoors, where they feed on bed bugs, house arthropods among other small creatures.</p>
<p>You are likely to see masked hunters in areas inhabited by pigeons and bats. This is because pigeons and bats harbor bed bugs and other creatures that make their diet. Though masked hunters feed on bed bugs, you shouldnt imagine of having them in your house!</p>
<p>Theyll bite even humans, especially around the mouth. Thats why they are sometimes called the kissing bug. Their bite is as painful as a bee sting.</p>
<h3 id="2-cockroaches">2. Cockroaches</h3>
<p>Roaches are very fond of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-cockroaches-eat-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/)/">eating bed bugs and their eggs</a>
. In fact roaches will eat anything from food crumbs, wood, paper, glue, trash, the list is endless.</p>
<p>Standing at between 1 and 3 inches long, roaches outsize bed bugs and can move very fast, making it easy to run after the bed bugs. However, not all roaches eat bed bug. The most common bed bug eating roaches include the American roach, The German roach and the oriental roach.</p>
<p>Although cockroaches can eat a great deal of bed bugs, therere good reasons for not relying on them to eradicate bed bugs in your house. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs reproduce more rapidly than roaches. Thus theyll grow quickly to replenish their population.</li>
<li>Roaches are pesky pest you dont want to have around. Apart from causing a lot of mess in your house, they can be possible carriers of diseases like salmonella.</li>
<li>Cockroaches are difficult and expensive to get rid of.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-spiders">3. Spiders</h3>
<p>Spiders are
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/">natural predators of bed bugs</a>
, mosquitoes, flies and many other small creatures. Some spiders make webs in different corners of the house to trap and eat small creatures that crawl or fly nearby.</p>
<p>Others like the Philodromid Crab Spiders are swift enough to track and run after the bed bugs.�Although some spiders are poisonous, many of them are naturally harmless and will feed on most of the nagging house pests including bed bugs.</p>
<p>Spiders that are known to eat bed bugs include, the Philodromid Crab Spiders, Cellar spiders, jumping spider and the Cobweb spider.</p>
<p>Usually, spiders dont chew their prey. Instead, they paralyze their prey and consume it with their digestive juices.</p>
<p>Similar to other natural predators, spiders will neither be a good option for eradicating bed bugs. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiders eat a host of other insects. So, they wont go hunting for bed bugs in your house.</li>
<li>Though usually harmless, spiders are scary to have around.</li>
<li>Their cobwebs make your house untidy</li>
<li>Some spiders are poisonous</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-ants">4. Ants</h3>
<p>Many ant species love sweet foods like honeydew but will also
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-ants-eat-bed-bugs/">ants feed on small creatures including bed bugs</a>
to add protein to their diet.</p>
<p>The most common bed bug eating ants include the pharaoh ant, fire ants and the argentine ant. But the pharaoh ant has been documented to be especially notorious for eating bed bugs.</p>
<p>However, given the elusive nature of bed bugs, ants will have a hard time getting them. So you expect that ants will not significantly reduce the bed bug population.</p>
<p>In addition, most ants prefer to feed on carcasses rather than hunting down their prey.�Another limitation for using ants to eradicate bed bugs is that they reproduce rapidly just like the bed bugs.</p>
<p>So, in a matter of time, you could have an ant infestation which will need extra costs to eradicate.</p>
<h3 id="5-house-centipedes">5. House Centipedes</h3>
<p>House centipedes are natural predators for most household pests including roaches, spiders, moths, bed bugs among other small creatures.</p>
<p>Standing at between 5 and 150 mm long and with between 15 to 175 pairs of legs, these arachnids are very good at hunting.</p>
<p>Their rather flat configuration allows them to get through tiny spaces or cracks where bed bugs usually hide and breed. Plus they can move swiftly compared to bed bugs</p>
<p>Although centipedes have a good chance of feeding on bed bugs, you will need a host of them to have any impact on the fast growing bed bug population.</p>
<p>However, having too many centipedes crawling around the house can be very irritating. Furthermore, they can bite humans in defence.</p>
<h3 id="6-lizards">6. Lizards</h3>
<p>Lizards are natural predators of insects including bed bugs. Their diet is essentially composed of insects and arachnids. Thats why lizards hang around places infested with insects such as lavatory, kitchen and store house.</p>
<p>Luckily, lizards are harmless and some of their species are usually kept as pets. But again you will need a host of lizards to eradicate the bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>A large number of lizards can be quite disturbing. Plus their body size prevents them from running after bed bugs in narrow spaces where they hide most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="can-natural-predators-help-eradicate-bed-bugs"><strong>Can Natural Predators Help Eradicate Bed Bugs?</strong></h2>
<p>You have seen that therere many natural predators that can be used to feed on bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>Although these predators can eat a significant population of bed bugs, they cant be relied on to eradicate the bed begs. Compared to other bed bug control methods, natural predators have a number of limitations. These include:</p>
<h3 id="1-cannot-eliminate-entire-bed-bug-population">1. Cannot Eliminate Entire Bed Bug Population</h3>
<p>As you have noticed, most of the predators feed on several other creatures apart from bed bugs. That means, they dont go looking for bed bugs in their hiding places.</p>
<p>Predators feed on bed bugs that come in the open. Therefore, they cannot significantly reduce the number of bed bugs in your home.</p>
<h3 id="2-bed-bugs-reproduce-and-spread-rapidly">2. Bed Bugs Reproduce and Spread Rapidly</h3>
<p>Compared to their predators, bed bugs breed and multiply rapidly. On average, an adult can lay up to 12 eggs every day or 500 eggs in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Thus, it doesnt take long before a few bed bugs grow and become an infestation. If you rely on natural predators, bed bugs will breed quickly and overwhelm them.</p>
<h3 id="3-youll-be-surrounded-by-too-many-pests">3. Youll Be Surrounded by Too Many Pests</h3>
<p>In order for natural predators to have any impact on the bed bugs in your house, you need to have enough of these creatures.</p>
<p>This means that youll be surrounded by a host of other creatures like roaches, spiders, centipedes, masked hunters among others.</p>
<p>Most of these predators are pesky pests that will wreak havoc in your house on top of your bed bug menace.</p>
<p>Some of them are carriers of diseases such as dysentery and salmonella. Others will destroy your property and make your house very untidy.</p>
<p>You might not escape bits from predators like spiders, masked hunters or centipedes. Whats more, bed bugs hide in narrow spaces inside mattresses and sofa set. You definitely dont want these creatures around these places.</p>
<h3 id="4-natural-predators-cannot-control-infestation">4. Natural Predators Cannot Control Infestation</h3>
<p>Usually, bed bugs breed in difficult-to-reach areas. So, it would very hard for predators to feed on their eggs and larvae.</p>
<p>In addition not all of the predators mentioned above will feed on bed bug eggs. Thus, natural predators cannot be used to prevent bed bugs from breeding</p>
<h3 id="5-cost-of-eradicating-natural-predators-is-high">5. Cost of Eradicating Natural Predators is High.</h3>
<p>If you introduce natural predators to feed on bed bugs you will be creating another pest problem in your house. Similar to bed bugs, many of these predators reproduce rapidly, meaning they can easily become an infestation.</p>
<p>The cost of eradicating these predators is also high. Even worse, some predators like roaches can be as hard to eradicate as the bed bugs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Although natural predators can be used to feed on bed bugs, they are not reliable methods for eradicating an infestation.</p>
<p>You can however use the available commercial bed bug treatments or apply the do-it-yourself procedures to get rid of bed bugs in your house.</p>
<p>You can use chemical sprays such as permethrin, encasements and diatomaceous earth among others.</p>
