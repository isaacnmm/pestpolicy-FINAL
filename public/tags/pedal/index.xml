<p>Desirable Delay Pedal features - Right off, I have to state that the analog vs digital question will be the most significant consideration youll have to make while shopping for the guitar Delay Pedal.</p>
<p>This is in addition to considering cost, size, and quality of the delay pedals for guitar. Building from its simplicity, the digital delays were innovated to extend beyond the basic controls.
So, which is which: analog or digital delay pedals for guitar? Well, the analog or digital consideration is related to circuitry that produces the delay.
**Analog Delays - **
Analog Delays came during the 1970s when many of the pedalboards had an analog reverb and delay. As its name suggests, an analog delay employs the analog circuitry top creates its delay effect.</p>
<p>But what is unique about the analog delays over the digital delays? Well, analog delays have some unique features that would be difficult to get with the digital delays. For example, analog delays will give you a highly organic tone and simple basic effect.</p>

<p>**Digital Delay - **
Compared to the analog delays, the digital delay allows sharp precision at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>Further, digital delays have different modes that enable improved room to create an amazing tone with the guitar. Notably, digital delays re controlled though some pure logic from computer chips.</p>
<p>Digital Delay will not have sound coloration like the analog delay and it more flawless since it is algorithmic in nature. Depending on the guitarists requirements, theyd want to choose the digital delay because its more versatility and it produces longer delay times. Therefore, its possible to process the delays with different effects such as tap tempo and reverse echo.</p>
<p>However, with the analog delays, replaying the effect would lead to imperfections and coloration. Further, analog delays tend to produce shorter delay times compared to digital delays.</p>

<p>**So much of that, which is which analog or digital delay? - **
Ultimately, the debate of the choice of analog or digital delay finds itself to the rig you have and your personal taste.</p>
<p>Notably, the digital delay is favored by guitarists for its
attractive additional features &amp; higher versatility while the analog delay is best for simplicity, warmth, and quality.
Therefore, for a dirty signal and when you need long delays, the digital delay would be effective since it wont incorporate unwanted surprises in each repeat.</p>
<p>However, feeding distorted or thick sound to the analog delay pedal could lead to the reproduction of harmonics at each repeat and hence lead to poor sound outcomes.
