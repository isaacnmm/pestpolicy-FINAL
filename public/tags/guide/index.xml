      <description>A friendly, real-talk guide to understanding the difference between 2.1 and 5.1 soundbars. I&amp;#39;ll help you decide which audio upgrade is actually worth it for your home.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, the speakers built into your gorgeouss new TV are&hellip; well, they&rsquo;re terrible. The sound is often thin, flat, and the moment a movie has a quiet line of dialogue followed by a loud explosion, you&rsquo;re scrambling for the remote. I&rsquo;ve been there, and it&rsquo;s frustrating.</p>
<p>The great news is that a <a href="/posts/are-soundbars-worth-it/">soundbar</a> is the easiest way to fix this. But when you start shopping, you&rsquo;re hit with a confusing wall of numbers: 2.1, 5.1, 7.1.2&hellip; what does it all mean?</p>
<p>I want to cut through the jargon for you. For most people, the choice boils down to two main options: the practical <strong>2.1 soundbar</strong> and the immersive <strong>5.1 soundbar</strong>. Having set up both types in different homes, I can tell you they offer vastly different experiences. Let&rsquo;s figure out which one is the right fit for you.</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-the-real-difference">So, What&rsquo;s the Real Difference?</h3>
<p>Forget the technical specs for a moment and think about it like this:</p>
<p><strong>A 2.1 system is like being at a great concert.</strong> You have two main speakers (left and right) giving you a fantastic stereo image, and a powerful subwoofer that lets you feel the kick drum and bass in your chest. It’s a huge, immediate upgrade that makes everything sound fuller and richer.</p>
<p><strong>A 5.1 system is like being <em>in</em> the movie.</strong> You still have the front left and right speakers and the subwoofer, but now you add a dedicated center speaker just for dialogue, plus two more speakers that go behind you. When a helicopter flies overhead on screen, you&rsquo;ll hear the sound travel from the front of your room to the back. It’s about creating an immersive, three-dimensional bubble of sound.</p>
<h3 id="the-case-for-the-21-simple-powerful-and-practical">The Case for the 2.1: Simple, Powerful, and Practical</h3>
<p>The 2.1 soundbar is the hero for most households, and for good reason. This is the right choice if you find yourself nodding along to this: you want dramatically better sound without a lot of fuss or expense. You live in a small or medium-sized room, maybe an apartment, where running wires for extra speakers just isn&rsquo;t practical. You primarily watch TV shows, YouTube, or listen to music, and while you want it to sound good, you aren&rsquo;t necessarily trying to replicate a full cinema. The beauty of the 2.1 is its simplicity. You plug it in, place the subwoofer nearby, and within minutes you get that &ldquo;aha!&rdquo; moment where you can finally hear everything clearly and feel the satisfying rumble you&rsquo;ve been missing.</p>
<h3 id="the-case-for-the-51-bringing-the-movie-theater-home">The Case for the 5.1: Bringing the Movie Theater Home</h3>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re a true movie buff or a serious gamer, the 5.1 system is where the magic happens. This is for you if your idea of a perfect evening involves dimming the lights and getting lost in a blockbuster. The biggest, most underrated feature is the dedicated center channel. It anchors all the dialogue to the screen, making voices crystal clear even when the action scenes get chaotic. The rear speakers add a layer of immersion that a 2.1 system simply can&rsquo;t touch—hearing footsteps creep up behind you in a horror movie or the whoosh of a spaceship flying past the screen is a genuine &ldquo;wow&rdquo; experience. It requires a bit more setup and a larger room to really shine, but for that truly cinematic feeling, it&rsquo;s an investment that pays off every movie night.</p>
<h3 id="my-honest-advice-on-which-to-choose">My Honest Advice on Which to Choose</h3>
<p>After trying both, here’s my straightforward advice.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a great 2.1 soundbar.</strong> For 80% of people, this is the perfect sweet spot. It&rsquo;s affordable, it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to set up, and the improvement over your TV&rsquo;s built-in speakers is so massive that you&rsquo;ll be thrilled with your purchase. It gives you the powerful sound you need for daily enjoyment without any extra complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Only go for the 5.1 soundbar if you are dedicated to creating a &ldquo;movie night&rdquo; experience.</strong> If you have the space for it and you&rsquo;re willing to spend a bit more for that truly immersive surround sound, you won&rsquo;t regret it. For action movies and modern video games, it is a game-changer.</p>
<p>Ready to see what&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at some of the most popular and well-regarded <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/2-1-channel-sound-bar/s?k=2.1+channel+sound+bar&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=d3ca044185f37c69f01f02f2552416ee&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">2.1 channel soundbars on Amazon</a></strong>.</li>

      <description>Are you wondering which trampoline size would be perfect for you? Well, to make it a bit easier, I will look at 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you wondering which trampoline size would be perfect for you? Well, to make it a bit easier, I will look at 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline.</p>
<p>When deciding on the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-long-trampolines-for-gymnastics/">ideal trampoline shape</a>
, its crucial that you consider the available space in your backyard, the age of the user, and the purpose of the trampoline.</p>
<p>For example, the 14 ft. trampoline is a perfect choice for gymnastics, while the 12 ft. trampoline is ideal for normal bouncing or play.�Hence, check out my detailed analysis of 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline and decide on the best trampoline size for your backyard.</p>
<h2 id="12-ft-vs-14-ft-trampoline--differences">12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline- Differences</h2>
<h3 id="1-12-ft-vs-14-ft-trampoline-jumping-mat">1. 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline Jumping Mat</h3>
<p>Let us look at the jumping mats for both 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline. The 14 ft. trampoline has a jumping mat of about 148 inches in diameter. This diameter provides a bigger jumping surface to do flips and twirls.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the 12ft trampoline has a Jumping Mat diameter of about 125 inches.</p>
<p>However, weight restrictions may limit the number of people that jump on the large mat. Nevertheless, the big diameter mat provides enough space for two or more people to jump without colliding.�Therefore, the 14ft trampoline is better in terms of jumping space than the 12ft trampoline.</p>
<p>The larger jumping mat will provide ample space for your young gymnasts to perfect their tricks, twirls, and turns. Therefore, the 14-foot trampoline is a safe option for anyone who is into gymnastics.</p>
<p>The 12ft trampoline has a small jumping mat that might not be ideal for gymnasts. For your gymnastic exercises, youll need a spacious jumping area.</p>
<h3 id="2-12-ft-vs-14-ft-trampoline-weight-limit">2. 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline Weight Limit</h3>
<p>The 14ft trampoline will support a higher weight limit compared to the 12ft trampoline. This is because the 14ft trampoline is spacious, designed for a higher weight limit, and has more springs.</p>
<p>However, its important that you check the manufacturers recommended weight limit and see if it fits your situation. Each brand has its own criteria for weight limits. Check the recommendation first before making a purchase.</p>
<p>The 12ft trampoline has a weight limit of about 250 to 300lbs while the 14ft trampoline has a weight limit of 250 to 350lbs. The 15ft and 16ft trampolines can hold 250 to 450lbs.</p>
<h3 id="3-12-ft-vs-14-ft-users-age">3. 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Users Age</h3>
<p>Another crucial difference between the 12 ft. vs-14 ft. trampoline is the recommended users age. The 12ft trampoline is ideal for young children. This trampoline doesnt allow the child to bounce higher, hence its ideal for his/her safety.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the 14ft trampoline would be ideal for teenagers, youths, and adults. The large jumping mat will allow more than one person at a go. It will also encourage an upcoming gymnast to perfect his/her skills.</p>
<h3 id="4-12-ft-vs-14-ft-springs">4. 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Springs</h3>
<p>The 12 ft. vs-14 ft. trampoline may have a different number of springs depending on the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers will have the same number of springs in both the 12 ft. and 14 ft trampolines. While others will put more springs on the 14 ft. trampoline. Make sure you confirm the number of springs before making your purchase.</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher the number of springs in a trampoline the better and higher the bounce. Therefore, if youre looking for quality and higher bounces, youll want to choose a brand that includes more springs in their<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/small-trampoline-for-toddlers/">trampoline</a>.
However, if young children or toddlers are involved, you might want to choose a trampoline with fewer springs, hence, a lower bounce for their safety. Depending on the manufacturer, the 12ft would be ideal for children.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="product-review-for-12-ft-vs-14-ft-trampoline">Product Review for 12 ft. vs-14 ft Trampoline</h2>
<h3 id="1-orcc-12-ft-vs-14-ft-trampoline"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IBNPKSY/?tag=p-policy-20">1. ORCC 12 ft. vs-14 ft. Trampoline</a></h3>

      <description>As fleas search for food</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As fleas search for food
or flea dirt
, they&rsquo;ll be attracted by different stimuli to know a fitting host - are thermal and visual the main stimuli for attracting fleas?
<strong>So, are fleas attracted to heat (Thermotaxis)? Yes, over 90% of fleas will be attracted to fleas within 30 minutes but on its own, it has limited effectiveness in host-finding.�</strong>
<strong>Combining various stimuli such as movement, heat, and light (or shadows) will result in a higher attracting response on the fleas.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-are-fleas-attracted-to-heat-thermotaxis">Details: Are Fleas Attracted to Heat? Thermotaxis?</h2>
<p>As noted above, cat fleas will get attracted to their hosts through stimuli and thermal cues or stimuli. Thermotaxis denotes the aspect of repulsion or attraction towards heat.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, cat fleas are considered to be attracted and stimulated by heat or warmth - which means that they&rsquo;re positively thermotactic.</li>
<li>The positive thermotactic response in fleas allows them to location possible hosts andblood meals- this is because fleas&rsquo; hosts will emit some body warmth or heat.
But how do fleas detect heat? The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-have-antennae/">fleas&rsquo; antennae-like organ</a>
will work like some sensory organ. So, the fleas&rsquo; antennae will recognize different cues including heat or warmth.</li>
<li>Studies have reported that <a href="/posts/do-fleas-have-antennae/">flea</a> infestations significantly increase when there is a rise in warmth in the surrounding or heat.
If warm objects are positioned in the fleas&rsquo; environment, the bugs will jump randomly. The warm informs the fleas that there could be a possible host such as cats &amp; dogs.</li>
<li>Naturally, fleas love areas that are warmer. This includes places that have around 65 degrees of temperatures - and thus pets will make excellent hosts with their warmth.
Besides getting a great blood meal supply on the pets like cats &amp; dogs, fleas also enjoy the pet&rsquo;s warmth.</li>
<li>Fleas will use pets to gain entry into your house or apartment. But fleas may also hitch-hike your second-hand furniture or clothing.
When the fleas emerge from the cocoons, they&rsquo;ll start searching for a blood meal. If they don&rsquo;t get some blood meal, the bugs will starve within 1 week.</li>
<li>In the food-searching process, those fleas will identify their suitable hostsusing thermal and visual stimuli- this is simply heat &amp; light.
Recent studies report that when fleas are positioned in a dark area, over 90% of them will jump into the areas with light in just 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Considering lights, standard light will have a lower ability to attract fleas to those green-yellow lights.</li>
<li>Besides, the fleas&rsquo; attraction to heat or light will increase if the light source is turned on plus then off and on in quick succession - this mimics the movements of a flea host.
Further, flea traps that utilize intermittent lighting tend to attract &amp; trap more (about 82%) of these bugs.
The bugs will jump towards the heat source - as they&rsquo;ll get attracted to temperatures around 40C (104F).
However, they&rsquo;ll still get attracted by temperatures rising to highs of 50C (122F); and thus the fleas could hitchhike a number of hosts due to variation in temperatures that attract them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heat-alone-wont-promote-fleas-host-finding-habits">Heat Alone won&rsquo;t Promote fleas&rsquo; Host-Finding Habits</h2>
<p>Despite that heat or warmth will attract fleas, this cue (alone) won&rsquo;t work to attract the bugs towards their suitable hosts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs will orient their bodies to some warm gadget and aim to jump, but they&rsquo;ll only jump if there are other stimuli in the environment.
For example,
flea-control gadgets like flea traps
that use just heat as their sole stimulus will not attract the bugs.</li>
<li>Further, for the flea trap using light, including some heat will not boost its fleas&rsquo; attracting performance and host-detecting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fleas-abandon-their-hosts-with-low-temperatures">Fleas Abandon their Hosts with Low Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fleas will remain on their chosen host after they&rsquo;ve landed on such animals. However, fleas will leave that host once it&rsquo;s dying or dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs learn this if the body temperature of the host animals starts to drop.</li>
<li>Thus, the bugs will hitchhike another host or animal that is warm.
Further, fleas may jump onto some predator&rsquo;s body after such an animal has killed a flea-infested prey.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-emerged-flea-adults-on-hosts">Pre-emerged Flea Adults on Hosts</h2>
<p>Pre-emerged adult fleas will respond positively to heat as an attraction cue.</p>
<ul>
<li>After these younglings are adequately developed, they&rsquo;ll stay in<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-cocoons-look-like/">cocoons</a>up to when they detect some host.
The young fleas will be in the quiescent stage for about 5 months - they&rsquo;ll mainly be triggered by physical pressure and heat such as from a
fleas&rsquo; steam cleaner
.</li>
<li>The occurrence of pressure and heat will denote to the bugs that there is some nearby warm-blooded host.
The fleas emerge from those cocoons also due to the human breath that is warm. Another gadget I recommend for triggering the fleas&rsquo; emergence is the flea vacuum.</li>
<li>Will fleas be attracted to cold or heat? Well, fleas will flourish in humid and warm environments - which is about 75F - with their activity slowing down in winter.
Thus, during winter, the house and apartment will offer an appropriate habitat for fleas to grow especially if there are
<em>household</em>
pets like cats &amp; dogs.
For outdoor spaces, fleas will love humid, moist, &amp;
shady areas such as the yard or lawn
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on whether fleas are attracted to heat, YES fleas will be attracted by fleas but it must not be the only cue or stimuli.
Fleas prefer to respond positively to a combination of various stimuli including movement, heat, and light.</p>

Gila is an endangered lizard of northern Mexico and the south-western US. Its usually black in color with bright spots on various parts of the body. It has a notable stout body which is bulged at the head and tail.</p>
<p>An adult can reach about 20 inch and feeds on birds, small mammals and their eggs. The bulged head helps in holding the prey in place as it injects the venom to paralyze it.</p>
<p>But unlike snakes, all venomous lizards such as
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/11/17/1506321.htm">Australian lizards</a>
dont have fangs. Venom flows over the groves on their teeth to the prey. They rarely bite humans. If they bite they wont cause death.

<li>Theyre relatively larger than house lizards</li>
<li>Their skin is beaded skin instead of being scally</li>
<li>Can be recognized by their distinct colors i.e black and yellow, black and red or black and orange.</li>
<li>Strong limbs</li>
<li>They exhibit signs of panic. For instance, some lizards will produce a hissing sound. Notably the iguanas will take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on its four limbs.</li>
<li>When they bite, they clamp on until they are forcefully dislodged</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-dislodge-a-lizard-from-a-victim">How to Dislodge a Lizard from a Victim</h2>
<p>Whenever they bite, venomous lizards tend to cling on the victim while they release venom. The powerful jaws on their head makes it hard to detach.</p>
<p>Its advisable not to try to pull the animal as this would leave broken teeth in the victims flesh and cause further tissue damage. Here is what to do.
<strong>Open the Jaws with a Prying Tool -�</strong>
A prying tool such as a pliers or butter knife can be used to force open the jaws, and safely dislodge the lizard from the victim.
<strong>Immerse the Lizard in Water -�</strong>
Immersing the victims body together with the lizard in cold water is a safe way of detaching the animal. Some lizards are protected and so killing them is an offence.
<strong>Flame under the Chin -�</strong>
Another method of getting the lizard from the victims flesh is to slightly apply a flame just below the chin.
<strong>Allow the Lizard to Stand On Its Feet -�</strong>
If the lizard gets good grip on the ground, it may feel secure and release the grip. But this is not a quick method if you want to save the victim from subsequent venoms.</p>
<h2 id="final-word"><strong>Final Word</strong></h2>
<p>Most lizards are non-venomous and will not readily bite you. Even the few venomous lizards bite when provoked or in defense when they feel threatened.</p>
<p>Although the venom can barely kill a human, it can cause serious body reactions. In addition the bite can cause serious tissue damage. So, it good to be on the safe side whenever you encounter such lizards.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May be you have come across various species of lizards in your home, park or zoo and wonder whether they have backbones or not. How could their internal organs be protected or supported? Could they be having similar anatomy as mammals or other animals?
**So, Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates? The simple answer is, all species of <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">Lizard</a> are vertebrates (they have backbone also called the vertebral column/spinal column). **
**The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal regions and sacral apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into caudal and precaudal. **
<strong>The main function of the backbone is to offer protection to the spinal cord. It also provides an option for attachment of body muscles.�</strong>

<h2 id="are-lizards-vertebrates-or-invertebrates">Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates?</h2>
<p>Lizards including
bearded dragons
are vertebrates whose spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal and sacral vertebrae. Some species may have lumbar region too.</p>
<p>The main function of vertebral column in Lizards is to protect the spinal cord (this house the nervous system and aid in body coordination). In addition, the backbone offers support to the body and attachment of muscles, pectoral and pelvic girdle for easier locomotion.</p>
<h3 id="a-vertebral-column-in-lizards">a. Vertebral column in lizards.</h3>
<p>Lizard (apart from legless lizards) have vertebral column also called spinal column or backbone that is divided into four parts i.e. cervical, dorsal, sacral and sacral vertebrae. Some lizard species may also have lumbar region.</p>
<p>These vertebral sub-divisions are formed mainly to help perform a given functions in lizards. The major function of vertebral column it to ensure sufficient protection of spinal cord  which runs vertically and centrally within vertebral column from the head to tail. The spinal cord helps in condonation of the nervous system of the entire lizard.</p>
<p>Related:
Do Lizards Have Teeth?
<strong>i. The cervical vertebrae.</strong>
This vertebra is found at the neck region of the lizards. The cervical vertebrae help support the neck and assist in free movement of the neck  side by side, up and down or around.</p>
<p>The special type of cervical vertebrae called atlas is well adapted to help in nodding while axis allows rotary motion. In most lizards, the vertebral are articulated and fused is such a way that they seem vestigial. In some lizard species, most of these bones are advanced to form dorsal vertebrae.</p>
<p>The cervical vertebrae also provide the option for attachment of neck muscles and skull resting point.
<strong>ii. Dorsal vertebrae.</strong>
This is also called Thoracic vertebrae. The Dorsal vertebrae offer the point for attachment of the ribs. The ribs provide protection for the lungs, heart and the liver. The sternum and scapula are also attached on these vertebrae.</p>
<p>The number of dorsal vertebra varies according to the species. The small lizards such as chameleon lizards and savannah lizards may have 8 to 12 dorsal vertebra. The medium size lizards such as Nile monitor lizards may have 11 to 17 thoracic vertebra while large lizards such as Komodo dragon may have 16 to 25 dorsal vertebra.
<strong>iii. Lumbar Vertebrae.</strong>
These are vertebrae that are found between the dorsal and the sacral vertebral. These vertebrae do not carry any rib. Most lizards do not have Lumbar vertebrae thus their dorsal and sacral vertebrae are directly interconnected.</p>
<p>Lumbar vertebrae are only found in few large lizard species such as monitor lizards and Komodo lizards. The lumbar vertebrae provides an option for the attachment of body muscles. These vertebrae also enable lizards to fold coil easily.
<strong>iv. The Sacral Vertebrae.</strong>
The Sacral vertebral is the found in sacrum section. It is connected with pelvic to offer option for support and attachment of pelvic muscles.</p>
<p>The sacral vertebral has 1 to 7 bones in lizards. The number varies according to the lizard species. The first 3 sacral bones are fuse to form a strong support at the pelvis girdle.</p>
<p>The sacral vertebra has a short stout rib-like protrusion, which offer point of muscle attachment. Moreover, these vertebrae have short arches and spines.
<strong>v. The Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
This is also called the tail vertebrae. In some lizards, the caudal vertebrae are fused with sacral vertebrae. These vertebrae have short stouts on the sizes that provide for the attachment of the muscles. There are 1 to a maximum of 30 caudal vertebra in lizards.</p>
<p>The small-tailed lizards such as stumpy-tailed lizards have few vertebra while long tailed lizards such as skinks, basilisk and chameleon lizards have large number of caudal vertebrae (10 to 30).</p>
<p>The arches and spines in caudal vertebrae continuously decreases up to the last vertebra. The caudal vertebral are adapted to provide easier movement of the tail.</p>

<h3 id="b-the-vertebral-column-of-legless-lizard">b. The Vertebral Column of Legless Lizard.</h3>
<p>Legless lizards are lizard species that have lost their legs independently at a point in life or their legs have reduced into point of no use in locomotion. These lizards crawl on the ground like snakes.</p>
<p>The legless lizard has its backbone divided into two sections i.e. the precaudal and caudal vertebrae. These sections collectively support the lizard and protect the spinal cord from external damage as well as offer support and attachment for body muscles.
<strong>i. Precaudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The precaudal vertebrae consist of bones that are found before the tail/caudal or pelvic region. In precaudal vertebrae, bone are interconnected to form one chain that help the lizards in locomotion.</p>
<p>The cervical, dorsal/thoracic and lumbar are connected into one unit. These vertebrae offer option of attachment of body muscles and the ribs.</p>
<p>Most legless lizards have the first to fifth bones in the precuadal vertebrae fused thus having minimum movement/turning.
<strong>ii. Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The sacral and tail vertebrae in legless lizards are fused to form caudal vertebrae. Legless lizards do not have lumbar vertebrae and pelvic girdle (if any is very small).</p>
<p>The caudal vertebrae forms the tail region, which is powerful for defense action. The first 5 to 10 vertebral bones are fused to give ample strength to the legless lizard at the caudal origin.</p>
<p>The caudal vertebra has stout that protrude laterally to provide option for attachment of back muscles. Moreover, the caudal vertebrae have short spines and arches that decreases gradually till the tip of the tail.</p>
<h3 id="c-functions-of-the-backbonespinal-column">c. Functions of the Backbone/spinal column</h3>
<p>The major function of spinal column in lizards is to protect the spinal cord, which controls the nervous systems. The spinal cord runs vertically from the head to the tail and its centrally located through the hollow sections left along the vertebral column.</p>
<p>The backbone also provides option of attachment of the body muscles and point of growth of other body somatic cells. The muscles grows from the backbone and accumulate enough to help coordinated movement of the lizards.</p>
<p>The backbone provides the point of connections for other appendicular skeleton. The femur, the humerus and scapula are jointed to the backbone using either ball and socket joint or hinge joint to enable easier locomotion. The appendages are interlinked and their entire weight is housed at the backbone.</p>
<p>In addition, the backbone provides extra support and protection to internal organs such as the heart, liver, lungs and intestine. The clavicle, ribs and pelvis girdle are well jointed on the backbone to help in provide further internal protection.</p>
<h2 id="is-lizard-a-reptile-or-amphibian">Is lizard a reptile or amphibian</h2>
<p>All lizards are reptiles including
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-monitor-lizards-poisonous/">monitor lizards</a>
. They are cold-blooded animals (ectothermic). Unlike amphibians (which have smooth and slippery skin), Lizards have skin which is covered with scare  this one features of all reptiles. The following are characteristics/fears of reptiles (lizards):
<strong>1. They are cold blooded</strong>
. This means that their body temperature changes according to the change in temperature on its environment. Because of the ectothermic metabolism of the lizards, they are forced to bask under the sun to raise its body temperature. A warm lizard is more active that a cold one.
<strong>2. Their skin is covered with scale or scutes</strong>
. Reptiles develop hard skin that is made of scale using protein keratin. Reptiles such as turtles and armored crocodile have scutes which form deeper layer under the skin. All lizards skin is covered with scale.
<strong>3. Most reptiles lay eggs.</strong>
Like most reptiles, lizards are oviparous  they lay eggs, which have hard shells. Their eggs are laid mainly on land. Lizards also take care of the eggs until they hatch. The eggs of amphibians (frogs) do not have hard shell. The eggs are enclosed in a jelly substance that offer protection  the female frog never take care of its eggs once laid in water.
<strong>4. They breathe by use of lungs</strong>
. Reptiles (lizards) breathe though the lungs in their entire life  even when in water. Contrary, amphibians such as frogs and toad breath through lungs, skin or gills (at young stage - tadpole).
<strong>5. They have four walking legs (apart from legless lizards)</strong>
. The reptiles (lizards) have four legs that are used for locomotion/walking. Amphibians such as frog, newt or toad have two hind legs for jumping and two front legs adapted for landing. Their legs cant walk as in the case of lizards.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-have-backbones">Do Lizards Have Backbones?</h2>
<p>Yes. Lizards have backbones since they are classified as vertebrates. The backbone is used to give support to body organs, muscles and cells. Moreover, the Backbone of lizards offers option for attachments of body muscles.</p>
<p>The backbone provides point link for appendicular skeleton such as ribs, femur, humerus, sternum or scapula as well as protect internal organs such as heart, lungs, livers and kidneys.</p>
<p>The hard bone spines and arches formed by the spinal column of lizards provide suitable defense tool against its enemies.</p>
<h2 id="major-facts-about-lizard-as-a-reptile">Major facts about Lizard as a reptile.</h2>
<p><strong>1. The Survival Mechanism</strong>
.</p>
<p>Lizards have adapted to living in the harshest conditions without getting extinct due to their feeding diversity. Lizards feeds on variety of food such as small insects, crustaceans, snakes, birds and ever lard animals such as baby turtles.</p>
<p>Lizards such as Komodo dragon and tree crocodile are known for predation culture. They even attack human beings for food.</p>
<p>Lizards are able to camouflage and escape any predator. For example, the chameleon lizards are able to change color randomly to march the background and use this mechanism to escape the predator.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">venomous lizards use the poison to paralyze</a>
their prey before swallowing them. The strong tail of predator lizards is used a weapon to grasp and knock down their prey or defend themselves in case of attack.</p>
<p>Lizards often escape in case they notice dangers to hideouts that make predators difficult to reach them e.g. under the roof, in the thorn bushes or holes/cracks.
<strong>2. The lizard Habitat.</strong>
Lizards are found everywhere in the world. They mostly live on the ground. Lizards do not make nests. You will spot some lizards in trees, marshy areas or riverbanks (Nile monitor and Asian Water monitor)</p>
<p>Though lizards are ectothermic (cold blooded), you will find them in cold region as well as in arid and semi-arid areas e.g. Savannah monitor.
Leopard geckos are crepuscular
.</p>
<p>Lizards such as marine iguanas dwell under the water though they often come to the shore to bask and lay eggs. Lizards, which dwell on trees, have short wide toes that are well adapted to climbing.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All Lizard species are vertebrates. They have backbone, also called the vertebral column/spinal column, whose main function is to protect the spinal cord and offer option for attachment of body muscles and appendicular skeleton.</p>
<p>The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, sacral and vertebrae apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into precaudal and caudal vertebrae.</p>

**The direct answer is YES. Monitor lizards (such as Komodo Dragon, Asian Water Monitor, and Tree Crocodile Monitor) can bite and cause poisonous infections since they are venomous. **
<strong>The venom contains crotamine, which prevents blood clotting leading to a drop in blood pressure and cause death at the long run. On the other hand, Monitor Lizards such as Bengal Monitor and Savana Monitor are believed to be harmless and defenseless. However, these species are few.�</strong>

<p>Monitor lizards are the most
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">poisonous and dangerous species of lizards</a>
. They contain venom at the root of
their teeth
, which they use to paralyze the prey before they swallow. Most Monitor lizards are carnivore and are well known for their tactical hunting skills.
We can therefore say that most Monitor lizards are dangerous carnivores that paralyze prey using their venom before swallowing.
In addition, these reptiles harbor salmonella bacteria that cause infections to both pets and human beings if not treated or disinfected. Meat from Monitor Lizard contains Liver fluke which damages severely the pets livers and causes liver inflammation.</p>
<h3 id="1-komodo-dragonvaranus-komodoensis"><strong>1. Komodo dragon</strong>(<strong>Varanus komodoensis</strong>*)*</h3>
<p>This is the largest Lizard ever lived. It grows to a length of 30 meters and 135kg (300 pounds) in weight at adulthood. Komodo Dragon is the most venomous lizard. It can run fast to attack its prey, including human beings.
This reptile bites and injects poisonous venom into you/prey. The venom contains crotamine, which prevents blood clotting and thus leading to death if not urgently attended.
Several reports of human attacks by Komodo Dragon have been reported between 2000 and 2014. This reptile also introduces bacteria from its mouth to the prey accelerating the killing.</p>
<h3 id="2-malayan-asian-water-monitor-two-banded-monitorvaranus-salvator"><strong>2. Malayan, Asian Water Monitor, Two-banded Monitor</strong>(<strong>Varanus Salvator</strong>)</h3>
<p>This type of monitor lizard is found in South China Sea, Bengal bay, and Sri Lanka. They are well known carnivores that feed on fish, mollusks, birds, spiders, small mammals, and even other lizards. Asian Water monitor also eats meat from a dead human being.
These monitor bites human beings and injects venom that causes mild effects and infections which may get severe if not attended to. There are rare cases of people who have died out of Malayan monitors Venom unlike the case of Komodo Dragon.
People hunt the Asian Water Monitor for their skin and meat, which they use for traditional leather industry and medicine.</p>
<h3 id="3-tree-crocodile-or-crocodile-monitorvaranus-salvadori"><strong>3. Tree crocodile, or Crocodile monitor</strong>(<strong>Varanus Salvadori</strong>)</h3>
<p>This type of Monitor Lizard loves living in the Islands of New Guinea. They are dangerous and poisonous lizards. Just as the name states, they behave like crocodiles (threatening and hunt alone).
Crocodile monitor are highly aggressive. They are able to bite and kill their prey in minutes. Though people prefer hunting them for their meat and sin, these reptiles are considered a very risky and are mainly capture using traps.</p>
<h3 id="4-bengal-monitorvaranus-bengalensis"><strong>4. Bengal monitor</strong>(<strong>Varanus bengalensis)</strong></h3>
<p>This is commonly known as the common Indian monitor. It is found in West and southeastern Asia along with Sri Lanka.
This monitor lizard is considered harmless and defenseless by the people of Sri Lanka. Its highly hunted for meat and fat that is used for various home use.
The skin extract from Bengal monitor is used for making drums by the people of Sri Lanka. This reptile has not been aggressive against people and is considered a nice pet.</p>
<h3 id="5-nile-monitor-or-water-monitor-varanus-niloticus"><strong>5. Nile Monitor or Water Monitor (Varanus niloticus)</strong></h3>
<p>Nile Monitor is found in Nile valley of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is well known for hunting in rivers and nearby vegetation.
It is able to kill large animals such as frog, turtle, birds and terrapin for food. Nile monitor rarely hunt human beings. However, when threaten, they can bite and instill a painful injuries.
These reptiles prefer to escape by swimming in the rivers in case of danger.

<p>This Species of Monitor lizard is found in savannah and arid areas of Eastern and southern Africa. It is carnivore in nature and will kill small animals such as baby tortoise and invertebrates for food.
Normally, Savannah monitor loves solitary life. It bites when threated and knocks off its assailants using its long tail. There is no report showing death resulting from Savannah Monitor.�This species can be kept as a pet.</p>
<h2 id="are-monitor-lizards-poisonous-to-human-beings">Are monitor Lizards Poisonous to Human Beings?</h2>
<p>Monitor lizards such as Komodo Dragon, Asian Water Monitor and Tree Crocodile Monitor are termed as human threat since they contain venom. These reptiles do not hunt human beings, however, when provoked or while stressed, they can bite dangerously.
The bite from a Monitor lizard causes poisonous infections. The monitor lizards venom contains crotamine, which causes blood not to clot leading to drop in overall blood pressure in victims body  this may lead to death if not attended to immediately.
The bite from monitor lizard may be as deep as 0.5 to 2 inches and cause large swelling. The blood Oz continuously from the bite without stopping  you must therefore be quick to act on a bite from Monitor Lizards. The bite may take up to a month to fully heal the scar left during the attack.
In United Kingdom, The Sun Newspaper reported a case of Ronald Huff, 42, who died from venom injected by Monitor Lizard bite in 2002.� In fact, the reptile use to be left to roam in his house freely as a pet. After paralyzing Ronald Huff, the monitor lizard even fed on his hands and stomach organs in this bizarre incidence.
<strong>On the contrary</strong>
, some Monitor Lizards such as Bengal Monitor and Savana Monitor are believed to be harmless and defenseless.
However, these species are few and their behavior may be caused by large weight or hormonal imbalance. Research is still being carried out to establish what can make them aggressive like other species of monitor lizards.
The monitor lizards harbor salmonella bacteria that causes infections to both human beings and pet.� The pet Monitor Lizard should be disinfected often (once per month) to prevent them from dropping these bacteria in your compound.</p>
<h2 id="are-monitor-lizards-poisonous-to-your-pets-cats--dogs">Are Monitor Lizards Poisonous to your pets (cats &amp; dogs)?</h2>
<p>Monitor lizards are poisonous reptiles that will attach your pets on approach. Komodo Dragon and Tree Crocodile Monitors will bite your dogs or cats using their sharp pointed venomous teeth, paralyzing them to death  the teeth of monitor lizards are strong enough to penetrate the skin of your pets unlike other lizard species.
The bite from a monitor lizard may take more than a month for your pet to heal on vet treatment. The Monitor Lizards are always threated by the presence of dogs or cats since these pets tend to feed on them. Monitor lizard uses its paws, crawls and tail when attacking its assailants.
Monitor lizards also house salmonella bacteria (under the skin) that cause severe bacterial infections on your dogs or cats. You must therefore keep off dogs or cats from your pet Monitor lizards. Moreover, disinfect their cage regularly (monthly).
Dogs and large cats tend to hunt monitor lizards for their food. Meat from Monitor lizards contains liver flukes (
<strong>liver flukes dont affect the lizards</strong>
) which when eaten are transferred into your pets digestive track. These liver flukes then travel to the liver, gall bladder and finally to the bile duct. They cause severe liver damage and liver inflammation.</p>
<h2 id="which-diseases-are-caused-by-monitor-lizards">Which Diseases are caused by Monitor Lizards?</h2>
<p>Your pet monitor lizards may not be 100% safe for you, your pets or your humans if not well treated. They cause scary skin when held with unprotected hand.
One feels itching sensation, which makes you tend to scratch yourself. The skin of untreated (dirty, scary) Monitor Lizard is believed to excrete a chemical that cause itching and can also be allergic to allergen sensitive people.
The Salmonella Bacteria that is harbored in the skin of Monitor Lizard cause Bacterial infections to both human beings and pets on contact.
These infections is more pronounce in children who tend to play with pet Monitor lizards often. The research shows that Salmonella Bacteria is able to encompass over 2000 types of diseases in both human beings and pets.
The excretes from Monitor lizards need to be handled with care as they cause infectious diseases and can burn your skin. They favor growth of fungi that may lead to fungus infections in your place.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-lizards-bite">How Do Lizards Bite?</h2>
<p>Monitor Lizards can bite you, when provoked and inject you with venom that kills at long run. Several cases of Komodo dragon and Asian Water Monitor feeding on human being.
The Monitor lizards have sharp pointed teeth that are able to slice through the flesh to a depth of 0.5 to 2 inches. These bites causes continuous bleeding that dont clot easily and a resultant swelling that may take one month to heal. It is necessary to nurse and treat bites from Monitor lizard immediately in order to save the life of the victim.
During attack, the Monitor Lizards also use their tail power to knock off the prey. They grab prey with their paws, which have crawls are the end for fastening, while eating to prevent them from escaping.
Children, unlike adult, are susceptible to these bites since they love to play with pet monitor lizards a lot. The pet may get agitated by other causes such as reproduction thus biting your kid. In is necessary to keep of your kids from pet monitor lizards as much as possible.</p>
<h2 id="are-the-monitor-lizards-venomous">Are the Monitor Lizards Venomous?</h2>
<p>Yes. Monitor lizards contain venom at the root of each tooth. The venom contains crotamine chemical, which poisons and paralyzes the prey to death.
Crotamine prevent blood from bite injuries from clotting leading to continuous drop of blood pressure in the body. The Venom also inject chemical that cause immediate swelling and spread infections in the bitten area.
The release of venom from the monitor lizards is faster when it is more stressed or agitated. Since every tooth has venom glad at the root, you much be keen when handling the number of bites so as to administer medicine to each scar appropriately.
The Komodo Dragon Lizard species is said to have very poisonous venom that kill in minutes if unattended.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-dangers-of-overpopulation-of-monitor-lizards">What are dangers of Overpopulation of Monitor Lizards?</h2>
<p>Managing a large population of Monitor Lizards may be tedious and cumbersome to humanity. These Lizards tend to rebel and react negatively over any simple threat. With increased population, food scarcity arises and feeding them becomes challenging.
Hungry Monitor Lizards become carnivores that are more violent with time. They group themselves in crowds that aim at attacking both small and large animals to gain food. These reptiles will become aggressive to a point of attacking human beings (especially children) who try to contain them in their cage or breeding ground.
The colony of Monitor lizards will post threat to other pets and animals within the ecosystem. They rarely interact mutually with other animals  they live a symbiotic life in their lives.
The Monitor Lizard is one of the most fertile species of lizards and reptiles. It can lay up to 30 eggs twice a year, which all hatch a healthy baby monitor lizards. Monitor Lizards give fierce protection to their young ones thus ensuring fully transition to maturing.
Scientific research shows that it has been difficult to control overwhelming population of Monitor lizards due to the dynamics in their breeding pattern. However, to control their natural population increase, you can only do so best by destroying their eggs before they hatch.

<h2 id="can-monitor-lizards-be-petted">Can Monitor Lizards be Petted?</h2>
<p>Yes. You can pet the Monitor lizards. This can be done by using food as bait to lure it. People have petted Monitor Lizards.
However, it is necessary to learn the moods of your Monitor lizards since they may react negatively anytime thus biting and injecting poisonous venom to you, your pets or your humans.
The Monitor Lizard Pet should be kept away from other home pets such as dogs and cats since it can cause bacterial infections or get eaten leading to liver flukes transmission. Your kids should not be allowed to play with your pet monitor lizards alone.</p>

They bore holes into grains, cereals, and legumes making. Below is their life cycle and how to identify them.
<strong>Life-cycle</strong>
A grain weevil has a life span of 5-8 months. This happens if the temperature and the humidity are constantly constant. For temperatures are between 15-34 C and humidity of 40 percent.
The life cycle of the weevil begins when a mature female lays its egg inside the grain. It can lay 300-400 eggs per lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female weevil lays one egg per gain after which she seals off the holes with some wax. The wax released to seal the entry dries off forming a raised mark on the seed.</li>
<li>When the egg hatches, a white larva is released that is without legs. This larva stays in the grain while feeding on it until it develops into a pupa.
When the pupa transforms into an adult, it bores a hole to exit the grain.�It takes approximately 36 days for a weevil to fully mature and be ready to hatch an egg.
Immediately after leaving the grain, the female releases pheromones insinuating readiness to mate.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is another pantry bug that you are likely to find in your household. They are a common pest in warmer areas and environments.
This pantry bug is normally very destructive on dried plant products and fruits. In the pantry, you are also likely to find them in bread, floor, sweets, spices, cookies among others.
**Life-cycle **
A drugstore beetle has a lifespan of 13-65 days but some can live up to seven months. Their life cycle and life span highly depend on some factors like food and temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its life cycle begins when a female drugstore beetle lays its eggs. It can lay about 75 eggs in its life span.</li>
<li>It has three life stages egg, larvae/pupa, and adult stage. This beetle can survive in its larvae stage for a period of 5-20 weeks. The larvae feed on the grains as it develops.
In the final stages of its larvae stage, it builds a cocoon where the pupa stays dormant for 12-18 days.
The adult breaks out of the cocoon into a beetle that has a life span of 13-65 days. It is at this stage that they mate and lay eggs as the cycle continues.
They need a temperature of 30C and a humidity of 60-90 % for growth and mating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-idianmeal-moths-">**3. ****Idianmeal moths **</h3>
<p>They compromise the largest population of pantry bugs. They are very destructive and are found in grains and cereals, plants, nuts, pasta, fruits, rice, spices, and bread among others.

<li>With a temperature of 30C eggs takes 3-4 days to hatch while with a temperature of 20 C they take 7-8 days to hatch.</li>
<li>This larvae also have a web that it leaves behind which can be seen. These larvae also produce a cocoon that houses the dormant pupa stage of this beetle.
The pupa stays in this stage for 15-20 days before transforming into an adult moth.
It takes about 3 days for the adults to mate and lay eggs and the cycle continues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="can-drugstore-store-beetle-harm-you-when-eaten"><strong>Can drugstore store beetle harm you when eaten?</strong></h3>
<p>Like most pantry bugs, the drugstore beetle is harmless if eaten accidentally.� However, there are ways of reducing their infestation into your food and grains.
Keeping your foodstuffs below a temperature of 20 C will keep these bugs since they cannot survive in such an environment.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-eliminate-pantry-bugs"><strong>How to eliminate pantry bugs</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Check the food at the store</strong>
-before buying food at the store always make sure you cross-check well. Dont buy food that is not properly sealed or poorly packaged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check packaging dates as most likely the older products are more likely to be infested or even have eggs that later hatch into bugs.
<strong>Proper transportation-</strong>
check your products after transportation just in case the packaging is damaged. Any damaged packaging is prone to pantry bugs and should therefore be used first in your household or properly sealed before storage.
<strong>Using traps-</strong>
if you have noticed some pantry bugs in your kitchen or store, you can use traps to get rid of them. There are baits with sticky traps and some even with sex pheromones that attract bugs and stop them from further multiplication.
<strong>Storage-</strong>
On storage, you also need to check on the opened products and tight seal them to minimize entry of the bugs.
<strong>Grain and cereals Treatment-</strong>
if you find grain weevil, there are some insecticides that can be used to treat your grains and cereals against such.
<strong>Disposing of -</strong>
when the infestation is too much, there can be no better way than disposing of the produce. Instead of risking further multiplication of bugs trashing it is also a good option.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Are pantry bugs harmful if eaten? Though most of them are not harmful, it is good to avoid eating them. On the contrary, controlling their infestation would do more good than even allowing them in your grains, cereals, and other consumables.
That said and done, it is also not healthy to eat the pantry bags. Proper storage, treatment, and other good practices can be useful in getting rid of the bugs.</p>

Despite the fact that it might not cause birth abnormalities, it could cause a significant threat to the mother&rsquo;s health especially if she is allergic.</p>
<p>For the mothers who got in contact with plugin repellents during the first three months of their pregnancy, their male babies could have a condition called Hypospadias (difficulty opening penis or its foreskin)</p>
<h3 id="ii-on-babies"><em>ii) On babies�</em></h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-soundbars-have-superior-sound-quality">2. Soundbars have Superior Sound quality</h3>
<p>Initially, soundbars fell short on sound quality - they offered a better alternative to the sound system for the flat-screen TV. Thus, soundbars were just slightly superior to the in-built TV speakers.
However, soundbars are now deep and better positioned in the home entertainment space and hence have developed to become better sound systems.
In addition, its now possible to add other fitting components to your soundbars that&rsquo;ll help create an excellent surround sound in your room either small or large.
Further, the in-build speakers in your soundbars are of better quality plus have sub-woofers and surround-sound speakers for better entertainment.

<p>To match your chic modern decor, soundbars have a minimalist and stylish design that you&rsquo;ll love. Further, with their wireless subwoofer, you&rsquo;ll have even fewer wires that will be crossing around your spaces and rooms.
Therefore, the soundbar design will match your TV&rsquo;s slim aesthetic - which also providing quality audio that&rsquo;ll go well with the excellent TV visuals for watching different films and TV shows with a great experience.
The soundbar will sit flush with your cinema set-up or against the wall� - which is great for little spaces or small homes - thanks to their minimal and sleek design which is pleasing both to the ear and to your eyes. You can wall-mount the soundbar on the side, above, or in front of the TV screen.
Your traditional surround audio systems have bulky ugly looking components despite giving excellent sound quality. But we hate the disorganization, including the large wiring and equipment particularly if these ones aren&rsquo;t in your main living area.
Therefore, with a good-quality soundbar, you can get great sound while also keeping your rooms and spaces tidy and neat - call it compact and stylish.
For example, the system acts like the receiver while also holding all your front speakers - that&rsquo;s a minus 3 of the large components in your traditional surround audio systems. Notably, wireless connectivity allows you to place the surrounds and sub(s) at your selected location without needing wires.

<p>By design, most soundbars will seamlessly integrate with your favorite smart-home devices that have the latest technology including the smart TV, Amazon Alexa, Dolby Atmos, or even 4K TV.
The latest soundbars allow wireless audio streaming through Bluetooth plus they&rsquo;ll have convenient inputs like Coaxial and Optical, regular HDMI, and HDMI ARC - check differences in
soundbar&rsquo;s HDMI vs optical inputs
.
Therefore, both on cost and convince, getting a soundbar that&rsquo;ll readily integrate and work with current and most future technology is an excellent feature - check these
cameras for music videos
.
<strong>1.</strong>
For example, the soundbar will allow whole-home blue-tooth and audio connectivity by blue-tooth streaming from the computer, tablet, or smartphone to your TV and thus you can easily listen to music or
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/spotify-tips-and-tricks/">Spotify</a>
on higher-quality speakers.
<strong>2.</strong>
Further, you can get smart soundbar models such as
Roku
and JBL that have smart software like
<a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00226270">Alexa</a>
, Google Assistant, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku">Roku OS</a>
. Thus, you can easily give your old TVs a new life without - automation plus streaming - with no need for additional cables or
set-top streaming boxes

<strong>3.</strong>
Also, soundbars will have Dolby and channel Atmos - shown with numbers like 5.1.4 where the number (5) represents # of channels, number (1) states if there&rsquo;s a sub-woofer (maybe even a wireless satellite speakers) and the last number (4) denotes support for DTS:X /
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Atmos">Dolby Atmos Surround</a>
that&rsquo;ll support many objects.</p>
<ul>

<p>Most soundbars will cost anywhere between $200 &amp; $600 but maybe lows of $100 or highs of $1000. Therefore, these are highly affordable compared to your regular surround audio system.
Components of your regular surround audio system are costly when purchased separately. Compared to the soundbar package or a soundbar, even a package sound system deal will be more expensive.
But, are cheap soundbars any good? There are many top-selling soundbars, its possible to find quality soundbars that are affordable. Thus, no risk of trading on sound quality to the reduced price.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll find low-priced soundbars with impressive sound quality that&rsquo;ll readily replace your traditional audio system package - so check these
affordable and quality soundbars
.
But which soundbar size should you choose? Well, soundbars will come in varied sizes and shapes. Evidently, large-sized soundbars could have more drivers and thus a bugger sound but most of the time this will only give you the longer box.
Most of the new soundbars will cost anywhere from $200 and will come with a number of HDMI inputs that will be helpful for connecting AV devices to your soundbar directly as opposed to taking them through the TV.
However, to future-proof your soundbar, check that it has 3+ inputs and ensure they&rsquo;re passing both HRD and 4K signals - particularly for the 4K TV. You can stream music and other audio for the tablet or audio including from music apps like Spotify or Pandora.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-an-in-built-google-assistant-or-alexa">Do I need an in-built Google Assistant or Alexa?</h2>
<p>Currently soundbars comes with voice-assistants that&rsquo;re in-built made by
Sonos Beam, Google or Amazon. Don&rsquo;t have to purchase soundbar plus a Nest Mini separately - stylish and saving space.
The voice-assistant speaker like the
Polk Command Bar
or the Echo Dot will require that you have the &ldquo;always on&rdquo; microphone - you can control the soundbar functions including turning off lights.
The voice -assistant feature just sit around like a web browser that&rsquo;ll wait for anyone to say &ldquo;wake&rdquo; and it&rsquo;ll respond juts like a web search - check these
best earbuds under $50
.
Also, the app can also allow you to read back that it records - for check on privacy issues. But if such automation are too much for you, simply get a soundbar without the google voice-assistant.
Further, you should know that
Amazon Echo Link
allows a user to install Alexa capability on all soundbars that have analog input - but also check the input to hear music and responses.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-dolby-atmos-or-surround-sound">Do I need Dolby Atmos or Surround sound?</h2>
<p>Previously, 2-channel soundbars sounded alike with stereo or surround modes but wall-bouncing &amp; Dolby Virtual:X like

enhance immersion.
However, you may add extra surrounds (e.g.
Ikea Synfonisks
) on your soundbar like
Sonos Playbar
to get you better surround and extensive immersion for movies.
Luckily, you can include surround speakers to most mid-range soundbars for brands such as Samsung, LG, and Polk using Wi-Fi to link to stand-alone wireless speakers.
Therefore, there has been a major rise in the Atmos soundbars that has led to a significant drop in the prices. Different streaming services like
Netflix
provide
Atmos soundtracks for TV and movies.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After connecting the TV, check if the audio signals are sending correctly to your soundbar through TV audio by turning off the internal speakers of your TV.
You can check other connections like

      <description>The Gasteracantha (a.k.a</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gasteracantha (a.k.a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_orb-weaver">spiny spiders, spiny orb-weavers, or spiny-backed orb-weavers</a>
) <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> in the orb-weaver genus of spiders. The spiders have unique spikes on their backs.</p>
<p>The female Gasteracantha have brightly-colored spines on their shell-like, hardened, and broad abdomens. However, are spiny orb-weaver spiders poisonous?
<strong>The simple answer is, NO, Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders are not poisonous. While these Gasteracantha spiny spiders can bite, they aren&rsquo;t aggressive or poisonous spider species and they won&rsquo;t trigger any grave symptoms on humans.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="detailed-are-spiny-orb-weaver-spiders-poisonous">Detailed: Are Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders Poisonous?</h2>
<p>Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders measure about 1/4&quot; - 1/2&quot;, have 8 legs and are yellow, orange, black, or white in color with red markings. If you notice the colorful spiders and some large spun webs, then it may be a sure sign that your yard has been infested by spiny orb-weaver.
The spiny orb-weaver will mainly make their nests on shrubs, citrus trees, or around the sides of your house. In addition, these insects will mainly be active from October to January where they&rsquo;ll produce oval egg sacs under man-made structures and tree leaves too - interestingly they do this next to the webs by their females counterparts.
Each eggs sack of this Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders will hold roughly 100 - 300 eggs, and thus its presence will definitely signify a massive infestation in your yard. Sadly, the eggs will hatch within 2 weeks and hence you must control the bugs before the begin their hatching and reproduction.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-identify-the-spiny-orb-weaver">How to identify the Spiny Orb-Weaver</h2>
<p>The bug&rsquo;s body color is the surest way to distinguish between the spiny-back species - particularly in this case the orb-weaver spiders.
The male orb-weaver spiders are largely smaller compared to their female counterparts - their body length ranges from 2 - 3 millimeters but slightly longer in body width. On the other hand the female orb-weaver spiders measure 5 - 9 millimeters in body length and their body width is 10 - 13 millimeters.

<p>Source:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_orb-weaver">Wikipedia</a>
[/caption]
The spiny spiders, just like name mentions, have 6 spines or projections protruding from the rear of their abdomen. You&rsquo;ll find bright color on the dosaum or top of the spiny spiders&rsquo; abdomen - these will be red spines plus black spots on the white background.
However, some of the spiny spiders, may be yellow but have black spikes. But other may also be completely black in color. The male bugs will have 4-5 small humps while their females come with large spines sitting on their back of their body.</p>
<h2 id="special-behaviors-by-the-spiny-orb-weaver">Special Behaviors by the Spiny Orb-Weaver</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.insectidentification.org/insect-description.asp?identification=Spined-Micrathena-Spider">Micrathena</a>
and
<a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/beneficial/g_cancriformis.htm">Gasteracantha</a>
genus are the most prevalent among these spiders - particularly considering their body patterns, shape and colors. The Gasteracantha cancriformis males are tinier while the female adults are about half an inch.
With their spine-like spines, crab-shaped and compact bodies makes these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders look very distinctive. Geographically, the color of the female Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders is different because the black-spot abdomens could be yellow or white.
Further, the spines or projections might be black or red. Further, their male counterparts may have abdomens that are gray, small spines, and white spots.�However, these spiders look like they&rsquo;re dwarfed by their circular and spreading snares. So, simply spot any spider webs at your eye-level and above particularly on shrubs, trees, and buildings.
One unique characteristic of the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders is that you&rsquo;ll note some silk tufts around the house - especially around its foundation lines. The silk turfs act to protect the spider&rsquo;s eggs and babies from humans, other animals and birds. However, the silk tufts may also attract some prey or even caution lizards.
Generally, the female Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders in the Araneidae family are considered web builders. Further, the females will mainly work to rebuild and repair the spider webs - they&rsquo;ll do this in a single location if they won&rsquo;t be disturbed. The remaining time, the females will sit waiting for any predator from which they&rsquo;ll such the animal&rsquo;s bodily fluids.</p>
<h2 id="habitat-and-food-spiny-orb-weaver-spiders-live">Habitat and Food: Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders live?</h2>
<dl>
<dt><em>Habitat</em></dt>
<dd>You&rsquo;l mainly find these bugs in southern states particularly Florida or southern California but they&rsquo;ll also inhabit different regions in the world.
As noted earlier, you&rsquo;ll mainly find these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders in residential places plus citrus groves, around houses, shrubs and trees near your house. You&rsquo;ll notice them from their color and the webs they create plus you might notice their eggs sacs.
<em>Food</em></dd>
<dd>On diet, the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders mainly feed on small insects that they&rsquo;ll capture using their intricately made webs.� Specifically, the bugs will feed on small insects such as flies, mosquitoes, beetles, and moths. The spiders will bite and paralyze the insects as they feed on their ovals.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="controllingspiny-orb-weaver-spiders">Controlling�Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders</h2>
<p>Since the spiders mainly feed on insects, it makes sense to reduce the amount of light that&rsquo;s particularly outside your house - this will keep the spiders away plus also discourage their small insects from coming near your yard and house too.
Therefore, I suggest you change the exterior lights and install &lsquo;bug lights&rsquo; that are particularity yellow in color as this will reduce the amount of light and hence the number of small insects that&rsquo;ll be flying near your yard or house in the evenings and at night.</p>
<p>Further, ensure that you clean and clear all the webs that are around the house as this will discourage the spiders from creating their webs. You might require to undertake more aggressive bugs control measure if you&rsquo;re having a massive Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders� infestation - this may include finding the eggs sacs and bug webs.
For this, I would recommend using de-webbing substances - particularly those that are organic as these will help prevent the spider webs from easily attaching on the house or bushes around the yard or lawn. This ensure that the spiders won&rsquo;t get a habitat from where they&rsquo;d hatch a re-infestation in your residence.
However, on the extreme case of infestation by the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders, simply hire the services of a professional exterminator to control the bugs. Such services might be costly but its definitely worth it as it immidietly takes the burden off your shoulders.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, are Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders Poisonous? Well, as I&rsquo;ve outlined above, these spiders can bite humans but they aren&rsquo;t aggressive or poisonous. However, the spiders will only bite when they&rsquo;re provoked as these are generally beneficial bugs in your farm or yard.
Definitely, the bites from these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders won&rsquo;t be poisonous as won&rsquo;t also cause any grave or dangerous symptoms on you body.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As homeowners, we&rsquo;re often faced with <a href="/posts/do-fake-wasps-nests-work/">wasp</a> attacks and other flying insects, especially in summer and thus it&rsquo;s critical to know all that appertains to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bees-vs-wasps-vs-hornets/">wasps, bees, and hornets</a>
.
<strong>So, what are <a href="/posts/baby-bed-bugs/">baby</a> wasps, what do they look like? Well, a baby wasp is a youngling of a wasp that&rsquo;s between the egg stage to an adult wasp; includes the larvae, pupa, and then virgin queen or young male drone.�</strong>
However, the baby wasp will be helped in their feeding activities by the�adult worker wasps until they&rsquo;re adult enough to take various responsibilities.</p>
<h2 id="details-what-do-baby-wasps-look-like">Details: What Do Baby Wasps Look Like?</h2>
<p>The wasps will move via 4 life stages to get to adulthood - these are Egg-Larvae-Pupa-Adult. However, the baby wasp is a youngling wasp that is between the stages of egg &amp; adult wasp.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the baby wasp is described as a development stage as the insect grows to become an adult.
But the baby wasp is relatively inactive, particularly in its pupae stage since it&rsquo;ll remain domain for a number of days, then change into a virgin queen or male drone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-life-cycle-of-a-wasp---wasp-larvae-hatching">The life cycle of a wasp - Wasp Larvae Hatching?</h2>
<p>Most wasps and their babies will die off during winter and fall when the temperature drops. Thus, their virgin queens will move out and get impregnated to grow the life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>The queen wasps lay their eggs at end of winter when the temperature gets normal.</li>
<li>As the environmental temperatures drop, the queen wasp and wasp males die off and then the virgin queens will get impregnated.
The impregnated virgin queens will then move out and get some other shelter that&rsquo;s appropriate during winter but the other wap colony members will die.</li>
<li>After winter, the wasps will emerge during spring and begin to create their nests that look like a honeycomb - with some small cells</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="baby-wasp-development">Baby Wasp Development</h2>
<p>After the wasp eggs are hatched to become larvae (one stage of the baby wasp), these organisms start to grow.</p>
<p>In 2 - 3 days the eggs that are laid (each queen wasps will lay an unfertilized (drone) egg in one of its nests&rsquo; cells) will hatch.</p>
<ul>
<li>The queen wasp will feed the newly-hatched larvae with some insects inside the nest cells until they&rsquo;re mature.
Within 12 - 18 days, the wasp larvae will spin some silk in the cells to encase themselves. Further, the wasp larvae will emerge from those cocoons after 12 additional days.</li>
<li>At the start of winter, those queen wasp will begin their mating period before they migrate to other places.
In the new location, those queen waps will create some shelter or nest.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-azDxgBEcY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-azDxgBEcY</a></p>
<p>Once the larvae achieve enough energy, they&rsquo;ll transform into a wasp pupa - a stage that is inactive and will stay dormant for about 1-2 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, the wasp pupa will continue storing enough energy for further development and growth.
Finally, once the wasp pupa is fully developed, these baby wasps will emerge from the shell and become young adult wasps.</li>
<li>Next, the worker wasps will continue feeding those young adult wasps for 14 - 21 days until it becomes full-growth was adults.
So, the adult female wasps will then go to lay their fertilized eggs (that will hatch to become drones).</li>
<li>The hatched drones will be tasked to gather food, feed the wasp larvae, and create a nest for the wasp colony.
Further, the wasp queen will move to other places during the mating time to avoid mating the drones in their colony (and avoid inbreeding).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-the-color-size-and-shape-of-baby-wasps">What&rsquo;s the Color, Size, and Shape of Baby Wasps?</h2>
<p>Checking the wasps&rsquo; physical appearance would help you specifically identify those baby wasps.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, you&rsquo;ll need to check some unique physical features of the wasps - you&rsquo;ll mainly locate them in their nest, shelter, or the nest.
The baby wasps will come mainly as hornets, paper wasps, and yellowjackets.
<strong>1. Shape of Baby Wasps�</strong>
Baby wasps of varied species will have different shapes. For example, the baby yellowjacket waps have a�sloped sharp end,�cone-shaped abdomen, and a narrow waist.</li>
<li>Another species is the mud dauber wasp whose baby stage has an elongated (thin) body and a while those of the paper species have long legs and a waist that is spindle-shaped.
Besides the baby wasps of the European Hornet species has a smooth (hairless) body and a narrow waist.</li>
<li>Also, the babies of this species do not turn while developing.
However, in general, the baby wasps will appear as some lump that is inactive and is in those wasp nests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-color-of-baby-wasps">2. Color of Baby Wasps</h3>
<p>The color of the baby wasps will be yellow and black including the Yellowjacket and European Paper that have an abdomen that is black &amp; yellow.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the European Hornet has a tail that has yellow strips (on black) and its thorax is reddish-brown.
In addition, the baby wasps of the mud-daubers species will have black &amp; yellow.</li>
<li>However, the color marks or stripes on the baby wasps could be tiny to be visible - you may require some microscope or hand lens.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-size-of-baby-wasps">3. Size of Baby Wasps</h3>
<p>The size of the baby wasps will be around 0.2 - 1.5 inches in length depending on the species of the wasp.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the length of the baby wasps may be different, it won&rsquo;t be longer than 1.7 inches.
Notably, even some of the adult wasp could also have the same body length.</li>
<li>But the adult wasps can be differentiated since they&rsquo;re more active than the baby wasp.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-wasps-bite-or-just-sting">Do Wasps Bite Or Just Sting?</h2>
<p>Baby wasps won&rsquo;t sting humans and pests; these organisms exist in
the larvae, the pupae, and young adult development stages - all these lack sting tissues that are well developed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notable the wasp larvae will mainly live in the wasp nest cells and thus they&rsquo;ll have less capacity to move around
Next, the pupae are described to be dormant (immobile) while those
baby wasps in the young adult stage will start learning movement on emerging from the pupa.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question of baby wasps, these organisms exist between the stages of the eggs and adult wasp.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, these will be the wasps in the larvae, pupae, and the young wasp adults (including the virgin queen and the young male drone.
The baby wasps will be fed by the worker wasps up to their maturity age. The worker wasps will work to build nests, feed the larvae wasps, and search for food.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bartonella is a type of bacteria that can cause a variety of illnesses in both humans and animals. It is often transmitted through the bites or scratches of infected animals, particularly cats, and is a major concern for people who handle animals frequently. In this article, we will explore the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options for Bartonella infection.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-bartonella">What is Bartonella?</h3>
<p>Bartonella is a genus of bacteria that includes several species known to cause disease in humans and animals. The most well-known of these is
<em>Bartonella henselae</em>
, which is responsible for causing cat scratch fever (CSD), a common illness that affects people who have been scratched or bitten by an infected cat. Other species of Bartonella, such as
<em>Bartonella bacilliformis</em>
and
<em>Bartonella quintana</em>
, are associated with more severe conditions like Carrions disease and trench fever, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-bartonella-transmitted">How is Bartonella Transmitted?</h3>
<p>Bartonella bacteria are primarily transmitted through the bites or scratches of infected animals, most commonly cats. The bacteria are present in the saliva of infected animals, and when they scratch or bite a person, the bacteria can enter the body through broken skin. Fleas and ticks can also play a role in transmitting Bartonella, as they may carry the bacteria from one animal to another.
Human-to-human transmission is extremely rare, but it is possible in certain cases, such as through blood transfusions or organ transplants. Most cases of Bartonella infection are linked to close contact with animals, particularly those that carry fleas.</p>
<h3 id="symptoms-of-bartonella-infection">Symptoms of Bartonella Infection</h3>
<p>The symptoms of Bartonella infection can vary depending on the species of bacteria involved and the severity of the infection. In many cases, symptoms appear a few days to a few weeks after exposure to an infected animal. The symptoms of cat scratch fever, caused by
<em>Bartonella henselae</em>
, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red, swollen bump or blister at the site of the scratch or bite</li>
<li>Fever and chills</li>
<li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes near the site of the infection</li>
<li>Joint pain
In more severe cases, Bartonella infection can lead to complications such as endocarditis (infection of the hearts inner lining), bacillary angiomatosis (growth of tumors in the skin, liver, and other organs), and osteomyelitis (bone infection). Symptoms of these more serious conditions may include fever, weight loss, night sweats, and severe pain in the affected area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="diagnosis-of-bartonella">Diagnosis of Bartonella</h3>
<p>Diagnosing Bartonella infection can be challenging, as its symptoms can be similar to those of other bacterial infections. A healthcare provider will typically begin by taking a detailed medical history and asking about potential exposure to animals, particularly cats. Blood tests are often used to detect the presence of Bartonella bacteria, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing can be done to identify the specific species of Bartonella.
In some cases, additional tests such as blood cultures or imaging studies may be required to determine the extent of the infection and rule out other potential causes of symptoms. If Bartonella is suspected, your doctor may also test for other conditions that share similar symptoms, such as Lyme disease or toxoplasmosis.</p>
<h3 id="treatment-of-bartonella-infection">Treatment of Bartonella Infection</h3>
<p>The treatment for Bartonella infection typically involves antibiotics. The specific antibiotic prescribed will depend on the severity of the infection and the species of Bartonella involved. Common antibiotics used to treat Bartonella include azithromycin, doxycycline, and rifampin. In severe cases, intravenous antibiotics may be required.
Its important to complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor to ensure that the infection is fully cleared from your system. In some cases, Bartonella infections may require long-term treatment, especially if complications such as endocarditis or bacillary angiomatosis are present.</p>
<h3 id="prevention-of-bartonella">Prevention of Bartonella</h3>
<p>Preventing Bartonella infection largely involves reducing the risk of exposure to infected animals. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice good hygiene, especially after handling animals. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching animals, especially cats, or their environment.</li>
<li>Use flea control methods on your pets, including regular flea treatments and keeping your pets indoors to reduce their exposure to fleas.</li>
<li>Avoid handling stray or wild animals, as they may be more likely to carry Bartonella.</li>
<li>If you have a pet cat, avoid allowing it to scratch or bite you, and seek medical attention if you are scratched or bitten by a cat.</li>
<li>Wear gloves when cleaning litter boxes or handling animals that may have fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bartonella is a group of bacteria that can cause a variety of diseases in humans, ranging from mild illnesses like cat scratch fever to more serious conditions like endocarditis. While the bacteria are primarily transmitted through bites and scratches from infected animals, particularly cats, they can also be spread by fleas and ticks. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are essential to managing Bartonella infection and preventing complications. By practicing good hygiene and reducing the risk of exposure to infected animals, you can help protect yourself from this potentially serious infection.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to dealing with pests in your home, it is important to correctly identify the type of infestation you are dealing with. <a href="/posts/how-much-do-bed-bug-exterminators-cost/">Bed</a> bugs are one of the most notorious household pests, but they are not the only ones that can cause discomfort or damage. In this article, we will compare bed bugs with other common household pests, including their behavior, signs of infestation, and methods of control. Understanding the differences between bed bugs and other pests will help you take the necessary steps to eliminate them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-bed-bugs">What Are Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) are small, flat, reddish-brown insects that feed on the blood of humans and animals. They are nocturnal and typically hide in cracks and crevices during the day, emerging at night to feed. Bed bugs are often found in places where people sleep, such as mattresses, box springs, and bed frames. Although bed bugs are not known to transmit diseases, their bites can cause itching, irritation, and allergic reactions in some people.</p>
<h3 id="common-symptoms-of-bed-bug-infestation">Common Symptoms of Bed <a href="/posts/how-to-find-bed-bugs-during-the-day/">Bug</a> Infestation</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Itchy, red bites:**Bed bugs leave bite marks that are often grouped together in a small area, typically on exposed skin.</li>
<li>**Dark spots on bedding:**Bed bug excrement appears as dark stains on sheets, mattresses, and other fabric surfaces.</li>
<li>**Visible bugs:**Bed bugs can sometimes be seen on bedding, furniture, or in cracks and crevices in walls or floors.</li>
<li>**Musty odor:**Bed bug infestations may produce a sweet, musty smell caused by the scent glands of the insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-common-household-pests">Other Common Household Pests</h3>
<p>While bed bugs are a significant concern, they are far from the only pests that can invade your home. Lets take a look at some other common household pests and how they compare to bed bugs in terms of behavior, signs of infestation, and control methods.</p>
<h4 id="1-ants">1. Ants</h4>
<p>Ants are among the most common household pests. They live in colonies and can invade homes in search of food, water, and shelter. Unlike bed bugs, ants do not feed on blood. Instead, they are attracted to sugary foods, grease, and other food remnants.</p>
<h5 id="signs-of-an-ant-infestation">Signs of an Ant Infestation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Visible trails of ants, especially near food sources.</li>
<li>Ant nests, often located in cracks, behind walls, or under flooring.</li>
<li>Frequent sightings of ants in the kitchen, pantry, or other food storage areas.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="control-methods">Control Methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Sealing cracks and gaps where ants may enter.</li>
<li>Cleaning up food spills and crumbs to remove food sources.</li>
<li>Using ant baits or insecticides to kill ants and destroy their nests.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-cockroaches">2. Cockroaches</h4>
<p>Cockroaches are resilient pests that can thrive in a variety of environments, particularly in warm, humid areas. Like bed bugs, they are nocturnal and are often found in dark, hidden places. Cockroaches feed on organic matter, including food, garbage, and even other insects.</p>
<h5 id="signs-of-a-cockroach-infestation">Signs of a Cockroach Infestation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Dark, greasy streaks along walls, floors, or countertops.</li>
<li>Small, dark droppings that resemble coffee grounds or black pepper.</li>
<li>Visible cockroaches, particularly at night.</li>
<li>Foul odor, often described as musty or oily.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="control-methods-1">Control Methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating food and water sources by keeping the home clean.</li>
<li>Sealing cracks and gaps where cockroaches can enter.</li>
<li>Using cockroach baits, traps, or insecticides to kill cockroaches.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-termites">3. Termites</h4>
<p>Termites are destructive pests that feed on wood and other cellulose-based materials. They often go undetected for long periods because they live inside walls or underground. Unlike bed bugs, termites do not feed on blood. Instead, they can cause significant structural damage to buildings if left untreated.</p>
<h5 id="signs-of-a-termite-infestation">Signs of a Termite Infestation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Hollow-sounding wood when tapped.</li>
<li>Visible mud tubes along walls or foundations.</li>
<li>Small piles of sawdust near wooden surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="control-methods-2">Control Methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Contacting a pest control professional for treatment, such as liquid termiticides or baiting systems.</li>
<li>Sealing entry points to prevent termites from entering your home.</li>
<li>Regular inspections to detect early signs of termites.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-fleas">4. Fleas</h4>
<p>Fleas are tiny, blood-sucking insects that typically infest pets, particularly cats and dogs. However, they can also infest homes if pets are not treated for fleas. Unlike bed bugs, fleas are more active and can jump long distances. Fleas can cause discomfort for both pets and humans, with bites that result in itching and irritation.</p>
<h5 id="signs-of-a-flea-infestation">Signs of a Flea Infestation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Frequent scratching or biting from pets.</li>
<li>Small, red, itchy bites on the skin, particularly around the ankles.</li>
<li>Flea dirt (small black specks) found in pet bedding or carpeting.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="control-methods-3">Control Methods:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Treating pets with flea control products.</li>
<li>Vacuuming regularly to remove fleas and eggs from carpets and upholstery.</li>
<li>Using insecticides or flea bombs in the home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-bed-bugs-compare-to-other-pests">How Bed Bugs Compare to Other Pests</h3>
<p>While bed bugs are often associated with bites and irritation, they are quite different from other pests in terms of their feeding habits, hiding places, and control methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Feeding:**Bed bugs are the only pests on this list that feed exclusively on blood. Other pests like ants, cockroaches, and fleas feed on food or organic matter, while termites feed on wood.</li>
<li>**Signs of Infestation:**Bed bugs leave distinct bite marks, dark spots on bedding, and a musty odor. In contrast, other pests like ants and cockroaches leave trails or droppings, while termites cause visible damage to wood.</li>
<li>**Control:**While bed bugs require targeted treatment such as professional extermination, other pests like ants, cockroaches, and fleas may be managed with over-the-counter treatments, cleaning, and sealing cracks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Identifying and controlling household pests is essential to maintaining a comfortable and safe living environment. While bed bugs are a significant concern, other pests like ants, cockroaches, termites, and fleas can also cause harm and inconvenience. Each pest requires different control methods, so it is important to understand the characteristics and behaviors of the pests you are dealing with. If you suspect a bed bug infestation or any other pest problem, it is advisable to contact a pest control professional for an accurate assessment and effective treatment.</p>

<h2 id="best-concrete-driveway-cleaner--buying-guide">Best Concrete Driveway Cleaner  Buying Guide</h2>
<p>Not all cleaning agents are ideal for cleaning concrete driveways. Unlike other types of floors, concrete contains small holes which conventional cleaners cannot penetrate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thats why you require specialized cleaners meant to penetrate and lift the stains from the surfaces of concrete floors.</li>
<li>Therere many concrete cleaners in the market to choose from. So, you may be lost in choice when searching for the best cleaner for your driveway.
But there are a few important factors you should consider before you make a decision.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-type-of-cleaner">1. Type of cleaner</h3>
<p>Concrete cleaners can be categorized into two depending on their intended use. They can be either PH cleaners or bacterial cleaners.
a. Bacterial or Enzymatic Cleaners
Bacterial cleaners are recent entrants into the world of cleaning solutions. Also known as oxidation /enzymatic cleaners, these products make use of hungry micro-organisms which feed on a variety of stains.
Notably, bacterial cleaners will be the best choice for cleaning stains such as grease, oil, and another type of hydrocarbons.
Unlike other types of cleaners, bacterial cleaners leave little or no residue on surfaces. Thus, no brushing or further cleaning is required.
The only limitation is that they require repeated use for them to be effective. Also, the cleaning action takes some time compared to the PH cleaners.
b. PH Cleaners
PH cleaners can either be acidic, neutral, or alkaline.
Acidic cleaners are used to remove stains that dissolve in acidic solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the efflorescence caused by hard water can be cleaned using acidic cleaners.</li>
<li>Alkaline solutions are ideal for cleaning stubborn stains such as grease and oil.
The hydrocarbon chains in these substances are broken down to allow for easy removal with a brush or pressure washing.
Neutral PH cleaners are mostly used where the stain is not embedded on the surface.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-type-of-use">2. Type of Use</h3>
<p>You might have cleaning difficulties in your concrete driveway as well as other places like the kitchen floor, patio among others.
So, it might do you good to go for a product that will get rid of stains from most of your surfaces.
Luckily, most of the products in the market are designed for cleaning a number of surfaces. They often come with a list of surfaces they can clean or labels such as multipurpose.</p>
<h3 id="3-safety">3. Safety</h3>
<p>The safety of your family and animals comes first when choosing the right cleaning agents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the concrete cleaners in the market conform to the safety standards for human handling.</li>
<li>If theres a possible risk such as skin or eye irritation, manufacturers usually indicate so on the label.
Theres also a current trend to manufacture products that do no or little harm to the environment. So, it is important to go for cleaners that are safe for humans, animals, and the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-quantity">4. Quantity</h3>
<p>The amount of cleaner you need for satisfactory results depends on the type of cleaner, type of stain, and the space you want to clean.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some cleaners require only a small amount of application while others require large amounts.
It will be of good benefit to buying enough for the current project and for future use.
If you have a large driveway, go for bulk packaging to save on the cost.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although therere plenty of concrete driveway cleaners in the market, not all of them will do as they claim.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the above list contains some of the popular brands in the market.
So, depending on your preferences and budget you can choose any of these products to help you bring a new look to your concrete driveway.</li>

<h2 id="consideration-for-buying-dump-carts"><strong>Consideration for Buying Dump Carts</strong></h2>
<p>Dump carts go come in various designs, materials, and sizes. When choosing the best dump cart, you might be lost for choice because of the offers in the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to make your hauling activities a lot easier and enjoyable, you need a high-quality and efficient dump cart.
Therere a number of factors to consider when searching for the best dump cart for your garden or lawn. These include:</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-material-used-">**1. Material Used **</h3>
<p>The demand and popularity of dump carts have triggered manufacturers to come up with innovative designs for the modern gardener.</p>
<ul>
<li>They come in different sizes, designs, and qualities. Of course, what you get will depend on the amount of money youre willing to spend.
Cheaper dump carts are made with low-quality materials. But if you dont know how to tell the difference, you may settle for poor quality.
Low-quality dump carts may not take you for more than two years. So, if you are not working on a tight budget, go to the high-quality dump cart.
Below are the different types of dump carts, depending on the material used.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="i-plastic-dump-carts-">**(i) Plastic Dump Carts� **</h4>
<p><strong>Poly Tub Dump Cart</strong>
The poly tub type of cart is the most popular among homeowners. They are molded from high-quality plastics such as polypropylene or polyethylene.</p>
<ul>
<li>This makes them durable and less prone to cracks or deformities.</li>
<li>The poly tub is water-proof, allowing you to haul manure and other messy loads without spilling them on your compound.
Poly material is also resistant to corrosion and is quite easy to clean.
They are ideal for carrying both light and heavy loads.
<strong>Plastic Tub Dump Cart</strong>
Plastic tub carts resemble poly tub carts in design and appearance. The only difference is that the plastic material used in its construction is of lower quality than polypropylene or polyethylene.</li>
<li>The plastic material tends to distort and wear out easily. It can also be affected by UV degradation.
Thus, its not the ideal dump cart in hauling heavy loads. Its less expensive and easy to clean.
<strong>Structural Form dump cart</strong>
This type of dump cart features a low-density polymer bed on a steel frame.</li>
<li>The polymer material makes it tough and durable. Thus, it will be free from scratches and stains.
They come with reinforced slots or pockets on the sides for inserting extensions. This allows you to carry bulky loads that need more space.
Due to the high-quality materials, this dump cart will cost you $250 or more.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ii-metal-dump-carts-">**(ii) Metal Dump Carts **</h4>
<p><strong>Steel Tub Dump Cart</strong>
Another type of dump cart is one whose frame and tub are entirely made of steel.
They are sturdy and more durable than both poly and plastic tub carts. With this type of cart, you will be able to carry heavy loads such as gravel, ballast, etc.
A notable feature in this type of dump cart is the removable tailgate. This allows you to unload stuff conveniently without having to use a shovel.
The only setback is their susceptibility to rust since most of them are not built with stainless steel. Also, theyre not very easy to clean.
Theyre relatively expensive than the poly tub carts and will cost $150 - $500. But this is a worthy investment owing to their robustness and durability.</p>
<h3 id="2-load"><strong>2. Load</strong></h3>
<p>Whether youre buying a dump cart in a particular need or for general use, your equipment should withstand loads.</p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum load will depend on the strength of the frame. So, you might opt for heavy-duty carts, which can haul larger loads, or light-duty implements to help you transport small loads.</li>
<li>Typically heavy-duty dump carts can haul about 1500 pounds. But, if all you want is to carry manure and waste material from your landscaping activities, you can get a smaller one.
However, I would recommend you to go for a multipurpose dump cart because it can handle both small and heavy loads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-capacity"><strong>3. Capacity</strong></h3>
<p>Capacity is measured in cubic feet. Unlike the load capability, capacity will depend on the size, shape, and design of the tub /bucket.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your choice of dump cart depends on the type of materials you want to haul.</li>
<li>For instance, bulky materials such as hay require large-capacity rather than higher load capacity.
Generally, the available dump carts will carry ten cubic feet to 22 cubic feet. Those with provisions for extensions allow you to carry more volume.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-towingpulling-vehicle"><strong>4. Towing/Pulling Vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>Dump carts can be towed by a number of vehicles, including lawn tractors, ATVs, UTVs, garden mowers, among others.
Normally, lightweight dump carts are meant to be towed by small vehicles such as lawnmowers.
Therefore, its essential to choose your dump cart depending on the type of vehicle you want to use for towing. Most of the available dump carts will be compatible with most of your vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="5-mobility"><strong>5. Mobility</strong></h3>
<p>Another important feature to consider is the maneuverability of the dump carts on surfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is greatly determined by the wheels. Large tires make it possible to ride over rugged surfaces without getting stuck.
Well-treaded wheels are ideal for all surfaces, including wet and muddy tracks.
Pneumatic tires are the most preferred because of their ability to absorb shocks. Also, wider tires will provide good stability compared to thinner tires.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-features-to-consider"><strong>Other Features to consider</strong></h3>
<p>Some dump carts come with additional features that give them an edge over others in the market.
Of great importance is the ease of dumping from load from the tub. For this, various brands have different mechanisms for lifting the tub to dump the load. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>*Hydraulic lift:*Its the most preferred lifting mechanism due to its effectiveness. It gives you an easy and effortless way of dumping loads from your cart.</li>
<li><em>Electric lift</em>: It is not very common. It utilizes electricity to help people remove heavy loads from the dump cart.</li>
<li>*Swivel:*A swivel is a configuration of the dump cart, which allows you to rotate the tub to dump the load in a convenient area.</li>
<li>*Manual Lift:*With this type of dump cart, you lift the tub manually using the handle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The best dump carts for lawn tractors will make your lawn maintenance and gardening activities easier and enjoyable. They come in various sizes, designs, and qualities.</p>
<ul>
<li>The suitability of a dump cart will entirely depend on the type and amount of load you want to haul.
Whether you want a heavy or light-duty dump cart, go for the quality. This will get your job done quickly and with less hustle.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-portable-air-compressor-for-jeep"><strong>How to Choose the Best Portable Air Compressor for Jeep</strong></h2>
<p>Having a high performance air compressor on board your jeep can improve your overall confidence when you hit the road. However, finding an appropriate portable air compressor can be quite challenging because of the numerous offers in the market.
Thus, there are some important considerations you should make before settling on a compressor for your jeep. These include:</p>
<h3 id="size"><strong>Size</strong></h3>
<p>The size of your air compressor determines the ease with which you can move it around or load in your vehicle. A compact and lightweight equipment is preferred because it can be conveniently loaded in the car.</p>
<h3 id="performance"><strong>Performance</strong></h3>
<p>The performance of your air compressor depends on its rated maximum psi levels and flow rate. Higher psi levels allows you to inflate heavy duty tires. Flow rate refers to the amount of liters pumped into the tire per minute. The higher the flow rate, the lesser the time you take to inflate the tire.
For your jeep, consider air compressors with a minimum of 80 psi.</p>
<h3 id="accessories"><strong>Accessories</strong></h3>
<p>Consider an air compressor that comes with the necessary accessories to avoid incurring extra costs. The most important of these accessories include a hose, power cord and inflation valves/tips.
The air hose and power cord should be of appropriate length to enable you attend to all the tires with convenience. In addition, they should be made from heavy duty materials so that they do not wear out after a while.
You might also opt for one that comes with a carry bag. Carry bags are designed for storing the compressor and its accessories.</p>
<h3 id="versatility"><strong>Versatility</strong></h3>
<p>Its a good idea to get an equipment that will enable you to inflate your jeep and also serve other purposes. You might need compressed air for inflating tires of other vehicles, bicycle, motorcycle, bed or soccer balls.�Compressed air can also be used to clean equipment or gadgets such as electronics.</p>
<h3 id="display"><strong>Display</strong></h3>
<p>Ensure your air compressor comes with an accurate display. This allows you to accurately monitor the tire pressure to avoid over inflation. If you prefer an analog display, make sure the gauge has small graduations to enable accurate pressure readings.
Some air compressors come with both analog and digital displays. Thus, youre able to read the pressure accurately and easily.</p>
<h3 id="safety"><strong>Safety</strong></h3>
<p>The air compressor should have the necessary safety devices to protect the user and prevent equipment damage. For instance, some compressors allows you to set the required pressure for which pumping will stop automatically.
Different brands of air compressors have different runtimes for which cooling is required. Some are equipped with thermal protectors which automatically stops the motor in case of undesirable heating. The motor switches on automatically once the required working temperature is attained.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Power and speed are the most important things you need in a portable air compressor. This helps you keep your jeep tires always inflated no matter where youre.
Also, durability of the equipment is of great importance. An equipment that is made with durable materials will go for many years without major break downs.
So, depending on your budget and preferences, youll get a reliable product from the above list.

Check if the vehicle is fitted or secured with a safety mechanism that helps it to stop when it hits an obstacle.
There are several hazards a child is likely to face while riding, like crashes or tipping over. Ensure that your child is secured firmly on the car and remove all obstacles like chairs on their way.
It is also advisable to cover your child with protective gear, like a helmet, or a seat belt especially if they are riding outside. However, most ride-on-toys do not include such protective devices.

<h3 id="factors-to-consider-when-choosing-a-mower-for-hills">Factors to Consider When Choosing a Mower for Hills</h3>
<p>Selecting the right mower for hilly terrain involves more than just picking the most powerful machine. Here are some important factors to weigh:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Traction:**Hills require mowers with excellent traction. Look for large rear wheels and, ideally, rear-wheel or all-wheel drive systems to maintain control on slopes.</li>
<li>**Engine Power or Motor Strength:**Gas mowers should have a strong engine capable of handling inclines, while cordless mowers need high-voltage batteries and efficient brushless motors.</li>
<li>**Weight Distribution:**A mower thats evenly balanced reduces the risk of tipping over on steep grades. Models designed for hills typically have a lower center of gravity.</li>
<li>**Ease of Use:**Self-propelled mowers take much of the strain out of mowing on a slope. Adjustable handles and intuitive controls can also make a big difference.</li>
<li>**Durability:**Tough decks (preferably steel or composite materials) and reliable components ensure your mower can endure the extra demands of sloped terrain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-safely-mow-hilly-lawns">How to Safely Mow Hilly Lawns</h3>
<p>Safety should be your top priority when mowing on hills. Sloped lawns present unique hazards, so follow these guidelines to stay safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Mow Across the Slope:**Always mow side-to-side across a hill rather than up and down. This reduces the chance of the mower tipping over backward.</li>
<li>**Avoid Wet Grass:**Wet grass can be extremely slippery, reducing traction and increasing the chance of slipping or losing control of the mower.</li>
<li>**Use Proper Footwear:**Wear shoes or boots with excellent grip to maintain your footing on slopes.</li>
<li>**Clear Debris:**Remove any rocks, sticks, or other debris from the mowing area to avoid unexpected obstacles that could cause tipping or accidents.</li>
<li>**Stay Alert:**Always stay focused while mowing and avoid distractions. Keep a firm grip on the mower and adjust your speed as needed.</li>
<li>**Keep Others Away:**Ensure that children and pets are kept at a safe distance while you mow, especially on tricky terrain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Maintaining a hilly lawn doesnt have to be a daunting or exhausting chore. With the right walk-behind mower, you can tackle even the steepest slopes with confidence and ease. Whether you opt for the powerful reliability of the
<strong>Honda HRX217K5VKA</strong>
, the robust durability of the

<strong>Greenworks Pro</strong>
, or the technologically advanced

The symptoms of a black spider bite will include diaphragm paralysis, muscle aches, hypertension, challenges breathing, abdominal pain, back pain, profuse sweating, and nausea.</li>
<li>You can minimize the negative health impact and pain caused by black widow spiders by using an anti-venom.
Annually about 2,500 humans report having been bitten by black widows and getting relief from antivenoms.</li>
<li>The black widow venom is only recommended for people who are pregnant, those with high blood pressure, or humans with troubled breathing.
The Black widow bites anti-venom first came up in the 1930s and horses are the main animals used in the research.

<h3 id="2-where-can-you-find-the-black-widows">2. Where Can You Find The Black Widows?</h3>
<p>The black widows or the Latrodectus spiders will occupy temperate areas including those in South America, Africa, Australia, Asia, South Europe, and North America.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Black widows have been mainly occupying the grasslands deserts and forests which are largely in the West and South areas in the United States.
The black widows win spin webs outside of inside buildings, especially in the corners and areas near homes occupied by humans.</li>
<li>Black riddles will hide in woodpiles and crevices plus other secluded areas that have darkness.
In the house, these spiders will hide areas such as cluttered places, closets, basements, dark corners, and garages.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3items--foods-eaten-by-the-black-widows">3.�Items / Foods Eaten By the Black Widows.</h3>
<p>Just like with other spiders the Black widows will mainly feed on various arthropods such as scorpions, cockroaches, beetles, grasshoppers, and ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the Black widow may trap flies using their webs and eat them.
Also, these spiders will feed on various insects and spiders that are trapped in their webs.
Experts note that the rumor about sexual cannibalism is untrue since the females of the black widows don&rsquo;t eat the mates.</li>
<li>The black widow species that will feed on the mates mainly occupies the Southern hemisphere.
But the newborns of the black widows are known to eat their siblings that are freshly hatched.
Besides eating arachnids climbing and flying insects, the spiders will also feed on small vertebrates like lizards and snakes.
After the prey is tangled into the web of the black widows, a spider will inject venom into it and was paralyze the animal.</li>
<li>Next, the spider will release its digestive enzymes on the animal&rsquo;s body before carrying it off for their meal
As noted above, the black widows will release their digestive system externally onto their prey.
The digestion process in the spiders will take place outside their bodies.</li>
<li>The digestive enzymes will liquefier and soften the prey&rsquo;s body before a spider takes it in.
But how long will the Black widows survive with food to take?</li>
<li>When the black widow like I just made us will only leave for a few months without taking food.</li>
<li>However, some species of the Black widow are documented to live up to a year without food.

<h2 id="species-of-the-black-widow">Species of the Black Widow</h2>
<p>The Latrodectus genius (that includes the black widows) has 31 species with the black widows being five species among them.</p>
<ul>
<li>North America is home to three species referred to as the black widows; Latrodectus mactans ( the southern species), Latrodectus variolus (the northern species), and the Latrodectus hesperus (the western species).
Scientific evidence shows that a black widow is classified in the Theridiidae family (the comb-footed spiders).</li>
<li>This is because these spiders have some short and stiff hairs and the last parts of their rear legs and these parts look like comb teeth.</li>
<li>The spiders use these comb-like hairs for draping silk as the arachnid wraps it.
The Latrodectus genus also has brown widows and red windows.
In all the black widow species just the female ones have dangerous bites. Despite being known as and come arachnids the Latrodectus will defend themselves aggressively but may finally unleash their venomous bites.</li>
<li>The 32 species of these arachnids have occupied all the continents worldwide except in Antarctica.

</ul>
<h2 id="reproduction-in-the-black-widows">Reproduction in the Black Widows</h2>
<p>Except when mating during late spring, the Black widows are largely solitary arachnids - this information comes from the National geographic.
The Black widows have a unique mating process, which was anything as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The male black widow will spin silk as they prepare for mating.</li>
<li>Next, they will soak the silk with their sperms and wrap it around deer park appendages (around their head area)</li>
<li>Finally, they will begin searching for a receptive female black widow and then insert their sperm-soaked palps into the female reproductive hole.
A female black spider will make egg sacs (papery ones) and this will have eggs in hundreds, and they will hatch within one month.
The newly hatched spiders will be pale yellow or whitish but will become darker as they molt to the next stage.
The female black spiders will achieve their maturity in about 3 months and we&rsquo;ll leave for 6 months.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the male black windows will mature in 2 and a half months and will leave for about 3.5 months.
But, as reported by
<a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Latrodectus_mactans/">Animal Diversity</a>
, the Black widows known as the latrodectus mactans can survive for up to 4 years while caged all up to 3 years well in the wild.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bites of the black widows are considered venomous but will really cause death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the female black widows are known to contain venom but will only release it when they are cornered and their life is threatened.
The bite of a black widow will feel like a pinprick but its alpha-latrotoxin venom will overwhelm your nerve cells very fast causing intense pain and swelling.</li>
<li>The side effects of bites where the black widows will include diaphragm paralysis, back and abdomen pain, excessive sweating, and nausea.
You can use an anti-venom against the black widow bite and this will assist in minimizing the damage caused to your body.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Borax is a popular and effective solution for controlling ants, especially outdoors. It disrupts the ants digestive system, ultimately eliminating them and their colonies. Heres a guide on how to use borax effectively to deal with ants in your yard or garden.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-borax-for-ants-outside">How to Use Borax for Ants Outside</h2>
<h3 id="1-understand-how-borax-works">1. Understand How Borax Works</h3>
<p>Borax, a naturally occurring mineral, is toxic to ants but safe for humans and pets when used correctly. Ants are attracted to borax-based bait, which they carry back to their colony, effectively poisoning the queen and other members over time.</p>
<h3 id="2-prepare-borax-bait">2. Prepare Borax Bait</h3>
<p>To create an effective <a href="/posts/ant-control-in-bellingham/">ant</a> bait, mix <a href="/posts/borax-flea-killer/">borax</a> with a sweet attractant such as sugar, honey, or syrup. Heres a simple recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 1 tablespoon of borax with 3 tablespoons of sugar or honey.</li>
<li>Add enough water to create a thick paste.</li>
<li>Place the mixture on small pieces of cardboard or in shallow containers near ant trails.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-place-the-bait-strategically">3. Place the Bait Strategically</h3>
<p>Locate ant trails or areas with heavy ant activity outside. Place the borax bait along these paths, near anthills, or around the perimeter of your garden. Ensure the bait is out of reach of pets and small children.</p>
<h3 id="4-monitor-and-replenish">4. Monitor and Replenish</h3>
<p>Check the bait regularly to ensure it hasnt dried out or been consumed entirely. Replenish as needed until you notice a significant reduction in ant activity. This process may take a few days to a week for full colony elimination.</p>
<h3 id="5-use-borax-in-a-spray-solution">5. Use Borax in a Spray Solution</h3>
<p>If youre dealing with a widespread infestation, a borax spray can help target larger areas. Mix 1 tablespoon of borax with 1 cup of warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and apply it directly to anthills, nests, or trails.</p>
<h3 id="safety-precautions">Safety Precautions</h3>
<p>While borax is generally safe, follow these precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep borax and bait away from food preparation areas and water sources.</li>
<li>Avoid applying borax directly to edible plants or crops.</li>
<li>Wear gloves when handling borax to prevent skin irritation.</li>
<li>Store borax in a secure place, away from children and pets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages-of-using-borax-for-ant-control">Advantages of Using Borax for Ant Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Effective Colony Elimination:**Borax targets the entire colony, including the queen, ensuring long-term control.</li>
<li>**Eco-Friendly:**Borax is a natural product, making it a safer alternative to chemical pesticides.</li>
<li>**Cost-Effective:**A small amount of borax goes a long way in controlling ant infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-to-seek-professional-help">When to Seek Professional Help</h3>
<p>For severe infestations or if borax doesnt seem to work, consider contacting a pest control professional. They can assess the situation and provide targeted solutions for your specific needs.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using borax for ants outside is a simple, effective, and affordable solution for managing outdoor ant problems. By preparing the bait correctly and placing it strategically, you can eliminate ant colonies and protect your garden or yard. Always follow safety guidelines when handling borax, and enjoy an ant-free outdoor space.</p>

, or
mango
.
But most of us wonder; which food or snacks should your avoid or give to beardies? Well,
bearded dragons eat a variety of foods
like fruits, vegetables or commercial foods.
<em>But can bearded dragons eat apple? Yes, bearded dragons will eat apples. However, for a healthy diet, peel the apple&rsquo;s skin and cut the fruit into small pieces.�</em>
<strong>Ensure the Caution - only feed apples like a treat because excessive apples will lead to runny stools.�</strong>
<strong>Apples are a source of nutrients including vitamin C, proteins, fiber and so on. Apples also contain a lot of water which helps in hydrating your beardies.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="bearded-dragons-and-the-apples"><strong>Bearded Dragons and the Apples��</strong></h2>
<p>Apples make a very good diet for bearded dragons like

. Apples are good for because of their high nutrition value. But peel the apple fruit first before feeding on the beardies.
Notably apples are a good source of vitamin C, protein, fiber, carbs and so on. Though bearded dragons require small amounts of vitamin C, its a vital component of their diet.
Improperly or unpeeled apples fed onto the bearded dragon could cause impaction. Also, give the apples as snacks - in small bits to avoid running stools. You can give bearded dragons water from some bowl.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ITWqNQyuU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ITWqNQyuU</a>
Deficiency in vitamin C can cause stomatitis, bleeding gums, bruising of skin. Bearded dragons or reptiles exhibiting such conditions are usually treated using vitamin C - known this to properly
<a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/other-pets/bearded-dragon-stats-facts/">care for your bearded dragon</a>
.
Apples consist about 86% water. That gives you a perfect means of hydrating your bearded dragon. Notably these creatures drink little water and most of them dont even know how to drink water from a bowl. In fact, it takes time to train your beardie how to drink water. However, when you feed then with apples, you dont have to worry about dehydration.
Apples meant for bearded dragons need to be washed properly to remove chemicals used for pest control. Ingesting pesticides can make your beardie very sick or even result to death. In addition, apples should be peeled and sliced into very thin slices to make it easy for them to chew.

<h3 id="can-baby-bearded-dragons-eat-apples"><strong>Can Baby Bearded Dragons Eat Apples?</strong></h3>
<p>You can feed your baby bearded dragon on apples but not on a regular basis. The diet of baby bearded dragons should consist of 80% animal protein since they are still in their growing stage.
So, they should be fed more on insects such as roaches, worms, crickets and so on.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tqQijUN0Dw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tqQijUN0Dw</a>
Their plant protein diet should only be 20%. Therefore, baby bearded dragons should be fed with minimal amounts of apples. This applies to other fruits and vegetables.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-apple-skins">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Apple Skins?</h2>
<p>Well, bearded dragons will eat apples as part of their diet. However, don&rsquo;t feed the apple skins or peels to the bearded dragons as this may cause trigger runny stools.
Also, cut the apples into small bits after peeling their skins. Because bearded dragons won&rsquo;t chew properly, the small bites makes it easy to eat and equally delicious.
Bearded dragons won&rsquo;t easily eat the apple skins or peels. The pets are unable to properly digest the apples skins and thus you&rsquo;ll need to avoid feeding them on your beardies.

<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-drink-apple-juice"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Drink Apple Juice?</strong></h3>
<p>Apples are very enticing to bearded dragons. So, they wont resist the taste of apple juice. However, they should be given small amounts of apple juice because its sugary drink.
Too much sugar isnt good for a bearded dragons stomach. It causes loose stool thus leading to a lot of mess in their cage.�You can take advantage of the sweetness in apple juice to teach your bearded dragon how to drink water from a bowl.
Beardies are not used to drinking water from a pool when in the wild. They normally hydrate from their diet which mainly consists of plants and insects.
Adding apple juice to the beardies water bowl makes the water a little bit tasty. Your pet will get lured to the flavoured water and with time it will get used to using the water bowl even without the flavour.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-green-apples"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Green Apples?</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the apples appear red in color. But theres also a green apple going by the name Granny Smith Apple. Bearded dragons will eat all types of apples regardless of color.
Their differences in nutrition content are negligible, with the green apple having higher protein, iron and potassium content.
The only notable difference is their taste. Red apples are sweeter while green apples have a sour taste. Also, green apples have a slightly greater fiber content compared to the red apples.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-apple-peels"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Apple Peels?</strong></h3>
<p>Fruit peels including apple peels should not be given to bearded dragons for two reasons. First, bearded dragons have a delicate digestive system which cannot effectively digest apple peels. Chewing the peels also proves difficult for these tender creatures.
Another reason why you should not feed your beardie on apple peels is that the skin might contain chemicals sprayed on apples. Ingesting such chemicals can lead to illness or even death.

<h3 id="how-to-feed-bearded-dragon-with-apples"><strong>How to Feed Bearded Dragon with Apples</strong></h3>
<p>Some bearded dragons take some time to get accustomed to a new diet or environment. As a result you might notice that your beardie isnt eating apples.
But with some effort and trick you can easily get your
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">bearded dragon to start eating</a>
apples.�Follow these steps to prepare and teach your beardie to eat apples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash the apples to remove dirt and any chemicals used as pesticides.</li>
<li>Peel off the skin using a knife or vegetable peeler. Ensure you dont lose too much of the flesh. If this is too much work, you can get a mini peeler to help you peel apples in a short time.</li>
<li>Slice the apples into very thin pieces. Bearded dragons wont be able to chew large chunks of apples. For baby beardies, the pieces should be even smaller.</li>
<li>You can chop a sizeable amount of apples and store in the refrigerator for future use. But of course you should defrost the pieces before feeding. When feeding your beardie with apples from the freezer sprinkle some thiamin powder since freezing causes a reduction in thiamin.</li>
<li>Place the pieces in a shallow bowl so that your beardie can easily see whats inside.
If youre giving them apples for the first time, they might refuse to eat. In this case, you can teach them to eat apples through hand-feeding. You can touch the beardies mouth with a piece of apple so that it gets a taste of the sweetness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Apples are an ideal diet for bearded dragons in addition to other plants like vegetables. Other than being a source of vitamins and fibre, apples are less acidic which makes them good for beardies.
When feeding your beardie on apples, ensure that they are thoroughly cleaned, peeled and chopped into small pieces. Plus do not overfeed your pet on apples.
Therere plenty of other foods you can give to your beardie including insects and leafy vegetables. In particular, baby beardies should be given very small amounts of apples.</p>

      <description>Bananas (*musa spp)*</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hort.ufl.edu/trees/MUSSPPA.pdf">Bananas (<em>musa spp)</em></a>
are widely eaten at homes in cooked form or as snacks when ripe. It concerns many whether
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/">bearded dragons can feed</a>
on bananas, whether ripe or raw. May be you even wonders if banana peels, leaves or stems can be used to feed these lizards.
<em>So, can bearded dragon eat bananas? The direct answer is YES!� Bearded dragons will comfortably feed on bananas whether ripe or unripe. Bananas have rich vitamin composition (needed to boost immunity), high dietary fibers (specially unripe bananas  which prevents constipation), high potassium content (needed to regulate blood pressure and kidney stones).�</em>
<em>Bananas have strong antioxidants (dopamine, catechins  reduces heart diseases), low salt and sugar content (especially unripe bananas- which reduces diabetes and teeth decay), low water level (that reduce over hydration) as well as rich mineral components such as folate, iron, niacin, riboflavin, magnesium, manganese &amp; calcium, which improves growth and development of bones, tissues and organs.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas-7-secrets">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?? 7 Secrets</h2>
<p><strong>Yes, but</strong>
bananas shouldnt be fed as the main meal since they contain low calcium: phosphorous ratio (leads to metabolic bone disease). These are the key considerations in
<a href="https://www.texvetpets.org/article/bearded-dragons-cold-blooded-companions/">caring for beaded dragons</a>
.
They have relatively high sugar level (some ripe bananas � causing diabetes) as well as low glycemic index (controls carbs uptake into the bloodstream). Controlled and supplemented banana feeding is therefore required.</p>
<h3 id="1-rich-vitamin-composition">1. Rich Vitamin Composition</h3>
<p>Bananas are rich in vitamin A (10.67mg - which is necessary for normal vision, boosts reproduction and immune system), vitamin B1 (that helps in breakdown of carbohydrates to give energy on your beardie as well as boost nerve signals).
Bananas also have vitamin B6 (0.4mg-needed for creation of red blood cells and metabolism of protein &amp; fat) and vitamin C (8.4mg-necessary for growth &amp; development as well as repair of all worn out body tissues).
Ripe bananas have more vitamins than starch as compared to unripe ones, especially Williams and apple banana species. Related -
Can Bearded Dragons Eat Grapes?</p>
<h3 id="2-high-dietary-fibers">2. High Dietary fibers</h3>
<p>Bananas have a high dietary fiber-mainly pectin (thats water-soluble) which is needed to prevent constipation. For every 100g of banana meal, there is 3.1g of both soluble and insoluble fibers that helps lower cardiovascular disease CVD and coronary heart disease CHD.
Notably, unripe bananas have high fibers than ripe ones and at times are difficult for your beardie to digest. It is required that you feed your beardie with bananas that are just about to ripen so that you may acquire maximum nutrients from either side (ripe and unripe).
Though edible, green bananas should, least be used as meal for your beardie as it draws a lot of water during digestion thus leading to constipation on excess feeding.</p>
<h3 id="3-high-potassium-content">3. High Potassium Content</h3>
<p>For every 100g of banana fruits, there is 422mg to 453mg of potassium mineral on average. This quantity is quite high as compared to other fruits such as grapes, mangoes or apricots.
Potassium mainly regulates fluid balance, nerve signals and enables smooth muscle contraction of your beardie. NB: Ripe bananas have more potassium content that unripe ones.
In addition, high potassium in bananas will help reduce water retention in the body and lower blood pressure of your beardie. Importantly, potassium will protect your beardie against kidney stones and osteoporosis/stroke.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFL6Bmecvxs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFL6Bmecvxs</a></p>
<h3 id="4-strong-antioxidant">4. Strong Antioxidant</h3>
<p>Bananas (especially Cavendish species) are considered to have high antioxidants such as dopamine, cetachins and gallocatechins. Gallocatechins will help reduce cholesterol (that cause clogging of inner lumen of blood vessels) accumulation in your beardie by breaking any cholesterol traces.
On the other hand, dopamine will enhance oxidation of low-density lipoproteins and reduce plasma oxidative stress.
Importantly, the Trans-� carotene and cetachins found in bananas will further help reduce heart diseases and generative illness that may attack your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="5-low-salt-and-sugar-content">5. Low Salt and Sugar content</h3>
<p>Apple bananas, cooking banana and Williamss banana species have low salts and sugar levels, especially when raw. There is actually 4.5mg to 12mg sugar for every 145g of banana fruits.
Starch in unripe bananas inhibits salts and sugar concentration - just like with
Cucumbers
. However, as these bananas ripen, the sugar and salt levels increases.
Excess sugar in some ripe banana species such as red bananas will cause insulin resistance that lead to diabetes mellitus/insipidus in your beardie or cause obesity. In addition, sugar accumulation on their teeth will cause teeth decay.
Low salt in the blood is needed for healthy beardies life since excess salt will cause water retention and high blood pressure, which may lead to stroke or heart attack.</p>
<h3 id="6-low-water-level">6. Low Water Level</h3>
<p>As compared to other fruits such as mangoes, pawpaw, grapes or berries, bananas have far low water content. On average, bananas contain 34.5% to 59.2% water, which is mixed with solid carbs and calories content.
Unripe bananas (especially plantains and red species) have a higher water content that reduces as the banana ripens. Read too -
Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cantaloupe?
.
Low water content in necessary to reduce over hydration on your beardie. Excess water causes runny/watery poo, drooling, kidney failure as well as osmotic imbalance in your bearded dragon.
The water content in bananas, unlike in other fruits, is store in combined form thus will only be used after the food is completely digested.</p>
<h3 id="7-rich-mineral-content">7. Rich Mineral Content</h3>
<p>Bananas are rich in minerals such as Iron (which prevents anemia), Calcium (5mg  for strengthening of bones and teeth), Magnesium (27mg), Zinc (0.2mg), Sodium (1mg) and Manganese (0.3 mg) for every 100g of bananas.
These minerals will help boost growth and development of body tissues of your beardie as well as boost its immunity.</p>
<h3 id="8-no-cholesterol-and-improves-insulin-sensitivity">8. No cholesterol and improves insulin sensitivity</h3>
<p>Most banana species such as Cavendish and Williams are cholesterol free. This means that your beardie wont suffer from cholesterol associated disease such as heart failure or arteries clogging/thrombosis, which lead to death of many bearded dragons.
In addition, ripe bananas improves insulin sensitivity making it quick acting and thus reducing chances of diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure on your beardie.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragon-eat-bananas-peels-stems-and-leaves"><strong>Can Bearded Dragon Eat Bananas Peels, Stems and Leaves?</strong></h2>
<p>Most beardie species will eat banana peels and leaves but not banana stems. Actually, banana peels contain vitamin B6 (which protect Type 2 diabetes, weight loss), vitamin B12, polyphenol and carotenoids, which boost health immunity of your beardie.
Normally, feed your beardie with fresh peels of ripe bananas. Unripe banana peels are highly rejected by most beardie species.
Banana peels are not beardies favorite, therefore, your will need to mix chopped pieces with other fruits like grapes, guavas or main meals.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-bananas-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to prepare Bananas for your bearded dragon.</h2>
<p>Follow the following procedure when preparing bananas for your bearded dragon.</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest bananas while unripe and separate them from stalk.</li>
<li>Allow them to drip water for two to three days if you intend to feed your beardie when they are still raw.</li>
<li>You can keep them for one or two weeks (until they near ripening) in open air without adding any substance that may quicken ripening process - this will help maintain high nutrients content available.</li>
<li>Clean them with warm or treated water before peeling to remove any chemical or poisonous insects such as fireflies that may be on the skin.</li>
<li>Peel the bananas and chop them into small pieces that are not larger than the space between the beardies eyes.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can chop the bananas without peeling after cleaning  however, some beardie species wont eat bananas with peels.</li>
<li>Mix chopped bananas with other fruits such as guavas, kiwi, apricots as well as vegetables like
cabbages
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-broccoli/">broccoli</a>
in a ratio of 1:3.</li>
<li>You should supplement banana feeds with main diet always. Feed 250g to 600g of bananas per given meal.
<em><strong>NB</strong></em>
: Its necessary to feed you beardie with bananas nearing to ripen than feeding them with immediate or over ripen bananas.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-often-should-you-feed-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How Often Should You Feed Your Bearded Dragon?�</strong></h2>
<p>Bananas should be used as occasional meal due some problems (mentioned in this article) that may arise when used as main diet for your bearded dragon. Feed your beardie once or twice per month with banana salad.
Avoid excess use of green bananas combination when preparing the meal since they have very low glycemic index that lowers the carbs uptake rate.
Baby beardie shouldnt be fed using immediate harvested unripe bananas or fully ripe bananas as this may affects its digestive track or make it docile.
Occasional feeding is also attributed by low calcium: phosphorous (0.3:1). High phosphorous quantity in bananas as compared to calcium affects the calcium (necessary for bones and teeth strengthening) uptake leading to a calcium deficiency disease called metabolic bone disease.
NB: It is importance to improve calcium levels using power calcium supplement regularly.</p>
<h2 id="which-types-of-bananas-should-you-avoid-feeding-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>Which Types Of Bananas Should You Avoid Feeding Your Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-bananas-with-too-much-starch"><strong>1. Bananas with too much starch</strong></h3>
<p>Excess starch (especially found in unripe bananas) is hard to be digested by many beardie species. In addition, starch draws a lot of water during digestion leading to constipation if continuous banana feeding is undertaken.
You will need to use bananas with less starch level like apple bananas or allow them to ripen to lower the starch levels before feeding your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="2-banana-with-excess-phosphorous-content"><strong>2. Banana with excess phosphorous content</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, banana have higher phosphorous content as compared to other fruits like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">mangoes</a>
and
tomatoes
.
However, you should always select a banana species that has the lowest phosphorous content as it inhibits calcium uptake into the blood leading to calcium deficiency.</p>
<h3 id="3-green-bananas"><strong>3. Green bananas</strong></h3>
<p>Most green bananas/plantains species have high starch content (when raw) and low glycemic index, which affects the digestion of most beardie species. In addition, plantains have higher phosphorous content that is undesirable for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="4-bananas-with-too-much-sugar-content"><strong>4. Bananas with too much sugar content</strong></h3>
<p>Excess sugar will cause high blood pressure, heart attack/stroke as well as kidney fatigue on your beardies if not controlled. In addition, sugar from bananas clogs on the teeth leading to teeth decay.
Avoid regular feed of such bananas as red bananas in order to curb associated sugar problems</p>
<h3 id="5-bananas-with-low-glycemic-index"><strong>5. Bananas with low glycemic index</strong></h3>
<p>Glycemic index determines how fast carbs in food enters bloodstreams. A lower index is associated with high loss of carbs from the meals due to low absorption into the blood stream.
Actually, low glycemic index in bananas results from high starch and fiber structure (especially immediate harvested unripe bananas).
You will have to select banana species such as Williams that has higher glycemic index for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="6-bananas-with-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio"><strong>6. Bananas with low calcium: phosphorous ratio</strong></h3>
<p>Most banana species have low calcium: phosphorous ratio thus occasional feeding is recommended. However, some banana species have higher ratio than others do. Therefore, you are required to select those bananas that have higher calcium: phosphorous ratio in order to reduce occurrence of metabolic bone disease that may occur.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So,�can bearded dragons eat bananas?
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">Bearded dragons will not only eat</a>
bananas, but will also feed on their peels and leaves. However, bananas should not be used as main diet. Occasionally, feed your beardie with 250g to 600g of banana salad that is supplemented with other main meal.
Avoid banana species that have high sugar level, low glycemic index as well as low calcium: phosphorous ratio. Importantly, always engage qualified veterinary to provide medical checkups after every 3 months in case you often feed your beardie with bananas.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can bearded dragons eat broccoli? Vegetables are part of the
recommended diet
for bearded dragons.�Broccoli is a source of essential minerals and vitamins. However, not all vegetables are
good for your bearded <a href="https://cvm.ncsu.edu/documents/caring-for-your-bearded-dragon/">dragon</a>
.
<em>So, can bearded dragons eat broccoli? A simple answer is YES. A little broccoli wont do harm to your beardie. However, you should only feed your beardie with small amounts of broccoli once in a while. Thats because broccoli contains high contents of oxalic acid which may cause kidney failure in reptiles.�</em>
<em>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</em></p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-broccoli"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Broccoli?</strong></h2>
<p>Broccoli provides a good source of calcium, protein, fibre and vitamins such as vitamin A, B1, C, E and K. But they also contain high levels of oxalic acid which makes it unsuitable for reptiles including bearded dragons.</p>
<p>Although
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">bearded dragons can eat</a>
broccoli, they should be given very little of it. The high levels of oxalic acid in broccoli isnt good for their kidney and bone health. Taking too much oxalic acid reduces the amount of calcium in their body. Oxalic acid reacts with calcium in the body of the reptile which leads to an imbalance in the calcium: phosphorous ratio.</p>
<p>As a result, the body of the reptile utilizes the calcium from the bones which leads to bone degeneration. Inappropriate combination of calcium also affects the functioning of the kidney. It leads to bladder stones which in turn affect the kidney due fluid retention.</p>

<h2 id="broccoli-cap-ratio-how-it-affects-bearded-dragons"><strong>Broccoli Ca:P Ratio: How it Affects Bearded Dragons</strong></h2>
<p>The ratio of calcium to phosphorous in a bearded dragons diet is of great importance. The ideal Ca:P ratio for bearded dragons and other reptiles is 2:1. That means for every unit of phosphorous there must be two units of calcium.</p>
<p>Ca:P ratio determines how effectively calcium is absorbed in the reptiles body. Higher levels of phosphorous inhibits calcium absorption in their body which in turn causes Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD).</p>
<p>Equal parts of calcium and phosphorous result in a reaction which forms calcium phosphate. Since this is an insoluble salt, it wont be absorbed in your beardies intestine. Also, excess calcium in the beardies body inhibits the absorption of phosphorous which helps in bone health and PH balance.</p>
<p>The 0.7:1 calcium to phosphorous ratio in broccoli isnt good for your bearded dragon. Therefore broccoli should be given occasionally and in small quantities. A good balance of calcium and phosphorous can be achieved by mixing broccoli with a range of greens or vegetables. Alternatively, you add supplements to achieve the 2:1 ratio.</p>
<h2 id="broccoli-for-bearded-dragon-what-you-need-to-know"><strong>Broccoli for Bearded Dragon: What you need to know</strong></h2>
<p>As earlier said, you can give your bearded dragon small amounts of broccoli without any worries. If you resolve to give broccoli to your bearded dragon, remember these tips.</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat your bearded dragon with small amounts of broccoli.</li>
<li>Broccoli should be given only occasionally as a means of adding variety to their vegetable diet.</li>
<li>Serve only raw broccoli.</li>
<li>Broccoli should be cut into very small pieces to allow easy chewing and prevent choking.</li>
<li>Give only the floret because its softer for the beardie to chew and digest. Avoid the leaves and stalk.</li>
<li>Do not give broccoli to baby beardie. Not only do they need less vegetable diet but its also hard for them to digest.</li>
<li>In case your bearded develops complications after eating broccoli stop the feeding immediately. If possible consult your veterinarian.

<ul>
<li>Wash fresh broccoli with running water or in a bowl of clean water. Rub it with your fingers to remove dirt and any lodged insects. Wipe the broccoli with a tea towel to dry.</li>
<li>Use a sharp knife to cut off the leaves from the stalk. Now part off the florets by cutting them out from the stalk.</li>
<li>For each of the floret, remove the stem so that youre only left with the flowering part.</li>
<li>Finally cut the large florets into small pieces to make it easy for your bearded dragon to chew.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>If you own a pet bearded dragon you must be prepared to give it the best care possible. Perhaps a bearded dragons diet is the most delicate part of its maintenance. While they thrive on a variety of diet, some foods can be dangerous to them.</p>
<p>Although bearded dragons eat broccoli, they should be given very small amounts once in a while. If you give too much broccoli, it will affect their health because it exhibits unbalanced Ca:P ratio.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cabbages, whether red, green, or variegated, are vegetables that are often eaten together with course meals across the world.
Previously we checked
what <a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/">bearded dragons eat</a>
. It may even concern you if these lizards can eat all cabbage species or not.
<em>So, can bearded dragons eat cabbages? The simple answer is YES! The bearded dragon will feed on all varieties of cabbages without any problems. Actually, cabbages have rich vitamin composition (needed to boost beardies immune system), and high calcium: phosphorous ratio (that prevents metabolic bone disease).�</em>
<em>Cabbages have high dietary fiber (which prevents constipation), large mineral contents (needed for growth and development of tissues), contain powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory, low-fat content (thus preventing obesity) as well as relatively low sugar level that help reduce cases of diabetes and high blood pressure on your bearded dragon.�</em>

<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-cabbage">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cabbage?</h2>
<p>But it is necessary to keep close monitoring of the sugar and
water levels of your beardie
as excess intake may result from unregulated cabbage feeding. Read also;
Can Bearded Dragons Eat Tomatoes?</p>
<h3 id="1-high-calcium-phosphorous-ratio">1. High calcium: phosphorous ratio</h3>
<p>Cabbages have proven to be one of the best vegetables with very high calcium: the phosphorous ratio of 2:1 or 2.4:1.
This ideally means that your bearded dragon will enjoy high uptake of calcium (necessary for the strengthening of bones) into the bloodstream without phosphorous inhibition.
Actually, phosphorous is a dangerous cofactor that inhibits calcium absorption in the blood if it occurs in high quantities in any animal feed.
Problems that result from excess phosphorous (such as metabolic bone disease  calcium deficiency disease) will be reduced far or get eliminated by feeding your beardie with cabbages.
Green cabbages like Savoy and Nana cabbage species show high calcium: phosphorous ratio as compared to red and variegated cabbage species. Read also -
Can Bearded Dragons Eat Mango?
Storing harvested cabbage for 2 to 5 days before feeding your beardie will improve the calcium uptake level and reduce phosphorous activeness. This is important.</p>
<h3 id="2-rich-vitamin-composition">2. Rich Vitamin Composition</h3>
<p>Vitamin K, which regulates clotting of blood in case of injuries and building/replacing worn-out tissues, is found in very large quantities in cabbages (especially Savoy species). For every 100g of cabbage, there is 54% to 83% of RDI of Vitamin K -
from eggs
.
As compared to other vegetables like kales and corianders, cabbages show 64.6mcg extra of vitamin K. Cabbages also have vitamin D and B12, but in low quantities as compared to other vitamins.
Also, cabbages Vitamin C (51.5mg of RDI- needed for the proper functioning of the bones, blood vessels, and smooth skin /muscle flexibility), Vitamin B1 (0.11mg - which boost nerve signals and accelerates carbohydrates breakdown to give energy for your beardie), Vitamin B6 (required for fat/protein metabolism and red blood cell creation) as well as vitamin A that boosts the beardies vision during the night.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeihdUU3phg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeihdUU3phg</a></p>
<h3 id="3-high-dietary-fiber-25g">3. High dietary fiber 2.5g</h3>
<p>For every 100g of fresh cabbage, there is 2.5g to 3.21g of fibers. Green cabbages have more fibers than variegated and red cabbage species.
Fibers will keep a healthy digestion/alimentary canal by fueling regular and smooth bowel movement. It is the insoluble fibers found in cabbages that add bulk to the stool network, bind it well thus preventing your beardie from constipation (difficulties in releasing bowels).
Cabbages also have 1.2g to 1.5g of soluble fibers, which add to the main meal during digestion  these cruciferous fibers decrease the cholesterol level and help break down low-density lipoproteins that may lead to a heart attack or high blood pressure.
Feed your beardie with cabbages that are 3days after harvesting to a period just before the outer leaves begins to turn yellow so as to acquire maximum fiber content  fibers lose action ability when the cabbage turns yellow.</p>
<h3 id="4-large-mineral-contents">4. Large mineral contents</h3>
<p>Cabbages have high mineral components such as potassium (367mg per 100g of cabbage) that is needed to regulated nerve signals, ensure smooth contraction of muscles, maintain optimal osmotic balance as well as prevent kidney stones and lower blood pressure.
In addition, cabbage has other minerals like magnesium (12mg), iron (0.47mg), zinc (0.18), manganese (0.19mg), and sodium (0.78mg) that help in the growth and repair of beardies tissues as well as boost its immune system.</p>
<h3 id="5-low-fat-content">5. Low fat content</h3>
<p>Cabbage generally have low fat content of about 0.2g for every 100g of cabbage. This quantity is very low as compared to over vegetables like lettuce or broccoli.
Fat is quite dangerous for beardie as excess of it accumulates at the tail and berry lining making it inactive or docile. Read Also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?</a>
In addition, excess fat will cause your beardie to generate high blood pressure and heart failure or stroke if not attended to accordingly.
In comparison, red cabbage species have lower fat content than variegated and green cabbage species. You can therefore supplement the main meal with savoy or red cabbage species if you want to lower the fat intake of your bearded dragon.</p>
<h3 id="6-relatively-low-sugar-and-starch-level">6. Relatively low sugar and starch level</h3>
<p>Fresh Cabbage has a lower sugar content of about 2.3g to 3.4g for every 150g of cabbage. This sugar level is relatively low and will not have effect your pet beardie if proper feeding routine is followed as advised in this article (below).
High sugar level will lead to high blood pressure, heart attack as well as kidney failure. Further, excess sugar may cause diabetes.
Cabbage has low starch content (7.3%). Excess starch (in combined form) in a meal will be difficult for most beardie species to digest.
Actually, starch draws a lot of water from intestine for digestion process and needs high energy thus may cause constipation.
Low starch as compared to other nutrients (all combined) is needed to help ease the digestion process of your beardie.
NB: Yellow cabbages (about to dry) are more sugary and should be avoided as beardies meal.</p>
<h3 id="7-high-energy-generation">7. High energy generation</h3>
<p>When broken down through digestion, cabbages will give out 103 kJ to 113kJ or 25cal of energy for every 100g of cabbages.
The value is quite high as compared to other vegetables such as kales, green beans, or corianders.
Enough energy is needed for beardies daily activities such as moving about, feeding as well as keeping it warm (homeostatic function)</p>
<h3 id="8-powerful-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatory-compounds">8. Powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds</h3>
<p>Cabbages have powerful antioxidants such as polyphenols that will prevent your beard from damages caused by free radicals (molecules with odd electrons that damage body cells) on body tissues.
The anti-inflammatory compound (kaempferol and sulforaphane) found in cabbage will
protect your bearded dragon
from diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease as well as heart disease.
Importantly, these compounds will also reduce any chronic and acute inflammatory diseases. Read also;

<h2 id="how-to-prepare-cabbages-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to Prepare Cabbages for Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Follow the procedure below when preparing cabbages for your bearded dragon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest mature cabbages (avoid immature cabbages as they have low calcium levels and nutrients arent fully stocked) and remove the base stalk  this prevents draining of nutrients from the cabbage.</li>
<li>Store the cabbage for 3 to 6 days before feeding your beardie  this will improve calcium uptake,
drain excess water
and reduce phosphorous activeness.</li>
<li>Remove the outer foliage leaves (may have infections) and clean the cabbage with warm water or treated water to remove any poisonous insects (fireflies) or chemicals that may be in contact.</li>
<li>Split the cabbage (into 3 or 4 pieces) and remove the mid-rib/talk  this is hard for beardie to digest.</li>
<li>Chop the cabbage in to small sizes (size not larger than the space between beardies eyes). Always check (when chopping) any possibilities of insects or worms that could have hid between leaf blades.</li>
<li>Mix the cabbages with fruits like grapes, mangoes, or bananas to improve the taste (normally, cabbages are not beardies favorite meals).</li>
<li>Feed your beardie with 250g to 650g of cabbages once or twice per week. You can supplement cabbage salad with other main meals like mealworms or silkworms.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cabbage-species-you-shouldnt-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Cabbage Species You Shouldnt Feed Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<h3 id="1-cabbages-with-very-low-glycemic-index"><strong>1. Cabbages with very low glycemic index</strong></h3>
<p>Glycemic index determines how carbs are absorbed into beardies bloodstream.
Most cabbage species such as nana cabbage and red cabbage have a relatively low glycemic index that affects starch breakdown.
This is attributed to the presence of certain cofactors that prevent starch conversion/digestion.
Select cabbage species that have a higher glycemic index e.g. savoy so as to eliminate digestion problems that results from undigested starch</p>
<h3 id="2-cabbages-with-high-water-content-">**2. Cabbages with high water content **</h3>
<p>Freshly harvested cabbages have a high water content of 60% to 85% (116g out of 150g) in relation to dry matters. As said earlier, cabbages should be stored for 3 to 6 days to drain excess water.
Avoid
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-should-i-feed-my-bearded-dragon/">feeding your bearded dragon</a>
with variety of cabbages that have high water content e.g. nana cabbage, before draining period.
Excess water that accumulates in the beardie due to continuous cabbage feeding will make your pet docile, have low blood pressure, or experience diarrhea and runny poo.
Moreover, overhydration that results from excess water will lead to osmotic imbalance thus causing homeostatic problems in your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="3-cabbages-with-high-sugar-level"><strong>3. Cabbages with high sugar level</strong></h3>
<p>Many varieties of cabbages have relatively low sugar content (2.3g to 3.4g for every 150g of cabbage). However, sugar level increases as the cabbage overstay after harvesting (as it tends to turn yellow).
On the other hand, species like red cabbages and variegated cabbages have higher sugar content if they overstay on the farm or in store thus should be used within the first 10 days after harvesting.
High sugar level (as stated in this article) cause high blood pressure, kidney fatigue as well as heart problems.
You will need to select low sugar cabbage for your beardies health safety and avoid cabbages that have overstayed in stores (15- 24 days).</p>
<h2 id="which-parts-of-cabbages-dont-you-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Which Parts of Cabbages Dont You Feed Your bearded dragon</h2>
<p>It is required of you to remove the following parts of the cabbages before feeding your beardie:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-middle-stalkmidrib"><strong>1. The middle stalk/midrib</strong></h3>
<p>This is the hardest part of the cabbage that is found at the center and prolongs outside to form the taproot network.
Though nutritious, your beardie wont be in a position to digest it easily (hard).
In addition, the section has tough starch composition that impairs the digestion process.�Actually, the stalk may get stuck in the alimentary canal causing impaction or chock your beardie to death.</p>
<h3 id="2-foliage-leavesfirst-leaves"><strong>2. Foliage leaves/first leaves</strong></h3>
<p>First/foliage leaves of cabbages should be removed as they contain many chemicals (acquired at the initial stage  if cabbage is not organically grown) that may impair/affect your beardies digestive system.
Moreover, these leaves stores excess oxalate (impairs digestion) needed for cabbage build up at the earlier stage of growth and development.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragons will feed on all species of cabbages to acquire vitamins, minerals, and enough energy needed for growth and development. Moreover, cabbages have a dense fiber network that will add bulk to beardies stool thus preventing constipation.
High calcium: phosphorous ratio should be one of the reasons for selecting cabbages as a regular diet for your bearded dragon.
Remember to involve a qualified veterinarian often to check your beardies health, if you consider cabbages as a diet since they contain average sugar and water level that may arise if not monitored.</p>

Cantaloupes are over sugary (causing teeth decay), very acidic (cause indigestion problems). Also, cantaloupe have excess water content (which cause runny poo), Low calcium: phosphorous ratio as well as low quantities of minerals.</strong>
*Though most Bearded Dragon owners tend to feed their pet beardies with cantaloupe, this act may endanger the animals health at long run. *
<em>Some vet recommends occasional feeding of bearded dragon with little bit of cantaloupe, but I suggest you avoid them completely due to the above named problems.�</em></p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-cantaloupe-7-tips">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cantaloupe? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>Cantaloupe, also known as sweet melon, muskmelon, honeydew, rock melon or persian melon in different regions of the world, is a common fruit mainly eaten as a snack or dessert by people.
Could be you grow cantaloupe in your farm or have come across some in the groceries and wonders whether your Bearded Dragon can eat these fruits.</p>
<h3 id="1-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio">1. Low Calcium: Phosphorous Ratio</h3>
<p>The biggest danger of feeding your bearded dragon with cantaloupe is the low calcium: phosphorous ratio. Currently, a well-cultivated cantaloupe has a calcium: phosphorous ratio of 0.6:1. Actually, the ideal or recommended calcium: phosphorous ratio should be 1:1, 2:1 or more.
Why is the ratio crucial for your pets health? Well, its important to know that presence of high level of phosphorous as compared to calcium inhibits calcium uptake at the alimentary canal into blood stream.
This happens due to high affinity of phosphorous absorption. In addition, if phosphorous concentration is high, it will suppress calcium ions from any intake process.
This will lead to calcium deficiency in your bearded dragon. Since calcium is required for bone strengthening and making, your pet lizard will end up suffering a very dangerous/deadly disease called metabolic bone disease.
To avoid this occurrence, it is recommend that you feed your beardie with fruits that have high calcium: phosphorous ratio.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gIL6J6Sqv4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gIL6J6Sqv4</a></p>
<h3 id="2-excess-water-content">2. Excess Water Content</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe has a very high water content of about 90%. Though water is necessary for your pet beardie hydration, excess of it will lead to over hydration.
The alimentary canal of an over hydrated beardie has a mucus lining that prevents absorption of nutrients and accelerates flow of food before digestion occurs.
The lizard will also suffer frequent diarrhea and watery/runny poo that messes the cage often. The animals kidneys get fatigued easily or overworked by the ultrafiltration and may fail at long run (kidney failure).
The excess water content in cantaloupe also makes your bearded dragon inactive/docile if not taken care of. You need to monitor the water level of your pet beardie (through use of qualified vet) to ensure its not over hydrated or dehydrated.
Moreover, youll need to note that dehydration of your beardie will lead to dizziness, low blood pressure, dry mouth &amp; dry skin as well as indigestion problems like constipation.
It is therefore recommended that apart from avoiding cantaloupe for your beardies, also limit fruits that contain high water content in their meals.</p>
<h3 id="3-high-acidic-level">3. High Acidic Level</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe have a pH between 4.5 to 6.9. This alone tells us that excess feeding of these fruits will lead to acid accumulation in your beardies digestive track.
High acid levels will cause burning sensation or irritation along the gullet  the beardie will tend to move around abnormally or scratch its throat/neck region against objects in the cage.
Also, acidity will cause stomach upset to your bearded dragon. The lizard looks uncomfortable, fatigued and at times may even vomit feeds.
High acid levels affect normal digestion in the stomach and intestines of beardies by denaturing the enzymes, which controls the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-cucumbers/">digestion process</a>
.
At time, a beardie suffering from acidity problems will excrete dry undigested waste material that may even have mucus or blood stains.</p>
<h3 id="4-low-vitamins-and-mineral-content">4. Low vitamins and mineral Content</h3>
<p>As compared to other fruits such as grapes, berries, apple or apricot; cantaloupe has lower mineral content.
There is 0.21 mg iron, 0.18mg zinc and 0.14mg manganese for every 100g of cantaloupe Oz. This is an indication that you will need to overfeed your beardie with extra cantaloupe to acquire the right quantity needed by the body for normal functioning  this contradicts the recommendation that you should avoid cantaloupe.
Vitamins such as vitamin D, E and K that are very crucial for your bearded dragon are unavailable too and those that are present such as vitamin A, B1 and C are in low quantities.
This, therefore, is an indication that cantaloupe will not provide enough vitamins and mineral if used as a daily meal for your bearded dragon.</p>
<h3 id="5-very-sugary">5. Very Sugary</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe has 7.86g of sugar for every 100g of the fruit oz. This this level is quite high for bearded dragon
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">nutrition</a>
requirements.
In the ideal situation, an adult beardie should take 0.5g to 2g (max) sugar contentment for every 100g Oz of a given meal while juvenile beardies should be fed with meals that have 0.4g to 1.2g sugar content.
Ideally, the sugar content in this fruit is already far beyond the needed amount in your lizards body/physiological processes.�Excess sugar that is absorbed in the blood may cause high blood pressure or diabetes that may lead to death easily.
Sugar, also accumulates on the teeth and between teeth gaps leading to teeth decay or dental carries. Normally, its not possible to brush the teeth of your beardies as a form of healthcare.
However, you should monitor their sugar deposit level by ensuring that you feed less sugary meals and by also providing vegetable meals that have high fiber content, which brush the teeth in the process of feeding.
Actually, its very necessary to engage a qualified vet often for teeth inspection of your beardie.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-cantaloupe-for-occasional-feeds">How to prepare cantaloupe for occasional feeds?</h2>
<p>Though it is not advisable to feed your bearded dragon with cantaloupe, some beardie owners still feed their pets with these fruits.
To meet proper health standard of your bearded dragon, you will need right preparation and control feeding program. To achieve this, follow the procedure below while feeding your beardie:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all the vines and foliage when harvesting your cantaloupe and leave it for a week to reduce fresh water content.</li>
<li>Wash the cantaloupe thoroughly with warm/disinfected water (if possible)  this will help remove and kill any insect or bacteria on the fruit skin.</li>
<li>Peel the entire fruit to remove the green out skin  this part is usually more acidic and has high phosphorous content that lead to calcium: phosphorous imbalance condition.</li>
<li>Slice/chop the peeled cantaloupe into small sizes  the chopped sizes should not be larger the space between your beardies eyes to allow easier swallowing and reduces chocking that may happen.</li>
<li>Leave the chopped cantaloupe in air or warm environment to drip excess water before feeding.</li>
<li>Feed your adult beardie with 100g to 500g of chopped cantaloupe per month in order to control side effects associated with it.
Some veterinaries have recommended occasional use of cantaloupe, which in my case I suggest that there should be close monitoring of your beardies in order to curb any complications that may arise.
Occasional feeding of bearded dragon with cantaloupe (once per month) may not show any harmful effects on their health at all, especially when the feeding is supplemented with other daily meals.
However, if there is a laxity in sugar monitoring, calcium: phosphorous ratio control as well as water regulation, then, your bearded dragon will suffer some of sicknesses highlighted in this article at the beginning.
<strong>NB</strong>
: It is highly advisable to mixed cantaloupe with other fruits/vegetables such as berries, apple, cabbages, green beans/peas etc. at a ratio of 1:3 to supplement it and enhance its digestion process without complications.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cantaloupe, just like avocado and orange, shouldnt be used as a main meal for your bearded dragon. The fruit is very acidic and has high water content that may lead to kidney failure, diarrhea or watery/runny poo.
Moreover, cantaloupe has low calcium: phosphorous ratio, which inhibits uptake of calcium necessary for bone strengthening thus leading to metabolic bone disease.
The high sugar content found in cantaloupe will cause teeth decay if not monitored at long run. It is therefore advisable to avoid use of cantaloupe as main diet for your pet bearded dragon.</p>

<a href="http://avianexotichospital.com/bearded-%5Bdragon%5D(/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/).html">bearded dragons</a>
eat carrots? You know that bearded dragons love eating a variety of vegetables. Vegetables are a good source of minerals, vitamins, and water. So, we recently analyzed this -
what do bearded dragons eat?
But, can bearded dragons eat carrots?
<strong>Short answer is YES  Bearded dragons love eating carrots. Carrots are rich in Beta-carotene and vitamin A which are essential requirements in a bearded dragons diet. However, carrots should be avoided if the bearded dragon is presently on vitamin A supplements.�</strong>
Thats because feeding the bearded dragon on carrots while it is receiving vitamin A supplements might lead excess vitamin A. This condition is known as vitamin A toxicity or hypervitaminosis A.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrots"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Carrots?</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons will generously eat carrots! With carrots, you have a good chance of enriching your pets diet with valuable nutrients.
Carrots contain numerous nutrients which contribute to the overall health of your bearded dragon. Here is the breakdown.</p>
<h3 id="1-contains-vitamin-a">**1. **<strong>Contains Vitamin A</strong></h3>
<p>Vitamin A is an essential requirement in a bearded dragons diet. Bearded dragons get vitamin A either from plants such as carrots or it can be administered as vitamin A supplements. Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-cabbage/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cabbage?</a>
Giving vitamin A to your bearded dragon comes with three benefits. The main importance of vitamin A in a beardies body is vision. Just like in humans, carrots help in maintaining eye health since they contain a lot of vitamin A. A deficiency in vitamin A can adversely affect the beardies eye sight.
Thats why swollen eyes are the first symptoms of vitamin A deficiency in a bearded dragon.�Vitamin A also plays an important role in bone development, skin health, protein synthesis and reproductive health.
While vitamin A proves good for your bearded dragon, it can reach toxic levels if given in excess. If youre feeding your beardie on carrots, its extremely hard for the calcium to reach toxic levels.
However, if you feed your beardie with carrots and vitamin A supplements at the same time, theyre very likely to suffer vitamin A toxicity (hypervitaminosis A). Therefore, its advisable not to feed your bearded dragon with carrots at a time when they are on vitamin A supplements.</p>
<h3 id="2-contains-beta-carotene">**2. **<strong>Contains Beta-Carotene</strong></h3>
<p>Carrots also contain beta-carotene which acts as means of regulating the amount of vitamin A consumed by your bearded dragon. Excess beta-carotene wont have any harmful effects on your bearded dragon as long as it comes from plants including carrots. The only effect is the tendency of their skin to turn yellow.
However, if excess beta-carotene is administered in form of supplements, it is likely lead to hypovitaminosis A (vitamin A deficiency). In excess, the beta-carotene from supplements tends to destroy vitamin A thus leading to its deficiency.
In summary, beta-carotene from carrots will do no harm to your bearded dragon. But it becomes dangerous when you give carrots and supplements that contain excess beta-carotene.</p>
<h3 id="3-fiber">**3. **<strong>Fiber</strong></h3>
<p>The fiber content in carrots plays a big role in digestion. Without fiber, the outer shell from the insects that you give to your bearded dragon could prove very difficult to digest. Inefficient digestion causes constipation which in turn may make your pet beardie sick. Severe constipation can even lead to death.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrot-leavestops"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Carrot Leaves/Tops?</strong></h2>
<p>You might already be feeding your bearded dragon on greens such as kale, cucumber, celery leaves, Swiss chard and so on. But are carrot leaves also good for them? Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?</a>
Well, bearded dragons cant resist the luring scent from the carrot tops. However, these greens will do more harm than good to your pet beardie. They contain high levels of oxalates which are harmful to bearded dragons and other reptiles when consumed in excess.
Oxalates are associated with calcium binding in the body. With little calcium in the body, a lot of oxalates reach the kidneys which may eventually lead to kidney stones.
Therefore, although your beardie can eat carrot tops, you should give very small amounts and on very rare cases. Give carrot tops as occasional treats.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-cooked-carrots"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cooked Carrots?</strong></h2>
<p>Beardies readily eat cooked vegetables including carrots. However, cooking leaches out the nutrients that would otherwise be beneficial to your beardies health and growth.
When it comes to nutrients in vegetables, fresh is always a factor. So, if bearded dragons can eat raw carrots, there is not benefit of cooking it. Youll be denying them the nutrients required a healthy life.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-should-you-give-carrots-to-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How Often Should you Give Carrots to Your Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons require a host of other nutrients which are absent in carrots. In addition, their diet in the wild doesnt include carrots at all. Therefore, carrots should be given sparingly and not as their staple food. You can make it once every week.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-carrots-for-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How to Prepare Carrots for Your Bearded Dragon</strong></h2>
<p>Now its time to feed your bearded dragon with carrots. Below is a step by step guide for preparing a carrot meal for your pet: Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-grapes/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Grapes?</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Wash the carrots with clean water and peel using a kitchen knife or a mini peeler. Dont give the peels to your beardie because they might contain pesticides.</li>
<li>Chop the carrots into very small pieces because large pieces prove difficult for the bearded dragon to bite and chew. Alternatively, you can shred the carrots to make it even easier for your beardie to chew. Shredded carrots are even better for baby bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Place the chopped or shredded carrots in a dish and put it in the beardies terrarium. Bearded dragons love the sweetness in carrots. So, even if youre giving them carrots for the first time, theyll generously pounce on it with bites.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can prepare a sizeable amount of carrots and keep in the refrigerator. But remember to defrost when feeding your beardie with frozen carrots.
<em><strong>NB</strong></em>
: Only give fresh carrots. Once peeled and chopped, carrots will go bad easily. Rotten carrots might lead to diarrhea or other complications. Read also;

</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>From the above guide, you can certainly confirm that carrots arent a bad diet for your bearded dragon. They are a rich source of vitamin A, fiber and beta-carotene which are all beneficial to your beardies health.
However, you should avoid carrots if youre presently administering vitamin A supplements on your bearded dragon. Thats because you may end up raising the amount of vitamin A in their body to toxic levels.</p>

Baby beardies are especially hard to give new food. But with a little patience and trick, its only a matter of time before they start eating cucumber.
Typically, the
diet of a baby
beardie should constitute 80% proteins and 20% plant matter. But the plant matter should be increased as the animal progresses to adulthood.
The best way to introduce cucumber to your baby beardie is to give it early in the morning before it eats anything.
But you dont want to starve the little thing. If it refuses to eat at all, you can give them its favorite food. The intention is to make it used to cucumbers. Eventually, itll bear results.</p>

The bearded dragon will immediately pick on the insect and in the process, theres a chance of getting a bite on the cucumber slice.
You can repeat this trick several times until your beardie gets used to cucumber.</p>
<h3 id="3-mix-cucumber-with-sweet-fruits"><strong>3. Mix Cucumber with Sweet Fruits</strong></h3>
<p>Fruits such as apples, strawberries, and papaya can be mixed with cucumber to entice the beardie with their sweet taste.
Mix the cucumber with fruits that the beardie is used to. It will be drawn to the food by the smell of the fruits and immediately begin to bite.
Make sure the fruits and cucumber are sliced into small pieces and mixed thoroughly. This ensures that your beardie doesnt miss a bite of the cucumber as it picks on the sweet fruits.

. They are not only delicious but also contain essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins. But can bearded dragons eat eggs?
<strong>The simple answer is YES  Eggs are a healthy diet for your bearded dragons. Feeding the beardie with eggs provides them with proteins and vitamins such as vitamin A, B12, D,</strong>
and E. However, since eggs contain a lot of proteins, bearded dragons should be given eggs once in a while. This is especially so for adult beardies which require fewer
** proteins in their diet.**

<p>In the right quantities, eggs are good for your bearded dragons. You can give them eggs to supplement the protein diet they get from feeders insect. Below is a summary of the benefits of eggs to your bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">dragon</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eggs Contain Essential Vitamins and Minerals</strong>
Eggs contain vitamins and minerals which are essential to your bearded dragons health. As long as you are cautious on the high protein content in eggs, your beardie can benefit from the following vitamins and minerals.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>*Vitamin A:*Although bearded dragons require very minimal vitamin A, it helps in enhancing their normal vision, reproduction and developing their immune system.</li>
<li>*Vitamin D:*Eggs are rich in vitamin D which helps your bearded dragon in absorbing calcium from their diet. On the other hand, calcium helps in maintaining strong and healthy bones. Low calcium levels are associated with weaker and deformed bones.</li>
<li>*Vitamin E: *Vitamin E plays a big role in the bearded dragons body. Perhaps the most important is its role in boosting their immune system which helps in fighting bacteria and viruses. In addition it helps in red blood cells formation and preventing tissue damage.</li>
<li>*Vitamin B12:*Though not very common, vitamin B12 deficiency leads stunted growth, hatching discrepancies, weak leg muscles and high mortality rates. However, feeding your bearded dragon on eggs reduces chances of vitamin B12 deficiency.
Eggs also contain essential minerals such as magnesium, calcium, selenium, zinc, folate etc.

<li><strong>Eggs Contain Protein</strong>
Bearded dragons will readily eat eggs because they contain proteins which are vital in their growth. Baby bearded dragons require diets that are higher in proteins and less in vegetables because of their higher growth rate. Typically baby beardies need 80% proteins and 20% vegetables.
However, adults should be fed on 20% proteins and 80% vegetables. Whether youre dealing with adult or baby beardies, eggs should be given sparingly because they are very rich in proteins.
High protein intake makes your bearded dragon excessively fat. The problem with this is that it may lead fatty liver disease where fat builds up in the liver cells. The liver may eventually fail to function effectively.

<p>A big NO to raw eggs! The bacterias present in raw eggs are likely to make your bearded dragon sick. You may end up with a dead beardie.
Eggs should always be cooked before being fed to bearded dragons to kill the harmful bacterias.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-egg-shells"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Egg Shells?</strong></h3>
<p>The risks of feeding your bearded dragon with egg shells outweigh the benefits. Although they are richer in calcium than the egg itself, they cannot be easily be digested. Even in their finest form, egg shells take long to be broken down once inside the beardies digestive system
Also, because of the poor egg shell digestion, your bearded dragon may end up with lumps of shells in their stomachs which may cause impaction.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-hard-boiled-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Hard-Boiled Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>Hard-boiled eggs come with all the nutrients contained in an egg including protein, minerals and vitamins. So, giving them to your beardie would be very beneficial to their growth and health.
However, as earlier said, eggs should constitute a negligible percentage of their diet. Thats because too much protein can bring about health complications in future. They tend to become too fat and eventually suffer fatty liver disease.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-scrambled-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Scrambled Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>Scrambled eggs are just as good as hard-boiled eggs. Again, because of high protein issues, they should be feed in small quantities. However, they should not be cooked with fat the manner were used to prepare our eggs.
The reason for this is to avoid adding more fat to their diet. Also, check whether

<h3 id="egg-yolk-vs-egg-white-which-is-good-for-bearded-dragon"><strong>Egg Yolk vs Egg White: Which is Good for Bearded Dragon</strong></h3>
<p>Both egg white and egg yolk are good for bearded dragons. They contain vital nutrients that contribute to the well-being of your beardie. But owing to their high protein levels, bearded dragons should only have very little amounts of any of them.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-quail-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Quail Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>In terms of safety and nutritional value, quail eggs are just as good as chicken eggs. Similarly, you can only give your beardie small amounts of quail eggs because they contain too much protein.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-eggs-for-a-bearded-dragon"><strong>How to Prepare Eggs for a Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you have confirmed that eggs are good for your bearded dragons, its time to know how to go about preparing an egg meal for your beardie. Therere two ways you can prepare eggs for the bearded dragon.
<strong>Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Break the egg open and pour in a bowl.</li>
<li>Scramble until the egg white and egg yolk blends into a uniform paste.</li>
<li>Pour the resulting paste into a non-stick pan and heat on a low/medium flame gas burner to prevent sticking. Do not use any frying oil.</li>
<li>If the egg tends to stick, you can mix it with a spoon without concentrating on the final shape of the egg. Furthermore, youll have to break it into small pieces to make it easy for your beardie to eat.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can cook the eggs in the oven in bowl without using cooking oil.</li>
<li>Once its ready you can put it in the beardies bowl and serve once it has cooled. Ensure you slice the cooked egg into small pieces. You can serve it with their favourite vegetables such as kales, broccoli, collard and so on.
<strong>Boiled Eggs</strong>
Although scrambled eggs are tastier to your bearded dragons you can also give them boiled eggs. Below are steps for preparing hard boiled eggs for your pet.</li>
<li>Put the eggs in a pot and add water that just covers the eggs.</li>
<li>Boil the eggs in high heat until the water boils rigorously.</li>
<li>Put off the burner and leave the pot covered for 13-16 minutes.</li>
<li>Once they cool, peel off the shell and chop the egg into small pieces.</li>
<li>Put the egg in the bearded dragons bowl or feeding point. You can serve with vegetables or greens.
Note: You should only serve small amounts of eggs because they are very rich proteins. Too much proteins will fatten your bearded dragon to dangerous extents. Also, avoid adding salt or sauces to eggs meant for bearded dragons.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Eggs make a very nutritious diet for bearded dragons. Thats because they contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and proteins. However, because of the high protein content, they are only suitable as a once in a while treat.
If youre already treating your beardies with an insect diet, they already have enough of protein in their bodies. Eggs can be given occasionally to give them variety. Excess protein will only make your pet very fat. This may eventually lead to liver complications or even death.</p>

<h3 id="1-richstrong-fiber-content">1. Rich/strong Fiber Content</h3>
<p>Grapes have rich and strong fiber content that is necessary for digestion process of your bearded dragon. For every 150g of grapes, there is 1.5g to 2.8g fiber content  this is quite high value as compared to other fruits and vegetables.
Maybe you have vineyard or have seen some grapes in groceries and wonders whether your
<a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/bearded-dragons-feeding">bearded dragon can feed</a>
on them. Would it be okay if you feed it with grapes leaves or vines?
Fiber acts as roughage and binds the food being digested within the alimentary canal. Normally, grapes fiber network will help prevent constipation (inability to release bowels) in your bearded dragon.
Moreover, the grapes fibers are strong, long and coiled (especially for seedless grapes) thus providing a strong grip on food being digested without breaking. This improves the peristalsis process too  the smooth flow of chyme within the digestive track of your bearded dragon.
NB: It is important to note that the fibers are never digested and are highly need in every diet that you feed your beardie.

<p>Ripe grapes have 45% to 68% water content  this variation is due to climatic conditions in areas they are grown. Also, red grapes have slightly higher water content than green and pink grapes.
Apart from eating the grapes, your beardie will even eat their leaves too. However, grapes shouldnt be used as a regular diet for bearded dragon, since they have high calcium: phosphorous ratio (causes metabolic bone disease) and relatively high sugar content that may cause teeth decay, high blood pressure and diabetes.
However, on average, the water content in grapes is relative okay for your bearded dragon (if not overfed or when fed occasionally as advised).
For every 180g of ripe grapes, there is 80g to 121 g of water. This generally indicates that grapes will provide good amount of water (to your beardie) necessary for osmoregulation  this is a very crucial physiological process in beardies, which if not corrected will lead to high blood pressure or kidney failure.
Water also help in keeping your pet beardie hydrated thus preventing problems of dehydration such as dizziness, dry skin and dry mouth, constipation as well as low blood pressure.
Importantly, grapes water contain low glycemic index that helps control blood pressure and boost ultrafiltration process of your bearded dragon.
Note: You will need to be careful not to overfeed your beardie with grapes as this may lead to excess water intake that cause over hydration in your pet lizard. Actually, over hydration will make the beardie docile, have watery/runny poo, cause osmotic imbalance as well as diarrhea.</p>
<h3 id="3-low-acid-and-fat-level">3. Low Acid and fat Level</h3>
<p>The acidity level in either unripe or ripe grape is below 0.02mg for every 155g of grapes. In addition, the pH level of grapes on the chart ranges between 6.1 to 6.91.
This shows a strong indication that your bearded dragon has health safety when eating grapes as a diet.
We know well that high acid level in diet will cause discomfort and irritation along the alimentary canal (especially along the gullet). Moreover, acid will cause a burning sensation on the mouth inner lining and will cause indigestion problems to your beardies.
Its worth noting that grapes also have Antioxidants components �such as �phytochemical resveratrol (red grapes), lutein and zeaxanthin, �which help control heart related diseases and reduces inflammation on your beardie. These chemicals also promotes reduction of allergies occurrence on your pet lizard.
Notably, the skin of red grapes has high composition of antioxidant compounds like flavonoids myricetin and quercetin that will help repair radical cells in the beardies brain thus initiating stress relief.</p>
<h3 id="4-rich-minerals-and-vitamins-composition">4. Rich Minerals and Vitamins Composition</h3>
<p>Ripe grapes have rich vitamin C (27% of RDI), vitamin K (28% of RDI), vitamin B6 (6% of RDI) as well as vitamin A  these vitamins plays a crucial role in protecting your beardie against infection and boosts their pets vision.
Grapes also have compounds that reduces cholesterol absorption within the alimentary canal  this prevents cholesterol related diseases such as heart failure or obesity.
Thiamine and riboflavin found in grapes will richly boost the immune system of your bearded dragon further.
Grapes has high content of potassium that is necessary for controlling and regulating your beardies blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. Actually, for every 150 g of grapes, there is 288mg of potassium ions  relatively higher as compared to other fruits and vegetables.
Moreover, grapes also contains other minerals such as manganese, copper, magnesium, iron and zinc that will help build up bones, muscles and body tissues of your beardie, thus boosting its good health.

<h2 id="how-to-prepare-grapes-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to Prepare Grapes for Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>When preparing grapes for your bearded dragon, kindly follow the procedure below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick fresh ripe grapes right from the vineyard as an entire cluster. Leave them to drain excess water for 1 to 2 days.</li>
<li>Wash the grapes with warm or treated water to remove any chemical or poisonous insects such as fireflies that may be on the skin.</li>
<li>For seeded grapes, remove the seed as they may chock and kill the beardie when swallowing. Normally, you should slice the seeded grapes into 2 or 4 parts for easier removal of seeds.</li>
<li>For seedless grapes, you can feed your beardie direct or mesh them to form a viscous meal, which it can lick with its tongue.</li>
<li>After slicing grapes (smaller pieces enables the beardie to roll them with its tongue), supplement them with other fruits like apples, guavas, apricots as well as vegetables to boost its nutritional value and balance the low calcium content.</li>
<li>Place the meal salad in a dish and let the bearded dragon feed itself. Avoid pouring food into the beardies mouth directly from above as it may cause impaction or chocking leading to death.
NB: Avoid feeding your beardie with wild grown grapes  normally, most of them are poisonous or cause illnesses to your pet lizard.�Read Also:

<h2 id="problems-with-overfeeding-bearded-dragon-with-grapes">Problems with Overfeeding Bearded Dragon with Grapes.</h2>
<p>Grapes, unlike other fruits such as bananas or guavas, should be fed to your beardie occasionally. This is because these fruits cause various side effects to your pet if overfed and not monitored.
Feed your adult beardie once or twice per week with 100g to 150g of ripe grapes. Supplement grapes with main diet when feeding your pet always. After one or two months of feeding your beardie as advised, it is necessary to involve a vet to monitor its health condition.
<strong>1. High sugar levels.</strong>
For every 100g of grapes, there is 23.37 g of sugars. This amount is relatively high and if not controlled may cause your beardie to suffer from high blood pressure, heart failure and diabetes. In addition, the sugar may be deposited on their teeth in large quantities leading to teeth decay.
<strong>2. Relatively High Water Content</strong>
Grapes are 45% to 68% water content. This a lone is an indicator that the fruits should be taken in fewer quantities to prevent over hydration on your beardie. Excess water in your beardie will cause diarrhea, runny/watery poo, kidney failure or make your pet inactive.� Feed your beardie with grapes that have low water content to curb these occurrences.
<strong>3. Imbalance calcium: phosphorous ratio</strong>
Major challenge of using grapes as main meal is the imbalance calcium: phosphorous ratio 0.5:1 This is far below the require/ideal ratio, which is usually 1:1, 2:1 or more.
Presence of high phosphorous as compared to calcium will inhibit calcium intake in the blood leading to metabolic bone disease. Since grapes has other high nutritional benefits, you will need to boost the calcium level using calcium powder or other feeds that have high calcium content.
Importantly, avoid using grapes species that has very high phosphorous content.�It is also necessary to note that most grapes contain oxalate, which inhibits calcium intake. You will need to avoid using such grapes species for your beardie too.
Avoid feeding your beardie with unripe grapes  they usually have high acid content and low nutrition value.�Grapes shouldnt be used in excess as main meal for your bearded dragon for the different reasons.

<h2 id="can-bearded-dragon-eat-grapes-leaves">Can Bearded Dragon Eat Grapes Leaves?</h2>
<p>Apart from eating the grapes, your bearded dragon will also eat the grapes leaves. Actually, most beardie species love to eat grapes leaves more that the fruits.
You will only need to separate the leaves from the vines, clean and wet them a bit (for easier swallowing) before feeding your beardie. If possible, chop the leaves into small pieces for easier feeding.
Grapes leaves are more nutritious and rich in fibers, which help prevent constipation for your bearded dragon. Normally, the beardies dont eat the stems  the stem are not succulent and the beardies teeth are not well adapted to peel off the back skin from the stems.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Your bearded dragon will not only eat grapes, but it will also feed on their leaves nicely.�Grapes are rich in fiber content needed to help in digestion and also contain high level of potassium content necessary for blood pressure control in your beardie.
In addition, grapes have rich vitamin composition and minerals that boost beardies immunity. For beardies good health, always involve qualified veterinary for checkup.
However, grapes should be administered as an occasional meal since overfeeding may lead to high water content, high sugar level as well as imbalance calcium: phosphorous ration your beardie.</p>

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249901/"><em>Mangifera indica</em></a>
) is a delicious drupe that grows mainly in tropical climate and is often used as dessert by many people or chewed while unripe.
Could be you have come across a number of them at market place or you grow various mango species and wonders if
bearded dragons can eat them
. It may also concern you if beardies can eat mango peels, leaves or stems/backs.
<strong>So, the question here is, can Bearded Dragons Eat Mangoes? The direct answer is YES! Beardies feed on mangoes without any problems. Actually, mangoes are rich in minerals and Vitamins (needed for growth and immune boost).�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango-7-secrets">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Mango? 7 Secrets</h2>
<p>*Moreover, mangoes have relatively low water content (thus prevent over hydration) and it is an aphrodisiac fruit (improves beardies sexual activities). *
<em>However, mangoes should be supplemented with other meals as they contain Low calcium: phosphorous ratio, relatively high sugar level, moderate oxalate level as well as sight acidic content that may impair beardies body functionalities if fed in excess.</em></p>
<h3 id="1-vitamins-composition">1. Vitamins Composition</h3>
<p>For every 100g of mango salad, there is 6% to 10% Vitamin A that is needed to boost beardies eyesight thus preventing dry eyes and night blindness. In addition, vitamin A will improve your pets immune system further and help in development of reproduction system -
just like with eggs
.
Mangoes also have Vitamin B6 (0.119mg or 11.6% RDI needed for fat &amp; protein metabolism as well as in manufacture of red blood cells), Vitamin C (34.6mg or 67.2% of RDI - required to help repair worn-out tissues and boost your beardies growth and development) and Vitamin E (0.9mg or 9.67% RDI  needed for destruction of free radicals within tissues and prevents beardies skin from UV rays damage that may occur).
Importantly, mangoes have vitamin K (6% of RDI) that improves beardies blood clotting (in case of injuries) thus preventing any excess bleeding.

<h3 id="2-rich-pre-biotic-dietary-fiber">2. Rich Pre-Biotic Dietary Fiber</h3>
<p>Mangoes are known to have pre-biotic fibers that are will add bulk to your beardies stool thus preventing it from constipation (difficulties in releasing bowels). Scientific research shows that for every 100g of mango salad, there is 2.6g to 3.2g dietary fibers  this number is relatively high as compared to other fruits such as paw paws and berries.
The soluble based mango fibers will also add to the food content in the alimentary canal and ease the digestion process. Importantly, these fibers will help lower chances of your beardie suffering from coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease.
To acquire maximum dietary fibers, feed your beardie with ripe mangoes. Avoid mangoes that are over ripe as the fibers are usually very weak.

<h3 id="3-strong-antioxidant">3. Strong Antioxidant</h3>
<p>Mango species such as Apple mango have Strong antioxidant compounds that help in destruction of free radicals that mainly attacks body cells.
Antioxidants such as astragalin, gallate, quercetin, isoquercitrin, fisetin, and gallic acid and methyl work together in breaking down any free radical and poisonous chemical component that is taken in through ingestion by your beardie.
Moreover, mangoes contain other powerful antioxidants such as polyphenols, rhamnetinm, angiferin, catechins, anthocyanins and kaempferol, which further boost the intestinal lining protection and improve beardies immunity.
Notably, ripe mangoes have more antioxidants than unripe ones.</p>
<h3 id="4-rich-mineral-content">4. Rich Mineral Content</h3>
<p>There is 168mg of potassium in every 100g of fresh ripe mango salad. Potassium is required for smooth muscle contraction, fluid regulation and quick nerves signal control in your bearded dragon. In addition, potassium will lower the blood pressure, control excess water levels and prevent occurrence of diseases such as osteoporosis and kidney stones.
Presence of 11mg calcium will further help strengthen your beardies bones and teeth. Other minerals present include Sodium (1.3mg  needed for osmoregulation and blood pressure balance), Magnesium (10mg boosts heartbeat and maintains smooth nerve signal response), Zinc (0.19mg-required for cell division and repair of injuries), Manganese (0.063mg needed for metabolism of cholesterol and amino acid as well as clotting process) and Iron (0.16mg-prevents anemia and oxygen transportation).
Mangoes also contain phyto-nutrients such as �-carotene, �-cryptoxanthin and a-carotene, which easily combine with other antioxidants thus helping in elimination of free radicals.

<h3 id="5-relative-water-content-level">5. Relative Water Content Level</h3>
<p>On average, most mango species contain 49% to 74% water content when ripe. This quantity wont be harmful to your beardie if controlled feeding is carried out. Your beardie will have a stable osmoregulation (very crucial process for beardie without which it suffers kidney failure) if you follow proper feeding and preparation procedure given below.
Average water content is needed for your beardies homeostasis processes as well as maintenance of its skin and cells in hydrated state for proper physiological processes.
Low water content in beardie will cause dehydration that leads to dizziness, constipation and dry skin.
You should avoid overfeeding your bearded dragon with excess mangoes-it may lead to over hydration that causes high blood pressure and runny poo. Normally, Mangoes should be fed occasionally and be supplemented with other meals like mealworms or silkworms.

<h3 id="6-aphrodisiac-fruit">6. Aphrodisiac fruit</h3>
<p>Mangoes, from the recent scientific research, are now aphrodisiac. They contain compounds, which improves sexual activities of bearded dragons.
If your beardies are sexually inactive, just prepare 300g of mango salad weekly (as supplement feed) for a period of 3-4 months in order to boost their mating desire and performance.
Species such as chaunsa and alphonsos mangoes strengthen further the bonds of male and female beardies in a given cage they tend to stay together most of their time.</p>
<h3 id="7-low-fat-and-cholesterol-level">7. Low Fat and Cholesterol Level</h3>
<p>According to Jasleer (nutritionist), mangoes are cholesterol free and fat free. However, some species show about 0.0013mg of fat in every 100g of mango salad. This is a very low quantity thus safe for your beardies consumption.
Excess cholesterol in beardies accumulate in the inner lining of blood vessel thus narrowing them this causes high blood pressure and heart failure at long run.
In addition, excess fat builds up at the berry and tail regions thus making your pet beardie docile/inactive as well as obese.
<em>Mangoes have a high dietary fiber (needed to add bulk and reduce constipation), low fat and cholesterol (reducing obesity and heart problems), strong antioxidants (that prevent cells against free radicals) and high potassium level (needed for nerve signals control, muscle contraction and osmoregulation).</em></p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-mangoes-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to Prepare Mangoes for Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>To prepare mangoes for your bearded dragons meal, follow the procedure below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest ripe mangoes from the farm and leave them to drain water for at least two days  this will also improve their nutrients action/uptake by your pet beardie.</li>
<li>Clean/Wash mangoes using warm or treated water to remove any chemicals or stains that may harm your beardies digestive system.</li>
<li>Leave clean mangoes to dry in air/shade for 20minutes before peeling them.</li>
<li>Slice/chop the peeled mangoes into small sizes (the sizes should not be larger than the space between the beardies eyes)  this may lead to chocking that causes death easily.</li>
<li>Dont chop the central seed (dispose it instead)  mango seed is hard for beardie to digest and when swallowed may cause impaction or block the gullet.</li>
<li>Mix the mango salad with other supplement like cabbages and mealworms to add extra flavor.</li>
<li>Measure 300g to 545g of mango salad in a given time when feeding your beardie  the quantity is for one adult beardie.
NB: It is required of you to feed beardie twice or thrice per month with mango salad in order to avoid over hydration and side effects of excess sugar that may arise. Do not feed your beardie with unripe mangoes they are difficult for beardies to digest and often impact/chock them when swallowing.

<h2 id="mango-species-not-to-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Mango Species not to Feed Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<h3 id="1-mangoes-with-relatively-high-water-content"><strong>1. Mangoes With Relatively High Water Content</strong></h3>
<p>High water content is unfavorable for beardie as it leads to runny poo, high blood pressure, diuresis, difficulties in osmoregulation as well as diabetes. In addition, excess water will make your beardie docile or less active.
Mango species such as chaunsa have high water content as compared to others and should be fed least when they have not reached overripe condition.
Select mangoes, such as apple mangoes, which has low water content to eliminate such problems. It is also necessary to avoid overripe mangoes as they to be more acid the benzoic acid content in some mango species increases as they overripe.</p>
<h3 id="2-mangoes-with-high-sugar-levels"><strong>2. Mangoes With High Sugar Levels</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, mangoes have relatively high sugar content of about 7.68g per every 100g of mango salad. Excess sugar intake by beardies cause high blood pressure, diabetes and heart attack. In addition, sugar accumulates within teeth gaps and lead to teeth decay  this is very common.
Select low sugar mango species for your beardies occasional or daily feed supplement e.g.� keitt mango, osteen mango or haden mango varieties.
You can feed your beardie with mangoes that are about to ripen  they usually have low sugar content.</p>
<h3 id="3-mangoes-with-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio"><strong>3. Mangoes With Low Calcium: Phosphorous Ratio</strong></h3>
<p>One great problem of mangoes is that they have low calcium: phosphorous ratio of 0.4:1. This is dangerous since excess phosphorous inhibits (binds) calcium from being absorbed into the bloodstream leading to calcium deficiency disease called metabolic bone disease.
However, you can boost beardies calcium level in the mango salad by adding commercially manufactured calcium powder supplement when feeding.
You need to know that low calcium to phosphorous ration will also affect absorption of carbs by your beardie. Therefore, select mango species that have relatively high calcium: phosphorous ratio.

<h3 id="4-mangoes-with-high-acidity-level-">**4. Mangoes With High Acidity Level **</h3>
<p>Most mangoes have about 0.12% of RDI acid in every 100g of mango salad. Acid such as tartaric, benzoic acid and few traces of citric acid in some mongo species will affect the digestion process of beardies. Actually, high acid level will inactivate digestive enzymes leading to vomiting or drooling of the beardies.
You should consider mango species such as haden, keitt or apple mangoes that have least acid content as frequent diet supplement for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="5-mangoes-with-high-oxalate-content"><strong>5. Mangoes With High Oxalate Content</strong></h3>
<p>Just like phosphorous, oxalate found in some mango species will inhibit calcium absorption leading to metabolic bone disease. Moreover, oxalate will also limit carbs absorption and digestion of starch. It is therefore necessary to select mango species with low oxalate content.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragon-eat-mango-peels-stems-and-leaves">Can Bearded Dragon Eat Mango Peels, Stems and Leaves?</h2>
<p>Normally, bearded dragons do not eat stems and barks of mango tree since they are hard to digest and post swallowing challenges. Though mango lives have nutritious content, beardies dont like them they are rough, irritate beardies tongue and damage the mouth lining.
However, most bearded dragons will eat mango peels if they are well sliced/chopped. Actually, mango peels contain important antioxidant compounds necessary for destruction of free radicals that may be found within beardie body tissues.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded dragon will easily eat mangoes to acquire vitamin A, B6, C, E and K. In addition, mangoes have rich pre-biotic dietary fibers as well as rich mineral content.
Notably, low fat and cholesterol content makes mango salad a suitable feed supplement. However, mangoes contain relatively high sugar, moderate oxalate/acid and low calcium: phosphorous ratio and thus should be used occasionally.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bearded dragons enjoy a diverse and balanced diet that includes leafy greens such as collard greens and
cabbage
, as well as vegetables like bell peppers,
tomatoes
, and
carrots
.
However, it is crucial to carefully assess the food you offer to these unique and docile reptiles, as some foods may be unsafe for their consumption.
So, mushrooms: <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> they safe for Bearded Dragons?
<em>In summary, it&rsquo;s generally unsafe to feed mushrooms to bearded dragons - despite these bites having essential nutrients.�Although mushrooms have essential nutrients, many varieties, including wild mushrooms, are toxic to reptiles, including bearded dragons.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Besides, the consumption of mushrooms can lead to digestive problems or organ failure in bearded dragons due to these bites having high acidity levels and an unbalanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio.�</em>
<strong>Check out these Bearded Dragon Foods.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risks-in-feedingmushrooms-to-bearded-dragons">Risks in Feeding**Mushrooms to **<strong>Bearded Dragons�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-unbalanced-calcium-to-phosphorus-ratio-causes-bone-related-illnesses"><strong>1. U</strong>*nbalanced *<em>calcium-to-phosphorus ratio Causes Bone-related Illnesses</em></h3>
<p>The�calcium-to-phosphorus ratio is a critical aspect when analyzing the foods to give your�bearded dragons. Phosphorus has a critical role in cell functioning and energy production. On the other hand, Calcium is required to appropriate metabolic processes, bone development, and muscle function.
However, the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio must be carefully balanced - their diet must contain a high amount of calcium compared to phosphorus.</p>
<ul>
<li>An imbalance where the bearded dragon&rsquo;s diet has more phosphorus (than calcium) leads to lower rates of�calcium absorption and thus may result in diseases like metabolic bone disease (MBD), fractures, deformities, or even brittle bones.
Bearded dragons require a diet with a calcium-to-phosphorous ratio of 2:1 or 1:1. However, mushrooms have high phosphorus ratios and may lead to bone-related health conditions. For instance, the ratio in portabella mushrooms is 1:16.3 - calcium to phosphorous.
So, feeding your bearded dragon with mushrooms isnt good for their health. The unbalanced Ca:P ratio in mushrooms interferes with calcium absorption in the beardies body.</li>
<li>This results in calcium deficiency which in turn leads to problems such as metabolic bone disease, muscle weakness, and the inability of blood to clot.
When the amount of phosphorous exceeds calcium, phosphorous reacts with calcium to form calcium phosphate which is difficult to absorb in the gut.</li>
<li>Further, experts recommend including more foods that have a balanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/">dragon&rsquo;s diet</a>. Some of these foods are vegetables and calcium-dusted insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-oxalic-acid-in-mushrooms-negatively-affects-calcium-levels">**2. **<strong>Oxalic Acid in Mushrooms Negatively Affects calcium levels�</strong></h3>
<p>Mushrooms have a considerable amount of oxalic acid - an element that&rsquo;ll negatively affect the levels of calcium that&rsquo;s available in the body of your bearded dragon.
So, if you feed mushrooms to bearded dragons, the oxalic acid in the food will bind with calcium to create calcium oxalate (CaC2O4)- a compound that is insoluble and indigestible to your bearded dragons.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, binding calcium in an insoluble compound implies that there less calcium will be readily absorbed for proper body functioning in the beaded dragon such as in bone formation - read this may cause calcium deficiency.
As noted earlier, calcium is a vital nutrient in these reptiles as it helps in enhancing metabolic processes,� nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and making strong bones.</li>
<li>To make up for the low calcium levels, the body tends to get calcium from available sources such as bones. This leads to a condition called metabolic bone disease where bones become soft and weak.
Signs of metabolic bone disease in bearded dragons include deformed limbs, arched spine, limping, bone fracture, and lethargy among others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-mushrooms">Alternatives to Mushrooms</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear, by now, that mushrooms are unsafe for your bearded dragons and so I dig deep into finding nutritious and suitable alternatives for the reptile&rsquo;s diet.</p>
<h3 id="1-leafy-greens">1. Leafy Greens</h3>
<p>Using leafy greens the diet of your bearded dragon will help increases the calcium levels absorbed in their bodies.
These greens will give the pets suitable and safe minerals and vitamins. Exp[erts recommend using some of these leafy greens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mustard greens</li>
<li>Collard greens</li>
<li>Kale</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-vegetables">2. Vegetables</h3>
<p>Bearded dragons will benefit from vegetables - as an alternative to the nutrients they could have acquired from mushrooms.
Include some of these vegetables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Bell peppers</li>
<li>Tomatoes
The vegetable will give your bearded dragons an excellent mix of fiber and vitamins -which will significantly benefit the good health of your pet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-calcium-dusted-insects">3. Calcium-dusted insects</h3>
<p>Feed the bearded dragon with calcium-rich foods such as calcium-dusted insects - they&rsquo;ll also offer proteins. You may require to dust these insects with some reptile-friendly calcium powder before feeding your beaded dragons.
Some foods under this category include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dubia Roaches</li>
<li>Mealworms</li>
<li>Crickets
You can supplement calcium for the reptiles through substrates - Experts recommend using some considerable
substrate
in the diet of these reptiles to supplement the calcium levels in their food - but this must be done in moderation to avoid impaction or digestive problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mushroom-toxicity-for-bearded-dragons"><strong>Mushroom Toxicity for Bearded Dragons�</strong></h2>
<p>Although some mushrooms are included in the human diet, therere a few species of toxic mushrooms. They are potentially harmful to both humans and animals including bearded dragons when accidentally ingested.
Out of the common mushroom species, only a few species are lethal. Many others will only lead to noticeable symptoms when ingested by humans or animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms is extremely difficult because they share a lot of similarities.</li>
<li>Thats why misidentification is the leading cause of mushroom poisoning in humans.
Mushrooms can grow anywhere theres high moisture content including the yard, garden, basement, garage, and so on. To avoid accidental ingestion by your bearded dragon, kids, or other animals its advisable to get rid of any wild mushrooms.
Some of the common toxic mushrooms include:</li>
<li>Amanita phalloides</li>
<li>Inocybe</li>
<li>Amanita muscaria</li>
<li>Amanita pantherina</li>
<li>Clitocybe</li>
<li>Scleroderma citrinum

<h3 id="1-symptoms-of-mushroom-poisoning-in-bearded-dragons"><strong>1. Symptoms of Mushroom Poisoning in Bearded Dragons</strong></h3>
<p>Bearded dragons are usually confined to their tanks or terrarium. However, some beardie owners may once in a while take their pets outdoors to get some warmth from the sunlight.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your bearded dragon accidentally eats poisonous mushrooms in the yard, it may fall sick within a short time or even die.
Symptoms of mushroom poisoning vary depending on the pets vulnerability and the mushroom species. Below are some symptoms to look for in case your bearded dragon or other pets accidentally eats toxic mushrooms:
**a. Gastrointestinal Irritation (GI): **
It is the first sign of mushroom poisoning and may entail diarrhea and vomiting. These symptoms occur within 6 hours and may last up to 24 hours. However, if GI is not accompanied by other symptoms, its an indication of mild poisoning. Thus, it may not require major veterinary intervention.
<strong>b. Muscarinic Effects and GI:</strong>
If gastrointestinal irritation is accompanied by muscarinic effects such as pupil constriction, tear production, and drooling, these could be signs of more serious poisoning. In this case, your bearded dragon needs veterinary attention as soon as possible.
<strong>c. Muscarinic Effects, GI plus Lethargy, and Depression:</strong>
Apart from the muscarinic effects and gastrointestinal irritation, severe symptoms like lack of energy, depression, bleeding, and seizures. Eyes and the mucus membrane may turn yellow indicating possible liver damage.
These could be symptoms of Amanita phalloides mushrooms popularly known as death cap. Symptoms begin within six hours and may last up to 20 hours. Serious clinical attention is required to avoid fatality.
<strong>d. Hallucinogenic Syndrome:</strong>
Though nontoxic the magic mushroom causes hallucinogenic symptoms such as staggering, seizure, depression, muscle problems, or coma in severe cases. Since these mushrooms are illegal, its unlikely to find them in someones yard.
The only possible place your pet may pick magic mushroom is from the trash. If such symptoms are observed, serious veterinary intervention is required.</li>

or have you seen one at you field or zoo and even wonder what they actually eat?
But when it comes to other foods such as onions, you may need to pay a little bit of attention.
<em>So, can bearded Dragon Eat Onions?�</em>
<strong>The simple answer is No. Never feed bearded dragon with (cooked or raw). Onions are laced with high levels of acids and have high calcium to phosphorous ratio. These components cause indigestion problems along the delicate alimentary canal of Bearded Dragon.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-onions">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Onions?</h2>
<h3 id="1-toxic-to-their-digestive-system">1. Toxic to their digestive system</h3>
<p>Onions (scientific name
<em>Allium cepa</em>
) usually contain toxic substance which when eaten by Bearded Dragon, it toxifies the alimentary canal leading to digestion problems such as incomplete digestion,
<a href="https://www.vetexotic.theclinics.com/article/S1094-9194(16)30081-0/abstract">vomiting and burning sensation</a>
.</p>
<p>You will notice mixed reaction when you feed your beard dragon with onions due to colorless steam produced by fleshly cut onions. These steam emissions from onions usually make your
pet bearded dragon
to even shed tears (though they dont cry like human beings do).</p>
<ul>
<li>Though scientific research has been done, it has not been able to establish the exact chemical that cause tears and itching sensation on bearded dragon.
The onion leaves produces slippery fluid between leaf layers, which makes it unpleasant meal for your bearded dragon.� The green leafy onions have hollow inner sections that incubate gas, which causes vomiting to your bearded dragon when eaten.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-high-acidity-level">2. High Acidity level</h3>
<p>Onions have high level of acid content, which cause hurt burn and throat discomfort to your bearded dragon when eaten. The Folate (Folic Acid) &amp; ascorbic acid portions found in onions form a high pH environment in chyme within the stomach thus inhibiting normal working of digestive enzymes (high acid levels inactivates the digestive enzymes).</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw onions when eaten causes burning sensation (due to acid content) on the tongue and inner lining of Bearded dragons mouth. This feeling makes the pet get agitated or angry leading to loss of appetiteand they can&rsquo;t mate.
The red onions (normally fed to bearded dragons most  have white fleshy interior leaves and are sweet) have compound that affect the red blood cells of your bearded dragon leading to low cell count.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-unbalance-nutrition-components-calcium-to-phosphorous-ratio">3. Unbalance Nutrition components (Calcium to Phosphorous ratio).</h3>
<p>Onions have unbalance calcium to phosphorous ratio. For every 1gram of calcium, there is 2 grams of phosphorous in a given onion species. This on itself cause ion imbalance in the body.
High level of phosphorous as compared to calcium is not ideal for Bearded Dragon Survival. Excess or phosphorous will inhibit calcium intake leading adrenal or renal disorder. On the other hand, excess or calcium within the body may not be healthy for your bearded dragon (this may result from inhibition caused by the phosphorous within the bones or kidneys).
Proper calcium to phosphorous ratio for your bearded dragon to achieve healthy life is 2 grams of calcium for every gram of phosphorous or 1:1 ratio. This will ensure a balance calcium intake and phosphorous removal from the bones and thus preventing any possible disorder.
Onion has other nutritional components that may be of nutritional value for your bearded dragon. For every 100 grams of onions sliced for analysis, the following nutritional components will be found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calcium  23 milligrams ,<strong>Phosphorus  29 milligrams</strong>&amp; Potassium  146 milligrams</li>
<li>Iron  0.21 milligrams &amp; Magnesium  10 milligrams</li>
<li>Protein  1.1 gram, Sugars  4.24 grams &amp;��� Carbohydrates  9.34 grams</li>
<li><em>Folate (Folic Acid)  19 micrograms &amp; Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid)  7.4 milligrams</em></li>
<li><em>Pantothenic Acid (B5)  0.123 milligrams</em>&amp; Niacin (B3)  0.116 milligrams
By observation, it is clear that the phosphorous (written in bold) levels in sample is far much high as compared to calcium. In addition, the acidity level in different onion nutritional components (written in italic) are far much high too. This means that onions are not suitable for bearded dragon at whatever case.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rule-and-guidelines-to-follow-when-feeding-your-bearded-dragon">Rule and Guidelines to Follow When Feeding Your Bearded Dragon.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Any plant feeds should be fresh, chopped and thoroughly washed before feeding your bearded dragon. Water provides added nutrition to your beaded dragon.</li>
<li>Never feed your bearded dragons with food pieces that are larger than the space between the eyes (this cause chocking while feeding).</li>
<li>Let your bearded dragon hunt for food (insects) introduced in the cage to enable it to exercise while moving.</li>
<li>Always ensure that you feed you bearded dragon from a dish to prevent it from direct swallowing, which may cause impaction leading to death or health complications.</li>
<li>Never leave excess food in the cage after feeding your bearded dragon -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-eggs/">including egg diet</a>
. This makes it less active or docile since most of them never stop eating.</li>
<li>It is always advisable to offer plant feed mixed with insects to boost the nutrients acquired per feed.</li>
<li>Fruits should be peeled and chopped when feeding your bearded dragon.</li>
<li>Never entrust your kids to feed your bearded dragon in your absence.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragon do not eat onions in any form (raw or cook). Though some owners mix onions with other feeds, this is not right since onions contain toxic substance, acids and high calcium to phosphorous ratio, which cause digestion problems.
It is therefore advisable to avoid giving your pet bearded dragon any onion species. Also, follow the feeding guidelines discussed above to ensure a healthy life for your pet bearded dragon.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">bearded</a> dragons eat oranges?</strong>
Well, previously we&rsquo;ve seen that
beardies feed on selected veggies, insects (bugs), fruits
.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The short answer is NO - bearded dragons don&rsquo;t eat oranges - oranges contain excessive fruit acid and sugar that may irritate the digestive system of the bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">dragon</a> causing dehydration and diarrhea.�</strong>
Also, oranges contain more phosphorous than calcium, giving a Ca:P ratio that is incorrect for bearded dragons.
These beardies love supplements that have a ratio of calcium: phosphorus ranging from 2:1 to 3:1. See other foods for bearded dragons.

</ul>
<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-oranges"><strong>Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat oranges?�</strong></h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feed
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/central-bearded-dragon">bearded dragons</a>
(or other lizards) with oranges. Oranges have excessive fruit acid and sugar that&rsquo;ll irritate the digestive system of your bearded dragon.
Like other citrus fruits, oranges are very acidic. When ingested by beardies, they can cause severe diarrhea plus dehydration.
Also, the consumption of oranges interferes with the pets Ca:P ratio. Oranges contain large amounts of phosphorus compared to calcium.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, calcium is utilized in the absorption of phosphorus from the intestines into the bloodstream.
The extra calcium required for phosphorus is obtained by the body from the bones.
This is a known cause of bone degeneration in beardies which are fed on oranges.�Read Also:

<strong>Side-note:�</strong>
<em>Feed Bearded dragons with very small portions of limited types of fruits - including grapes, pears, cherries, peaches, plums, raspberries, pineapples, apples, peeled bananas, watermelon, and papayas.�</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-orange-fed-insects"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Orange-Fed Insects?�</strong></h3>
<p>A bearded dragon may eat the food, but some may be poisoned, have serious illnesses, or death.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, is it okay to feed your omnivorous bearded dragon with oranges - maybe some Mandarin oranges?
Bearded dragons love eating small creatures like roaches, crickets, and so on.</li>
<li>Since roaches and crickets have an appetite for sugary foods, you can feed them with oranges to enrich their bodies with calcium.
Oranges are particularly very helpful in the thriving and reproduction of Dubai roaches.</li>
<li>If you feed your bearded dragon on these insects, youll be indirectly giving them the calcium in oranges.</li>
<li>Just like in humans, calcium helps in maintaining the bone health of your bearded dragon.
As for the citric acid, the insects digestive system breaks it down to levels that are just appropriate for your beardie to absorb.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-mandarin-oranges"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Mandarin Oranges?</strong></h3>
<p>Mandarin oranges are types of oranges that contain less concentrations of citric acid.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, they are still not far from being harmful to bearded dragons. The sugar content in these citrus fruits is likely to cause diarrhea.</li>
<li>These creatures require a high plant intake in their diet. Plant diet is broken down by beneficial micro-organisms in the beardies gut.
However, optimum activity for these organisms is significantly hindered by the acidity in oranges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-drink-orange-fruit-juice"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Drink Orange Fruit Juice?</strong></h3>
<p>The sugar content and acidity remain the same whether you have the raw orange fruit or its juice.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, orange fruit juice should not be fed to bearded dragons since it can also cause diarrhea and dehydration.
Further, bearded dragons have poor drinking habits. Theyre so accustomed to desert conditions that they rarely take drinks when in captivity.</li>
<li>So, you might not bring your bearded dragon to drink orange fruit juice.</li>
<li>It takes time to teach bearded dragons to start drinking anything including water.
But in case you manage, do not give it orange fruit juice.�Read Also:

</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-citrus-fruits"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Citrus Fruits?</strong></h3>
<p>Oranges are in the class of citrus fruits and so are grapefruits and lemons.
Fruits in this class contain different levels of citrus acid concentration. So none of these should be fed to bearded dragons.
The acidity and sugar levels in citrus fruits will readily cause diarrhea in bearded dragons and other lizards.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, citrus fruits contain high levels of oxalic acid, especially on their peels.
It combines with calcium to form an insoluble compound (calcium oxalate).�This causes a deficiency in calcium which in turn leads to bone degeneration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-oranges-peels"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Oranges Peels?</strong></h3>
<p>Orange peels should not be fed on bearded dragons because they are also very acidic.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also contain oxalic acid which combines with dietary calcium to form calcium oxalate (CaC2O4).</li>
<li>This leads to lower levels of calcium which is necessary for phosphorous absorption.
To compensate for the low calcium levels, the body system uses calcium from the bones which lead to bone degeneration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-clementines"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Clementines?</strong></h3>
<p>Clementines are close relatives of oranges derived from the crossing of sweet orange and mandarin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since theyre acidic, they should not be fed on bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Their acid content is much less than in oranges.
Although clementines are a good source of calcium, phosphorous, and fiber, their acidic content isnt good for your beardie.
Like other citrus fruits, it has the potential to cause diarrhea. In addition, the sugar level and the Ca:P ratio arent good for your beardie.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-tangerines"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Tangerines?</strong></h3>
<p>Tangerines are close relatives to oranges, mandarins, and clementines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a citrus fruit, tangerine also has excessive acidity and sweetness. That rules out its viability as food for bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Tangerines have loose and thick skin with orange flesh and are red-colored.
But these fruits have a slightly reduced sourness. But Tangerines are very acidic to be fed to bearded dragons like their staple food.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-bearded-dragons-eat-in-the-wild">What Do Bearded Dragons Eat in the Wild?</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons are
omnivorous lizards that&rsquo;ll also eat wild vegetation such as leaves and some fruits.
The beardies will feed on
vertebrates like lizards plus invertebrates such as beetles and ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beardies will forage the wild vegetation and fruits plus flowers, plants, and small-sized bugs.
These pets can go for a long time with no food while conserving energy as they wait for suitable prey including small bugs.</li>
<li>The wild bugs and vegetation provide the bearded dragons with nutrients plus vitamins to supplement their regular diet.
Thus, the captive beardies may need supplements to match such nutritional supply - but you can give them salads and bugs.</li>
<li>Also, make the beardies work a bit to get their food while you&rsquo;re equally providing diet change.
Further, you may simulate wild feeding by providing videos - this also enhances their physical and mental health.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons must never be fed with citric fruit because they&rsquo;re highly acidic and have high sugar levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>As much as you want to give a calcium diet to your bearded dragon, you should avoid feeding them with oranges.</li>
<li>The sweetness and acidity of oranges and other citrus fruits arent good for the health of your beardie.
Therefore, you should feed them with alternative foods like kale, carrots, collard greens, and other leafy vegetables.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">bearded</a> dragons will eat fruits like peaches, watermelon, strawberries, and even apples. But can bearded dragons eat spinach - the green leafy vegetable?</p>
<ul>
<li>Can spinach harm the bearded dragons or does it hold some significant nutritional value for them?
<strong>So, technically, YES - bearded dragons will feed on spinach as it&rsquo;s not toxic to these pets and the leafy vegetables have some level of nutritional value.�</strong>
But spinach has notable compounds that would make the vegetable unsuitable for feeding to the bearded dragons on a regular basis. So, we generally advise you to avoid spinach in the beardies&rsquo; diet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check these
[Bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">Dragon</a> Feeding Guide](<a href="https://www.birdsandexotics.com/wp-content/uploads/Bearded-Dragon-ARAV.pdf">https://www.birdsandexotics.com/wp-content/uploads/Bearded-Dragon-ARAV.pdf</a>)
.</p>
<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-spinach">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Spinach?</h2>
<p>Veterinarians consider that you don&rsquo;t start or stop feeding spinach to your bearded dragon. But 1-2 spinach leaves won&rsquo;t be dangerous to your pet.</p>
<ul>
<li>A section of the dragon pet keeps saying that they won&rsquo;t feed their beardies with spinach to avoid the risk. I approve of this since spinach is instant necessary for the development of the pet.
So, I would recommend you consider other more nutritious and safer food or bites to feed your dragon compared to using spinach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dietary-requirements-for-bearded-dragon">Dietary requirements for Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons will require a dietary balanced meal that included veggies, fruits, and insects.</p>
<p>The adult dragon will require 20% insects and 80% plants. But baby or younger dragons require 30% plants and 70% insects (meat) or even 50-50 as advised by the veterinarian.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bearded dragons are considered omnivores - and thus they&rsquo;ll feed on both plant and meat foods. But their nutritional requirement will change with their age.</li>
<li>So, if you&rsquo;re checking out meat alternatives or sources to give your dragons, I would recommend trying some Nightcrawlers. Further, the plant-based dies must have mainly vegetables.
Feeding Spinach to�Bearded Dragons? Any Benefits?</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of feeding spinach to our bearded dragons include that it offers some level of nutritional value.</p>
<p>These are the nutritional values of raw spinach - this is per every 100 grams as noted by the
<em>Agriculture Department in the United States.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Magnesium 79 mg</li>
<li>Iron 2.71 mg</li>
<li>Vitamin A469 �g</li>
<li>Vitamin C28.1 mg</li>
<li>Protein 2.86 g</li>
<li>Fat 0.39 g</li>
<li>Potassium 558 mg</li>
<li>Phosphorus 49 mg</li>
<li>Calcium 99 mg</li>
<li>Sugar 0.42 g</li>
<li>Water 91.4 g</li>
<li>Fiber 2.2 g</li>
<li>Carbohydrates 3.63 g</li>
<li>Energy 23 kcal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-rich-in-antioxidants--minerals">1. Rich in Antioxidants &amp; Minerals</h3>
<p>Spinach is an antioxidant- and nutrient-rich vegetable as it comes with high levels of calcium, iron, folic acid, vitamin K, vitamin C, and carotenoids.</p>
<ul>
<li>On anti-oxidants, spinach is a great source of antioxidants such as lutein which is considered to reduce the probability of macular degeneration and enhance eye health.</li>
<li>Spinach contains a great blend of antioxidants and minerals that&rsquo;ll help the dragon to evade heart problems as it reduces cholesterol levels.
The anti-oxidants and minerals will also strengthen the bearded dragon&rsquo;s bones and tissue� - keeping the dragon&rsquo;s bonds strong and also healthy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-suitable-vitamins-source">2. Suitable Vitamins Source</h3>
<p>The beaded dragons will reap some significant vitamin quantities in the spinach - these include vitamins C, B-6, and A.
<strong>Vitamin C -</strong>
The USDA notes that there are 28.1 mg Vitamin C in every 100-gram of spinach - these include either the semi-savoy spinach, flat spinach, or savoy spinach.</p>
<p>Vitamin C has a major role in the repair, growth, and development of body tissues. The vitamin will assist in absorbing iron, maintaining bones and immunity.
<strong>Vitamin B-6</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin B-6 in spinach will help animals create their antibodies - these aid in fighting disease &amp; infections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin B-6 will help in the development of the nervous and immune systems while minting excellent brain development while also keeping appropriate weight.
<strong>Vitamin A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin aids in the development of excellent vision - while also promoting the growth of a suitable immune system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-high-potassium-levels">3. High Potassium Levels</h3>
<p>Spinach equally has high potassium levels - notably, a single spinach cup will have as high as 167-mg of potassium.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be great to notes that compared to amounts of potassium on a banana, spinach contains largely more. But how does Potassium help? Well, Potassium assists to keep normal fluid levels in the animal cells.</li>
<li>Further, the nutrient will assist muscles in contracting and keep blood pressure at normal.
Besides, potassium will also assist in regulating the normal body fluid levels, muscle activity, and kidney function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-suitable-phosphorus--calcium-balance">4. Suitable Phosphorus &amp; Calcium Balance</h3>
<p>Spinach will also offer a great Phosphorus &amp; Calcium balance that the bearded dragons will love.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is especially important for the younger beardies that will suffer when calcium levels are low in their diet.</li>
<li>Therefore, I recommend that you spray some supplements with calcium powder on the dragon&rsquo;s food. Further, we&rsquo;ve talked about phosphorous above, and this ingredient helps in binding the calcium for easier absorption.
Notable, metabolic bone disease (MBD) will arise in the dragon if it does not have adequate calcium in its body - 100 grams of spinach has phosphorus to calcium amounts of 49 mg and 99 mg.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-low-levels-of-fat-sugar-and-calories">5. Low Levels of Fat, Sugar, and Calories</h3>
<p>The bearded dragon could also be affected by obesity and thus it&rsquo;s important to control nutrients and ingredients that could contribute to this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>For this issue, spinach will have low levels of fats, sugars, and calories - and thus it&rsquo;ll be a great treat.
For hydration, the spinach also offers excellent water content that&rsquo;ll largely benefit the bearded dragons.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feeding-spinach-to-bearded-dragons-what-are-the-risks">Feeding Spinach to Bearded Dragons? What are the Risks?</h2>
<h3 id="1-calcium-and-oxalates">1. Calcium and Oxalates</h3>
<p>One of the challenges that will arise from feeding the spinach to your bearded dragons includes that there may be dangers of not getting inadequate calcium and high oxalates in the diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>This may occur when the dragons eat foods that have high amounts of phosphorous in comparison to what they have as calcium.
Further, the high levels of oxalic acids and oxalates in the spinach have proven to be problematic to bearded dragons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-risk-of-metabolic-bone-disease">2. Risk of Metabolic Bone Disease</h3>
<p>Feeding spinach to your bearded dragons makes you risk metabolic bone disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>The under 2 years with the beardies may become calcium-deficient and this may contribute to them having deformed, weak, and soft bones.
When the diet has low calcium, vitamin D-3, while also having high phosphorus - and this may cause a high risk of MBD.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in summary, should I feed my bearded dragons with spinach? Well, spinach is an okay munch for your dragon as it has good calcium: phosphorous ratio.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, spinach has high oxalates that will prevent the absorption of calcium and this may trigger metabolic bone disease in the beardie.
Cheers!</li>

<a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/ear-mites-otodectes-in-cats-and-dogs">Ear mites</a>
will cause your dogs to scratch and shake their ears very frequently. They live in their ear canal &amp; cause itchiness, as evidenced by frequent scratching.
<em>The simple answer is  YES. These parasites spread rapidly and can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with the affected animal. It&rsquo;s sporadic for humans to catch ear mites. If they get into your body, they won&rsquo;t survive for long since they are not adapted to live in a human host.�</em>
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/blogs/fullyvetted/2012/feb/sarcoptic_vs_demodectic_mange-12823">Demodectic mites and sarcoptic mites</a>
are common mites that can be transmitted from dogs to humans. So, you might be worried about ear mites being transmitted from your dogs to your family.�Related:

<h2 id="details-can-humans-get-ear-mites-from-dogs-symptoms">Details: Can Humans Get Ear Mites from Dogs? Symptoms</h2>
<p>Dogs are prone to ear mites, especially the
<em>Otodectes cynotis</em>
. They live inside the ear canal, where they feed on skin oils and wax. You can only see them with the help of an otoscope or microscope.
They are associated with intense itching and redness on the ears of the affected animal. This causes the animal to scratch at the back of the ear, often leading to bruises and possible secondary infection.
Ear mites are, however, not a threat to humans. But since they are highly contagious, they can easily be transmitted from one
dog to another or even humans
.
When you interact with your affected dogs, these tiny creatures may crawl and find their way into your body. You are also likely to catch ear mites when your infected dog shakes its head near you -
allow them to sleep on dog beds
.
Since ear mites feed on dead skin, it is possible to find them on your skin or underneath it. In rare cases, they can get into your ear canal to feed on the waxy secretions therein.
Outdoor dogs are more likely to get infected with ear mites and may affect other pets or humans. But you don&rsquo;t have to worry about ear mites. When they arrive on your body, they are not known to survive for long. They won&rsquo;t even cause severe infection. In rare cases, ear mites can cause a temporary rash on your arms or other extremities.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms-of-ear-mites-in-humans"><strong>Symptoms of Ear Mites in Humans</strong></h2>
<p>Dogs and cats
happen to be natural hosts
for ear mites. However, in rare cases, the mites can be transmitted to humans. Since they don&rsquo;t survive in humans for long, there may be no signs of infection. Usually, the symptoms of ear mites appear to be similar to those of other species of mites. These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skin irritation</li>
<li>Itchiness</li>
<li>Redness on the skin</li>
<li>Stained waxy inside the infected ear(s)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-dogs-get-ear-mites"><strong>How Do Dogs Get Ear Mites?</strong></h2>
<p>Ear mites are tiny creatures, but they move very quickly. When one of your dogs is infected, these mites can find their way into other pets in a short period. Adult ear mites can live up to months and multiply rapidly. Eggs hatch after only four days and reach maturity after three weeks.
When your outdoor dog interacts and gets into contact with affected dogs, it becomes easy for them to contract ear mites. Although they don&rsquo;t
fly or jump
, these mites crawl from the adjacent dogs to your dogs.
Alternatively, dogs may get the mites from a kennel that has been previously infected with ear mites. Fortunately, your
dog might brush
off ear mites with their paw or tongue. However, if the mites manage to get into the ear canal, your dog cannot remove them.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-know-my-dog-has-ear-mites"><strong>How Do I Know My Dog Has Ear Mites?</strong></h2>
<p>The earliest indicators that your dog has ear mites are frequent scratching and shaking of the ears. If you look closely inside the ears, the skin appears irritated and reddish. However, it would help if you ruled out irritations and redness caused by yeast or bacterial infections.
You can perform a simple test to confirm whether the symptoms are due to ear mites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a cotton ball, remove the black debris from your dog&rsquo;s ear canal. If the waste has already dried, you can loosen them with some mineral oil.</li>
<li>Scrutinize the sample for white dots, the size of a comma. A flashlight will help you observe the sample for ear mites. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you will see them moving around.</li>
<li>If you cannot ascertain whether your dog has been infected with ear mites, consult your local veterinarian. He/she will insert an otoscope into the ear canal to observe any mite activity. Alternatively, a sample can be removed from the ear and observed under a microscope.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-contagious-are-ear-mites"><strong>How Contagious Are Ear Mites?</strong></h2>
<p>Ear mites are small and contagious creatures almost the size of a comma. They mostly inhabit the ear canal of
dogs and cats
, where they thrive on the secretions and dead skin therein. They breed and multiply quickly and can spread to the head and other parts of the body.
They are just as contagious as fleas and may cause fungal and bacterial infections. Inflammation in the ear canal is also very likely to occur. In severe infestations, the eardrum can get ruptured, and this may lead to permanent hearing loss.
Puppies and kittens are more vulnerable to ear mites because of their low body immunity. They catch the mites from their mothers or other dogs they interact with. If your dog goes outdoors, it&rsquo;s very likely to catch ear mites and infect other pets in the compound.

<h2 id="how-to-treat-your-dog-for-ear-mites"><strong>How to Treat Your Dog for Ear Mites</strong></h2>
<p>Treat your dog as per the guidelines of your veterinarian. Wrong medications can harm your pet. A veterinarian uses special equipment to examine and recommend the correct medications.
If there&rsquo;s more than one pet in the compound, have them checked for ear mites. This will ensure that all the affected pets are treated to avoid re-infestation. Ear mite treatment will entail the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the help of a cotton ball, clean the affected dogs or pets&rsquo; inner ear to get rid of debris. They appear as dark and waxy substances often resembling ground coffee. If the substance tends to stick to the ear walls, you can loosen it with mineral oil.</li>
<li>Once the ears are clean, apply the prescribed parasiticide directly into the dog&rsquo;s ear tokill and removeear mites. Some antibiotics may be prescribed to help in the recovery process in case of a very severe infection.</li>
<li>Your veterinarian will also include a prescription for subsequent treatments. You&rsquo;ll be informed of the frequency of administering the medications.</li>
<li>Washing your dog regularly can help remove ear mites from their body even before they get into their ears. Veterinarians encourage washing pets with shampoo and water at least once a week to disinfect them.</li>
<li>Clean your pet&rsquo;s house regularly to keep mites at bay and reduce re-infestation.</li>
<li>Usually, your veterinarian will ask you to return for regular check-ups to monitor the remedy&rsquo;s effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-ear-mite-infections"><strong>How to Prevent Ear Mite Infections</strong></h2>
<p>So you want to keep your dog free from ear mites! But how does your pet get these creatures?
Well, dogs will catch ear mites when they get into direct contact with affected pets or surfaces. Whether at home or the dog park, any infected pet is likely to infect your dog with ear mites. They can be picked from the surfaces or hurled at them when the infected dog shakes its head.
Another place your dog is likely to pick ear mites is an infested kennel or bedding. However, you can keep your dog free from ear mites by following these strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first and most important approach is to limit your dog movement to public places that pose a risk of ear mites.</li>
<li>In case your dog gets into contact with affected pets or visits their kennel, wash the animal with shampoo and treat it with parasiticides.</li>
<li>Regularly check your pet&rsquo;s ears and clean any accumulated waxy. A veterinarian can help you check the interior of the ears. Cleaning also helps in depriving ear mites of their favorite food.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t want to keep your dog in restriction for fear of ear mites. So, you can apply some topical repellents behind their shoulders to keep ear mites at bay. These repellentswork effectively against otherparasites like ticks and fleas.
You&rsquo;re, however, required to use them regularly to keep these parasites away from your pets. For your pets&rsquo; safety, ensure you get a prescription from a qualified veterinarian before using these products.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Ear mites can be transmitted from dogs to humans through direct contact or when the animal shakes its head. Unlike in dogs, ear mites won&rsquo;t survive in human hosts for long.
So you don&rsquo;t expect them to have any symptomatic effects on
humans within the short stay
. Compared to other mite infections, ear mites are less severe. Their impact on dogs and other pets will depend on the severity of the disease.
However, with proper animal husbandry and expert treatment, you can quickly get rid of them and prevent future infestation.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Could be you have come across lizards in a pond, river, sea, ocean, or stagnant water at your home and wonder how they move about. How do they cross water bodies? So,</p>
<ul>
<li>can lizard Swim?�*
**The direct answer is, YES! Lizards can swim in water bodies including rivers, seas, oceans, or pods. These reptiles use their tail to propel themselves forward when swimming plus use front limbs for vertical movement. **
<strong>Some lizards like Gecko can even walk on water. Lizard, they&rsquo;re vertebrates, such as Marine Iguanas can swim in deep seas or oceans down to the floor in search of food while holding their breath for 45 minutes.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-can-lizards-swim-can-they-drown-movement">Details: Can Lizards Swim? Can they Drown? Movement</h2>
<p>Lizards can swim. The swimming capability varies from one species to another and is determined by body size, shape and length of the tail. Some lizard species such as Gecko and skinks can walk or run on the water bodies.
Marine Iguana lizards are known to swim in deep waters and can hold its breath for over 45 minutes while feeding on its prey at the floor of sea or ocean. Lizard such as sandfish or
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/science/21obsand.html">saharan lizard</a>
can swim even on sand instead of walking.</p>
<h3 id="1-mechanisms-used-by-lizards-to-swim">1. Mechanisms used by Lizards to Swim.</h3>
<p>Before getting into the water bodies, lizards take in a deep breath, which will sustain them while under the water. Then, the lizards walk into the water where they float since their large bellies offer suitable swimming buoyancy.</p>
<p>The Lizard, then, swings its tail sideways to propel it forward  tail is the main organ that is used mostly by lizard when swimming. The sideways movement of lizards tail is carried out intermittently and slowly unless the lizard detects danger (it flips tail fast to accelerate its escape motion).</p>
<p>Lizards use their legs to maintain themselves in a horizontal position. The front limbs will also be useful when lizards are changing their direction as they act as steering.</p>
<p>To dive downwards, the lizard pitches its head at a downward angle and locks the hind legs close to its body. Then, it uses its tail to propel itself downward. During the movement, the lizard holds its breath.</p>
<p>The Lizard is able to move vertically upward while using the font legs/limbs, which acts as flippers. The dorsal protrusion found at the back of the lizards help them from rolling sideways while swimming. They also acts as breakers for the sea/ocean current which may alter lizards movement.</p>
<p>The Iguana, Bearded dragon, Komodo dragon and Asian water monitor lizards are known to swim deep in the sea or ocean waters in search of food.�Once the lizard gets its tail detached, it may not be possible to swim well and may get drowned in most cases.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-bones/">Do Lizards Have Bones?</a></p>
<h3 id="2-distance-that-lizard-can-swim">2. Distance that Lizard can swim.</h3>
<p>Medium size Lizards can swim on the surface of water for 1 to 16 feet nonstop. They can also dive down up to 2 to 8 feet in search of prey.</p>
<p>Large Lizards such as Iguanas, Bearded dragon, Asian water monitor and Komodo dragon can swim more than 16 feet. In fact, Komodo lizard is known to swim 13 kilometers per hour. The Iguanas, Bearded Dragon and Komodo dragons are known to swim from one Island to another.</p>
<p>Most Lizard species prefer swimming on the surface since they are able to shoot their head up to blow and take in fresh air. The lizards tend to swim along the shoreline and wont get far into the sea or ocean lest they drown out of insufficient air since they cant breathe under water.</p>
<p>Marine Iguanas are able to swim down to ocean beds/floors in search of food. In addition, the marine Iguanas are well adapted to salty waters  they often blow off to remove salts from nasal cavities.</p>
<h3 id="3-challenges-faced-by-lizards-while-swimming">3. Challenges faced by Lizards while swimming.</h3>
<p>Drowning is major problem that face lizards while swimming. Though they can hold their breath longer (1 to 48 minutes) than other animals (human beings, birds), lizards get drowned when the air withheld replenishes.</p>
<p>Lizards that are used to flesh waters such as Nile monitor lizards will easily drown in case they find themselves in large water mass such as Mediterranean Sea.�Salty water environment makes the breathing activity of lizards difficult.</p>
<p>The salt particles block the nasal cavities and lizards breathing system causing them to drown or get fatigued faster. Though some lizards such as Marine Iguanas, Bearded Dragon and Komodo Dragons are adapted to swimming deep in salty sea and ocean waters.</p>
<p>However, most species of flesh water lizards are unable to fit in those environments.�Small size lizards are easily carried by sea and ocean current. They lack efficient braking mechanism and may be taken far into the water bodies where they get drowned.</p>
<p>Lizards that prefer to walk on water (gecko) are easily swept away by the water waves and eventually get drowned or fed by the prey.</p>
<h2 id="4-adaptation-of-lizards-to-swimming">4. Adaptation of Lizards to swimming.</h2>
<p>The following are adaptation of lizards to swimming. Lizards have web skin between their toes, which help them to float easily while swimming.</p>
<ol>
<li>The belly of lizard is flat and wide  this makes it float easily on water and thus increasing buoyancy while swimming.</li>
<li>Lizards have long tail, which help in forward propulsion.</li>
<li>The front limbs of lizards have wide and flat-bottomed toes, which help navigation.</li>
<li>The dorsal/back of the lizards protrude upwards slightly from the head to tail. This prevent lizards from rolling due to water current  acts as side breaks.</li>
<li>The lower part of the mouth of the lizards is large and act as reservoir for air when they are under the water.

</ol>
<h2 id="can-baby-lizard-swim">Can Baby Lizard Swim?</h2>
<p>Baby lizard can swim. Once hatched, the baby lizards have similar features as the adult lizards  only that they are not fully grown and adapted to full functionality.</p>
<p>The baby lizards swim in shallow water where heavy currents cannot drift them away. Their tail and dorsal protrusions are not fully developed to swimming and thus can easily be drowned.</p>
<p>The adult lizards help the baby lizards on how to swim by carrying them slight on their back. The Young lizard will then develop the art of flipping the legs and swaying of the tail slowly to being an expert with time.</p>
<p>Normally, a baby lizard can swim for 1 to 7 minutes before getting exhausted. It can move a distance of 1 to 10 feet on the surface. The baby lizards rarely swim under the water since they have not developed fully the art of withholding air while swimming.</p>
<p>Most of baby lizards that swim under water usually get drowned. In case you want to train your baby lizard pet on how to swim, you must ensure that you provide an underneath water protection.</p>
<p>You can make it step on a mesh table, which can allow water to pass and then tag it along as the baby lizard swim. This will make it easier to rescue your baby lizard pet in case it tend to drown.</p>
<p>You can also train your baby lizard to swim by holding it at chest region over the water and releasing it intermittently to make it swim. You can do so this at home using the basin water or the slow-running stream.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-can-lizard-hold-breathe-under-water"><strong>How Long Can Lizard Hold Breathe Under Water?</strong></h2>
<p>Normally, lizards do not breathe under water. They hold their breath while swimming under water. Small and medium size lizards such as Gecko and Skinks can hold their breath up to 16 minutes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, large lizards such as Iguanas, Asian Water monitor and Komodo dragon can hold breath for 30 to 50 minutes.</p>
<p>Marine Iguanas and Bearded dragon lizards can feed while holding breath under water. Lizards are able to swim back to the surface of water to take breath intermittently. This helps them to continue swimming without retreating to the shores.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-can-lizard-swim"><strong>How Long Can Lizard Swim?</strong></h2>
<p>Lizards can swim for 1 to 30 minutes nonstop. Most of the medium and small lizards swim in shallow waters and often retreat to the shores to bask and take extra breath.</p>
<p>Large lizards such as Tree crocodile Monitor can swim for 30 to 60 minutes continuously. In fact, Marine Iguanas swim very fast and is able to cover 13kilometers without stopping in 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Lizards are able to swim longer while on the water surface than when under water since they can shoot their head often to blow and take more air.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">Are Lizards Poisonous?</a></p>
<h2 id="can-lizards-walk-on-water"><strong>Can Lizards Walk On Water?�</strong></h2>
<p>Yes! Lizards such as Gecko and skinks tend to walk on water that swim. These lizards love shallow waters. Though they have long tails, they rarely use them to swim. Instead, they walk on the water surface by flipping their partially webbed limbs.</p>
<p>In Central America, the lizard called Jesus Christ lizard is known to literally walk on the water. This species has its body and legs adapted to maintain the lizard on the water body. It walks mostly against the water current to prevent it from being carried away.</p>
<p>At times, small lizards would run over the water. Gecko lizards are experts when it comes to running over the water bodies. They raise their tail slightly to acquire full momentum.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lizards can swim. They use their tail to propel them forward while on the surface or in deep water.</p>
<p>The partially webbed toes of the lizards help them in flapping and navigation while their flat-bottomed berry help in maintaining high buoyance of the lizard when swimming.</p>
<p>Some lizards such as gecko can walk and run on water. Baby lizards can swim though they may not be as excellent as the adult ones.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>So, on whether�can no-see-ums <a href="/posts/how-long-do-fleas-live-on-humans/">live</a> in my hair; NO, the no-see-ums or biting midges won&rsquo;t live in hair but may hide temporarily or get tangled shortly.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs will be<a href="https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/insects/bitingmidge.html">attracted by the CO2</a>released by animals and humans when exhaling. The biting midges will clearly lay their eggs and occupy moist soil.
No See Ums mainly in areas with high humidity and will populate a given location rapidly. They will live mainly around bogs, marshes, streams, and ponds.
For starters; no see ums are also known, by different people and regions, as punky, punkie, citrus, sand gnats,
sandflea
, or sandfly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-no-see-ums-live-in-my-hair">Can No-See-Ums Live in My Hair?</h2>
<p>When I was in Hawaii on vacation, no-see-ums tangled into my daughter&rsquo;s hair. We had to change her hairstyle into a gelled and short one as advised that it&rsquo;s best to avoid these bugs.
Therefore, walking through or sleeping in some wooded areas may allow the no-see-ums to jump onto your hair as their pets will be hiding in saturated or decomposing logs, algae, and mosses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pests will be attracted to or by carbon dioxide or light and thus lighting torches through the wood may make you vulnerable to gnats within your clothes and hair.</li>
<li>No see ums may be described as<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-no-see-ums-live-in-my-hair/">some tiny biting midges</a>looking like flies as they&rsquo;ll bite humans to leave an itchy feeling.
Despite that these bugs (insects) aren&rsquo;t invisible, they are small almost equal to the size of lint or some grain of dirt.</li>
<li>The insects go through the eggs, next larvae, then pupae, and finally adult stages - requiring about 2 to 6 weeks to attain full maturity.
Further, ensure to protect your pets including from the no see ums by spraying them with some eucalyptus or tea tree oil, especially on their
flea collar
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-no-see-ums-like-on-my-hair">What are the No See Ums Like on My Hair?</h2>
<p>On how to recognize these no see ums on my hair; well, these bugs are tiny measuring about 1 to 3 mm in their length.
On color, these bugs look grayish to reddish especially when they&rsquo;ve fed on blood. Therefore, if your hair is white or gray, you might find it challenging to see the pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the no see um species will have dark-patterns wings making them look grayish.
The mouthparts of these pests have some sheath and 4 cutting blades that&rsquo;ll help them dig into your skin or scalp - which could inflict massive pain.</li>
<li>So, ultimately, you may see some small red spots on your skin or scalp and hair when the pest has sucked blood from your body.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-no-see-ums-need-human-blood-to-reproduce">Will No See Ums need human Blood to Reproduce?</h2>
<p>On the feeding and reproduction habits of the biting midgets, the pest mainly feeds on nectar and plant sap.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the female no see ums require proteins to achieve effective eggs production and will thus they&rsquo;ll suck blood from vertebrates and small insects.
But the male no see ums won&rsquo;t be attracted to those vertebrates mainly so since their mouthparts arent adapted for biting either humans or other animals.
However, the female biting midges such as the Culicoides will also suck blood from amphibians, reptiles, birds, and also mammals. They&rsquo;re being attracted to the co2 released by the animals exhaling.</li>
<li>Further, some no see ums species like the Ceratopogonidae are considered predators and will thus capture and kill insect larvae, small worms, and protozoa.
Other no see um species will feed on organic matter, algae, fungi, and bacteria. The Leptoconops kertszi may disperse and bite humans up to 10 miles from the place that larvae developed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-bites-from-no-see-ums-on-the-head-and-skin">How to Treat Bites from No See Ums on the Head and Skin?</h2>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve noticed some no see ums on your hair, head, or skin, it&rsquo;s important to know how to deal with bug bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>As noted above, the male no see ums mainly feed on plant matter and nectar while the females will need come proteins to effectively lay eggs.
The skin bites will leave some sizable welt on the human scalp or skin - these welts may measure around 1 inch.
Treatment of these bites from no see ums will require that you wash the welt or wounds using some warm water &amp; soap.</li>
<li>The treatment will help reduce the pain and irritation while also averting further skin infection on your skin or head.
However, if the irritation continues further after you&rsquo;ve washed effectively, I recommend you apply some analgesic cream or cortisone. Further, talk to an expert doctor to handle the bites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-control-these-no-see-ums">How to Control these No See Ums?</h2>
<p>Controlling no see ums and their larvae too is considered a challenging task but the C. sonorensis species may prove easier to take out.
You can control the development of no see ums larvae by changing the bank form of those waste-water ponds, reducing leakage of troughs, and periodically changing the level of water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using insecticides to control no see ums may give you temporary success� - such as when you use the chemicals in the evenings, especially in the Gulf Coast or Atlantic Coast.
I would, however, recommend installing door and window screens that have small mesh sizes to control the no see ums in your spaces and hence prevent them from tangling in your hair.
In addition, if you&rsquo;ll be in the woods or camping, I approve the use of tents that are fitted with durable midge screens - but these must also have small-sized mesh screens.</li>
<li>But as an alternative, you may use clothes prayed with permethrin, DEET (diethytoluamide) to achieve temporary protection from the no see ums.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No see ums won&rsquo;t bite through your clothing or fabric like socks and thus having such covers on your hair or skin will afford extra protection from these pests.
Further, no see ums will not live in your hair but they hide there temporarily especially when you walk through some damp or forested area.
Using
citronella may help you
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-no-see-ums-repellent/">repel those no see ums</a>
from your hair and skin - but using DIY sprays such as eucalyptus or tea tree oil will be more effective - plus a

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a victim of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinger">wasps sting</a>
once is painful enough to leave a lasting impression regardless of whether you are a kid or an adult. Wasp stings generate excessive discomfort and can cause extreme allergic reactions in people who have sensitive skin.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, unpleasant incidents of wasp stings are more common than you think. Check the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/baby-wasp/">baby wasps</a>
for a detailed analysis.�But can wasps sting more than once?
<strong>Unlike the common misunderstanding, wasps can sting more than once without dying in the process. But did you know that these heavily criticized and aggressive insects can live with you peacefully in one space? If this sounds hard to believe in, continue reading this blog to find:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What causes the wasps to sting</li>
<li>Why wasps can sting multiple times</li>
<li>Not all wasps sting</li>
<li>How to tell if a wasp has stung you</li>
<li>The difference between wasps and bees
Contrary to the view that wasps are naturally destructive, they only use their venomous stinger for self-defense. Developing an understanding of their defense mechanism can help us devise preventive measures and ensure protection from any more unpleasant stings in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2236&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo;]</p>

<h2 id="why-do-wasps-sting">Why do Wasps Sting?</h2>
<p>The reason why you were struck with a wasps sting was probably that you unconsciously posed an imminent danger in some way. In other words, know that a wasp will attack you the moment it senses a fearful or threatening situation.</p>
<p>But a fearful situation can occur at anytime so why do the wasps mostly sting during summers? This is because female wasps tend to hibernate and lay eggs during winters.</p>
<p>They start producing new colonies in spring which then breaks down and disperse as soon as summers arrive. In the start, these dispersed, or worker wasps, are disoriented and so end up going in search of sweetened food and drinks. This, in turn, increases your chance of being exposed to wasps.</p>
<p>If you have wasps near your house, you would have noticed that their activity reduces at night. This is because wasps sleep at night and wake up to the slightest exposure of light  even if its just your flashlight!</p>
<h2 id="the-stinging-habit-of-wasps">The Stinging Habit of Wasps</h2>
<p>Being carnivores, wasps are very active when it comes to hunting. But they can also sting and defend themselves multiple times if they are aggravated or alarmed. This is because they dont lose their stinger when they sting. With each sting is some venom released, but its amount varies between wasps depending on how much each can hold in their body.</p>
<p>The only time they may not sting more than once is if they run out of venom. They can only sting again once the venom has regenerated. Some species of wasps are also capable of biting in addition to stinging when they feel attacked. But most resort to simply stinging in their attempts to deter humans who threaten their safety.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note is that the male wasps dont sting at all. This is because it is not physically possible for them to do so. Male wasps dont have a stinger and hence are neither too aggressive nor too protective  their sole purpose is to breed or pollinate.</p>
<p>Female wasps, on the other hand, are in charge of safeguarding their territory. Every time it stings, a female wasp also releases a pheromone that lets other female wasps know that it needs help.</p>
<p>So in case you thought a wasp stung you more than once, it was probably a whole pack of female wasps hinting you to run away!</p>

<p>Even in instances where wasps stung you more than once, keep in mind that they are not meant to kill you. Human deaths from wasp stings are incredibly rare. But the wasp stings do cause allergic reactions and immense pain.</p>
<p>The symptoms of a wasp sting can be grouped into three kinds of reactions:</p>
<h3 id="normal-local-reactions">Normal local reactions</h3>
<p>Majority of the non-allergic victims of wasp stings who face normal local reactions. It refers to developing a raised welt around the sting site with a small white mark in the location where the wasp attacked. Even though this is painful at the moment, but the swelling and pain go away after sometime.</p>
<h3 id="large-local-reactions">Large local reactions</h3>
<p>If you are allergic to stings, you are likely to face more pronounced symptoms of a wasp sting. Large local reactions are more painful than normal local reactions but they are not life-threatening. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme redness</li>
<li>Swelling that keeps increasing 2-3 days after the sting</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Vomiting
Large local reactions subside on their own within 2-3 weeks but you can opt for treatment for fast recovery.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="severe-allergic-reactions">Severe allergic reactions</h3>
<p>The most severe and alarming reactions to wasp stings are called anaphylaxis. This appears in people with sting allergy and needs immediate medical attention. Anaphylaxis occurs in response to the venom that has entered the body, resulting in a shock. Someone with anaphylaxis will face some or all of the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swelled face, lips, throat</li>
<li>Lightheadedness and dizziness</li>
<li>Diarrhea or stomach cramps</li>
<li>Decreased blood pressure</li>
<li>Itching in parts of the body that are unaffected by the sting</li>
<li>A feeling of nausea or vomiting</li>
<li>Difficulty in breathing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-wasp-stings">How to Treat Wasp Stings?</h2>
<p>How long the symptoms of wasp sting last depends on the way you treat the sting. As soon as you or someone near you gets stung by a wasp, you should get a clean cloth to wipe off the sting area. While most wasps dont normally leave the sting behind, make sure to check out for any sting in the affected area and remove it immediately.</p>
<p>You will soon notice a swelling around the stung area. Get an ice and apply it on the swelling every 20 minutes until it starts to subside. Make sure that you cover the ice in a cloth to avoid any direct contact with the skin. Use an anti-septic disinfectant around the sting area to prevent any infections. You may also consider having a painkiller in case there is severe pain.</p>

While severe reactions will require you to seek the help of a doctor, most of the time stings can be treated at home. Home remedies and treatments can be very effective on was stings. Some products that can immediately manage your discomfort include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creams and sprays containing anesthetics reduce the risk of infection.</li>
<li>Aspirin�or acetaminophen can effectively help deal with pain.</li>
<li>The Antihistamine in oral or cream form helps in subsiding the swelling, redness, and itching.</li>
<li>A cotton ball soaked in apple cider vinegar can curb the pain.
During your efforts to treat the sting, be careful with what you do. A minor carelessness can make the effects of the wasp sting very severe.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a wasp stings make sure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not swat at the wasp because it will continue stinging</li>
<li>Protect your head and face</li>
<li>Watch out for any severe reaction and act accordingly</li>
<li>Call for medical assistance if you notice an allergic reaction</li>
<li>Remain calm and not create chaos because that could make wasps sting you more than once</li>
<li>Not scratch the sting because it would lead to an infection</li>
<li>Not squeeze or burst blisters</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preventing-wasp-stings">Preventing Wasp Stings</h2>
<p>You have to be vigilant and careful to make sure that you dont have any unpleasant encounters with wasps in the future. To avoid stings try to consciously make an effort to stay away from the colonies of wasps and do not go too close in case you spot any. You can also use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-wasp-fogger/">wasp foggers</a>
.</p>
<p>Wasps love sweet smells which is why you should always cover your food and beverage containers when eating outdoors. You should also quickly wipe off any food or drink spills.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to avoid wearing any fruity and floral fragrances because they may end up attracting wasps.</p>
<p>You cant always know where you may run into a wasp. But it is ideal to wear close-toed shoes and muted tones when you visit a garden or meadow.</p>
<p>This will effectively reduce your chance of being stung if you accidentally disrupt or walk over a wasp nest - or even
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fake-wasps-nests-work/">fake wasp nests - do they work?</a>
. If you do get stung by a wasp once, dont make any sudden movement because it will only go on to result in more stings. Cover your nose and mouth with your hand and walk in an enclosed space.</p>
<p>If you have noticed a wasp or two in your house, dont hesitate to call a wasp control professional to inspect your house for any wasp infestation. This will protect you from running into a wasp nest unintentionally. If you see a wasp nest nearby, do not try to get rid of it all by yourself and contact a wasp control contractor instead.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now you know that not only does a wasp sting more than once but also what makes it sting an innocent human being.</p>
<p>We hope that this detailed account on wasps helped you identify the symptoms of a wasp sting, know the treatments that could work, and understand how you can avoid painful encounters with wasps.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably there are thousand ways you can kill you can kill a <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-antennae/">spider</a> in your yard or house.</p>
<p>But definitely, most of us know crushing it with a blunt object - the Hulk smash&quot; technique. But,
<strong>can you drown a spider?�</strong>
<strong>The simple answer is, No, you cannot drown a spider - as stated by Real Science - but they&rsquo;ll die if submerged in sewer. Spiders have a very low oxygen intake due to their low metabolic rate and thus drowning may take 1-3 hours.�</strong>
<strong>But water spider or diving-bell spider can live fully under water. Spider breathe through book lungs or web gills and remain under water for over 24 hours.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-can-you-drown-a-spider-flush-water-death">Details: Can You Drown a Spider? Flush Water Death?</h2>
<p>Just like human beings, spiders also drink water and this is why you might find them around water sources such as shower or bath stalls. Also, can the spider drawn in the ocean if its swept by any random sunbather.
Spiders spending time around the shower or bath stalls may end up being flashed down the drain when you&rsquo;re bathing.�So, if you&rsquo;re wondering if spiders can actually drown when you flash them them down the drain - relax we get into the details. Can they crawl or climb back fighting for its life.

[/caption]
The truth is: According to the
<a href="http://www.americanarachnology.org/">American Arachnological Society</a>
, any spider that&rsquo;s flushed will only drown within 1-3 hours since they have low oxygen intake dude to their low metabolic rate.
Some spider species sick as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_bell_spider">diving bell spider</a>
won&rsquo;t drown easily anyway because �they&rsquo;ll create underwater webs which allow gaseous exchange.�The webs enable the spider to rise above the water surface once daily -� prevents it from being
washed away the drain
.
Therefore, when trying to kill the spiders you should know that
some spiders aren&rsquo;t even venomous
but will prey on household pests such as mosquitoes. For example, some spiders

<h2 id="alternative-ways-to-control-spiders">Alternative Ways to Control Spiders</h2>
<p>Spiders are crawly, creepy arachnids that have 8 legs that tend terrify kids and adults equally. This is particularly so when one finds themselves attached when in an empty apartment.
You might see some black and white spots on the floor - which will mean you&rsquo;ll have to kill the spiders with any way possible. So, below are some of the methods you can use to kill the arachnids.
However, researchers caution against
<a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/779681/Scientists-spiders-eat-tonnes-insects-bugs-creepy-crawlies">squashing spiders - they keep a natural ecosystem</a>
. So, to deal with the arachnids in your boat, house or yard, you&rsquo;ll need to counter the spiders intelligently.</p>
<h3 id="1-use-lady-bugs">1. Use Lady Bugs</h3>
<p>You definitely won&rsquo;t like the ladybugs running around the floor spaces. So, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the ladybugs around the garden walls to keep the spiders and other small insects.
Further, the ladybugs will prey and eat the insects that&rsquo;ll attract the spiders - which means that that spiders will have limited food sources available around the house and thus they&rsquo;ll relocate.
Thus putting the ladybugs around your house won&rsquo;t kill the spiders but will keep them off your house&rsquo;s perimeter. It&rsquo;ll equally work excellently when there many flowers and bushes that are near the windowsills or house foundation.
Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-ears/">Do Spiders Have Ears?</a></p>
<h3 id="2-use-a-spider-spray-natural">2. Use a Spider Spray (Natural)</h3>
<p>Next up is using a natural spray for the spiders. You&rsquo;ll need to make the spray using natural ingredients and then spray it around the home&rsquo;s damp areas or bathroom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply, pour a single cup of the natural apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>Pour 1 cup of pepper</li>
<li>Pour 1 teaspoon of oil</li>
<li>Pour 1 teaspoon of dish soap (the liquid type)</li>
<li>Mix everything in one spray bottle and spray once, and respray after 3-5 days.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to spray the insecticide on the outer side of your house along the doors, windowsills, and windows to prevent the spiders from entering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-peppermint-oil"><strong>3. Peppermint Oil</strong></h3>
<p>Peppermint oil is hated by many pests including spiders and
bed bugs
. Notably, the oil has a very harsh smell - particularly for small arachnids and insects like
<a href="https://www.tipsbulletin.com/how-to-keep-yellow-jackets-away/">yellow jackets</a>
and wasps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a plastic bottle and pour some water (for dilution) with the peppermint oil so that it won&rsquo;t irritate your pets and the human skin.</li>
<li>Next, take the bottle and spray around the house, yard, and perimeter to repel the spiders.</li>
<li>Alternatively, soak some cotton balls in the peppermint oil-water mixture and position them in places you think spiders might be using to get into your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-de-clutter-your-spaces">4. De-clutter your Spaces</h3>
<p>Definitely, spiders - like insects too - like clutter and they&rsquo;ll camp behind dirty furniture and big boxes. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the home free from clutter and ensure its always clean.
Remember to dust and clean up the walls once each week while also putting away the packages and boxes. This will discourage the spiders from creating their web around - but also clean up any other cobwebs you see around.
Further, clean up your house&rsquo;s exteriors and slash up the bushes and vegetation that&rsquo;s on the house perimeter. This will remove any possible hiding places and make the space spider-free.</p>
<h3 id="5-citrus-peels">5. Citrus Peels</h3>
<p>Citrus, comparable mint leaves, contain acetic acid which insects and spiders loathe. Spiders hate citrus just like grapefruits, oranges, and lemons.
I would say that you can purchase citrus oils scents or simply save on some leftover peels after you&rsquo;ve eaten the fruit. These will repel the spiders away from your house and yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the citrus peels and rub them on bookshelves, baseboards, window sills, and doorways.</li>
<li>For the essential citrus oil, simply some water with the oil in the bottle ready for spraying around your house and perimeter.</li>
<li>However, for the citrus peels always replace these one in 1-2 days to ensure that the citrus smell is always active to repel the spiders from your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-spray-cedar-oil">7. Spray Cedar Oil</h3>
<p>Just like Citrus, spiders hate the cedar wood smell and will move so far from near it. So, simply lay down cedar mulch near your house and its perimeter to repel the spiders.
However, always get high quality cedar wood or cedar oil to ensure that the harsh smell won&rsquo;t die down so fast before it fully repels the spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>For cedar essential oil, simply mix the oil with some water and finally spray the mixture on your house&rsquo;s exterior and perimeter.</li>
<li>Also, you may position natural cedar in the house to repel the spiders. Luckily, its a natural solution that won&rsquo;t be toxic or harm pets and humans.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-use-tobacco">8. Use Tobacco</h3>
<p>Tobacco is hated by many insects and arachnids like spiders too. Luckily, tobaccos is readily available in most places and its equally cheap compared to
commercial spider fogger
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply get a tobacco leaf in your local store or shops and spread them on routes where you suspects spider use to get into the house.</li>
<li>Alternatively, crash the leaves and soak them in some water inn a spray bottle. Finally, spray the tobacco-water mixture around the house and perimeter.</li>
<li>Finally, you may create some tobacco balls. For this metods, you&rsquo;ll need to mix water, flour and tobacco leaves to create spider-repellent balls.</li>
<li>Caution - for homes with pets and kids, only using tobacco spray and leaves might be hazardous to these your sensitive animals and loved ones respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-use-borax">9. Use Borax</h3>
<p>Finally, borax is the last alternative repellent your can use against spiders. Definitely,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/borax-for-ants-outside/">borax is popularly used in repelling ants</a>
but it&rsquo;ll also be effective against spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the borax powder and sprinkle it on the routes and areas you suspect will be used by spiders or where they may make their webs.</li>
<li>In addition, you can sprinkle the powder along the doors, or between the storm windows and window.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve tackled the question - &ldquo;can you drown a spider?&rdquo; The response is that its impossible to easily drown spiders since they have low oxygen intake and equally low metabolic rate. This means that some spiders may even survive under water for 1-3 hours.
Equally surprising is that some spiders like water spider or diving-bell spider will use their book lungs or web gills for respiration�when they&rsquo;re under water. Therefore, these spider will�survive for longer (over 24 hours) without coming to the water surface.
I&rsquo;ve outlined alternative methods you can use to repel spiders from your house - as opposed to killing them since these arachnids assist in maintaining a

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has become a global health concern, and healthcare personnel (HCP) are at the forefront of combating the disease. Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucial for preventing the spread of the virus and protecting healthcare workers. This article provides a guide on how healthcare personnel can use PPE effectively when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-ppe-for-healthcare-personnel">Types of PPE for Healthcare Personnel</h2>
<h3 id="1n95-respirators">1.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084V8KZ71?tag=p-policy-20">N95 Respirators</a></h3>
<p>N95 respirators are the most recommended form of PPE for healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19. They provide a higher level of filtration compared to regular surgical masks, filtering out at least 95% of airborne particles. These masks are essential when dealing with patients who are known or suspected to be infected with the coronavirus.</p>
<h3 id="2surgical-masks">2.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085Y2D8TR?tag=p-policy-20">Surgical Masks</a></h3>
<p>Surgical masks are primarily used for patients who are suspected to be infected, as they help limit the spread of respiratory droplets. While they do not offer the same level of protection as N95 respirators, they are still an important part of infection control measures in healthcare settings.</p>
<h3 id="3face-shields">3.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Y6J9TL1?tag=p-policy-20">Face Shields</a></h3>
<p>Face shields provide an extra layer of protection for healthcare workers by preventing respiratory droplets from making contact with the face. They are often used in combination with masks or respirators to offer full-face protection when treating COVID-19 patients.</p>
<h3 id="4gloves">4.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZC3H1S7?tag=p-policy-20">Gloves</a></h3>
<p>Gloves are essential in preventing direct contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or patients. Healthcare personnel should wear gloves when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and when performing tasks that may expose them to bodily fluids.</p>
<h3 id="5gowns">5.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B0ZS4IK?tag=p-policy-20">Gowns</a></h3>
<p>Gowns provide full-body protection by covering the healthcare worker&rsquo;s clothing and skin. This is particularly important when handling patients who may be coughing, sneezing, or otherwise spreading respiratory droplets. Gowns are often used in conjunction with gloves, face shields, and masks to provide a comprehensive PPE solution.</p>
<h3 id="proper-ppe-use-in-healthcare-settings">Proper PPE Use in Healthcare Settings</h3>
<p>Using PPE effectively is crucial in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Here are some guidelines for healthcare workers:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Donning PPE:**Always put on PPE in a designated area before entering the patient&rsquo;s room. Ensure that the N95 respirator or mask is fitted properly, and the gown and gloves are secure.</li>
<li>**While in the Patient&rsquo;s Room:**Avoid touching your face, and ensure that PPE remains intact during patient care. Maintain physical distancing as much as possible while interacting with the patient.</li>
<li>**Doffing PPE:**Carefully remove PPE in a designated area, starting with gloves and working your way to the mask or respirator. Avoid touching the outside of the mask, respirator, or gloves, and dispose of all used PPE in appropriate bins.</li>
<li>**Hand Hygiene:**Perform hand hygiene before and after donning and doffing PPE, as well as after any patient contact. Use soap and water or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Proper use of PPE is a critical component in protecting healthcare workers from COVID-19. By wearing the appropriate protective equipment and following infection control procedures, healthcare personnel can reduce the risk of transmission and ensure their safety while providing care to patients. Always ensure that you are using PPE according to guidelines and changing it as necessary to maintain a safe working environment.</p>

While both serve the purpose of providing color and protection to the surfaces, they have different characteristics and are designed for specific uses. This guide will explain the key differences between ceiling paint and wall paint, helping you choose the right one for your project.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ceiling-paint">What is Ceiling Paint?</h2>
<p>Ceiling paint is specifically formulated for use on ceilings. It has a thicker consistency compared to wall paint and is designed to provide better coverage on horizontal surfaces. Ceiling paint is often available in flat or matte finishes, which helps minimize the appearance of imperfections on the ceiling surface. Additionally, ceiling paint is often more resistant to splattering and easier to apply with minimal mess.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-wall-paint">What is Wall Paint?</h2>
<p>Wall paint is designed for vertical surfaces such as walls. It is typically available in a wide variety of finishes, including flat, matte, eggshell, satin, semi-gloss, and gloss. Wall paint is formulated to provide a smooth, durable finish that can withstand cleaning and regular wear. Depending on the finish, wall paint may offer more resistance to stains and scuffs compared to ceiling paint.</p>
<h2 id="key-differences-between-ceiling-paint-and-wall-paint">Key Differences Between Ceiling Paint and Wall Paint</h2>
<h3 id="1-consistency">1. Consistency</h3>
<p>Ceiling paint has a thicker consistency than wall paint. This thicker formulation helps it adhere better to ceilings and prevents drips or splattering during application. Wall paint, on the other hand, is more fluid and designed to flow smoothly onto vertical surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="2-finish">2. Finish</h3>
<p>Ceiling paint is typically available in a flat or matte finish. This is because flat finishes help to hide imperfections such as cracks, stains, or uneven surfaces that are common on ceilings. Wall paint, however, is available in a wider range of finishes, from flat to high-gloss, depending on the desired appearance and durability.</p>
<h3 id="3-durability">3. Durability</h3>
<p>Wall paint is generally more durable than ceiling paint due to its resistance to stains, scrubbing, and moisture. Walls are exposed to more wear and tear, so wall paints are designed to hold up better over time. Ceiling paint is not meant to endure the same level of contact, so it is not formulated to withstand the same level of wear and tear.</p>
<h3 id="4-application">4. Application</h3>
<p>Ceiling paint is designed to minimize splatter and create a smooth, even surface when applied. Its thicker texture makes it easier to apply without excessive drips. Wall paint, on the other hand, is typically easier to apply over larger vertical surfaces, and it can be used with a variety of application tools such as brushes, rollers, and sprayers.</p>
<h3 id="5-coverage">5. Coverage</h3>
<p>Ceiling paint is usually more opaque and offers better coverage than wall paint. This is especially important when covering old stains, water marks, or uneven surfaces on the ceiling. Wall paint provides solid coverage as well, but it may require more coats depending on the color and texture of the surface being painted.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-use-ceiling-paint-on-walls">Can You Use Ceiling Paint on Walls?</h2>
<p>While it is possible to use ceiling paint on walls, it is not recommended. Ceiling paint is formulated with a flat finish and a thicker consistency that may not provide the desired results on vertical surfaces. Additionally, ceiling paint does not offer the same durability as wall paint, so it may not hold up well to the wear and tear typically experienced on walls.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-use-wall-paint-on-ceilings">Can You Use Wall Paint on Ceilings?</h2>
<p>Using wall paint on the ceiling is also not recommended. Wall paint is designed for vertical surfaces and may drip or splatter excessively when applied to the ceiling. It may also be less effective at hiding imperfections on the ceiling surface compared to ceiling paint.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Choosing the right paint for your ceilings and walls is crucial to achieving the best results in your home painting project. Ceiling paint is thicker, has a matte finish, and is formulated to hide imperfections, while wall paint is available in a wider range of finishes and is more durable. Be sure to use the appropriate paint for each surface to ensure optimal performance and a flawless finish.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the right paint for your home is crucial to achieving the desired finish and ensuring durability. Although both interior and exterior paints serve the purpose of coating surfaces, they are formulated with different ingredients and designed for specific environments. This article explores the key differences between interior and exterior paints and helps you decide which one is best suited for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="1-composition-understanding-the-ingredients">1. Composition: Understanding the Ingredients</h3>
<p>The primary <a href="/posts/difference-between-ceiling-paint-and-wall-paint/">difference</a> <a href="/posts/difference-between-a-bee-and-a-wasps-nest/">between</a> interior and exterior paints lies in their composition. Interior paints are designed for indoor use and are formulated to provide a smooth, durable finish that is easy to clean and maintain. They are also made with fewer chemicals that could be harmful in confined spaces, such as low levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Exterior paints, on the other hand, are crafted to withstand more demanding conditions, including moisture, UV rays, and fluctuating temperatures. As a result, exterior paints contain more robust ingredients, such as resins and additives that help prevent mildew growth and provide better protection against the weather.</p>
<h3 id="2-durability-how-long-will-the-paint-last">2. Durability: How Long Will the Paint Last?</h3>
<p>Durability is one of the key aspects to consider when choosing paint for a project. While interior paint is designed to withstand daily wear and tear from cleaning and touching, it is not built to resist the elements like exterior paint. Exterior paints are specifically designed to endure the outdoors, where exposure to rain, sun, wind, and snow can cause the paint to deteriorate quickly if the proper formulation is not used. For example, exterior paints are often made with more durable resins that can expand and contract with the temperature, preventing cracking or peeling. This makes them perfect for protecting surfaces that are exposed to harsh environmental conditions.
Interior paint, while still durable, is not subjected to the same challenges as exterior paint. It does not need to resist direct sunlight or heavy moisture, but it should provide a smooth finish that resists smudges, scuffs, and stains. Typically, interior paints are formulated to be washable and scrub-resistant, which is especially important in high-traffic areas such as hallways, kitchens, and bathrooms.</p>
<h3 id="3-finish-and-texture-how-do-they-feel">3. Finish and Texture: How Do They Feel?</h3>
<p>The finish and texture of interior and exterior paints differ significantly. Interior paints tend to have a smoother finish to match the smooth, clean walls of a homes interior. These paints are often available in a variety of sheens, such as matte, satin, eggshell, and semi-gloss, allowing homeowners to choose the level of shine and texture that best suits the aesthetic of each room. For instance, matte finishes are perfect for hiding imperfections in walls, while semi-gloss finishes are ideal for high-moisture areas like bathrooms and kitchens due to their easy-to-clean properties.
Exterior paints, however, often have a thicker consistency to help them adhere to outdoor surfaces like wood, masonry, or metal. These paints typically have a more textured finish, which aids in bonding with rougher, uneven surfaces. The sheen for exterior paints ranges from flat to gloss, with flat finishes being the most common for walls exposed to the elements. High-gloss finishes are also available for trim and doors, where more durable protection is needed.</p>
<h3 id="4-voc-content-how-they-affect-indoor-air-quality">4. VOC Content: How They Affect Indoor Air Quality</h3>
<p>VOCs (volatile organic compounds) are chemicals that evaporate into the air during and after the application of paint. They can cause health problems such as headaches, nausea, and dizziness, especially when used in enclosed spaces. As a result, interior paints are formulated with lower levels of VOCs to ensure better air quality inside the home. Low-VOC and no-VOC options are available for those who want to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals.
In contrast, exterior paints are allowed to have higher levels of VOCs since they are used outdoors where ventilation is not as much of a concern. However, many modern exterior paints have been formulated with reduced VOC content to make them more environmentally friendly. If you are concerned about VOCs, look for exterior paints that are labeled as low-VOC or eco-friendly.</p>
<h3 id="5-application-areas-where-are-they-used">5. Application Areas: Where Are They Used?</h3>
<p>Interior paints are specifically designed for walls, ceilings, trim, and other surfaces within the home. These paints are formulated to be less resistant to moisture and weathering but highly resistant to scrubbing and cleaning, which is why they are ideal for kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms. They provide a smooth, even finish and are perfect for enhancing the overall aesthetics of indoor spaces.
Exterior paints, on the other hand, are intended for use on surfaces exposed to the elements. These include the exterior walls of your home, fences, decks, doors, and trim. Since outdoor surfaces are subjected to harsher conditions such as rain, direct sunlight, and fluctuating temperatures, exterior paint is designed to provide a protective coating that resists these challenges. Additionally, exterior paint often contains mildew-resistant properties to prevent growth in damp environments.</p>
<h3 id="6-cost-which-one-is-more-expensive">6. Cost: Which One is More Expensive?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, exterior paint tends to be more expensive than interior paint. This price difference is due to the added durability and weather-resistant properties that exterior paint needs to have. Exterior paints must be able to withstand a wide range of environmental conditions, which means they require higher-quality ingredients and manufacturing processes. Additionally, because exterior paints are thicker and designed for larger surface areas, you may need to buy more paint for an exterior project compared to an interior one.
While exterior paints are typically more expensive, it is important to consider the longevity of the paint. Choosing a higher-quality paint may save you money in the long run by reducing the frequency with which you need to repaint your exterior surfaces. Interior paint, on the other hand, is often more affordable and can be touched up with ease as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="7-conclusion-which-one-should-you-choose">7. Conclusion: Which One Should You Choose?</h3>
<p>The choice between interior and exterior paint comes down to the specific needs of your project. For interior spaces, choose an interior paint that provides a smooth, easy-to-clean finish and offers a variety of sheens to match the aesthetic of the room. If you&rsquo;re painting outdoor surfaces, exterior paint is the best option to ensure that your home is protected from the elements. Exterior paint is durable, resistant to UV rays, and able to withstand rain, snow, and fluctuating temperatures.
Choosing the right paint ensures that your surfaces will look good and last longer. Whether you&rsquo;re refreshing a living room or protecting your home&rsquo;s exterior, selecting the right paint for the job will give your space the look and longevity it deserves. When in doubt, consult with a professional to guide you in making the best choice for your project.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anole lizards, often referred to as &ldquo;Anoles,&rdquo; are common in many households and outdoor environments. Known for their vibrant colors and territorial behaviors, these small reptiles are often a source of curiosity. One common question people ask is whether anole lizards bite. In this article, we&rsquo;ll explore the possibility of anole lizards biting and when it might happen.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-anole-lizards">Understanding Anole Lizards</h2>
<p>Anole lizards are part of the
<em>Polychrotidae</em>
family and are commonly found in the southeastern United States, the Caribbean, and Central America. They come in different colors, with the green anole being the most well-known. These lizards are typically small, with some species reaching lengths of around 5 to 8 inches.
While anole lizards are generally non-aggressive, their behavior can vary depending on the situation. They are more likely to exhibit territorial behavior, especially during the mating season, or when they feel threatened. Anole lizards use their vibrant colors to communicate, and males often puff up their dewlaps (throat flaps) to assert dominance.</p>
<h3 id="1-do-anole-lizards-bite-humans">1. Do Anole Lizards Bite Humans?</h3>
<p>Although anole lizards are not known for being aggressive towards humans, they can bite in certain situations. Typically, these bites are not harmful and are more of a defensive response. If an anole feels threatened or cornered, it may bite in an attempt to escape. The bite is not strong and rarely breaks the skin, but it can be startling for the person handling the lizard.</p>
<h3 id="2-when-do-anole-lizards-bite">2. When Do Anole Lizards Bite?</h3>
<p>Anole lizards may bite in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>**When they feel threatened:**If an anole feels it is in danger or being handled too roughly, it may bite as a defensive mechanism.</li>
<li>**During territorial disputes:**Male anoles, especially during mating season, may bite other males in an attempt to defend their territory.</li>
<li>**When they are startled:**If an anole is caught off guard or feels trapped, it may bite out of instinct to protect itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-do-anole-lizard-bites-hurt">3. Do Anole Lizard Bites Hurt?</h3>
<p>Anole bites are typically not painful. The bite is more of a nip and is unlikely to cause any significant harm. The lizard&rsquo;s teeth are small and pointed, so while it may feel like a mild pinch, the bite is rarely severe enough to draw blood or cause lasting damage. However, some individuals may experience mild irritation or discomfort after a bite, especially if the bite occurs in a sensitive area.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-to-avoid-getting-bitten-by-an-anole">4. How to Avoid Getting Bitten by an Anole</h3>
<p>To prevent getting bitten by an anole lizard, it is important to handle them gently and with respect. Here are some tips to avoid bites:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Approach calmly:**Avoid sudden movements or loud noises that may startle the anole.</li>
<li>**Avoid cornering them:**Anoles may bite if they feel trapped or unable to escape. Always allow the lizard to move freely.</li>
<li>**Use proper handling techniques:**If you must handle the anole, gently support its body and avoid holding it too tightly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-what-to-do-if-you-are-bitten">5. What to Do If You Are Bitten?</h3>
<p>If an anole does bite, it is generally not a cause for concern. Clean the bite area with soap and water to avoid infection. If the bite causes any discomfort, you can apply an antiseptic cream. In rare cases, if the bite leads to an allergic reaction or significant swelling, seek medical attention.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Anole lizards do have the ability to bite, but it is rare and typically happens in self-defense. If you avoid handling them too roughly and respect their space, bites are unlikely to occur. If bitten, the bite is usually harmless and can be treated easily. These fascinating reptiles are mostly non-aggressive, and with proper care, they can make great pets without posing a risk to humans.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While <a href="/posts/compare-carpenter-bee-vs-bumblebee/">carpenter</a> bees do not bite humans, they can cause damage to wooden structures. The bees burrow into wood to create their nests, which can lead to structural damage if left unchecked. Over time, repeated nesting activity can weaken wood, especially in areas like decks, eaves, and siding.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-prevent-carpenter-bee-infestations">How to Prevent Carpenter <a href="/posts/hornet-bees-and-wasp-removal-tacoma/">Bee</a> Infestations</h3>
<p>To prevent carpenter bees from nesting in your home or garden, consider the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Seal Wooden Surfaces:**Ensure that wood around your home is sealed properly. Carpenter bees are attracted to untreated wood, so applying a coat of paint or varnish can deter them from drilling.</li>
<li>**Use Bee Traps:**Specialized carpenter bee traps can help reduce the number of bees around your property.</li>
<li>**Regular Inspections:**Regularly inspect your wooden structures for signs of carpenter bee activity. Look for round holes and sawdust-like material near wood surfaces.</li>
<li>**Natural Repellents:**Some natural repellents, like citrus or essential oils, can be used to discourage carpenter bees from nesting in certain areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees are typically harmless to humans and do not bite. While their nesting behavior can cause damage to wood, they are not aggressive and will only sting if provoked. Taking preventive measures, such as sealing wood and using repellents, can help avoid infestations and minimize the risk of damage.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Cats <a href="/posts/do-flying-termites-eat-wood/">Eat</a> Lizards? Have you ever met lizards and cats together in your home, yard or compound? Can your lizard and cat pet live together? It is interesting to find how cats go along with lizards in your place? So, do cats eat lizards?
<em>The direct answer is YES! Cats will eat lizards. Cats are great lizard predators. They will hunt, kill and eat lizard either by cutting it into pieces or swallow it whole (for the small sized cats).�</em>
<em>Cats prefer eating smaller lizards such as geckos, skins and Savannah�lizards. However, depending on the species, cats may not be safe after eating lizards. Some species such as salamanders and juvenile blue-tailed skinks secrets poison in their skin, which may kill your cat if eaten.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
<em>Though house lizards (gecko) may not have venom or poison, they carry parasites (liver flukes), pathogens and bacteria (salmonella) which affect adversely on the health of your cat when eaten.</em>

<h2 id="details-do-cats-eat-lizards">Details: Do Cats Eat Lizards?</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-do-cat-eat-lizards">1. How Do Cat Eat Lizards</h3>
<p>Cats normally hunt and kill the lizards before eating them. The cat will cut (using its teeth-canines) lizard into parts for easier swallowing. Also, the cat can tear the soft flesh from the body meat of the lizard. Main parts of lizards that are usually fed on by the cats include the body meat, limbs and the tail. When feeding on the lizards, cats do not remove lizards skin (which is infectious in some lizard species).
Most cats do not eat the Head of lizard unless when they swallow lizard whole (which is a rare case). Small cats dont eat the lizards bones. You will, probably, find bones leftovers where the cat was feeding.
Cats dont hunt lizards as a group unless when training their kitten. You are not likely to spot cats feeding since they hide mostly.�After killing the lizard, cat begins by eating the tail since its soft, fatty and its caudal bones can be chewed together with meat easily.</p>
<h3 id="2-which-lizards-do-cats-eat-most">2. Which Lizards Do Cats Eat Most?</h3>
<p>Your pet cat may not be selective when hunting lizards for food. However, most cats have been found to hunt more some of the following lizard species:</p>
<ol>
<li>**House lizards (Gecko).**These lizards are readily available at many homes and are safer when eaten by cats (not toxic/poisonous, contains no venom).</li>
<li>Moreover, geckos do not run faster when escaping in case of danger and their defense mechanism against cats is weak (mild bite and hiding) as compare to other lizards such as Tree crocodile monitor, which attack its predators.</li>
<li>**The savannah Lizards.**These lizards are small in size and are found in subtropical climate. Your pet cat will mainly go hunting them in the fields. Savannah lizards are quick to catch since they do not run fast.</li>
<li><strong>Nile water monitors</strong>. These love water bodies in rivers and pods around your home or region. Cats hunt them even though they get wild during capture. These lizards are safe and non-venomous.

</ol>
<h3 id="3-which-lizards-are-poisonous-to-cats">3. Which Lizards Are Poisonous To Cats?</h3>
<p>The following lizards are poisonous to your pet cat when eaten.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Mexican Bearded</strong>These lizards are found in Southern United states and are highly venomous. The roots or Mexican Bearded lizards have venom glands that releases poison every time it bites your cat. The poison lowers the blood pressure of the cat and prevent blood clotting. Moreover, the cat face walking challenges, breathing, have frequent pooping and urination and generates inability to meow after eating Mexican bearded lizards.</li>
<li>**Gila Monitor lizard.**This lizard is known attack and bite cats in defense. Its poison is severe than that of Mexican Bearded lizard and its poisonous teeth paralyzes the cat on injection. Their skin also house bacteria that causes severe infection on your cat.</li>
<li>**Komodo dragon.**This lizard is able to attack and kill cats on approach immediately. It has poisonous glands that release killing venom on biting. Cats bitten by die in minutes. Most cats fear hunting the Komodo dragon. In fact, Komodo dragon is known to kill human beings.</li>
<li>**Juvenile blue-tailed skinks.**The skinks secrets poison in their skin, which kills the cat when eaten. Cats are highly attracted to blue tailed skinks and often prey on them. The skinks dont run fast in case of attack (they are easily caught by cats).</li>
<li>They have poisonous skin (skin produces poison) which kill cats when eaten. Salamanders have smooth soft skins and are usually swallowed whole by cats. Salamander dont escape faster and thus are easily caught by cats (predators).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-it-safe-for-cats-to-eat-lizards-what-are-the-dangers">Is it safe for cats to eat lizards? What are the Dangers?</h2>
<p>Most lizards are not toxic to cats when eaten (they are therefore safe). The body meat of lizard do not contain any poison that may affect the health of your cat. However, some lizards such as Komodo dragon and Gila Monitors have poisonous gland at their tooths root, which inject venom to its prey (cat) on attack thus paralyzing or killing it.
Though the lizards meat may not be poisonous, it may post the following dangers when eaten:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Get Liver Flukes. **Lizards such as skinks, savannah and geckos have liver flukes in their elementary tracks. These flukes do not affect these lizards. However, when your pet cat eats lizards, the liver flukes are transferred into the cats digestive canal from where they move up the liver to the gall bladder.</li>
<li>The liver flukes cause liver inflammations and block the bile duct of your cat leading to death.<em>Some symptoms of liver flukes</em>in your pet cat include yellow eyes and skin, vomiting, diarrhea, Lethargy, loss of appetite and swelling of abdomen.</li>
<li>**Acquire Salmonella Bacteria. **The skin of house lizard (gecko), skinks and bearded lizard house bacteria such as Salmonella. The salmonella bacteria may not cause sickness on a healthy cat. However, when the cat fall sick, the bacteria will accelerate the illness.</li>
<li>**Skin Infections.**The under skin of skins, Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, house lizards etc. have pathogens which cause severe skin infections on your pet cats.

<h2 id="how-do-lizards-protect-themselves-from-cats">How Do Lizards Protect Themselves From Cats?</h2>
<p>Lizards have various mechanisms of protecting them from their predator. These ways include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Running Away.**Most small sized lizards such as Gecko, skinks and savannah lizards run away in case of the attacks. However, they may not run very fast, but their swift enables them to reach their hideouts safely.</li>
<li>Inflate their Bodies. Lizards such as Thorny devil and Horned toad lizard inflates their bodies to appear big so as to scare away their predators. Bearded dragon is able to puff their throat out making them bigger thus scaring their predators.</li>
<li>**Autotomy.**This an act where the lizard is able to carry out self-amputation of tail. Lizards such as leopard geckos and house lizards are able to cut off its tail in case of danger. The cut tail is used as a bait or a mechanism that stops the predators (scare/confuse) from following them further.</li>
<li>** Fighting. **Monitor lizards such as Tree Crocodile monitor and Gila monitors are famous of fighting against their assailants. The Komodo dragon and Green Iguana use their tail to knock down their enemies.</li>
<li>**Using venom/biting.**Venomous lizards such as Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, Mexican Bearded lizards and the Tree Crocodile have venom in their teeth roots, which paralyses their prey on biting.</li>
<li>**Camouflaging.**Lizards such as chameleons are able to change color to match their hideouts. Small lizards are brown, grey or black colored, which camouflage well with their environment such as back or trees, rocks or sand. Some lizards such as bearded lizards and Gila monitors camouflage to send a warning signal to their predators.</li>
<li>**Hissing.**Frilled dragon opens its frills and produces a hissing sound, which frightens the predator and also makes it look more dangerous.</li>
<li>Squirting blood from their eyes. Pygmy short horned lizards squirts their blood from their eyes when they spot a predator. This make their eyes to enlarge thus scaring away their predators.</li>
</ol>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/dust-mites/">Dust</a> Mites are
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/">tiny insects</a>
that have eight legs and a small head and they feed off flakes of dead skin shed by humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>NB: an adult human will shed about 500 million flakes of their dead skin daily.
Dust mites measure about 1/100 inch in length and so it&rsquo;s only visible through a microscope.
The symptoms of dust mites for humans include itching and sneezing - but these can be related to chiggers, ticks, and spiders.
<strong>But do dust mites bite humans? No, the mouthparts of dust mites are quite rudimentary and so they can&rsquo;t sting or bite humans.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>On the contrary, dust mites will eat their own cast of skins and poop or fungi, pollen, pet skin, and flakes of dead human skin.</strong>
We&rsquo;ve seen that dust mites will not bite or sting humans (
[this is unlike other <a href="/posts/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/">mite</a> species](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fungicide-powdery-mildew/">https://pestpolicy.com/best-fungicide-powdery-mildew/</a>)
). But do we, like most homeowners, worry so much about these bugs?
Lets find out!

<h2 id="details-do-dust-mites-bite">Details: Do Dust Mites Bite?</h2>
<p>In summary, we&rsquo;ve seen that dust mites will not bite humans but we still have reason to be concerned about these bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most concerning issue with having dust mites in the house is their allergens since they trigger allergic reactions in humans.</li>
<li>There are about 20 + dust mite-related allergens that arise from the pests&rsquo; bodily secretions including poop and cast skins.
So despite that, the dust mites want to bite humans or inject venomous chemicals into their bodies, they can trigger grave medical issues.
Dust mites will hide in locations where dust tends to settle; these places include curtains, blinds, furniture, bedding, and soft fabrics.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://asthmaandallergies.org/">Allergy and Asthma Foundation</a>reports that Americans totaling roughly 20 million are insensitive to allergens resulting from dust mites.
It&rsquo;s almost impossible to completely remove all the dust mites from your spaces but you can control their numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges-health-risks-posed-by-dust-mites">Challenges/ Health Risks Posed by Dust Mites</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nfOXIWWzR8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nfOXIWWzR8</a>
Health experts have documented dust mites as a key indoor trigger for humans that have asthma and allergies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So a continued and chronic dust mites&rsquo; explosion can lead to adverse health effects for humans with allergies and those that are sensitive or allergic to mites.
Exposure to dust mite allergies may result in mild asthma with symptoms being sneezing, watery eyes, or runny nose.
Severe cases of asthma can result from extensive and chronic explosion dust mites that could lead to facial pressure, congestion, coughing, and sneezing.</li>
<li>So humans who are asthmatic and also sensitive to dust mites will have a higher risk of severe asthma attacks and flare-ups.
The Minuscule and tiny fecal pellets from dust mites will irritate the human throat and nose membranes if inhaled and cause sneezing.</li>
<li>The dust mite allergens may also trigger hives on the skin, allergic reactions, and asthma attacks.
The signs of having dust mites in the house will include running nose, headaches, and sneezing.

<h2 id="effective-protection-from-dust-mites-techniques">Effective protection from dust mites: Techniques</h2>
<p>Homeowners can effectively protect themselves from dust mites through techniques that will help eliminate or reduce the pests. Let&rsquo;s check them out</p>
<h3 id="1-reducing-the-humidity">1. Reducing the Humidity</h3>
<p>Recent scientific research shows that reducing the relative humidity of space will control dust mites plus the allergens they reproduce.
Experts advise that you should maintain relative humidity (RH) of under 50% in your home to reduce the dust mites and the allergens they produce.</p>
<ul>
<li>The research was done by altering indoor RH in the humid temperate climate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-remove-hiding-areas-for-dust-mites">2. Remove Hiding Areas For Dust Mites</h3>
<p>I also advise that you clear those areas where the dust mites could live.
Some of the areas include pillows that have allergen
encasements
, mattress covers, curtains and drapes, and furniture that has smooth surfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing most of these objects from your spaces will help reduce the hiding or breeding grounds for the dust mites.
It is also advisable that you wash the bedding once weekly with hot water that is 130 + degrees Fahrenheit.
Also check places that the dust mites can live in, including stuffed animals and various clutter.
Otherwise, you may opt to wash search objects using hot water that is 130 + degrees per Fahrenheit as these will kill dust mites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-remove-and-replace-the-carpets">3. Remove And Replace The Carpets</h3>
<p>Dust mites will find an excellent hiding and living place in your carpeting.
So to control these bugs, I advise that you remove the carpeting from your house, particularly if the family members have allergens that are related to dust mite allergens.</p>
<ul>
<li>But you can still vacuum the carpets thoroughly with aquality vacuum cleaner.
Avoid wet mopping but just focus on removing dust and dirt on the floors through damp cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-dust-the-floors-regularly">4. Dust The Floors Regularly</h3>
<p>Combining regular cleaning and dusting off the floors will help minimize dust quantities that accumulate in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will help improve the air quality in the house and that&rsquo;s better health for you and your pets.
Avoid stirring the dust while cleaning by using some wet microfiber cloth for the washcloth.</li>
<li>In comparison homes in lower-income areas and those that are old and located in humid climates tend to have more dust mites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dust mites will not bite humans and they are also not visible to the human eye.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, these pests will cause health effects such as allergic reactions, hives, and asthma.
Finally, it&rsquo;s impossible to completely remove the pests from your house but you can minimize them.</li>
</ul>

      <description>Summer times is the perfect time to relax at your balcony or backyard.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer times is the perfect time to relax at your balcony or backyard.</p>
<p>Right? Well, it may not be that peaceful if you have wasps infestation in your home - its time to
<a href="https://extension.unh.edu/resources/files/Resource000532_Rep554.pdf">control these wasps</a>
.</p>
<p>Could be you have come across Fake Wasps Nests  a perfect designed, non-toxic wasps trap that lure the wasps into death chamber.� So, my question is, do fake wasps nests work?
**Yes! Fake Wasps Nests are designed in a shape that resembles the own wasps made nest. The wasps are tricked to think that there are already existing wasps in the territory. **
<strong>The human-made decoy fools the wasps to fly into the chamber where they get trapped and killed through suffocation.</strong>
Lets get into details.</p>
<h2 id="do-fake-wasps-nests-actually-work">Do Fake Wasps Nests Actually Work?</h2>
<p>YES! Fake Wasps Nest work by fooling wasps into their chambers. They are tricked to think that there are some existing wasps in the Fake Wasps Nests.</p>
<p>Then, the wasps will fly into the chamber where they get stuck and killed by suffocation  you can even remove wasps while alive (this depends on what the fake wasps nest was made for).</p>
<p>The walls of internal chamber of Fake Wasps Nests is reinforce with sticky substance (e.g. glue) that help trap the flying wasps on contact.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Fake Wasps Nest has a doom shaped interior that offers an ample space to accommodate large number of wasps awaiting death. In addition, the Fake Wasps Nests has a narrow entrance at the bottom, which makes it difficult for the wasps to fly out.</p>
<p>The idea of trapping and killing wasps using Fake Wasps Nests is brilliant though highly affected by wasps behavior of life  they prefer living in their own made wasps nest.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-fake-wasp-nest">What is a Fake <a href="/posts/baby-wasp/">Wasp</a> Nest?</h2>
<p>Fake wasps nest is a product/repellent designed to fool the wasps into them. It resemble the actual wasps nest though the material used in making it may differ slightly.</p>
<p>This product operate by trapping the wasps within its chambers. The human made decoy intends to trick wasps to believe that some wasps live in the territory.</p>
<p>The fooled wasps, then, flew in where they get stuck. The Fake Wasps nest may kill wasps by suffocation or allow them to die naturally  this is determined by the purpose for which the fake wasps nest was made.</p>
<p>Fake wasps nests are small in size. They are highly portable and can be hung at different points within your house or compound.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-fake-wasps-nest-in-your-placehome">What is the purpose of Fake wasps nest in your place/home?</h2>
<p>Wasps lives in colonies within your home or compound. They can harm your humans or animals if disturbed at any point. In fact, wasps are no go zone. Unlike bees, they sting repetitively without losing their lives.</p>
<p>Fake wasps nest are supposed to eliminate these insects in a peaceful way. To realize this, the wasps are expected to fly into the Fake Wasps Nest where they get trapped and killed.</p>
<p>This method is a simple way of ensuring that you do not cause commotion in wasps hideouts during eradication.�It is risky to allow wasps infestation in your home/compound/place  they multiply relatively fast posting threats to the occupants.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-fake-wasps-nest-ineffective">What makes Fake Wasps Nest Ineffective?</h2>
<p>The Fake Wasps Nest may not be as effective as you might expect. This is attributed mainly by the behavior of different species of wasps. Research shows that, most wasps do not like living in artificial Fake Wasps Nests. Instead, they prefer to build their own wasps nests.</p>
<p>Though some research showed that wasps could get into the Fake Wasps Nest and live, the number was quite small. You may also find some wasps building their own wasps nest inside the Fake wasps nest  this is a clear indicator that the fake wasps nests are not effective enough.</p>
<p>In some cases, Wasps would build their nest just adjacent to Fake Wasps Nest. Actually. there is a strong bond that lay between the wasps and their own made nests  thats why they often return to them even after you chase them away.</p>
<h2 id="could-the-purchased-fake-wasp-nests-be-more-effective">Could the Purchased Fake Wasp Nests be More Effective?</h2>
<p>The most important thing to consider in a Fake Wasps Nest is the principle of operation. The fact that the artificial idea of fooling wasps into their death cage is ineffective, tells you that any fake wasps nest will yield similar results.</p>
<p>Your purchased Fake Wasps Nests may be more appealing than the homemade option. However, the killing/trapping idea is already incorrect or inefficient.</p>
<p>Importantly, the wasps are not attracted by the color or quality of your fake wasps nest  they have the inborne attraction to their own made nests.</p>
<p>You must opt for suitable alternatives if you endeavor to experience great impact in wasps eradication.</p>
<h2 id="what-make-people-feel-that-fake-wasps-nest-would-work">What make people feel that Fake Wasps Nest would Work?</h2>
<p>Definitely! People think that since most species of wasps live in territorials, then, it is easier for them to soothe wasps into a decoy Fake Wasps Nests. In the ideal situations, its not the case. Most wasps have ways of making decisions and implementing them.</p>
<p>In case a swam of wasps want to migrate, they do a thorough investigations on any Fake Wasps Nest or place before relocating.</p>
<p>Wasps, rarely shift to other places  they may even take a year or more before moving to a new nest.</p>
<p>Sometimes, wasps nest may not necessarily be on the roof or somewhere hanging  many wasp species tend to build their nests on or within the grounds where you may not see them. Hanging Fake Wasps Nests wont work for these species of wasps.</p>
<p>In most scenarios, people think that presence of flying wasps within their compound calls for wasps infestation in the area. This may not be the case. These wasps may be on patrol searching for food source or new place to inhabit. Setting Fake Wasps Nests basing on such occurrence will be a waste of time and resource.</p>
<p>You must continuously monitor the wasps occurrences in case you notice some in your vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="can-wasps-re-use-their-own-made-nest">Can Wasps Re-Use Their Own Made Nest?</h2>
<p>No! In the real life, wasps wont opt to go for their old abandoned nest. Naturally, during winter, most of male wasps die due to advance weather conditions.</p>
<p>The queen is, then, forced to leave and search for a new place to hibernate until summer.�During the following year, the wasps would build other nests in their new location, abandoning their previous nests completely.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the queen may return to the old place but wont live in the old nest. Instead, the queen wasps would make a new nest near to the old one and begin to breed. This behavior tell you that the Fake Wasps Nests may not be an option for the wasps on return thus rendering them ineffective.</p>
<p>Research shows that there are very few cases where wasps re-use their own made nests. Though this may occur, it is not something you can rely on when setting up you Fake Wasps Nest.</p>
<p>It is advisable that you remove all abandoned wasps nest in your house - they may act as attractants of future wasps re-infestations in your home. These abandoned nests may also house some eggs or young wasps, which may be left to develop and mature during the winter period.</p>
<h2 id="which-wasps-control-methods-do-work">Which Wasps Control Methods Do Work?</h2>
<p>Though wasps control may not be achieve efficiently through use of Fake Wasps Nests, its necessary to try it in different places/points. However, if you realize that it doesnt yield much, you can opt for some of the alternative given below:</p>
<h3 id="1-use-alternative-wasps-traps">1. Use alternative wasps traps</h3>
<p>You can purchase or create your own homemade traps using used items like bottles. In this option, you will need to place a wasps attractants inside the bottle and place it near wasps infestation site.</p>
<p>Close the bottle once the wasps get in. Though tedious, this method works nicely.</p>
<p>You can also make swat trap, which you will swap and kill any flying wasps you spot in your place. This trap may not kill those wasps that do not come from their hideouts.</p>
<h3 id="2-using-wasp-spray">2. Using Wasp Spray</h3>
<p>You can spray the wasps nests directly using the insecticide to kill eggs and adult wasps. Ensure you frequently do this to keep off future infestations. It is necessary to select the best spray for wasps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7GqQmTT1MU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7GqQmTT1MU</a></p>
<h3 id="3-using-wasps-repellent-dust">3. Using wasps Repellent Dust</h3>
<p>Wasps repellent dusts are product made to release a smell that keeps off wasps. You can purchase these products and place them at different points in your compound or home.</p>
<p>This a long-term option that can treat your place for more than 6 months. However, this option is dangerous for your pets and children.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-of-smoke">4. Use of smoke</h3>
<p>Create a wood smoke and pass it over wet clothes. Then, concentrate the moist smoke at the wasps nest.</p>
<p>This will kill both eggs and adult wasps. Some of the wasps will escape even before you reach them once they sense fire in the vicinity.</p>
<h3 id="5-use-of-dish-soap-and-water-mixture">5. Use of dish soap and water mixture</h3>
<p>This is a local way of eliminating wasps. Mix dish soap with water and smear/spray over the wasps nests. Then, leave the product to do the killing. You need to do this severally for complete killing.</p>
<h3 id="6-clean-the-compoundhome">6. Clean the compound/Home</h3>
<p>Ensure you clean your compound by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure that you remove all the garbage.</li>
<li>Remove broken woodpiles.</li>
<li>Clean rotten fruits.</li>
<li>Removing abandoned wasps nests.</li>
<li>Sealing the opening in your structure.
This will minimize the infestation of wasps in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-engage-a-wasps-professional">7. Engage a wasps Professional</h3>
<p>It is important to engage a Wasps Professional to help eliminate wasps infestations.</p>
<p>These people have gears that aid in locating and quick removal of wasps without harming the occupants. They can also help initiate ways that will minimize future wasps infestation in your place.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-with-wasps-nests-in-your-home">What to Do with Wasps Nests in your Home</h2>
<p>Never test the wrath of wasps by disturbing their nests. Definitely, you wont like their reactions. Wasps defends their territories dangerously.</p>
<p>Once you locate a wasps nest in your compound/home, do not be quick to actions. Take your time. Do proper assessment to determine the possible population of wasps in the nest. Then, put on the proper gears that will prevent you from being stung.</p>
<p>Engaging a wasps control professionals to help remove wasps infestations in the best options. This will minimize some of them from escaping. They have special equipment designed purposely for this mission.</p>
<p>It is important to note that safety is a key factor during wasps removal - wasps can sting severally at a single point causing severe pain and swelling. Wasps stings can also cause allergy to your humans and animals.</p>
<p>If you have to knock out the wasps nest, ensure you run for safety immediately  this is the most primitive way of wasps removal. Be keen to check whether there are some wasps left in the fallen nest while others flew away. Some wasps may hide within the house and build new nests instead of leaving the entire place.</p>
<h2 id="the-donts-during-wasps-removal">The Donts during wasps removal</h2>
<p>The following are some of things you dont engage in during wasps removal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never destroy wasps ground nests with boiling water.</li>
<li>Dont knock down large wasps without wasps protection gear.</li>
<li>Never extract wasps using a vacuum.</li>
<li>Never pour flammable substance on the ground wasps nests.</li>
<li>Never fool wasps by playing dead.</li>
<li>Dont hide from wasps in water bodies  they will swim and wait for you to emerge.</li>
<li>Avoid bright and scented clothes while removing wasps.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fake Wasps Nests actually work by fooling wasps into their chambers. Once insides, wasps are trapped, suffocated and killed. The effectiveness of Fake Wasps Nests is quite low since most wasps prefer to build their own wasps nests.</p>
<p>Therefore, Fake Wasps Nests may not be the best option for wasps eradication. You can try the wasps control alternatives that are highlighted in this article to achieve successful wasps elimination in your place.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas are notorious for causing discomfort and irritation to both pets and humans. One common question people have about fleas is whether they have antennae. The short answer is yesfleas do have antennae, and they play a crucial role in helping them navigate their environment. In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore the role of antennae in fleas and how they contribute to the <a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">flea</a>&rsquo;s survival.</p>
<h2 id="flea-anatomy-the-role-of-antennae">Flea Anatomy: The Role of <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-antennae/">Antennae</a></h2>
<p>Fleas are small, wingless insects that rely on a variety of sensory organs to detect their surroundings. One of the most important sensory organs for a flea is its antennae. These antennae are primarily used for detecting vibrations, chemical signals, and air currents. Let&rsquo;s dive deeper into how these antennae work and their role in a flea&rsquo;s life cycle.</p>
<h3 id="1-flea-antennae-structure">1. Flea Antennae Structure</h3>
<p>Fleas have two antennae located on the front part of their heads. These antennae are quite short and have several segments, which are covered in sensory hairs. These sensory hairs help the flea detect changes in its environment, such as the presence of a potential host. The antennae are not used for flying (since fleas are wingless), but rather for sensing their surroundings and helping the flea find food, shelter, and mates.</p>
<h3 id="2-how-fleas-use-their-antennae">2. How Fleas Use Their Antennae</h3>
<p>Fleas use their antennae to sense the world around them. They can detect the slightest vibrations, which helps them detect when a host animal is nearby. They can also pick up chemical signals released by potential hosts, guiding them toward a food source. Additionally, fleas can sense changes in air currents, which can alert them to danger or new opportunities in their environment.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-role-of-antennae-in-flea-behavior">3. The Role of Antennae in Flea Behavior</h3>
<p>Fleas rely heavily on their antennae during the process of finding a host. For instance, when they sense vibrations, they can tell if an animal is walking nearby. The antennae help them detect the heat and carbon dioxide released by animals, which is essential in locating a host to feed on. This ability to detect the presence of a host makes fleas effective parasites, as they can quickly find their next meal.</p>
<h3 id="4-flea-antennae-and-communication">4. Flea Antennae and Communication</h3>
<p>While fleas don&rsquo;t communicate in the same way that social insects like ants or bees do, their antennae can help them detect chemical signals that may be related to mating. Male fleas, for example, can use their antennae to detect the presence of a female flea in the area. This sense of chemical detection helps fleas find mates and reproduce effectively.</p>
<h3 id="5-antennae-and-flea-control">5. Antennae and Flea Control</h3>
<p>Understanding the role of antennae in flea behavior can help in the development of better flea control methods. Since fleas rely on their antennae for detecting hosts and environmental cues, disrupting this sensory mechanism can be an effective strategy for flea control. Some flea treatments and repellents may target the sensory hairs or chemicals that fleas use to detect their surroundings, making it harder for them to locate a host and breed.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fleas do indeed have antennae, and these antennae play a critical role in their survival. They help fleas detect vibrations, chemical signals, and air currents, which are essential for finding a host and reproducing. By understanding the role of flea antennae, we can develop more effective strategies for managing flea infestations and protecting our pets and homes from these pesky parasites.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas are tiny parasitic insects that feed on the blood of mammals and birds. While they are not capable of causing harm on their own, <a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">flea</a> infestations can cause serious issues for both pets and humans. One of the most common questions people have about fleas is whether or not they actually suck blood. Lets explore this question in detail.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-fleas-do">What Do Fleas Do?</h2>
<p>Fleas are external parasites that rely on the blood of a host to survive. Fleas are equipped with specialized mouthparts designed for piercing the skin and feeding on blood. When a flea lands on a host, it uses its sharp, needle-like mouthparts to pierce the skin and access the blood vessels beneath. Once they begin feeding, fleas can consume a significant amount of blood relative to their size.</p>
<h2 id="do-fleas-suck-blood">Do Fleas Suck Blood?</h2>
<p>Yes, fleas do suck blood. They have specialized mouthparts called
<em>stylets</em>
that allow them to pierce the skin of their host and feed on blood. Fleas typically feed multiple times a day, and a single flea can consume several times its body weight in blood. Their bites are itchy and can cause irritation and inflammation in the skin. The saliva of fleas can also cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-feed">How Do Fleas Feed?</h2>
<p>When a flea bites a host, it injects saliva containing anticoagulants into the skin to prevent the blood from clotting. This allows the flea to feed uninterrupted. Fleas have a specialized feeding tube that enables them to suck up the blood from the hosts skin. Unlike mosquitoes, which feed by sucking blood through a needle-like proboscis, fleas actually pierce the skin with their mouthparts to feed.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-fleas-suck-blood">What Happens When Fleas Suck Blood?</h2>
<p>As fleas feed on blood, they can cause discomfort and lead to various health issues. Some of the most common problems associated with flea bites include:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Itching:**Flea bites often cause itching and inflammation, which can lead to scratching and further skin irritation.</li>
<li>**Allergic reactions:**Flea saliva can trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, leading to hives, swelling, and other symptoms.</li>
<li>**Flea-borne diseases:**Fleas can transmit diseases such as the plague and flea-borne typhus. Fleas are also known to transmit tapeworms to pets and humans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-fleas-only-suck-blood-from-pets">Do Fleas Only Suck Blood from Pets?</h2>
<p>While fleas are often associated with pets like dogs and cats, they can also feed on humans and other animals. Fleas are opportunistic feeders, meaning that they will jump onto any available host to feed. Pets with flea infestations may experience more frequent flea bites, but humans and other mammals are also at risk if fleas are present in the environment.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-flea-infestations">How to Prevent Flea Infestations</h2>
<p>To prevent flea infestations, it is important to regularly check your pets for fleas, use flea preventatives, and keep your living environment clean. If you notice fleas on your pets or in your home, it is essential to act quickly to address the issue and prevent it from spreading.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas do suck blood. These parasites are equipped with specialized mouthparts that allow them to pierce the skin and feed on blood. While flea bites can cause discomfort, they can also lead to more serious health issues, including allergic reactions and the transmission of diseases. It is important to take steps to prevent flea infestations and to seek treatment if you suspect you have a flea problem.</p>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/do-flying-termites-eat-wood/</guid>
      <description>If you have seen flying termites around your home, you probably have a lot of questions in mind.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have seen flying termites around your home, you probably have a lot of questions in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do flying termites eat wood? Though most people confuse flying termites with flying ants they are clearly different.
<strong>So, do Flying Termites Eat Wood? Flying termites do not eat wood but only fly out to mate and reproduce and to form a new colony. In this flying termite stage, they only survive in that state for nearly an hour or two before their wings fall off and they seek a nest to lay their eggs.�</strong>
<strong>But, when they shed wings, they cause destruction by burrowing into woods or establish nests where they start their next life cycle - know how to control termites.�</strong>

<h2 id="what-are-flying-termites---know-these-insects"><strong>What Are Flying Termites - Know these Insects�</strong></h2>
<p>Flying termites are part of the termites life cycle and part of the larger insects family. They are winged and also are the reproductive part of the termites cycle. They are known as the alates.
If you have never seen flying termites, you are most probably going to confuse them with the flying ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alates have 4 wings of the same size with a pair on each side. Their thorax and abdomen are almost similar in size and the waist is thick. The antennae are straight with a 3/8 inch long body that can reach even  inch wide.</li>
<li>There are 3 major species of the alates that include subterranean termites, damp wood, and Formosan termites.</li>
<li>From the 3 species, Formosan alates cause more destruction than other species. Dampwood alates are also known to destroy anything woody including furniture, books, and rotting pieces of wood.
Therefore, every time you see flying termites, you need to raise an alarm over an incoming or an already existing infestation in your home.

<h2 id="where-can-you-find-the-f"><strong>Where can you Find the F****lying Termites?�</strong></h2>
<p>The flying termites come from an already established nest to go mate and reproduce. After mating, their wings fall off as they seek a new nest to start another colony.</p>
<ul>
<li>They burrow underwood and other suitable places for the next colony.</li>
<li>When they are successful, they reproduce and the cycle continues
There are different species of flying termites and each species has a different swarming season.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-do-flying-termites-swarm"><strong>When do flying termites swarm?</strong></h2>
<p>The major reason why flying termites come out from their colonies is that they are out to mate. However, there are different species with different swarming seasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see a swarm of termites in broad daylight during the spring season, these are the subterranean species.</li>
<li>If the infestation is during the late summer, the swarm is from the dry wood species they also like appearing in the evenings.</li>
<li>They are very fond of artificial lights and will storm into your house in case you leave your windows and doors open.</li>
<li>Lastly, damp wood species like swarm during summer but also like hiding under damp wood and rotten pieces of timber.
When the summer season is on, damp wood species also like entering our houses like swollen balloons if the windows and doors are open.� Use window shields to prevent these termites and other insects from getting into your house.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-flying-termites-live"><strong>How Long Do Flying Termites Live?</strong></h2>
<p>Flying termites dont survive for long in this nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes approximately 1 hour as they mate and drop off their wings to look for nests where they can reproduce.
The maximum they can take in this state is 2 hours.

<h2 id="flying-termites-in-the-house-what-should-i-do"><strong>Flying Termites In The House-What Should I Do?</strong></h2>
<p>The flying termites you see around are completely harmless to you as a person. They dont bite nor do they sting.
But there is a reason to get worried because they are either looking for a nest to establish or there is already an existing nest within your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>If nothing is done, they can be built nests in your attic, ceiling, underground foundation, or any other place within your home.
In the meantime, you need to lock up your windows and doors to prevent their entry into your house. Turning off the lights also helps control those that are attracted to light.
If nothing is done, these flying termites will establish a nest-a a new queen will be formed and this could mean termite infestation. The damage to timber, books, ceiling, and furniture among other things they come around.
Next time you get a swarm of flying termites consult a pest control expert who knows the best way to eliminating them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-flying-termites"><strong>How Do You Get Rid Of Flying Termites?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have noticed these flying termites, its a signal that you need to take action against insect control in your area.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an indication that the termites have been hiding in your vicinity and are now going to multiply even more.</li>
<li>Flying termites are actually hard to control because they appear within a very short time and quickly disappear into their nests after mating.
The queen is also very much protected and killing it is hard making it impossible to control the rest of the termites. It will continue laying eggs and releasing more termites into your house.
Using pest control products may work but a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">professional pest control expert</a>
will do a much better job in eliminating them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do flying termites eat wood? No, they dont but they are indications of more destruction to come.</p>
<ul>
<li>This winged stage is normally short for the termites where they mate before wings fall off and they look for the best place to make a new colony.</li>
<li>Though this stage does not cause any destruction, it leaves an alarm of what awaits you if you dont take immediate action to control them.
Expect different flying termites to come out in different seasons depending on their species. They are also attracted to different things depending on their species i.e. artificial light, damp wood among others.
That said and done, there are many available means to
control the termites invasion
. However, the best option remains engaging experts in pest control for the complete elimination of the termites in your home.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below I answer this question - do geckos eat bed bugs or what can you use to exterminate the bugs. So, will lizards help exterminate the bed bugs?
<em>In summary, do lizards eat bed bugs? Yes, lizards (particularly geckos or house lizards) will kill bed bugs - but won&rsquo;t be an effective pest control remedy.�</em>
<em>However, Bed bugs are fast reproducers and hence lizards won&rsquo;t keep up to feed on the bugs with their quick multiplication just�like with other house pests.�</em>

<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs">Details: Do Geckos Eat Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Some Lizards like the <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-roaches/">Gecko</a> will <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> bugs including bed bugs - great bed bugs extermination. The pest extermination methods to use on bed bugs will reduce the sucking of human blood.
Bed bugs (Cimex hemipterus or Cimex lectularius) will invade your clothing and mattresses - these will cause bites. You may result in skin-related issues, blisters, and rashes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs have an average body length of about 1 to 7 mm - and hence they&rsquo;re visible - they&rsquo;ll also jump onto household items, pets, and clothing.</li>
<li>If there bed bugs (pests) around your house - maintain great hygiene - including in the urban area.
But can multiple lizards exterminate the bed bugs? Well, yes, lizards and geckos will feed on lizards but may also leave mess and droppings.

<h2 id="any-dangers-feeding-bed-bugs-to-geckos">Any Dangers Feeding Bed Bugs to Geckos?</h2>
<p>For any lizards that are allowed to fend for themselves around your house, as a pest control measure, you won&rsquo;t experience any problems - but not when
adopted as a pet
.
Therefore, feeding the lizards with bed bugs (that are brought from elsewhere) may not be a great idea since bed bugs are known to hold organisms causing bacterial infections.</p>
<h2 id="issues-with-using-geckos-to-control-bed-bugs">Issues with Using Geckos to Control Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>So, if any homeowner considers employing geckos of house lizards to eat bed bugs, they must be prepared to control different issues related to that.</p>
<h3 id="1-gecko-feces">1. Gecko Feces</h3>
<p>Involving house geckos to control bed bugs will lead to different issues with undesirable effects including leaving feces on different surfaces.
The lizard droppings will be concealed in hard-to-find or dark places - near or around the kitchen cupboard that won&rsquo;t be moved regularly.
The feces may be hidden in areas that are hard to notice - and you&rsquo;ll notice this issue when you see flies swarming in some specific dark or partially hidden places.</p>
<h3 id="2-damaging-household-devices">2. Damaging household devices</h3>
<p>Further, the geckos may equally cause damage to your household devices including electronics.
This may cause losses in terms of malfunctioning devices - due to electrocuted lizards.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-pests-to-feed-to-your-geckos">Alternative Pests To feed to your Geckos?</h2>
<p>Some homeowners believe that any uninvited insect must be exterminated using chemical methods - but to control the
intruder
, you can use different creepy-crawlies.</p>
<h3 id="1-mosquitoes">1. Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>There are alternative pests that you may feed to your lizards - house lizards won&rsquo;t only feed on bed bugs but will also attack the small pests running around your house and
yard
.
Lizards are largely diurnal, and they won&rsquo;t eat numerous mosquitoes, but will opportunist capturing of the pests. But toads and frogs crepuscular &amp; nocturnal) eat more mosquitoes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLBtiyLAgAU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLBtiyLAgAU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
Lizards love mosquito diets - they&rsquo;ll simply stick out their sticky tongue and feed on the bugs. But lizards may not be welcome in homes that have small rodents,
cats
, and dogs.
Therefore, for houses that have pets, you&rsquo;ll require to acquire the services of some expert exterminators for the
control of the mosquitos
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, lizards (many amphibians) tend to be very creepy particularly in the house basement. Lizards may also bring diseases - they love damp and warm environments.
Therefore, to help control mosquitoes, you may avoid killing the lizards you notice around your home, pantry, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-mice-and-rats">2. Mice and Rats</h3>
<p>Mice and rats will create a great food source for geckos in your spaces - even in the rented spaces - but they&rsquo;ll mainly eat the young ones and rat litter.
Geckos will efficiently predate on mice and rats - geckos mainly hide in dark areas - and they&rsquo;ll feed on the pinkies - young rats particularly while their mother rat is away.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqMRsTMiwI&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqMRsTMiwI&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
You&rsquo;ll find the lizards hanging around dark places - locations where you also get mice and rats and their younglings. Thus lizards get to snack on the pests and their�pinkies.</p>
<h3 id="2cockroaches">2.�Cockroaches</h3>
<p>So, will geckos feed on cockroaches? Well, yes geckos and house lizards will also eat roaches and their larva. But they occupy different places - roaches love places near the ground.
On the other hand, geckos occupy spaces that are higher above the ground - they love dark, damp, and equally cool places. But house lizards will occupy dark places - also loved by cockroaches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-cockroaches/">Animals that Eat Cockroaches</a>
Centipedes will feed on house lizards - the bug&rsquo;s wriggly motion will attract lizards that snatch them fast. You&rsquo;ll get the centipedes around the house on wood beams and other wooden fixtures.
Lizards will also feed on termite swarmers that move in colonies - they have wings and hence will fly as swarmers.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="will-housegeckos-eat-bed-bugs-in-captivity">Will House<strong>Geckos Eat Bed Bugs in captivity?�</strong></h2>
<p>So, will house geckos feed on bed bugs while they&rsquo;re in captivity? Well, yes, geckos (even when in captivity) will munch different pests including bed bugs, cockroaches, silkworms, or waxworms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, while the geckos are in captivity you&rsquo;ll need to provide additional food and meal supplementation like vitamins.</li>
<li>But ensure to check the size of the pests and insects you&rsquo;re giving to the geckos to avoid choking - they must measure a maximum of the distance between the gecko&rsquo;s eyes.
In addition, live crickets must not be allowed into the
gecko&rsquo;s enclosure space
since they actually nibble and bite on your humble pests.
On gecko thirst for water, mist water in the pest&rsquo;s enclosure. So, don&rsquo;t pour water simply into some dish since the geckos will quench from water droplets on leaves and tree branches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question &ldquo;do geckos eat bed bugs&rdquo;, Yes, geckos will feed on bed bugs but they may also bring salmonella and also leave damaged devices and drop feces.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been disturbed by colonies of roaches in your place and wonder which animal can eliminate them naturally? You may even be compelled to find out if some of your pets can eat cockroaches.</p>
<p>Do you own a pet <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs/">Gecko</a> (house lizard) or have you spotted one in your house, yard or zoo? Well, in this article, we shall delve into close predation of gecko on roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>**So, Do Geckos <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a> Roaches? The direct answer is YES. Geckos hunt and eat roaches in your home, yard, or zoo. **</li>
<li><strong>But, it&rsquo;s not advisable to feed your Geckos on cockroaches from your house or caught outside in the fields since these roaches contain bacterial infections, parasites, and germs, which may affect their health adversely.</strong>
<strong>�Geckos will eat any species of roaches (unselective) though they prefer eating Dubia roaches. They also hunt and eat mosquitoes, ants, rats/mice, swarmers, crickets, locusts, and centipedes in your place.</strong>
Lets get into the details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-roaches">Details: Do Geckos Eat Roaches?</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-do-geckos-eat-roaches">1.� How do Geckos Eat Roaches?</h3>
<p>Geckos hunt and eat roaches as one of their main meals. When hunting, Gecko approaches the roach or a colony of roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, it focuses on a specific cockroach after which it shoots its head and captures it with the mouth (its rear legs give it ample momentum to reach its prey on time).</li>
<li>A Gecko would slowly turn the captured roach with its mouth to ensure that the roachs head is inside the mouth fully  this helps in fasten suffocation process, which is one of the ways Gecko uses to kill the roach.
The Gecko will then try to push the roach further (using its tongue) into its mouth. It will take 1 to 3 minutes for Gecko to swallow whole one roach.</li>
<li>Alternatively, some species of Gecko such as Leopard Gecko prefer to cut (using its teeth) the roachs head first and feed on the body later.</li>
<li>When eating roaches, Gecko does not use its legs to hold on roach for better grip like cats do  gecko uses its mouth entirely for grasping and holding roach into place.
Once Gecko eats a roach, it pauses for 1 to 3 minutes before eating another one  this helps it recover hunting energy and breathe enough air, which it uses to suck in roach when swallowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Geckos will rarely eat a roach from the abdomen  they always eat it from the head. In addition, Geckos eat every part of a roach including the wings.</p>
<h3 id="2-species-of-roaches-that-geckos-eat">2. Species of Roaches That Geckos Eat.</h3>
<p>Geckos do not select when hunting roaches for food. However, research shows that, in a colony of roach species, Geckos tend to feed on Dubia roaches more and often than other species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study has revealed that Dubia roaches have tasty components and a higher level of calcium than other roaches  something that attracts Geckos to prey on them preferentially.</li>
<li>Also, Dubia roaches lack wings (female Dubia roaches) thus making it easier for Gecko to swallow them whole.
Though American roaches, German roaches, and Oriental roaches are the most common at-home are highly likely to be preyed on by Geckos, they post-feeding challenges to them.</li>
<li>They have scary legs and long wings that make swallowing problematic.
Moreover, these roaches cause health problems to Geckos when eaten thus becoming less popular and prioritized food species.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-how-many-roaches-can-gecko-eat">3. How Many Roaches Can Gecko Eat?</h3>
<p>An adult Gecko can eat 2 to 6 (maximum) roaches in a given meal. Some Geckos will feed on two roaches at a time and eat a total of seven roaches in a given day.</p>
<p>However, the number of roaches eaten by Gecko per day may change slightly according to the size of the roach being eaten  Geckos eat smaller roaches than bigger ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Young/baby Gecko can/will eat 2 to 4 roaches in a meal on a given day. Normally, most Geckos feed for 10 to 17 minutes  this time is enough for them to have eaten to their satisfaction.</li>
<li>If you have a pet gecko, it is important to feed it just enough (overfeeding will make your gecko inactive).
Baby geckos should eat a few roaches 2 to 3 times in a given day. (It is not advisable to feed your pet geckos daily  alternate or skip some days).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-are-roaches-bad-to-gecko-when-eaten">4. Are Roaches bad to Gecko when Eaten?</h3>
<p>Though most geckos feed on any roaches around your place (unselective), most roaches found in homes (e.g. American roaches, German roaches, and Oriental roaches) cause health problems to geckos when eaten.</p>
<ul>
<li>They carry parasites, germs, and bacteria in them that cause infections and sickness to your Geckos.</li>
<li>The Salmonella bacteria found on/under the wings of these roaches cause scary and infectious skin on your Geckos.
Parasites such as Trichuris (11.97%), Eimeria (2.73%), Capillaria (6.16%), Toxocara (4.86%), Hook Worm (4.86%), and Ascaris (33.76%) were found both on external and internal parts of roaches after close lab examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Germs from pesticides or control chemicals that may be sprayed in your house or out in fields easily stick on the wings and body of roaches  this will find their way into the gecko digestive tract when eaten thus affecting its health.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-can-your-house-gecko-eat">What Else Can Your House Gecko Eat?</h2>
<p>A Gecko eats mosquitoes in your house or yard by extending its tongue out for the mosquitoes to land and get stuck. A Gecko can also shoot out its tongue out to catch a flying mosquito.</p>
<h3 id="1-ratsmice"><strong>1. Rats/mice.</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from roaches, geckos also hunt and eat rats and mice in your house or compound.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gecko may not kill big rats or mice; however, it feeds on baby rats/mice at their nest.
Geckos help a lot in controlling these organisms. However, the feeding rate is low  you need another alternative control method too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-crickets-and-locusts"><strong>2. Crickets and locusts.</strong></h3>
<p>Field geckos hunt crickets and locusts more than the roaches. Study shows that crickets have a high nutrition value (protein).</p>
<p>The Geckos hunts crickets in their hideouts (holes) by use of their mouth or sticky tongue.</p>
<p>Geckos catch centipedes along the wooden structures in your house or yard using their mouth and swallow them whole.</p>
<p>Swarmer produced by termite colonies in your house or fields is often eaten by geckos. Gecko uses its tongue to stick swarmers and swallow them whole.
<strong>3. Worm substrates e.g. mealworms</strong>
.</p>
<p>You can feed your pet gecko with some of the locally bred organisms such as hornworms, mealworms, silkworms, and super worms.</p>
<ul>
<li>These organisms have a high level of fat that is dangerous for geckos in excess (causes geckos to fatten faster thus leading to walking problems).
Such meals should be fed in fewer quantities and be supplemented often with vet-approved roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-you-avoid-giving-your-gecko">What Should You Avoid Giving Your Gecko?</h2>
<p><strong>1. Vegetables and Fruits</strong>
.</p>
<p>Geckos are insectivorous reptiles. They should not be fed on fruits, vegetables, or any plant extracts/substances.</p>
<p>This causes stomach upset in them though most of the geckos wont feed on such substrates.
<strong>2. High-level fatty insects (Mealworms).</strong>
It is risky to feed your pet Geckos on large quantities of mealworms, hornworms, silkworms, or any high-level fatty insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat from these organisms is stored (not digested) in the adipose tissues (skin layer/beneath the skin) at the tail and stomach regions.</li>
<li>The fattened Gecko becomes docile/inactive and unable to walk normally  this may lead to death with time.
Highly fatty feeds should be fed to your pet gecko once or twice a week and also in less quantity. Supplement insects such as roaches and crickets should accompany the highly fatty gecko feeds.
<strong>3. Ants and Mosquitoes</strong>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid feeding your pet gecko with ants or mosquitoes. Although geckos eat them, these insects cause though and stomach irritation, which may even call for veterinary attention.
<strong>4. Scorpions and termites.</strong>
Scorpions, termites, and safari ants are risky meals for your pet gecko since they attack, bite and instill injuries on its mouth and skin.</p>
<p>Though at times Geckos are able to overcome and eat them, it is advisable not to offer them as food to geckos.
<strong>5. Light insects.</strong>
No insects that produce light (fireflies) should be fed to geckos. They contain toxic chemicals that will harm your pet Gecko.</p>
<p>It is highly recommendable to seek your vet advisory for various types of commercial gecko feeds available to ensure that you always offer the right diet and quantity to your pet geckos at the right time (proper feeding time).</p>
<p>You can also visit gecko feed retailers at the local center/distributors around you.</p>
<p>NB:
<em>Ensure that all your gecko commercial feeds are vet-approved.</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The gecko is an insectivorous reptile that feeds on roaches as one of its meals.</p>
<ul>
<li>They hunt and capture these insects with their mouth before swallowing them whole or slicing them into pieces and then swallowing.</li>
<li>It is not advisable to feed your gecko with roaches in your house or caught from the fields since they usually have germs, bacteria, and harbor infectious parasites.
Gecko can also feed on crickets, ants, locusts, rats, swarmers, and centipedes.</li>

      <description>Lizards are fascinating creatures, and their diverse dietary preferences reflect their adaptability to different environments.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lizards are fascinating creatures, and their diverse dietary preferences reflect their adaptability to different environments.</p>
<p>The question of whether lizards eat snails can be answered with a resounding &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; though the specifics of this feeding behavior depend on various factors, including the species of
<a href="https://ucanr.edu/sites/MarinMG/files/116745.pdf">lizards</a>
, their natural habitat, and the availability of other food sources.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the dietary habits of lizards, their relationship with snails as prey, and the broader ecological role both animals play.</p>
<h2 id="lizards-and-their-dietary-preferences">Lizards and Their Dietary Preferences</h2>
<p>Lizards belong to a diverse group of reptiles, encompassing over 6,000 species worldwide. Depending on their species, they can be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.</p>
<p>Most lizards that prey on snails are typically insectivores or carnivores, feeding on a variety of small animals, including insects, worms, spiders, and, in some cases, snails.�Certain lizards have a specialized diet that includes specific prey, while others are opportunistic feeders that consume whatever is readily available.</p>
<p>In the wild, food scarcity often pushes lizards to diversify their diet, including feeding on snails, particularly when they are abundant. This is especially true in environments where snails are easy to catch and offer a good source of nutrition.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-lizards-eat-snails">Why Do Lizards Eat Snails?</h2>
<p>Snails provide an excellent source of protein and other essential nutrients for lizards. Their soft bodies, though protected by a hard shell, are rich in energy, making them an attractive food option for many <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> species.</p>
<p>Moreover, snails are relatively easy to catch because of their slow movement, and lizards can easily overpower them.�The availability of snails often depends on environmental factors, such as moisture and temperature.</p>
<p>Snails tend to thrive in humid conditions, which makes them abundant in environments like forests, gardens, and wetlands. Lizards living in these habitats may naturally encounter snails more frequently and incorporate them into their diet.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-lizards-that-eat-snails">Types of Lizards That Eat Snails</h2>
<p>While not all lizard species eat snails, several species and
baby lizards
are known to do so, particularly those that dwell in areas where snails are abundant. Lets explore some of the lizards that are likely to include snails in their diet.
<strong>1. Skinks:</strong>
Skinks are one of the most well-known groups of lizards that frequently feed on snails. These small, smooth-scaled reptiles are found in various habitats, from deserts to forests. Skinks are generally insectivorous but will not hesitate to eat snails when available. Their strong jaws help them crush the snails shell, allowing them access to the soft body inside.
<strong>2. Anoles:</strong>
Anoles are another group of lizards that might occasionally eat snails. Native to the southeastern United States, Caribbean, and parts of South America, anoles are small, agile lizards that primarily feed on insects. However, larger anole species, such as the Cuban brown anole, may also eat snails if they are easy to catch.
<strong>3. Geckos:</strong>
Geckos, particularly larger species, may also eat snails. These nocturnal lizards, known for their ability to climb vertical surfaces, typically feed on insects, but they are opportunistic feeders. If snails are readily available in their habitat, geckos may include them in their diet.
<strong>4. Monitor Lizards:</strong>
Large lizards, such as monitor lizards, are known to eat a variety of prey, including snails. Monitors are powerful carnivores that can hunt larger animals, but they are also skilled at scavenging and foraging for smaller prey. Snails, though a small meal for these large reptiles, can be a convenient source of nutrition in environments where food is scarce.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-lizards-eat-snails">How Do Lizards Eat Snails?</h2>
<p>The act of eating snails requires some specific adaptations, particularly when it comes to dealing with the snails protective shell. Many lizards that eat snails have strong, sharp teeth or jaws that allow them to break through the shell to reach the soft flesh inside.</p>
<p>For instance, skinks are known for their ability to crush snail shells with their strong jaws. Once the shell is broken, the lizard consumes the snails body, leaving the broken shell behind. In some cases, lizards may even swallow smaller snails whole, shell and all, allowing their stomach acids to break down the calcium-rich shell.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-impact-of-lizards-eating-snails">Ecological Impact of Lizards Eating Snails</h2>
<p>Lizards play an important role in the ecosystem by regulating populations of smaller animals, including snails. By consuming snails, lizards help control snail populations, which can be beneficial in both natural and agricultural environments.</p>
<p>In gardens and farms, for instance, snails are often considered pests because they feed on a variety of plants, causing
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">venomous</a>
to crops and ornamental vegetation. Lizards that feed on snails can act as a natural form of pest control, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>This predator-prey relationship helps maintain ecological balance and prevents any one species from becoming too dominant.�Additionally, the consumption of snails by lizards contributes to the nutrient cycle in ecosystems.</p>
<p>By feeding on snails, lizards facilitate the transfer of energy and nutrients up the food chain. The calcium in snail shells, for instance, is a valuable nutrient for lizards, helping them maintain healthy bones and eggshells during reproduction.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, lizards do eat snails, though the frequency with which they do so depends on factors such as species, habitat, and availability of other prey. Snails provide a rich source of protein and nutrients for lizards, making them a valuable food item in certain environments.</p>
<p>Lizards that are capable of overcoming the protective snail shell, such as skinks, geckos, and anoles, often include snails as part of their diet.�The consumption of snails by lizards is not only beneficial for the reptiles themselves but also has broader ecological implications.</p>
<p>By controlling snail populations, lizards contribute to the balance of ecosystems and help reduce the impact of snails on plants and crops. This predator-prey dynamic exemplifies the interconnectedness of species within an ecosystem and highlights the important role that lizards play in maintaining biodiversity.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably you have come across various species of lizards in your home, compound, fields, yards, or zoo and wonder if they have bones. How then are their body muscles supported?��So,
<em>do lizards have bones?�</em>
<strong>The direct answer is, YES, all **
lizards are vertebrates
** that have bones that are interconnected together to help them in locomotion.�</strong>
<strong>The bones of lizards are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton. These bones offer support, protection of internal organs, and options for attachment of body muscles and cells. The number of each bone varies according to size and species of lizard.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-do-lizards-have-bones">Details: Do Lizards Have Bones?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860302/">Lizards, like other reptiles, have bones</a>
. Their bones are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton. The appendicular skeleton consists of the pelvic girdle, the pectoral, the limbs, and the bones of the front and hind legs.</p>
<p>The axial skeleton form the central axis of the lizards body. It comprises the skull, the dorsal/thoracic cage and the vertebral column.</p>
<p>The two skeleton structures are interconnected and plays a great role in protecting the inners body organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and intestines as well as the spinal cord (vital). Moreover, they provide suitable support of the body and enhances easier locomotion.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-functions-of-bones-in-lizards">What are the functions of Bones in Lizards?</h2>
<p>The following are main functions of bones in lizards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protecting the spinal cord - the vertebral column bones.</li>
<li>Protecting the brains and cerebral system - the skull.</li>
<li>Protecting providing option for attachment of internal organs such as digestive organs, heart, kidney, liver and lungs (ribs).</li>
<li>Provides option for attachment of the body muscles  axial skeleton, pelvic and pectoral girdle.</li>
<li>Help in locomotion/movement  the appendicular skeleton  femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, scapula, metacarpals, and metatarsals.</li>
<li>For grasping and grinding over the surface  the phalanges, metatarsals and metacarpals - including<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">lizard teeth</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-many-bones-does-a-lizard-have">How Many Bones Does a Lizard Have?</h2>
<p>Lizard species have different varying number of bones due to their difference in sizes. However, the skeleton of lizard has 28 specialized bones, which work collective to offer protection and locomotion effectively.</p>
<p>These bones include the vertebral column (caudal, sacral, lumbar, thoracic/dorsal and cervical vertebrae), the sternum, the scapula, the tarsals, metatarsal, carpal, metacarpal, tibia, fibula, ulna, radius, ribs, mandibles, maxilla and the phalanges.</p>
<p>Most lizards have 100 to 300 bones while large lizards such as Tree crocodile may have more. On the other hand, small lizards such as gecko may have less than 100 bones.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-have-bones-in-their-tails">Do Lizards Have Bones in Their Tails?</h2>
<p>Yes! Lizards have bones in their tail. The tail which is formed from the caudal vertebrae contain bones, ligaments, nerves, vasculature and tail muscles which gives it the tail power.</p>
<p>The tail of most lizards get detached easily when held. The Fracture of the tail vertebrae usually occurs at the fracture plane leaving behind flesh tail tissue to heal.</p>
<p>The cut tail is not easily returned in lizards  thus most of lizard species wont grow their tail back (remain tailless) - check
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5484412/">lizard tail bones regeneration</a>
.</p>
<p>Though a few lizard species show lateral growth of detached tail, the tail may not be as functional as the original tail. The First 3 bones in the lizard caudal vertebrae are fused to give it tail power. In case the tail detachment occurs past these three bones, there is normally no regrowth that can occur in most cases.</p>
<p>Lizards lack the tail autotomy and cannot be treated once their cut tail. Ensure you hold your pet lizard from below at the chest region (not lifting it by the tail).</p>
<h3 id="a-appendicular-skeleton">a. Appendicular Skeleton.</h3>
<p>The appendicular skeleton in lizards comprises of the bones that form the front and the hind legs plus the pelvic girdle and pectoral girdle from which the limbs are attached to the axial skeleton. These bones collectively coordinate the lizards movement.
<strong>1. Pectoral girdle.</strong>
This consist of two main bones, that is, the scapula and the collarbone also called clavicle. The clavicle is s-shaped <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-bones/">bone</a>, which articulates with the sternum at the front chest of the lizard. The clavicle also joins the scapula at the end of lizards shoulder.</p>
<p>Its main function is to support the scapula. Lizards have two collarbones  each jointed at the sternum and scapula.�Scapula is a bone that articulates with humerus and aid in the shoulder movement of lizard.</p>
<p>Scapula has a wide v-shaped surface area that offers an option for attachment of the neck and back muscles that coordinates the movement of joints. Lizards have two scapula  one for each front leg/limb.
<strong>2. Front Legs.</strong>
Lizards have two front legs. Each leg has similar and equal number of bones as the other. Humerus (limb) joins scapula at the shoulder articulation point.</p>
<p>Then, the two leg bones (ulna and radius) join humerus at the sigmoid notch. At the end of ulna and radius lay carpal bones, which allow rotary movement of the arm.</p>
<p>The Carpals extent to form the metacarpal bones (bones at the palm of the arm) and phalanx bones (the bones that allows the folding of the arm). The phalanges are jointed to help the lizards when grasping the prey.</p>
<p>The bones at the front legs of lizards function to coordinate in the locomotion and grasping the prey. In addition, they provide option for attachment of front leg muscles.
<strong>3. Pelvic girdle.</strong>
The Pelvic girdle has three bones that provide an option for the attachment of the lizards hind legs. The three bones are the pubis (front), ischium (back) and ilium (wing). The pelvic girdle also provides the surface for attachment of back muscles.</p>
<p>Most lizard species have their pelvic girdle fused and linked to the axial skeleton at the caudal vertebrae except in large lizards such as Komodo Dragon and Tree Crocodile Monitor and
bearded dragons� do they eat tomatoes?
.</p>
<p>In small lizards, the femur is connected directly to the axial skeleton through the ball and socket joint at the sacral vertebrae.
<strong>4. Hind legs.</strong>
Lizards have two hind legs. Each leg has equal number and similar bone type as the other. The Hind leg is joined to pelvic girdle at caudal vertebrae using the femur  which has the ball shaped end to allow the notch rotary motion.</p>
<p>At the end of femur, there is a patella bone, which helps form the knee joint. The leg is extended using two bones called tibia (larger) and fibular (smaller). These two bones function to support the weight of lizards and offer
<a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3013">option for attachment of leg muscles</a>
.</p>
<p>At the end of tibia and fibula lay tarsal bones that allows two-way motion of the arm. These bones are connected to metatarsal bones (metatarsals are elongated bones and forms base of lizards foot). At the end of metatarsals are phalanx bones. The phalanges are jointed and form the toes, which help in grasping on the ground, trees or rocks when walking.</p>
<h3 id="b-axial-skeleton">b. Axial Skeleton.</h3>
<p>The axial skeleton comprises of the skull, the dorsal/thoracic cage and the vertebral column. Axial skeleton forms the central axis of the lizards. The major function of axial skeleton is to offer point for the attachment of the appendicular skeleton and protect the spinal cord (spinal cord is responsible for nervous system coordination).
<strong>1. The skull.</strong>
Skull is a bony structure, which forms the head. The lizards skull is divided into several bones, which include the facial bones, the cranial bones, the hyoid bone and auditory ossicles.</p>
<p>The skull also contain the lower jaw (mandible - the only movable bone) and maxillae. The meninges (head hard skin and muscles) grow and merge with the lizards body skin.</p>
<p>Major functions of the skull is to protect the brain  which is be most sensitive part of the body coordination system.
<strong>2. Cervical Vertebrae</strong>
The cervical vertebrae consist of vertebra found at the lizards neck region. The first two cervical vertebra (atlas and axis) are specialized to help the nodding of head (atlas) and rotary motion of the head (axis).</p>
<p>Other vertebra are fused making the neck region of lizard stiff while some advance to form thoracic vertebrae. The cervical vertebrae also offer option for attachment of neck muscles.
<strong>3. Thoracic/dorsal vertebrae.</strong>
The dorsal vertebrae, also called thoracic vertebrae, is found at the chest region of the lizards. The vertebra provides option for the attachment of the ribs (ribs protects internal organs such as lungs, heart and livers from external damage).</p>
<p>The end of each rid is attached to sternum (breastbone) that is located at the front chest region. The number of ribs and vertebra varies from one lizard species to another. Large lizards like Tree Crocodile monitor and Komodo Drago have 15 to 24 vertebra, the medium sized lizard lizards have 10 to 16 dorsal vertebra while small lizards such as savannah and chameleon lizards have 7 to 11 thoracic vertebrae.</p>
<p>Each dorsal vertebra is connected to two ribs (one on either side).� The dorsal vertebral provides option for the attachment of the back muscles.</p>
<p>Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">Are Lizards Poisonous?</a>
<strong>4. Lumbar Vertebrae.</strong>
Most lizard species do not have lumbar vertebrae apart from the large lizards such as Komodo dragon and Asian water monitor lizards. The lumbar vertebra do not have the ribs attached. This region is where the stomach lay and provides option for the lizards to coil effectively during attacks.
<strong>5. Sacral Vertebrae.</strong>
The sacral vertebrae are found at the sacral section (sacrum). The pelvic girdle is jointed with the sacral vertebrae and offers large surface area for attachment of back muscles. The Lizards have 1 to 7 sacral vertebra. However, larger species can have 3 to 5 more vertebra.</p>
<p>Small and middle-sized lizards such as Nike water lizards, savannah lards and house lizards have their sacral vertebra fused to form caudal vertebrae.
<strong>6. Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The caudal vertebrae, also called tail vertebrae, is what forms the tail of the lizards. Caudal vertebrae has bones that decrease in size up to the last one. Each vertebra has two short protruding ribs that provide surface for attachment of tail muscles.</p>
<p>The caudal vertebra has short spines and arches. Long-tailed lizards such as Basilisk, chameleon lizards and skinks have 10 to 32 caudal vertebrae while small-tailed lizards have 1 to 10 caudal vertebrae.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>All Lizard species have bones that are collectively linked to aid them in protection and locomotion. The bones are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton.</p>
<p>Main functions of the bones include support, protection of internal organs and offer options for attachment of body muscles. �The total number of bones vary according to size and species of lizard. Lizards have an average of 28 specialized bones.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably youve seen a <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> running around your house or yard. So, youre wondering whether these reptiles can bite you, other humans, in your residence, or even pets.</p>
<p>Further, how do these lizards even feed  with or without teeth? So, do lizards have teeth?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The short answer is, YES! Lizards have teeth that are well adapted to the type of food they eat. The dentition of lizards varies from one species to another within the taxonomic family where some have pleurodont teeth formation while others have acrodont teeth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The shape of their teeth is either conical, pointed, or serrated to help them grip the prey and push it into the digestive tract. Lizards do not have alveoli or tooth sockets in their dentition. Some lizard species have venom ducts connected to their tooth roots to help paralyzed their prey.�</strong>

<h2 id="do-lizards-have-teeth---reptile-dentition">Do Lizards Have Teeth? - Reptile Dentition</h2>
<p>Lizards have teeth that are well adapted to the type of food they eat. Lizards,
<strong>unlike mammals which have several types of teeth</strong>
, have all their teeth similar (one type) except a few species.</p>
<p>Normally, lizards do not have teeth sockets or alveoli. Their teeth are either acrodont or pleurodont.
<strong>1. Acrodont teeth classification.</strong>
In this classification, the teeth are superficially fused to the tooth-bearing bone usually at the biting edges of the maxilla and mandibles.</p>
<p>Particularly, this fusion should be handled with care (by lizard owners) since acrodont dentition is not replaceable on removal. However, only young lizards can have their acrodont teeth replaced.</p>
<p>The acrodont teeth are weak and easily lost. With wear and tear resulting from biting, their jawbones are left exposed or sometimes bleeding due to abrasive action.</p>
<p>Lizards possessing the acrodont type of teeth include Agamid lizards like water dragons, bearded dragons, and chameleons. �Acrodont class is highly susceptible to diseases such as periodontal.
<strong>2. Pleurodont teeth classification.</strong>
This is the main type of dentition that is found in most lizards. The teeth are attached to the interior side of the jawbone creating a wider surface that offers strong fusion as compared to the acrodont type.</p>
<p>The teeth are often replaced in the lifetime of lizards while others may be swallowed with the prey during feeding. Some lizards may grow numerous teeth in their palate.</p>
<p>The front acrodont teeth are shed off and replaced often since they are frequently involved in grasping, biting, and holding the prey when feeding as compared to the posterior teeth.</p>
<p>The sharpness and shape of the pleurodont class lizards vary from species to species. The majority of lizards have short, sharp-pointed, and conical-shaped pleurodont teeth.</p>
<p>Some lizards like Kamodo Dragons have curved and serrated teeth that can cut hard flesh causing serious breeding on biting.</p>
<p>Molluscivores such as Nile Monitor and Caiman Lizard have teeth that are flat, blunt, and rounded. These teeth also have crowns, at the back of the jaw, adapted to the crushing of crustaceans such as clams and snails.</p>
<p>Venomous lizards, also known as heloderma, have a large longitudinal fold or groove in the interior part of each lower jaw tooth that helps in storing venom used to paralyze the prey.</p>
<p>Lizards that are herbivores such as iguana have wide and flat teeth crown with serrated sides adapted to plant feeding.
<strong>The pleurodont class</strong>
of lizard teeth is mainly found in monitor lizards, iguanas, anoles, basilisks, and chuckwallas.
<strong>3. Thecodont teeth classification.</strong>
This type of teeth is mainly found in other reptiles such as snakes, crocodiles,s and all mammals. Importantly, the thecodont teeth are easily confused with the pleurodont and acrodont types in reptiles - you must therefore be keen.</p>
<p>However, the thecodont type of teeth is characterized by well-established, deep bony sockets which hold into place teeth that are replaceable in a given order and cycle according to the individual animal species.</p>
<p>Thecodont is firmly adapted for strong grasping without being shed off.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-teeth-do-lizards-have">How Many Teeth Do Lizards Have?</h2>
<p>Different species of lizards have a varying number of teeth from the young stage to adulthood. These lizard species include:</p>
<ol>
<li>This type usually has an average of 20 to 30 teeth in each quadrant. At maturity, iguana would have a total of 80 to 120 teeth.</li>
<li>**Nile Monitor.**Its teeth are classified into: premaxillary teeth are 9, each maxilla has 10 to 11 teeth and each dentary has 11 to 12 teeth that are well adapted to crushing and grinding food.</li>
<li>**Kamodo Dragon. **It has approximately 60 teeth protruding one inch from the jawbone. The teeth are sharp-pointed and cause serious harm on a single bite.</li>
<li>Apart from few exceptions, an average Gecko has approximately 50 to 100 teeth. However, a leaf-tailed Gecko has 300 or more teeth  the largest number of teeth ever found in lizards.</li>
<li>The number of teeth found in skinks is not defined in various species available. However, the minimum number of teeth you can get in a given skink is 20 while the highest number is 90 teeth on average.</li>
<li>An adult chameleon has 32 to 44 teeth on average. However, these are not the number of teeth it has during death. Most of the front teeth are worn out or removed due to grasping and biting, leaving behind a roughjawbone.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-are-lizards-teeth-used-for">What are Lizards Teeth Used For?</h2>
<p>Lizards Teeth can be used in any of the following functions:
<strong>1. For Feeding.</strong>
These are the primary functions. Lizards use teeth to grasp, bite, and coarse the food/prey before swallowing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The teeth also help in preventing the prey from slipping away during feeding.</li>
<li>Some lizard species use their teeth to cut prey into small sizes that would facilitate easier swallowing.
Normally, Lizards dont chew their food; instead, they swallow in bits.
<strong>2. For Protection/Defense.</strong>
Lizards use their teeth for defense in case of danger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Veterinary examination shows that young lizards make rapid snaps when agitated or stressed as they try to bite while large adult lizards make deep cut when biting and use their tails to knock off their enemy.
<strong>3. Aid in Mating.</strong>
During the copulation period, male lizards latch on the female. It bites the females back, head, or neck to gain the ample stability needed during mating.</p>
<p>The Iguana lizards are more aggressive as compared to other species since the female produces pheromones during the menstrual cycle that attracts the male often.</p>
<h2 id="do-baby-lizards-have-teeth">Do Baby Lizards Have Teeth?</h2>
<p>Yes! Young lizards are hatched with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-lizards-eat/">teeth in place for eating</a>
. As the lizard grows and near maturity, the teeth increase in number. The Pleurodont class of lizards is able to shed off and replace their teeth regularly up to 6 times a year.</p>
<p>Contrary, the acrodont class of lizards do not replace their teeth once they are shed off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, special care should be taken (by owners) when handling these species of lizards.</li>
<li>The teeth of baby lizards are adapted to feeding on soft food substances.
Though they can grasp, the teeth are usually not strong enough to cause any substantial resistance against their prey. So, most of the young lizards are fed by their mothers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-lizard-bite-human-being">Can Lizard Bite Human Being?</h2>
<p>Lizards, usually, will bite you if they feel threatened or when they are stressed. Some of these bites are not injurious (are harmless) while some
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizards are poisonous</a>
and may infect you, your humans, and pets badly.</p>
<p>Iguanas, Monitor lizards, and Nile monitors are some of the lizards that are rampant in biting when threatened or stressed.</p>
<p>Normally, Lizards dont attack human beings. They live a cohesive and associative life with the human being thus becoming a nice pet to have.</p>
<p>However, research shows that lizards at times rebel, a special class of people such as veterinarians, when undergoing medical checkups  they try to defend themselves by biting back.</p>
<p>In case a lizard bites you, it is necessary to seek medical attention from the hospital.</p>
<p>However, most of the bits from house lizards (Geckos) are mild scraps that can be attended at home using a home fast aid kit.</p>
<p>NB:
<em>It is advisable to wear protective gear always when handling lizards during medications and physical checkups. Related: Are Leopard Geckos Nocturnal?</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All lizards have teeth. The teeth of young lizards increase in number as they grow to their adulthood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Importantly, lizards have either acrodont or pleurodont type of teeth that are well adapted to feeding, mating, or defense.</li>
<li>Lizards rarely bite human beings. Their bites are usually harmless though there are few species that have venom that may cause infections.
Lizards are generally harmless thus can be nice pets if taken care of well.</li>

      <title>Do Moles Have Eyes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/do-moles-have-eyes/</link>

      <description>From an outward look, moles appear not to have eyes! But how do they manage to dig tunnels and destroy our gardens?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From an outward look, moles appear not to have eyes! But how do they manage to dig tunnels and destroy our gardens?</p>
<p>Moles will do anything that is done by animals that have eyes. They dig tunnels, move around, look for food, mate and also evade enemies. But do they have eyes?
<strong>Short answer is YES  Moles have eyes which are covered by a fur and a thin membrane. These eyes cant see things but can differentiate light and dark. Their eyes help them in knowing time periods and seasons of the year.�</strong></p>
<p>Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-mole-traps/">Best Mole Traps</a></p>
<h2 id="details-do-moles-have-eyescan-moles-see">**Details: Do Moles Have Eyes?�**Can Moles See?</h2>
<p>Moles have eyes which are permanently covered by skin and fur. However, the fact that they shy away from bright light means that their eyes are capable detecting light.</p>
<p>Even without eyes, moles continue to wreak havoc in our beautiful lawns and gardens. Lets see how they manage to do that!</p>
<p>When you dig out their tunnels, you expose moles to bright light. In response to this, moles will always seal the exposed tunnels to block light rays.</p>
<p>Notably, moles follow a regular routine from morning to evening. That means they know the time of the day. They wake early in the morning, rest at midday and get back to work at dusk before going to bed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVQrtnb8xn8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVQrtnb8xn8</a></p>
<p>Researchers say that such a controlled routine is made possible by their eyes.�Furthermore, their eyes help in knowing the time of the year. Thats why they only come out during spring in search of mates.</p>
<p>A typical research done on Iberian moles shows that although their eyes are completely closed, they possess structures similar to those of diurnal animals. These structures connect factually to the brain and help moles in detecting and avoiding light.</p>
<p>Research on the nature of moles eyes also focuses on the possibility of degeneration due to disuse. Therere assumptions of gradual loss in eyesight for animals living in dark places due to evolution. However, moles eyes have retained their function and do not exhibit any signs of becoming dysfunctional due to evolution.</p>
<h2 id="can-moles-see"><strong>Can Moles See?</strong></h2>
<p>Moles arent completely blind. They have eyes which are covered by a thin skin and fur to shield them from dirt.</p>
<p>Their retinal cells are also fully developed to enable light recognition. They can also see movements and shadows. However, they cant see clearly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dRGvmLGa2I&amp;t=95s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dRGvmLGa2I&amp;t=95s</a></p>
<h2 id="how-do-moles-find-their-way"><strong>How Do Moles Find Their Way?</strong></h2>
<p>Although moles cant see images, they have adapted ways of finding their way inside their tunnels and when they come above the ground.</p>
<p>Perhaps their most important part for navigation is their nose. Their protruding noses possess touch receptors known as Eimer organs.</p>
<p>They find their way by touching the ground with their nose. These touch receptors have the ability to recognize objects and boundaries enabling moles to move in the dark.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-moles-communicate"><strong>How Do Moles Communicate?</strong></h2>
<p>Just like other animals moles are able to communicate especially during mating. How they do this without functional eyes isnt a mystery!</p>
<p>They are highly adapted to vibrations and sound. They can produce and hear high-pitched sounds.</p>
<p>Moles can also use their scents to communicate with mates and identify food. They release powerful scents which can be easily picked their mates. These odors are quite disgusting to humans especially during mating.</p>
<h2 id="do-moles-see-their-prey"><strong>Do Moles See Their Prey?</strong></h2>
<p>Moles dont use their eyes to locate their food. They use their nostrils to locate foods such as earthworms, snails, spiders, centipedes among other small insects.</p>
<p>Research has shown that moles are some of the few mammals that can smell in stereo.�Their nostrils can detect odors independently.</p>
<p>Different signals are sent to the brain, making it possible to discern the direction of the smell. Thus, they have the ability to differentiate food from other things by picking up the intensity of smell.</p>
<h2 id="do-moles-see-predators"><strong>Do Moles See Predators?</strong></h2>
<p>Although moles spend most of their time in their underground tunnels, they come out to look for mates especially during spring.</p>
<p>This makes them vulnerable to predators such as cats, dogs and birds of prey. However, they also have ways of evading predators.�Since they have a poor eyesight, they wont see predators.</p>
<p>However, their stereo sense of smell (both nostrils sniff independently) allows them to detect potential predators and retreat to their tunnels. With one sniff, a mole is able to tell there is a cat around. In fact, pouring soiled cat litter into holes made by moles can repel them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Moles have eyes but they are not used for seeing things. They are however able to differentiate light and dark as portrayed by their tendency to avoid light.</p>
<p>Lack of functional eyes doesnt prevent them from surviving in their environment.�They compensate for the poor eyesight with a powerful sense of touch on their nose.</p>
<p>In addition they have a powerful stereo sense of smell. These two qualities allow them to navigate in their tunnels, locate food, mate and evade predators.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you tired of swatting away pesky mosquitoes
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/when-do-mosquitoes-come-out/">every time you step outside</a>
? Do <a href="/posts/best-mosquito-killer/">mosquito</a> bites ruin your outdoor enjoyment?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a solution following the<a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents">EPA and CDC guideline</a>s, you might have come across the idea of using mosquito-repellent bracelets. These wearable devices claim to keep those blood-sucking insects at bay, but do mosquito bracelets actually work?
In this post, we&rsquo;ll dive into the science behind mosquito repellent bracelets, explore their effectiveness, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.
<strong>Understanding Mosquito Bracelets: The Research Behind Them</strong>
You&rsquo;re not alone in wondering whether mosquito bracelets are a legitimate solution or just another marketing gimmick. Numerous studies and experts have examined the effectiveness of these wearable repellents.</li>
<li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides valuable insights intomosquito-borne diseasesand prevention methods. However, let&rsquo;s explore the question you&rsquo;re asking: do mosquito bracelets actually work?
<strong>The Answer: Yes, But with Limitations</strong>
In short, yes, mosquito repellent bracelets can offer some level of protection against mosquito bites. These bracelets typically contain ingredients like citronella, lemongrass, or DEET, which are known for their mosquito-repelling properties.
However, it&rsquo;s important to note that the level of protection they offer might not be as comprehensive as other methods such as traditional insect repellent sprays or mosquito nets.
<strong>Explaining the Answer</strong>
An average mosquito repellent bracelet contains natural ingredients that mosquitoes find unpleasant. When worn on your wrist or ankle, the bracelet emits a scent that is designed to repel mosquitoes.
While this can create a &ldquo;mosquito-free zone&rdquo; around the wearer, the effectiveness depends on factors such as the type of ingredients used, the concentration of those ingredients, and even the individual&rsquo;s body chemistry.
<strong>Pros and Cons of Mosquito Bracelets</strong>
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the pros and cons of using mosquito-repellent bracelets:
<strong>Pros:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>**Convenience:**Bracelets are easy to wear and require no skin application, which can be preferable for individuals with sensitive skin.</li>
<li>**Portability:**You can wear mosquito bracelets anywhere, making them ideal for outdoor activities like camping, hiking, or gardening.</li>
<li>**DEET-Free Options:**Many mosquito bracelets use natural ingredients, offering an alternative for those who prefer to<a href="https://draxe.com/health/deet/">avoid DEET-based products</a>.
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>**Limited Protection:**Bracelets might not provide complete protection, especially in areas with high mosquito populations.</li>
<li>**Varying Effectiveness:**The effectiveness of mosquito bracelets can vary based on the specific brand and ingredients used. But essential oils are<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/essential-oils-terrible-bug-repellents/">not very effective</a>in repelling insects.</li>
<li>**Short Duration:**Some bracelets&rsquo; effectiveness diminishes after a few hours, requiring frequent replacement.
<strong>Tips for Using Mosquito Bracelets Effectively</strong></li>
<li>**Choose Reputable Brands:**Opt for mosquito bracelets from trusted brands that use scientifically tested ingredients.</li>
<li>**Use Additional Protection:**While using mosquito bracelets, consider wearing long sleeves, and pants, and using other repellents for added protection.</li>
<li>**Replace as Needed:**If the effectiveness of the bracelet wanes, replace it with a fresh one to maintain protection.
<strong>The Science Behind Repellent Ingredients</strong>
Understanding the active ingredients in mosquito repellent bracelets can shed light on their effectiveness.
Substances like citronella and DEET work by masking the scents that attract mosquitoes.
Citronella, a natural oil derived from lemongrass, creates an odor that repels mosquitoes. DEET, a synthetic chemical, interferes with the insects&rsquo;
<a href="https://www.readersdigest.ca/travel/travel-tips/how-do-mosquito-repellents-work/">ability to detect carbon dioxide</a>
and human sweat, making it harder for them to locate their human targets.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="popular-mosquito-repellent-bracelet-brands"><strong>Popular Mosquito-Repellent Bracelet Brands</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to mosquito-repellent bracelets, a variety of brands have entered the market, each offering a unique approach to repelling these pesky insects. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at some of the well-known options available:</p>
<h3 id="1-repelwatch---a-natural-aroma-shield"><strong>1. RepelWatch - A Natural Aroma Shield</strong></h3>
<p>RepelWatch stands out as an innovative brand that focuses on harnessing the power of natural essential oils to create effective mosquito-repellent bracelets.</p>
<ul>
<li>These bracelets are designed to emit a blend of scents that mosquitoes find repulsive, making them less likely to linger around wearers.
The blend often includes ingredients like citronella, lemongrass, and eucalyptus. Citronella, in particular, is renowned for its ability to deter mosquitoes with its distinct aroma.</li>
<li>RepelWatch bracelets offer users a convenient way to enjoy the outdoors without constantly swatting away these unwanted visitors.
The science behind RepelWatch&rsquo;s approach lies in the understanding of how mosquitoes locate their prey. By emitting scents that disrupt the mosquitoes&rsquo; ability to detect human odors, these bracelets create a protective barrier around the wearer. While the level of protection might not be absolute, RepelWatch provides an additional tool in the fight against mosquito bites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-para"><strong>2. Para&rsquo;Kito Wristbands - Infused Pellets for Prolonged Defense</strong></h3>

This can be especially valuable for parents seeking effective mosquito protection for their children without the need for constant reapplication.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="addressing-common-questions"><strong>Addressing Common Questions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q1: Are mosquito bracelets safe for children and pets?</strong>
Many mosquito bracelets are designed to be safe for children and pets, as they avoid the direct application of
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/skin-applied-repellent-ingredients">chemicals to the skin</a>

      <description>Opossums go through garbage,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opossums go through garbage,
hunt mice and snakes
, and hang around roadkill - which exposes them to dangerous diseases like rabies.</p>
<p>So, the question is: do opossums <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-carry-ticks/">carry</a> rabies?
<strong>In brief, NO, Opossum/ possums are very unlikely to carry rabies. Opossums&rsquo; body temperature is too low to inhibit the rabies virus compared to other wildlife like foxes, skunks, raccoons, and bats.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Opossums Cages&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="cold-body-temperature---do-opossums-carry-rabies">Cold Body Temperature - Do Opossums Carry Rabies</h2>
<p>The opossum is just one of the many animals that are immune to rabies.</p>
<p>Opossums have a body temperature about as cold as ice, which helps them avoid the diseases even when they consume infected food or water sources.</p>
<p>Their immunity isn&rsquo;t a result of their cool blood; it&rsquo;s because their bodies produce antibodies around the clock, day in and day out, against almost every virus you can think up - including rabies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums also heal fast from wounds due to bacteria-fighting cells called macrophages on top of those constant antibody production levels protecting their huge stomach lining.
Opossums have a low body temperature level which scientists believe may hold clues to the animals extraordinary resistance to rabies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only once in a blue moon does an opossum carry rabies (it&rsquo;s more than likely just regular old flu). The threat of leptospirosis, caused by bacteria, is much more common in Opossums.</p>
<p>Opossums are known carriers of leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that can be transmitted via contact with the animals feces and urine in the soil.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums aren&rsquo;t necessarily known for their hygiene - and so as they drive into the trash, they may get those parasites causing diseases like leptospirosis.
Many of these parasites cause bites and nips on the human ankles and feet.</li>
<li>Further, opossums won&rsquo;t carry or contract Lyme Illness despite carrying ticks.
If you are concerned about your pets and family members contracting the leptospirosis bacteria from an opossum excreting, there are some preventative measures that could help.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-a-rabid-opossum-do">What does a rabid opossum do?</h2>
<p>Rabies is comparably rare in opossums because of their cooler body temperature. But, can possums be rabid?</p>
<p>Well, Yes, the Center for Disease Control notes that Rabid opossums show symptoms such as reduced appetite, lethargy, vomiting, fever, and seizures.</p>
<p>Signs of rabies progress in the rabid opossum condition include excessive salivation, self-mutilation, aggression, abnormal behavior, challenges in swallowing &amp; breathing, paralysis, weakness, cerebral dysfunction, &amp; cranial nerve dysfunction.</p>
<h2 id="does-hissing-in-opossum-signify-being-rabid">Does Hissing in Opossum Signify Being Rabid?</h2>
<p>Hissing in opossums is not an indicator of being rabid. The sound the animals make can be triggered by a number of reasons, such as when they are mating or fighting with each other.</p>
<p>It also occurs when they get startled and have been known to hiss because their fur is caught on something like branches from trees that humans disturbed while passing through their territory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums may hiss if they feel threatened when cornered. They won&rsquo;t always do this unless they are frightened, but it is a defense tactic to scare away other animals.</li>
<li>To scare predators, the opossums can also produce some repugnant smell, growl, bare their teeth, and hiss - and so these not signs of being rabid.
If you have a problem with opossums, call your exterminator for help. They will come for an inspection and possible safe removal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="do-opossums-bite">Do Opossums Bite?</h2>
<p>Typically, opossums may bite when threatened or cornered. They might also bare their teeth in a threat display or hiss as well.</p>
<p>However, opossums may equally act dead and do not move when threatened.</p>
<p>Opossums may also bite if they are injured or struggling to get free from being captured in a person&rsquo;s hands, but this is relatively rare.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do Opossum have teeth? Yes, most often small incisors that grow throughout their life and wear down as the animal ages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can use these teeth for chewing food or defending themselves with a quick nip at an intruder who is getting too close.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, hissing is another defensive behavior that may be exhibited when an opossum is threatened.</p>
<p>It is rare for opossums to bite humans, but it can happen. So people should stay away from wild animals in the wilderness if they are not vaccinated against rabies or other diseases.</p>
<h2 id="which-diseases-do-opossums-carry">Which Diseases Do Opossums Carry?</h2>
<p>Opossums carry a relatively low risk of carrying rabies but they may have
<strong>dangerous pathogen and germs</strong>
that&rsquo;ll lead to illnesses like leptospirosis.</p>
<p>Leptospirosis causes flu-like symptoms and is caused by bacteria in contaminated bodily fluids and urine from infected Opossum.</p>
<p>The disease may infect rodents,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-squirrels-live/">squirrels</a>
, skunks, and raccoons but fail to show outright signs.</p>
<p>The disease can be passed on to humans through contact with infected animal&rsquo;s urine or by breathing in infectious droplets from an animal sneezing or coughing nearby.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent this illness from happening by wearing gloves when handling possums, keeping your yard clean of trash where they may live (build a fence if necessary)
Humans who contract Leptospirosis may fail to show
<strong>symptoms</strong>
for weeks or months and they may include fever, headache, chills, muscle aches.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid leptospirosis - especially from wild animals, stay away from places that may be contaminated with wildlife urine or water sources like swamps, rivers, and lakes.</p>

<h2 id="dont-let-opossums-into-your-yard">Don&rsquo;t let Opossums into Your Yard</h2>
<p>Without proper understanding and preparation, Opossums can pose a risk to domestic pets in your area.</p>
<p>Opossums require time and a place to warm up, so they are not likely to enter your yard during the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>They feed on fruits, snakes, vegetables, mice, nuts, and insects; however, their diet can be broadened by scavenging for any edible material such as garbage or pet food left outside.
Opossums are one of the few animals that can&rsquo;t get rabies but they can carry other diseases such as the plague, roundworm, and leptospirosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The animal&rsquo;s droppings could contaminate your yard with E-coli or salmonella.</p>
<p>Opossums can also cause a nuisance by attempting to get into trash cans, dog houses, or any small spaces where they would feel safe from predators.</p>
<h2 id="the-shy-and-reserved-opossums">The Shy and Reserved Opossums</h2>
<p>Possums are typically docile, so you can deal with them gently by nudging them away. You can also go towards them and speak in a slow, gentle voice to convince them that you are not any kind of threat.</p>
<ul>
<li>If they do not move after these actions then try scooping him up by placing your hands under their stomach and lifting upwards slowly.
If the possum still does not want to leave, or if there is more than one present, you will have to use a little bit of force on the animal so he knows who&rsquo;s boss!</li>
</ul>
<p>Opossums are often misidentified as rabies carriers because of their strange drool and hissing habits - but they use these for their defense.</p>
<p>The opossum primarily resides in one location for a short period of time, six months typically; they&rsquo;re transient animals - they&rsquo;re introverted and reclusive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums are very protective of their dens and move often if their homes are disturbed.
Opossums will contract or spread disease when they feast on dead animals. Even if the disease doesnt transmit to the opossum, there are risks of acquiring diseases from eating rotting flesh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Opossums are shy and reserved animals that tend to spend the majority of their time inside of their burrows, only coming out when its dark and no one will see them. This naturally prevents them from contracting various illnesses.</p>
<p>Opossums are fascinating, but they&rsquo;re fearsome predators too. Read more to find out how opossums use their special defense mechanisms against predators while conserving energy and remaining healthy themselves!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in conclusion, do opossums carry rabies? No, they do not; thanks to their colder bodies that inhibit the rabies virus.</p>
<p>But opossums will carry other diseases such as leptospirosis that can spread to humans, so it&rsquo;s always important to observe caution when you are around them.</p>
<p>Wild animals that&rsquo;ll carry rabies include raccoons, foxes, and skunks.</p>
<p>As you can see, opossums do not carry rabies!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that possums eat cats is largely a misconception. Possums, being opportunistic omnivores and scavengers, primarily feed on fruits, insects, and small animals like rodents.</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not actively hunt cats, and while they might scavenge the remains of a deceased cat, they do not pose a direct threat to living, healthy ones.
Possums are more likely to compete with cats for food than to attack them. This article explores <a href="/posts/do-possums-eat-chickens/">possum</a> behavior, their dietary preferences, and the nature of their interactions with domestic cats, offering reassurance to pet owners and tips to prevent unwanted encounters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possum-diet-what-do-they-eat">Possum Diet: What Do They <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a>?</h2>
<p>Possums are omnivores, which means they eat a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-opossums-eat/">variety of plant and animal matter</a>
. Their diet is highly opportunistic, often dictated by what is easily available in their environment. In the wild, possums typically consume:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fruits and berries</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insects and small invertebrates</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rodents and small birds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Carrion (dead animals)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vegetables and grains</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eggs but not chicken</strong></li>
<li><strong>Small reptiles and amphibians</strong>
In urban areas, possums may forage through garbage cans and eat pet food that is left outside. They are scavengers by nature, which means they are more likely to feed on what they can find rather than actively hunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to understanding their dietary habits is that possums are not hunters in the traditional sense. Instead, they forage and will eat whatever is most accessible and easy to catch or find, including plant material, insects, and small animals.</p>
<h2 id="possums-and-cats-understanding-the-interaction">Possums and Cats: Understanding the Interaction</h2>
<p>The idea that possums eat cats is largely a myth. Cats are much larger than most of the typical prey items that possums eat. In fact, adult cats are far too big and capable of defending themselves, making them an unlikely target for a possums diet.</p>
<p>While possums may be opportunistic eaters, they do not have the predatory skills or desire to hunt down a living, healthy cat.</p>
<dl>
<dt>There are, however, a few scenarios where a possum and a cat might interact:</dt>
<dt><strong>1. Competition for Food</strong></dt>
<dd>If a possum and a cat are both foraging in the same area, such as near an outdoor food dish, they may compete for resources. Possums may try to eat leftover cat food, but this does not indicate predation. The possum is simply scavenging what it can find.
<strong>2. Scavenging Behavior</strong></dd>
<dd>In very rare cases, a possum may be found eating a deceased cat. However, it is important to stress that this does not mean the possum killed the cat. As scavengers, possums will eat carrion, and if they come across a dead animal, including a cat, they may consume it.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>This can lead to the misconception that possums hunt cats, but they are merely feeding on an already deceased animal.Possums live an average of 1 to 2 years but<a href="https://opossumsocietyus.org/general-opossum-information/">can do up to 4 years</a>, but don&rsquo;t kill them - mainly when you see their destructive habits.</li>

<strong>3. Defensive Reactions</strong>
: If a cat and possum were to get into a confrontation, the possums instinct would not be to attack but to defend itself. Possums often employ a defense mechanism known as &ldquo;playing possum,&rdquo; where they feign death to avoid aggression from predators. In some cases, if a possum feels cornered, it may hiss, growl, or show its sharp teeth to scare off a potential threat, but it would not go on the offensive unless absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-possums-arent-a-threat-to-cats">Why Possums Aren&rsquo;t a Threat to Cats</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why possums dont pose a significant threat to cats:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Size and Strength</strong>: Adult cats are generally larger, faster, and stronger than possums. In a physical altercation, a healthy cat would likely come out on top, or at the very least, would be able to escape without serious injury.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Differences</strong>: Cats are predators by nature and tend to be territorial. On the other hand, possums are scavengers and generally prefer to avoid confrontation with larger animals. When faced with a cat, a possum is more likely to flee or try to scare the cat away rather than attack.</li>
<li><strong>Dietary Preferences</strong>: Possums have no real interest in hunting down and consuming large animals like cats. Their natural diet consists of smaller prey and scavenged food. While they may consume carrion if they find it, this is far different from actively seeking out and killing a cat for food.

</ol>
<h2 id="what-should-pet-owners-do">What Should Pet Owners Do?</h2>
<p>While possums dont pose a direct threat to cats, pet owners may still want to take precautions to minimize interactions between the two animals. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep Pet Food Indoors</strong>: Avoid leaving pet food outside, especially overnight, as it can attract possums and other wildlife.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Garbage Cans</strong>: Since possums are scavengers, they may try to get into unsecured garbage cans. Keeping lids tightly closed will discourage them from foraging in your yard.</li>
<li><strong>Supervise Pets Outdoors</strong>: While possums arent likely to harm your cat, its always a good idea to supervise your pets when theyre outdoors, especially at night when possums are most active.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Attractants</strong>: Possums are drawn to food sources, so removing things like fallen fruit, bird feeders, and compost piles can help prevent them from frequenting your property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the notion that possums eat cats is largely unfounded. While possums are opportunistic feeders and scavengers, their natural diet does not include live, healthy cats.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are more likely to forage for fruits, insects, and small animals or scavenge for dead animals. Interactions between possums and cats are usually driven by competition for food rather than predation.
Pet owners can reduce the likelihood of encounters by taking simple precautions, but overall, possums are not a significant threat to household pets.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe some chicken (plus chicks) and their eggs have recently disappeared from their coop. Recently, there have been some native opossums
*(Didelphis Virginiana) and dead chickens *
around - well, these are scavengers.
So, you&rsquo;re wondering really &lsquo;do possums eat chickens?&rsquo; Well, Yes, possums will scavenger and eat chickens (including fully-grown hens) and other easy food sources like chicks and eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The adult <a href="/posts/do-possums-eat-cats/">possum</a> weighs 4 to 15 lb and measures about 21 to 36 inches in length - about the size of your house-cat. They have 50 pointed and sharp teeth with a white mouth (&amp; face) with grey or white fur.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll also notice that they have a hairless tail, black eyes, and pink nose, and pointed faces.
To repel the possums, you may position ammonia-coaked rags near the chikcen coop or spray any of these rodent repellents&hellip;</li>

<h2 id="do-opossums-or-possums-eat-chickens">Do Opossums or Possums <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">Eat</a> Chickens?</h2>
<p>As noted above, possums and opossums will attack and eat your chickens. So, YES, simply put, possums will eat chickens. Their strong teeth enable them to tear down prey&rsquo;s bones and flesh - including from dead animals and chickens.</p>
<ul>
<li>While uncommon, possumslike raccoons will eat mature hens(about 20 in a night since they are large &amp; intimidating) but may regularly prey on chicken eggs and their young chicks.
The omnivore animals largely eat and prey on small invertebrates - but if they are occupying the backyard gardens, the possums could hunt your chickens and eggs too -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-possums-eat-cats/">but the possums won&rsquo;t eat the cats</a>
or dogs.

<h2 id="do-possums-steal-and-eat-chicken-eggs">Do Possums Steal and Eat Chicken Eggs?</h2>
<p>Ye
s, possums that will manage to sneak into the chicken coop will (or come across eggs) will eat the chicken eggs - but they&rsquo;ll also prey on adult chickens.</p>
<ul>
<li>My experience: One night I met a large possum in the chicken coop around the bird&rsquo;s nesting boxes.</li>
<li>We noted that the possum had returned and stolen eggs - we also found some of the eggs busted.
But will the possums eat raw eggs? Yes, they&rsquo;ll feed on raw eggs in addition to other foods like
protein dog kibble,
minced veggies,
calcium vegetables, chicken crockpot, and bones.
Also, what smells do the possum hate? Well, these animals won&rsquo;t love
ammonia - so I would recommend you pour some ammonia into that coffee container.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-stop-possums-from-killing-my-chicken">How to Stop Possums from Killing My Chicken?</h3>
<p><strong>1. Remove chicken or pet food�</strong>
Avoid leaving chicken or pet food lying around overnight. Such idle foods tend to attract the possums.</p>
<p>Put the chicken or pet food in some metallic (and air-tight ) containers - this will prevent the mother possum from nesting around and rearing their babies.</p>
<p>The possums and their younglings will eventually take over your spaces - and this will endanger you5r chicken as the adult possums will think that the food belongs to their babies.
<strong>2. Line the Chicken coop with 10-inch tin�</strong>
Line the chicken coop with some 10-inches tin to bar possums eating up the wood-� they won&rsquo;t attack the chicken easily.</p>
<p>So, lining up the chicken structures with tin inside and outside - this is because the possums won&rsquo;t chew on the tin.
<strong>3. Don&rsquo;t Leave Chicken Eggs overnight</strong>
Next, I caution against leaving the chicken eggs overnight in that coop.</p>
<p>This is because the scent of the egg
will attract predators including raccoon&rsquo;s
, skunks, and possums.
<strong>4. Place Mothballs and Ammonia�</strong>
Next, position some mothballs and ammonia (odour or stink) as these will help remove the possum from its hiding area.</p>
<p>So, pour the ammonia onto some coffee container and place a wick (towel or rag) that&rsquo;ll help disperse the stinking fumes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check locations that look like possum shelters and place the mothballs or ammonia
<strong>5. Pour Wolf or Fox Urine repel possums�</strong>
Skunks, raccoons, and possums won&rsquo;t get near that chicken coop or nearby hiding areas that have wolf or fox urine.</li>
<li>You may also use the fox-urine granules (Shake-Away) by the brand name as they&rsquo;ll repel and scare off the rodents and possums.
Besides, you may use human urine to repel the possums around the
garden or yard. Notably, the fresh urine will be bacteria-free and clean.
<strong>6. Set Possum Traps</strong>
Possum traps will also be a great addition to the feature in reducing chicken death and disappearance. Set up this device on areas you suspect possum frequent.</li>
<li>Some baits suitable for the possum trap includeapples, peanut butter, vegetables, berries, and fruit.
But remove these traps around the morning time to prevent catching other small pets or even your chickens.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcqgdEfsyQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcqgdEfsyQ</a>
<strong>7. Fencing�</strong>
Fencing around that yard or garden will also hinder possums from reaching your chicken.</li>
<li>Definitely, their strong teeth won&rsquo;t tear down that fence - but avoid chicken wires as they&rsquo;re too weak.
Further, don&rsquo;t allow drinkable water around your garden or yard as this will attract possums that may attack your chicken.</li>
<li>The chicken will be very vulnerable during the dark hours - while also the possums will also be active at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, do possums eat chickens? YES, possums will occasionally hunt and seat chickens in the backyard.</p>
<ul>
<li>But they&rsquo;ll more probably eat chicks, Bantams (small breeds), and eggs.</li>
</ul>

that are believed to have strong feelings and emotions towards human beings and other animals. Could be you have seen varying behavioral <a href="/posts/best-drain-snakes/">snake</a> reactions in your place or cage. Do they feel or react out of emotions like human beings do?
**Well, the question here is, Do Snakes Have Feelings? The direct answer is YES! Snakes have feelings (just like other reptiles) that generate varying emotional reaction. **
<strong>Snake can feel hungry, it can get angered (sad), it can generate fear, it can be happy or respond to touch. The response to these feelings may be more aggressive or calm according to the type snake you are dealing with.</strong>

[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Cages for Snakes&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-do-snakes-have-feelings">Details: Do Snakes Have Feelings?</h2>
<p>Various scientific researchers have proven that snake have feelings. The can show hunger, anger, happiness, fear or respond to touch. However, most snakes show varying emotional reactions towards some of these feelings.</p>
<h3 id="1-anger-feelings"><strong>1. Anger feelings</strong></h3>
<p>Often, most snakes when angered, they react by biting. They would rebel their enemies by threatening to bite them or spiting their poisonous/venomous saliva. �This defensive reaction is brought by sadness feelings that has materialized/accumulated in them.</p>
<p>Snakes generate anger because of life stresses, hunger and reproduction occurrences. When each of these causes of anger materializes, they make snakes to respond with mixed negative reactions that may harm other snakes, pets or humans.</p>
<p>Importantly, the snake that has anger feelings usually shows calmness, does not seem to move about, frequently , turn its eyes from its hideout, raises it head and back (python) or pushes its tongue back and forth severally.</p>
<p>Angered snake will suddenly attack you on approach and retreat or escape.</p>
<h3 id="2-hunger-feelings"><strong>2. Hunger Feelings.</strong></h3>
<p>Snakes shows the hunger feelings by flicking out their tongues regularly. They will keep moving about in their cage (possibly looking for food). Normally, snakes will tend to be rebellious and angry when hungry. When hungry, snakes will tend to resist their owner and even attack any visitor in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Contrary, snakes that are fully fed remain calm. They do not move about in their cage a lot (though some may move to stretch their bodies and bask under the sun). Snakes in full stomach tend to be friendlier to the owner and visitors too.</p>
<h3 id="3-fear">3. Fear</h3>
<p>Snakes often generate fear. Mostly, fear glows when snakes detect attack from its assailant. The reaction may be by attacking the enemy (using its venom) or escaping by lateral undulation.</p>
<p>The snake is believed to have senses that enables them to detect any attack (this is pronounced in the black mamba species). It will often notice you before reach to kill it.</p>
<p>Snakes use their thermal vision, color and smell to located their enemies and prey.</p>
<h3 id="4-touch-feeling-response"><strong>4. Touch Feeling Response.</strong></h3>
<p>Most Snake negatively if you try to reach and pick them by hands. Some snake like anaconda or python will bite you on touch.</p>
<p>All snake species respond immediately to touch. These cold-blooded reptiles will detect your touch instantly using thermal receptors in their skin.</p>
<p>Though snakes can be held by hands after training/bonding, most of them are not comfortable (they tend to coil out of your hands once held).</p>
<h2 id="can-snakes-feel-love">Can Snakes Feel Love?</h2>
<p>No! Unlike human beings, snakes do not have any intellectual capacity and capability to feel love or get affectionate. Snakes can get friendly with the owner, but they may not generate any love feelings towards him/her.</p>
<p>Normally, the snake feels the connective care of a creature (owner) that is not threatening and that which will offer care. Snake owners tend to think that snakes are affectionate when they coil around them  this is usually not the truth, snakes have no capability. The love instinct, which is emotionally connected, does not exists in snakes at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, snakes do not show love to other pets either. The relationship between snakes and their mates doesnt last for long after reproduction activity is done  this tells why snake can mate anywhere it meets the female.</p>
<h2 id="can-snake-be-petted">Can Snake be Petted?</h2>
<p>You can pet a snake. This may not be that easy at first. However, snakes will get free when they realize that you are not a threat or source of food. As the owner, you must maintain a continuous care for your snakes to create that close bond with them.</p>
<p>Importantly, you must involve a vet for regular check on it emotional reactions, the venomous content and level of human-pet freedom gained.</p>
<p>Though you can pet snakes, it is not always assured that petted snakes will respond positively to you (owners) or other humans. You therefore need to check on the feelings and emotional conditions of your snakes before interacting with them.</p>
<h2 id="do-snakes-have-a-personality">Do Snakes Have A Personality?</h2>
<p>Scientific researches shows that snakes have a certain level of personalities that can be assigned to them. They are able to associate with human beings and shows clearly their preference. When a snake is not comfortable with a given condition or feed, it react differently.</p>
<p>You will find that various species of snakes live differently in their cage or nest  it is not possible for different snake species to live in the same cage (they may fight).</p>
<p>Snakes such as anaconda, black mamba and python are associated with strong personalities as compared to green snakes.</p>
<h2 id="can-snakes-be-friendly">Can Snakes be Friendly?</h2>
<p>Normally, snakes are known to be dangerous and venomous reptiles. Naturally, snakes are friendly to human  only that they feel threated in presence of humans who tend to kill them.</p>
<p>Snakes love to stay in homes than in forest or bushes. Research shows that many snakes have been found in bed sleeping next to human without harming them.</p>
<p>This shows that most snake are friendly if assured of their life security. The idea of training the snakes has even made snakes become friendlier with humans and pets without negative reactions.</p>
<p>King snake and ball pythons are the friendliest snakes for any beginners. Make sure you do not annoy the snake as it may turn aggressive.</p>
<h2 id="can-snake-be-tamed">Can Snake Be Tamed</h2>
<p>Unlike Dogs and cat, snakes cannot be tamed or domesticated to serve various activities in their cage. Even though they are partially friendly, they will remain and die as wild reptiles full of reactive feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>You cannot leave your kid with wild snakes such as boa, anaconda, python or black mamba  they may get violent kill the child.</p>
<p>There is no single successful snake taming that has been carried out in the universe  most attempt have only made snakes friendlier to human beings than before.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Snakes, like human beings, have feelings of anger/sadness, hunger, happiness, pain, fear and can response to touch. Snakes are not friendly to human at first and will react by defending themselves or escaping in case they spot you.</p>
<p>However, continuous bonding through feeding of snakes make them friendlier. It is important to note that snakes cannot be tamed and will remain wild throughout their life. You should therefore asses their feelings before attending them.</p>

      <title>Do Spiders Have Antennae</title>

      <description>Spiders are fascinating creatures, often mistaken for insects due to their small size and presence in many of the same environments.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders are fascinating creatures, often mistaken for insects due to their small size and presence in many of the same environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, their anatomy differs significantly, leading to some common misconceptions, particularly around whether spiders have antennae.
This article explores whether spiders have
<em><strong>antennae</strong></em>
, their unique sensory systems, and how they differ from other arthropods, particularly insects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-have-antennae">Do Spiders Have Antennae?</h2>
<p>The short answer is
<strong>no, spiders do not have antennae</strong>
. While spiders and insects are both arthropods, they belong to different classes: spiders are arachnids, and insects are classified as
<a href="http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/">hexapods</a>
. One key difference between these two groups is their body structure, including their sensory organs.</p>
<p>Antennae are absent in spiders. Instead, they have other sensory systems that help them navigate their environment and detect prey. These features work differently from insect antennae but serve similar functions.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-antennae-what-are-they">Understanding Antennae: What Are They?</h2>
<p>Antennae are sensory organs found in many arthropods, including insects and crustaceans. They play a crucial role in detecting chemical signals, vibrations, and environmental stimuli such as temperature and humidity. Insects rely on their antennae to navigate their surroundings, find food, communicate, and detect potential mates.</p>
<p>Antennae are typically long, segmented appendages located on the heads of insects. They come in various shapes and sizes depending on the species and serve functions like smelling, sensing air currents, or detecting vibrations. Given their importance to insect life, its natural to wonder if spiders share this feature.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-sensory-system-the-role-of-pedipalps-and-hair-like-structures">Spiders Sensory System: The Role of Pedipalps and Hair-like Structures</h2>
<p>Instead of antennae, spiders have evolved other sensory adaptations that help them perceive their surroundings and hunt effectively.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pedipalps</strong>: Located near a <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s mouth, pedipalps are small, leg-like appendages that play a significant role in sensing, manipulating prey, and in mating for males. Though not as long or prominent as insect <a href="/posts/do-fleas-have-antennae/">antennae</a>, pedipalps are highly sensitive and help spiders detect chemical signals, such as those from potential prey.</li>
<li><strong>Sensory Hairs (Setae)</strong>: Spiders are covered in tiny hairs called<em>setae</em>, which are highly sensitive to touch, air currents, and vibrations. These hairs allow spiders to detect even slight movements in their environment, helping them sense prey caught in their webs or an approaching predator.</li>
<li><strong>Trichobothria</strong>: Spiders have long, specialized hairs called trichobothria, which are exceptionally sensitive to vibrations in the air. These hairs help spiders detect the movement of nearby prey or predators, allowing them to react even when the source is not in direct contact.</li>
<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: While insects rely heavily on their antennae for sensory input, spiders often use their eyes to a greater degree. Most spiders have eight eyes, though the number and arrangement can vary by species. Some spiders, like jumping spiders, have excellent vision, which they use to hunt and ambush prey.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="differences-between-spiders-and-insects">Differences Between Spiders and Insects</h2>
<p>Though spiders and insects are both arthropods, there are significant anatomical and behavioral differences between them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Body Structure</strong>: Insects have three body segments (head, thorax, abdomen) and six legs, while spiders have two segments (<a href="https://bijlmakers.com/spiders/spider-bodyparts/#cephalothorax">cephalothorax</a>and abdomen) and eight legs.</li>
<li><strong>Sensory Organs</strong>: Insects have antennae that serve as primary sensory organs. Spiders lack antennae and instead use pedipalps, sensory hairs, and their keen eyesight for sensory input.</li>
<li><strong>Breathing Systems</strong>: Spiders breathe through structures called book lungs, while insects use a network of tubes called tracheae to transport oxygen.</li>
<li><strong>Life Cycle</strong>: Insects typically undergo metamorphosis, transitioning through stages such as egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Spiders do not undergo such transformations; they hatch as miniature versions of adults and grow through molting.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-spiders-navigate-without-antennae">How Spiders Navigate Without Antennae</h2>
<p>Despite lacking antennae, spiders are highly adept at navigating their environments. They rely on their pedipalps, sensory hairs, and excellent vision to hunt and detect threats. Web-building spiders, for instance, use vibrations in their webs to sense when prey has been caught.</p>
<p>For non-web-building spiders, like wolf spiders or jumping spiders, trichobothria and setae provide detailed information about their surroundings. These sensory adaptations allow them to hunt effectively, ambushing prey or avoiding predators.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, spiders do not have antennae like insects do. Instead, they rely on other sensory organs, such as pedipalps, sensory hairs, and eyes, to interact with their environment.</p>
<p>These adaptations allow spiders to hunt, detect threats, and navigate effectively without the need for antennae. Though spiders and insects share some similarities as arthropods, their anatomy and sensory systems differ significantly, making spiders unique and highly skilled predators in their ecosystems.</p>

      <title>Do Spiders Have Bones</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/do-spiders-have-bones/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/do-spiders-have-bones/</guid>
      <description>Your regular spiders are small-bodied insects. So, its not out of the ordinary to imagine how small their bones would be, if they have any at all.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your regular spiders are small-bodied insects. So, its not out of the ordinary to imagine how small their bones would be, if they have any at all.</p>
<p>In fact some bigger creatures like lobsters, crab, snails, worms and shrimps have no bones.
<em>So, do spiders have bones?</em>
<strong>Well, spiders don&rsquo;t have bones - and like other arthropods. However, they have an �endoskeleton plus an exoskeleton (external skeleton) that provides primary support for the arachnid&rsquo;s muscles. Its exoskeleton has cuticles plus joints on their surfaces to enable easy movement.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-bones-exoskeleton">Details: Do Spiders Have Bones?? Exoskeleton?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s cuticle is composed of 4 layers (like other arthropods) unlike insects that have 3 cuticle layers. However, the cuticles are all made off chitin fibers plus protein.
But, don&rsquo;t be mistaken, the spider still has a small internal skeleton - that&rsquo;s has, however, no bones in it.�The spider&rsquo;s endoskeleton has collagen and a couple of plates which won&rsquo;t articulate like bones do for the skeleton in vertebrates.
Compared to humans and other animal species -these ones have an endoskeleton that acts like a support structure that&rsquo;s created from bones.
The endoskeleton offers support to its organs like
lungs
,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-brains/">brain</a>
,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-hearts/">heart</a>
and maintain the animals size and shape.</p>
<h2 id="exoskeletons-offer-spiders-body-support">Exoskeletons offer Spiders Body Support</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, spiders have an exoskeleton as compared to having an internal skeleton created from bones. So, what&rsquo;s these exoskeletons and what makes it up?
The arthropod&rsquo;s exoskeleton is made from chitin- which covers its body outer surface to offer support, protection, and structure. Thus, the exoskeleton will be shed (through molting) as the spider grows and develops. So, below is a�tarantula shedding her exoskelton:�</p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-benefit-from-theexoskeletons">How Spiders Benefit from the�Exoskeletons</h2>
<p>Compared to endoskeletons, exoskeletons will provide more protection because it covers the whole spider&rsquo;s body while the bones would only be located internally.
Also, exoskeletons enable the spider&rsquo;s muscles to achieve more leverage for movement, lifting, or picking objects - this is better than in the animals with endoskeletons.
Therefore, the exoskeletons will give the spider more power and straight than other animals of the same size but having an endoskeletons.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-ears/">Do Spiders Have Ears?</a></p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-move">How Spiders Move</h2>
<p>The segments of the exoskeleton in the arthropod are joined using joints to allow it to move up and down. Therefore, the muscles that are attached to the exoskeleton tend to contract allowing the spider to move its legs inward.
However, the spider lacks muscles that would otherwise extend its legs back (outward) to their default position. Therefore, the creature use its blood and other bodily fluids to push the legs outward.
Whenever the spider loses excessive bodily fluid, it&rsquo;ll lack the required pressure (
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/hydraulic.htm">hydraulic)</a>
for moving its legs outwards. You&rsquo;ll notice the spider lying on its back and its legs in a curled up position.</p>
<h2 id="howspiders-molt">**How�****Spiders **<strong>Molt�</strong></h2>
<p>Spiders will move from one point to another through muscle contraction - these will be attached to the exoskeleton on the outer part of the arthropod.
The spider&rsquo;s exoskeleton is composed of different cuticle layers - that are made from chitin (polysaccharide) and
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/cell3.htm">proteins</a>
. This allows the cuticle structure to be layered like a
<a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question154.htm">plywood</a>
grain.
Therefore, the cuticle structure is very strong for protection while also preventing the spider from losing fluids excessively and drying out. This would in turn prevent effective movement in the arthropod.
But the cuticle won&rsquo;t grow like the human tissue or bones (endoskeleton) and thus it must be shed off as the spider continues to develop and grow. But spider molting mainly happen when the spider is in its younger years - but other may molt all its life.</p>
<ol>
<li>When time is ready, the spider&rsquo;s body (directed by its hormones) will absorb a part of its cuticle layer (particularly the lower layer) in its exoskeleton.</li>
<li>In addition, the spider&rsquo;s body will also start generating a new cuticle layer to create another exoskeleton. So, the emerging exoskeleton will be folded slightly to allow it to expand when the spider sheds off the old exoskeleton.</li>
<li>The spider will inject a molting fluid at the areas separating the new and old exoskeleton. The fluid allows easy separation of the two exoskeletons by create a gap between them.</li>
<li>Next, the spider bust out to shed its old exoskeleton. To achive this, the animals tend to raise the heart rate and thus pumping more blood (hemolymph) into its cephalothorax from their abdomen.</li>
<li>Therfeore the hemolymph&rsquo;s pressure forced the older exoskeleton to crack while the spider continues to flex their muscle to make its old exoskeleton to molt.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Invertebrates and vertebrates follow the Hallers Rule when considering the body size and brain comparison. For example, the ant&rsquo;s brain makes up 15% of its body mass. But, the difference is considerably bigger in spiders -m as outline din this
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467803911000727"><em>Arthropod Structure &amp; Development study</em></a>
.
Spiders are tiny arachnids that seem to be very intelligent for their small sized-body in web-weaving (some being even below 1 millimeter in body length). You can control them using
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-spider-spray-for-indoors/">spider sprays</a>
of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-spiders/">spider foggers</a>
.
<strong>But, do spiders have brains? Well, technically, spiders have no brains in the manner anatomy defines &ldquo;brains&rdquo;. However, the arachnids have neural/ nerve cell clusters filling up many spaces in the spider&rsquo;s cephalothorax. Notably, the&quot;brains&quot; of some spiders like Jumping spiders tend to extend down in their legs.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-brains">Details: Do Spiders Have Brains??</h2>
<p>It would require a big brain for the small spiders to have such magnificent web-weaving prowess and weave webs that are even bigger than the arachnids.
A recent
<a href="http://www.stri.si.edu/english/scientific_staff/staff_scientist/scientist.php?id=10">spider brain study</a>
by Bill Eberhard analyzed 9 species of spiders across 6 web-weaving groups. The outcomes of the study was that the spider&rsquo;s body was inversely proportional to its brain size. Thus, smaller spiders have relatively larger brains.</p>
<p>In addition, for various spiders, their central nervous system occupied about 80% of their body spaces - it may also fill up the arachnid&rsquo;s legs as shown below. Check
<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110603-spiders-spare-legs-webs-science-animals/">how spiders evolved its spare legs</a>
.</p>
<p>Further, the body of the spider, like
*Leucauge mariana, *
filled with its brain continue to grow and develop up to when it becomes an adult.
You&rsquo;ll notice that some of the immature and tiny spiders tend to have a bulging and deformed body due to having an excess spider brain.
However, the adult spiders won&rsquo;t have a bulge. This is because its brain cell will still remain relatively small. The brain cell will have nucleus containing all the genes of the spider - which occupy space.
Further, the axons and nerve fiber diameters can&rsquo;t be reduced - even for the young spiders, since if they&rsquo;re overly thin it&rsquo;ll affect the flow of ions carrying nerve signals. Therefore, additional space would be given to the spider&rsquo;s nervous system.</p>
<h2 id="too-much-spider-brain-for-a-small-body">Too Much Spider Brain for a Small Body?</h2>
<p>Definitely, you won&rsquo;t consider that the spider&rsquo;s brain tends to take up too much body space at the disadvantage of other of its organs. This aspect is yet to be examined scientifically.
However, by examining the spiders physically, you&rsquo;d notice that the animals are definitely making a trade off to have a big brain spread even all over its legs.
A example of this is the Phidippus clarus spider that has been seen to have its digestive system (particularly of the adult jumping spider) is positioned in the animal&rsquo;s cephalothorax (the body and head cavity).
However, for the baby Phidippus clarus, the cephalothorax is fully filled with the brain and thus the young one now tends to have its digestive system being less developed.

<h2 id="how-heavy-is-the-spiders-brain">How Heavy is the Spider&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brain&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>The Hallers rule states that as an animal&rsquo;s body size reduces, the more its proportion of its body taken by its body increases. For example, 2-3% of the human&rsquo;s body mass is composed of the brain.
Further, scientifically, the tiny animal brains take up 15% of the creatures biomass - however, some spiders tend to be much smaller comparatively.
However, brain cells also need high amounts of energy. Thus, the spiders will be converting most of the food they take up into brain power.
From a Costa Rica and Panama study on the spider&rsquo;s brain extension, researchers resolved that the Nephila clavipes had a weight that&rsquo;s a 400,000 multiple of� the small spiders.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-large-spider-brains-help-in-spinning-webs">How Do Large Spider Brains Help In Spinning Webs?</h2>
<p>Its a key presumption that spiders require a large brain to create to super complicated webs. This is relatively true to some extend but not for all the spider species.
For example, the kleptoparasitic spiders have eveolved and are unable to spin their webs and so they steal such webs from other spiders. However, these kleptoparasitic spiders do not have a smaller brain compared to other spiders.
On the other hand, the researcher noted that the spiders require to be smart to become stealthy and sneaky - and thus this shows why the kleptoparasitic and other stealing spiders have a big brain too just like the web-weaving spiders.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For along time, scientific evidence considered that spiders are dominated by touch and sight. But the characteristics of these arachnids can be both terrifying and impressive.</p>
<p>**So, do spiders have ears? Spiders don&rsquo;t have ears or eardrums but jumping spiders can hear **
**sounds even from 5 meters away. **
<strong>A recent�study show that spiders�have tiny sensitive hairs to detect sound.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-ears">Details: Do Spiders Have Ears?</h2>
<p>According to the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/13/spiders-dont-have-ears-but-they-can-still-hear-you-coming">Paul Shamble research</a>
, their study showed that spiders have acute hearing senses. These insects, despite lacking ears and eardrums, will hear sounds from far distances.
Definitely, the research notes that the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s eardrums are small but its sensitive leg hairs will help the insect to detect sounds. Current research shows spiders will hear humans clap and talk in 5 meters.

<h2 id="spiders-legs-are-sensitive-to-sound-waves">Spider&rsquo;s Legs Are Sensitive To Sound Waves</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">Past knowledge</a>
suggested that the hairs on the spiders legs are sensitive to sound waves plus other airborne vibrations - but they said this was limited to sounds only near the spider&rsquo;s body length.
Definitely, most researchers had not realized that the spiders would also interpret the sound waves to a neural activity - this implies that the arachnids could actually hear the sound waves not just sensing even when the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-sleep/">spiders are resting</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="deeper-recording-than-just-visual-information">Deeper Recording than Just Visual Information</h2>
<p>The study conducted on
<em>hidippus audax (jumping spiders)</em>
where the researcher were doing neural brains recordings for the spiders analyzing their processes of processing visual data.
However, Menda conducted an analysis deeper into the spider&rsquo;s brain as
<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/log/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">outlined in this study</a></p>
<ul>
<li>this was unlike their norm in the previous research on the spider&rsquo;s visuals.
When Menda was moving from the spiders, the chair did some squeaking in the laboratory floor. The spider&rsquo;s neurons fired with the chair squeaking - they could hear a &lsquo;pop&rsquo; sound. Again the neural recordings fired again.
To clarify their discovery, the researchers did clap as they moved away from the spider to check when the neurons firing would stop. But the neurons firing continued up to 5 meters from the spider.
<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/log/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">Menda</a>
reported that the accidental discovery had just enabled the researchers to begin a new journey into testing the spider&rsquo;s hearing capability.

<h2 id="testing-spiders-hair-using-water-droplets">Testing Spiders Hair using Water Droplets</h2>
<p>Menda and team went on to determine the spider&rsquo;s hearing capability by placing some droplets of water on the insects legs - the main was to reduce the vibrations that would happen on the hairs.
But the spider&rsquo;s auditory neurons could no fire - which would mean the arachnid could not hear. Tests showed spiders were sensitive to sounds at low frequencies (80 Hz -130 Hz) like for wasps&rsquo; wing-beats.
However, even with their slight haring, spiders won&rsquo;t hear like human do - this is because their brain process such information in a different way.
The researchers are now examining if spider species like fishing spiders and wolf spider show similar reaction on sound waves - as shown in

<p>When fear comes - particularly when attached by spiders, you&rsquo;ll definitely scream but can the arachnids hear you? However, first, vibrations and visuals, are more pronounced.
Previously, researchers thought that spiders could only hear sounds and noises that are just around the insects body. Spiders will smell, taste but will sense vibrations (on hearing) via tiny holes nand hairs all over its body.
Some spiders species such as Phidippus audax and jumping spider do hear noises and sounds that are up to 5 meters away from the spider.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders, being over 48,000� species, are an essential section of the earth ecosystem. These arthropods possess the
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33989-9_2">open circulatory system</a>
that is, they lack &ldquo;true blood&rdquo; or veins to transport it. But, do spiders have hearts?</p>
<p><strong>The simple **
<strong>answer</strong>
** is, Yes, spiders have 1 tube-like heart in its abdomen with one artery that carry hemolymph (spiders blood) and ostia (one-way valve) on its sides. However, the spider&rsquo;s heart has no capillaries.�</strong>
<strong>Spiders have the open circulatory system. The animal&rsquo;s heart thus pumps the hemolymph into the sinuses and body cavity soaking its organs and tissues to give them hormones, nutrients, and oxygen.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-hearts">Details: Do Spiders Have Hearts??</h2>
<p>Spiders have the open circulatory system, which is different from that in mammals that have the closed circulatory system. The spiders has 1 heart that&rsquo;s a muscular tube pumping the hemolymph into the open circuit.
The spider&rsquo;s bodies like the
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=OCypCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=Spiders+Have+Hearts&amp;ots=kd5ld9canM&amp;sig=BTTnLEI9RYd9m76MSBHlSGRYGIo">Brown recluse</a>
will be filled with the arthropod&rsquo;s haemolymph that&rsquo;s pumped via arteries into the sinuses (openings) that surround various internal organs. The arthropod&rsquo;s blood would diffuse into the� individual cells and later collected into the spider&rsquo;s heart.
Related:
Do Spiders Have Brains?</p>
<p>Therefore, the spiders won&rsquo;t have definite veins that&rsquo;ll transport the arthropod&rsquo;s Haemocyanin (blood) in the body. The Haemolymph has haemocyanin as opposed to the mammalian Haemolymph .
Haemocyanin has copper molecules compared to hemoglobin that contains iron molecules - the spider&rsquo;s blood have a blue coloration.
But Haemolymph carry more oxygen - actually 17 times more than Haemocyanin. In addition, Haemocyanin has no cells like those in mammalia blood.</p>
<h2 id="human-blood-cells-vs-spider-blood-cells">Human Blood Cells Vs Spider Blood Cells</h2>
<h2 id="bloodcirculationin-spiders">BloodCirculationin Spiders</h2>
<p>The heart of the spider is situated in abdomen, not� cephalothorax, which is on the upper section. This is also evident in other species having a abdominal cuticle that&rsquo;s pale-colored. Check the
best spider spray for indoors
to control the athropods.
Also, its enclosed by a membrane that&rsquo;s thin just like the pericardium around the mammalian heart. The spider&rsquo;s heart will pump the haemolymph via the pedicel then to its cephalothorax through the anterior aorta (large artery).
To guarantee that the blood flows in one-way, the spider&rsquo;s heart has simple valves. Also, the spider has a 30 to 200 heart rate (beats in every minute) varying with level of activity or species.</p>
<ol>
<li>Negative pressure is what will allow the spider&rsquo;s haemolymph to return in its heart - this particularly occurs when the heart relaxes in between the beats.</li>
<li>But the haemolymph that&rsquo;s pump[ed into the spiders cephalothorax is moved via unique channels though pedicel whenver the blood pressure is high in its cephalothorax compared to that in the abdomen.</li>
<li>Further, the haemolymph would collect in the lacunae prior to diffusing into the lamellae of the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-lungs/">book lungs</a>and taken up via the heart&rsquo;s tissue spaces� getting in through the ostia (tiny holes).</li>
<li>The secondary�haemolymph pumping is great since there exists cephalothorax muscles that&rsquo;ll expand and compress to allow easy movement of the spider&rsquo;s legs.</li>
<li>Every cephalothorax compression makes the haemolymph that has lost oxygen back via the pedicle moving towards the book lungs for gas exchange and finally getting back to the spider&rsquo;s heart.</li>
<li>However, researchers noted that when the spider moves its legs vigorously, its<a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:871756">heart rate will increase</a>due to a rise in pressure of the haemolymph in the spider&rsquo;s cephalothorax that increase fluid flow into the abdomen.</li>
<li>This on the other hand reduces the flow of haemolymph into the cephalothorax from the abdomen through the spider&rsquo;s anterior aorta. This, therefore, makes the heart rate to slow down as a compensation mechanism.

</ol>
<h2 id="what-makes-up-the-spider-haemolymph">What Makes up the Spider Haemolymph?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s haemolymph is pale blue in colour since it doen&rsquo;t have haemoglobin (iron molecules containing) in the human blood is the red color matter.
However, the haemolymph contain haemocyanin that carry oxygen and contain copper - making it look blue in color.
But the haemolymph is almost similar to the human lymph which tends to diffuse via the human tissues and finally returns to your circulatory system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Haemolymph cells will help carry oxygen around the spider&rsquo;s body. However, cells also assist in reducing bleeding (just like the mammalian thrombocytes) due to tiny injuries like losing a leg - this encourages faster healing. However, losing a abdomen may be fatal to the spider.</li>
<li>The blood cells in the spider&rsquo;s haemolymph is created in the walls of your arthropods heart - her&rsquo;e you&rsquo;ll find the prohaemocytes cells.

that look like the fish gills. The book lung allow easy exchange of air carbon dioxide and oxygen due to its large surface area.
However., for spiders having 1 pair of the book lungs, its considered that the second one evolved into a tracheae system (fine tubes) looking like the bronchial and trachea systems in human lungs. To control the arthropods, use
spider foggers.
But these will be kept open using the chitin as opposed to cartilage in humans. However, they have 1 0r 2 spiracles (openings) that are positioned in abdomen&rsquo;s under-side between the spider&rsquo;s book lungs and spinnerets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012814043700025X">Spiders</a>
(in the Arachnida class) are feared by humans for their poisonous bites. However, most spiders are quite harmless - denoting their great diverse family of 38,000 known species.</p>
<p>Arachnids that closely resemble spiders include mites, ticks, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion">scorpions</a>
. We know that
spiders don&rsquo;t &ldquo;sleep
&ldquo;,
have no bones
, plus have a
long tubular and masculine heart
. But, do spiders have lungs?
<strong>The short answer is, YES, spiders have either 1 or 2 pairs of book lungs. The arachnids breathe through their book lungs or trachea - these are the very narrow tubes laid all through the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s body.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-lungs">Details: Do Spiders Have Lungs??</h2>
<p>Spiders have either 1 or 2 &ldquo;book lungs&rdquo; pairs for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_organ">respiration</a>
. These kind of lungs look like
book pages as they have
hollow,
soft, and
thin plates that flap to the air via small openings on abdomen of spider.
The spider&rsquo;s blood (the
Hemolymph
) pass across the lung plate&rsquo;s
inner surface to allow exchange of
oxygen with
carbon dioxide between the spider and its
atmosphere.
The spider&rsquo;s book lungs offers the
big surface area to allow appropriate
gas exchange. Some
tarantulas have surface area of the book lungs being about a
square
27.6 inches (
70 cm
).
The
opening slips in the book lungs tend to
contract and expand but won&rsquo;t close completely. However, during intense spider activity, the slits on the
book lung will open fully.</p>
<h2 id="how-book-lungs-promote-spiders-respiration">How Book Lungs Promote Spider&rsquo;s Respiration</h2>
<p>The book lungs are located in the open-ventral abdominal atrium (the air-filled cavity) and is linked to the environment via the small slits on the side of the abdomen.
The spider&rsquo;s book lung plates - in their unfolded form - contain hemolymph. The folds work to increase the surface area of the lungs and the air it&rsquo;ll contact - allowing better gas exchanged. But most spider species won&rsquo;t require movement of plates to allow effective respiration.
However, some spiders may lack the book lungs but still undertake gaseous exchange through the thin walls in the abdominal cavity and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate_trachea">tracheae tubes</a>
.
Definitely, the spider&rsquo;s trachea seems to have developed from its book lungs since it has super elongated chambers. Thus, other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnid">arachnids</a>
like harvestmen (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiliones">Opiliones</a>
) amd
mites
will do gassoue exchange via tracheae or even just the body surfaces.
Arachnids without book lungs are called apulmonate arachnids and they include
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifugae">sun spiders</a>
,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricinulei">Ricinulei</a>
,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscorpion">pseudoscorpions</a>
, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwhip_scorpion">microwhip scorpions</a>
.
However, those Arachnids with book lungs are called pulmonate arachnids - which include the

,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapulmonata">Tetrapulmonata</a>
, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion">scorpions</a>
.
On book lungs&rsquo; preservation - the one from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonotarbid">trigonotarbid</a>
was the oldest that recovered in Scotland -
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynie_chert">Rhynie chert</a>
. Further, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian">Devonian</a>
lungs look almost like the book lungs of the spiders / arachnids.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-book-gills-and-respiration">Spiders Book gills and Respiration</h2>
<p>For the
<a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Invertebrates/Horseshoe-Crab">horseshoe crabs</a>
(in males and females), you&rsquo;ll notice book gills similar to what is in spiders. Researchers opine that book lungs developed from the
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467803915000353">book gills</a></p>
<ul>
<li>but you&rsquo;ll find these externally.
The genital operculum is the front flap� but it has no gills. Notably, the flap-like book gills seem to have developmned from legs and they allow respiration when the animal is under water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-spiders-breathe-underwater">How Do Spiders Breathe Underwater?</h2>
<p>Some spiders like Scuba spider use their web like gills to breather when they&rsquo;re under water. Others like the Argyroneta aquatica will breathe via fine�abdomenal hairs to bubbles floating on the water surface.
Some diving-bell spider use their web like a gill for breathing - particularly when they get under water. For example,
<a href="http://www.activetouch.de/index.php?id=38">Stefan Hetz</a>
and
<a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/roger.seymour">Roger Seymour</a>
conducted a study using 12 spiders to note that the spiders used their web like their gill when they&rsquo;re under water.
The web is silk like and will enable oxygen to move from the environment near the ware and get to the spider while also allowing carbon dioxide to get back to the environment.
Seymour reported that the diving-bell spiders could survive for over 24 hours under water. Therefore, these arachnids will easily hide from their prey and predators.</p>
<h2 id="how-sea-spiders-breathe-without-gills-orlungs">How Sea Spiders Breathe Without� Gills or�Lungs</h2>
<p>Many strange creatures exist in the cold Antarctic depths  particularly under the Antarctic ice. Giant sea spiders are the strangest of them all. Definitely, the Antarctic spider species will grow very big while the normal sea spiders are usually small in size.
In addition, these Antarctic spiders have even more strange internal organs. For example, youll find a section of their guts and even all their genitals in their legs. Further, they have a very weak
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-hearts/">heart</a>
and thus it cant pump its blood (hemolymph) in its body.
Therefore, the spiders will only pump the hemolymph via their guts movement as opposed to just relying on their heart for pumping the blood. Definitely, there are additional queries on these spiders but on how the undertake gaseous exchange is a critical issue.
While at it, lobsters, crabs and fish use gills for gaseous exchanges. In this, water will flow over the gills to absorb the available oxygen. However, worms on land or at sea will generally absorb the oxygen via their skin.
However, for sea spiders  they lack lungs or gills while their skin is just
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-bones/">the exoskeleton  but no internal bones</a>
which is thick to allow oxygen absorption. �However, the sea spiders have many pores what they use for respiration.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some spiders even exhibit ballooning behavior - but do spiders have wings? Spiders use the earths electric field as a guide
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/trapdoor-spiders-australia-africa">for flying across oceans</a>
on long strands of silk  without wings!
<em><strong>Well, what about winged spiders? Do these exist? No, not really. There are no known species of <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> with fully developed wings capable of powered flight in any way comparable to that of insects or birds.�</strong></em>
<em><strong>However there is one genus (Palystes) whose females possess wing-like projections called apomoses which cover their reproductive organs and sometimes also extend beyond them. These structures serve only as protective covers and are not used for flight.�</strong></em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spider Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-wings">Details: Do Spiders Have Wings?</h2>
<p>Most insects have wings, but spiders dont. There are winged species of jumping spider (Salticidae) but these do not have wings in any way comparable to that of insects or birds and so they can&rsquo;t fly either.
The jumping spiders&rsquo; wings are actually a very thin layer of chitin, which is the substance that covers their exoskeleton.
The spider&rsquo;s thorax and head comprise what would be called the cephalothorax in other arthropods (such as crustaceans) and thus wings can&rsquo;t be incorporated into the body plan
Some spiders, called &ldquo;ballooners,&rdquo; use the earth&rsquo;s electric field as it would a compass to lift their bodies into the air on long strands of silk - but they&rsquo;re often attracted by light sources which can cause them to fly into flower-like structures or be trapped in clothing!
The spider can then use this silk to trap particles in the surrounding atmosphere for it to float on. This is a form of transportation known as &ldquo;ballooning.&rdquo;

<h2 id="do-spiders-glide">Do spiders glide?</h2>
<p>Spiders like arboreal tarantulas are excellent jumping�- known to glide from tree to tree - and they might grow glider wings over million�of years.
Also,
<em>Selenops change their whole</em>
body into some airfoil and they&rsquo;ll glide for a long time.
Gliding is a great way for spiders (and other arthropods) to escape from predators, and it&rsquo;s also a good means of transportation if they need go long distances!
Some spiders can even use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">changes in wind currents</a>
or tree branches like stepping stones across gaps too wide for jumping.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4oMFOoK50">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4oMFOoK50</a></p>
<h3 id="how-spider-silk-help-in-flight">How Spider Silk help in flight?</h3>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s silk is the strongest known natural material. It&rsquo;s stronger in some ways than steel and Kevlar, yet it&rsquo;s light as a feather!
Spiders can make silk straight from liquid to solid by spinning out of their mouths or rear ends. The spider makes its own glue when needed, just like you might use Elmers glue from a jar.
Spider silk is made mostly of protein. The spider spins the silk using tiny spigots on its abdomen called spinnerets. Through ballooning, a spider will use the silk�to make voyage cross-ocean journeys!
A few spiders have been found that live in the snowy mountains of Alaska.
Its not surprising they are able to survive so far north, because some species balloon as high as 15 miles into the atmosphere with just their silk and then float back down on air currents.

<h3 id="why-wont-spiders-fly">Why Won&rsquo;t Spiders Fly?</h3>
<p>Spiders�show varied behaviors�and lifestyles compared to other insects. For example, while many insects can use their wings to fly and some spiders do ballooning behavior.
A spiders body is covered in tiny hairs called setae that are too small for the human eye to see. These setae help them sense when they touch something or even if a potential predator has touched or grabbed them!
Some spiders are active during the day and others at night. Some can live on trees, some in sand dunes, or even high up near mountain peaks where it is cold enough to snow!

<h3 id="what-if-spiders-had-wings">What If Spiders Had Wings?</h3>
<p>If spiders had wings, they could fly from one place to another. Unlike other insects that can only use their wings for limited periods of time, a spiders setae would allow it to stay in the air all day long!
If�the spiders could fly, they would be able to find mates much more easily. They could also escape from predators!
But humans would be able to find them much more easily around the house and spaces, so it would not be as safe (they&rsquo;d be nightmare bugs).
The spiders would feed on many pests - comparable to bats, but wouldn&rsquo;t be able to clean up the mess like bats.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do Spiders Have Wings? Well, they don&rsquo;t have wings, b
ut can spiders fly? Yes! Some spiders use the earth&rsquo;s electric field as it would a compass to lift their bodies into the air on long strands of silk - this is called ballooning.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Spiders Pee? Animals, unlike plants, must all &ldquo;urinate&rdquo; despite undertaking the process in different ways. Urinating allow removal of unwanted salts, nitrogen, and also maintain water balance in their bodies.</p>
<p>In humans, the urination process starts in the kidney while the bladder stores the urine (nitrogenous urea waste plus water) in liquid form before its ejected.
**So, do spiders pee? The short answer is, NO, spiders don&rsquo;t urinate like humans. But spiders poop-pee uric acid (from malpighian tubules akin to kidneys) that is semi-solid and won&rsquo;t dissolve in water. **
<strong>Simply, spiders won&rsquo;t deposit urine and feces separately like humans. Spiders release the waste in a combined form (feces plus urine) through the anus.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-pee-urinate-7-spider-faqs">Details: Do Spiders Pee? Urinate? 7 Spider FAQs</h2>
<p>Spiders have malpighian tubules (comparable to mammalian kidneys) that&rsquo;ll remove the nitrogenous waste in form of uric acid. The malpighian tubules will drain into the stercoral pocket (a pouch in its digestive tract).
However, unlike human urine, the uric acid is near-solid and won&rsquo;t dissolve in water. Spiders pee-poop that&rsquo;s semi-solid help them avoid losing water through their urine.
In the stercoral pocket, the uric acid is mixed with solid waste coming from the spiders digestive tract to form the semi-solid poop-pee that come out combined through the anus.</p>
<h2 id="conserves-water-with-uric-acid">Conserves Water with Uric Acid</h2>
<p>Insects and spiders will change their nitrogenous waste into uric acid - which is an insoluble and contains minimal water - as a water conservation method for the spider.
Comparatively, flying insects and birds produce dry &lsquo;urine&rsquo;that has uric acid since they avoiding a bladder with water helps them cut their weight.

<h2 id="do-spiders-drink-water">Do Spiders Drink Water?</h2>
<p>Simple answer is, YES, spiders drink water. While in the wild environment, the spiders will drink from droplets on the ground of vegetation. Further, they can drink from evening or morning dew that&rsquo;s hanging on the spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>However, for the caged spiders, you should offer them fresh water using objects like small dish, damp sponge or bottle cap including for the tarantulas species. The Tarantulas will also drink the droplets of water gathered on foliage or leaves around them.
Despite that spiders do drink water must not make you think that the arachnids live in drains. For a spider that&rsquo;s inside the house, the best water sources is water droplets from shower or tap , sink edges, or plugholes.
Definitely,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spiders can&rsquo;t drown</a>
but may remain trapped in the bath or sink due to being too steep or slippery. The whistling spider species creates a silk layer for their long burrow to ensure it remains humid and hydrated.
Raindrops dew can also provide a water sources for some spider species. Garden spider, wolf spider and wolf spider tend to get water from drinking the morning dew. They&rsquo;ll take the water from dew via mound (silk-covered) at the door of their hideout.
Some spider species also drink nectar from the garden plants particularly when there are limited water sources such as rain, dew or tap water. Spider species like the whip spider use their pincers to suck water from sources like dew or nectar flowers.</p>
<h2 id="some-spiders-dont-drink-water">Some Spiders Don&rsquo;t Drink Water</h2>
<p>The red back and black widow (
while they&rsquo;re not all venomous
), interestingly, don&rsquo;t drink water like humans or other spiders. These spiders get most of their required body fluids from sucking their prey.
These are comparable to mammals such as the koalathat don&rsquo;t drink water but derive their fluids from eating eucalyptus (smooth-barked) among other plan leaves.

poop and pee is mixed together</p>
<ul>
<li>through their malpighian tubules to eliminate the nitrogenous waste. So, its fact that spiders don&rsquo;t generate urine but will have the near-solid uric acid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spiders lack a clearly defined urinary tract comparable to that in mammals. Check this
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-spiders-defecate-urinate-and-is-it-harmful-to-humans">amazing answer</a>
on whether spiders pee or poop. You can use
spider spray to control the arachnids
that are unwanted indoors.
The spider&rsquo;s pee-poop is small light brown, cream, or white colored that will appear like round drops. On size, these droppings measure around 1/16 - 1/8 an inch in diameter. Further, the spider&rsquo;s poop mainly contains guanine - just like in the DNA.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us fear spiders (unless it&rsquo;s a pet <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>) because
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">their spider bites are largely poisonous</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if any homeowner sees some insect poop around the house, they worry that they could have spiders around.
<strong>But, do spiders poop? Yes, after feeding and digestion happen, spiders will poop to release their body&rsquo;s waste. The spider poop will be the size of a pinhead (thick liquid) and they have a gray, black, brown, or white color.�</strong></li>
<li>After drying, the spider poop may stain the surface, the floor, and the walls.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-poop-spider-droppings-and-feces">Do Spiders Poop? Spider Droppings and Feces</h2>
<p>As summarized above, spiders will poop� (just like other animals) after eating their popular food; which is the tiny insects. The poop they release is simply body waste.</p>
<ul>
<li>But spiders feed on tiny insects and they don&rsquo;t poop as often as large animals like mammals - which means that you might not catch the spiders in action releasing their body waste.
The metabolic rate of spiders (like the
tarantula
) is quite slow and thus they&rsquo;re able to feed on the tiny insects but will defecate a few times in a given time.</li>
<li>Some of these spider species may feed just once a month and thus with a slow metabolic rate, they&rsquo;ll require less eating and thus lesser pooping.
On structure and size, spider poop is comparable to bird poop - but on color, it&rsquo;s white (when wet) but will turn to light-brown or cream after drying.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-the-shape-size-and-color-of-spider-poop">What&rsquo;s the Shape, Size, and Color of Spider Poop?</h2>
<p>As noted above, spider poop will look something close to the shape, size, and color of the bird&rsquo;s poop - but smaller in size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiders&rsquo; poop will have black stains but whitish in color when it&rsquo;s wet - white liquid.
The spider poop stains are anything around 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch in their diameter. However, once dried, the spider poop will turn black, light brown, or grey.</li>
<li>However, the shape, size, and color of the spider poop will be different depending on the spider species.
For context, some spider species that are large-sized such as the tarantula produce poop that is large - the poop is also less viscous but very water - and hence it tends to dry faster.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="locations-to-check-forspider-poop">Locations to check for<strong>Spider Poop�</strong></h2>
<p>So, which exact locations will you find the spider poop around the house or in the yard?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, note that you&rsquo;ll mainly find the spider poop around the areas that the spiders will frequent.
Notably, the spiders will make their webs and poop around places that have less traffic such as the corners of the garage, ceiling, under the sink, cabinets, garage, and house.</li>
<li>You can also find the spider pop on surfaces such as skirting boards, windowsills, floors, and walls.
The Tarantulas poop will mainly be dropped on walls and glass in their boxed enclosure.</li>
<li>However, the arboreal tarantulas will love to drop their waste in places such as an enclosure door�while other species like the water bowls.
Because these places have less traffic, the spider will settle in the locations so that their insect traps won&rsquo;t be disturbed. Thus, you&rsquo;re likely to get more spider poop here.
Spider poop is largely liquid and viscous in nature since it&rsquo;s made up of spider poop mixed with its pee - which is actually uric acid.</li>
<li>However, spider webs will be created from silk - which is largely protein-based and produced from the silk glands of the spider.
Compared to the spider poo that&rsquo;s mainly undigested food materials that are released from the spider&rsquo;s anus, spider silk is released from the spinnerets that are also around the insect&rsquo;s anus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-times-willspiders-poop">How Many Times Will<strong>Spiders Poop?�</strong></h2>
<p>Spiders have different rates and times of releasing their poop depending on the species. Some species that can show the difference in pooping are the jumping spider and the tarantula.</p>
<ul>
<li>As outlined, spiders with slow metabolism rates will definitely excrete less often and thus you&rsquo;ll find less spider poop in their hiding areas.
For example, there are spider species that&rsquo;ll poop once a day or even in a month - this may vary with the spider&rsquo;s health, their living conditions, and availability of small insects for their food.</li>
<li>Another fun fact is that spider may use their poop to keep off their predators - mainly because the spider poop has a pungent smell that wades off other animals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-safe-is-spider-poop-toxic">How Safe is Spider Poop? Toxic?</h2>
<p>Bites from some common spiders tend to be venomous mainly due to the antimicrobials in their blood and venom but are spider poop toxic? Well, simply stated spider poop is never toxic.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, most animal droppings could be dangerous as they may carry parasites, viruses, and bacteria but<a href="https://www.illinoispoisoncenter.org/my-child-ate-poop">spider poop is classified as less toxic</a>.
But it has
<a href="https://www.pctonline.com/article/pct1013-spider-poop/">been reported that</a>
poop from the Black Widow may bring pathogenic bacteria if it is eaten by flies.</li>
<li>Despite that spider ear insects like flies, most of their poop is non-toxic.</li>
<li>Otherwise, they would transmit pathogens such as Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, or Salmonella spp.
Notably, the antimicrobial cap[abilities that are normally in the venom of a spider are often removed by the poop&rsquo;s bacterias.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-or-remove-the-spider-poop"><strong>How to Clean or Remove the Spider Poop�</strong></h2>
<p>To clean the spider droppings, you&rsquo;ll require just some paper towel, cloth, and some water.</p>
<ul>
<li>But it&rsquo;s best you clean the spider poop very soon because delay may make it leave some yellow stain on the fabric.
But if the spider poop leaves a prominent yellow stain, you can remove it with some aggressive stain cleaners or removers.</li>
<li>The poop from tarantulas spiders could be challenging to clean largely because their droppings may be cluttered.
I suggest you use some long tweezers or tongs to hold the clothe or wet tissue that has been dipped into some water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Further, the spider poop will also be dropped tother with a bolus - I can describe this as the web and part of the flesh of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/">tiny insects like bed bugs</a>
that the spider ate.</p>

<p><strong>But do spiders sleep? Spiders don&rsquo;t sleep like humans but have circadian rhythms - rest &amp; activity cycles. Spiders lack eyelids and don&rsquo;t close their eyes like humans.�</strong>
<strong>During the resting phase, spiders conserve energy during the day and cold areas by lowering the metabolic rate and cutting their activity - how spiders hibernate during winter. But spiders are more highly active at night so as to avoid predators such as birds at day time.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-do-spiders-sleep"><strong>How Do Spiders Sleep?</strong></h2>
<p>In hibernation mode, the arachnids will lower their metabolic rates while also tucking in their legs. Most
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=oJxVDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP6&amp;dq=do+Spiders+Sleep&amp;ots=0sDheMGg5e&amp;sig=BlRRfLwk_a-nKhGyTSZ31hwIiJU">spider species</a>
will be active mainly at night. In addition, these arachnids will hibernate during the cold season.
Do spiders sleep?�To a curious mind, it would make sense that a creature with 8 eyes would need to sleep from time to time. However, do spiders sleep? The answer to this is fascinating and shrouded in mystery as demonstrated below
The fact that spiders do not have eyelids suggests that spiders rest, just not in the way we do but in their own unique way. Spiders have daily cycles of rest and activity. They cant shut their eyelids but their body reduces activity levels and lowers their metabolic rate to conserve energy.</p>
<h2 id="science-behind-sleep-hibernation-in-spiders">Science behind Sleep (Hibernation) in Spiders</h2>
<p>There is scanty research on the science behind animal sleep. However, studies suggest that animals have a cardiac rhythm which is determined by the time of day. Animals are either nocturnal (active at night) or diurnal (active during day time).
During their inactive phase, the creatures tend to burrow and experience a drop in their metabolic activity rate. During cold seasons, spiders curl their legs and reduce their metabolic rate even as they stay huddled together in cocoons during the coldest months of the year.</p>
<h2 id="do-spiders-crawl-in-mouth-while-sleeping">Do Spiders Crawl in Mouth While Sleeping?</h2>
<p>The fact that spiders are capable of such hibernation means that they can do so in short bursts on a day to day basis to give the impression of sleep. As the spider encounters a period of low food availability and harsh climatic conditions, they enter hibernation mode to conserve energy.
When the spiders are resting,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-brains/">their brains</a>
will be working round the clock. For example, they&rsquo;ll feel even the smallest vibration with their great tactile sense. In addition, they&rsquo;ll react in case of danger of when one of their prey gets stuck on their web.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-species---differences-in-sleeping">Spiders Species - Differences in sleeping?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s brain is a little different from the human brain. Therefore, the arachnids won&rsquo;t get bored in their &ldquo;rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; mode. But some spiders may take naps at night.
But hunting spiders posses more powerful eyesight compared to those that build webs. for example, wolf spiders will attack and chase their prey.
Crab spiders will just sit around waiting to ambush their prey on the leaf and flower.�In addition, jumping spiders will use their great
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-ears/">hearing capability</a>
, intelligent and eyesight.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-of-the-arachnids">Lifestyle of the Arachnids</h2>
<p>Different spiders will &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; in their webs but some won&rsquo;t require the web traps against their prey. For example, the trapdoors build their tunnels and install doors (with hinges).
There are over 1000 spider species globally. For example, jumping spiders are computed to be about 5000 - which is roughly 13 % of all species of spiders.
The Salticidae family - particularly jumping spiders don&rsquo;t also create spider webs but will spin tether ropes if they&rsquo;re jumping. So, spiders will be quite at rest waiting for a suitable prey or while conserving energy.</p>
<h2 id="arachnidssnoring-andbody-language">Arachnids&rsquo;�Snoring and�Body Language</h2>
<p>In hibernation mode, the arachnids will lower their metabolic rates while also tucking in their legs. Therefore, the spiders will live longer with no food as they won&rsquo;t be burning calories - particularly at night and during the cold weather.
However, whenever you see a spider that has taken an odd position such as legs tucked plus lying on its back - it could be dead.�What about snoring in spiders? Well, spiders won&rsquo;t snore like human beings.
In fact, these insect will be hiding in wall crack among other protected areas. Further, for survival these arachnids will sleep, nest, and hunt out of predator&rsquo;s harm.

<p>Some factors like cold temperatures or circadian rhythms may make the spiders such as Agelenopsis aperta may pass out or remain unconscious - you might in fact think that the insects is dead.
In addition, some drugs like marijuana, caffeine, or chloral hydrate may make the spiders to pass out or it&rsquo;ll negatively affect the insect&rsquo;s web-making capability.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summertime in many parts of the World including the United States such as in Washington, D.C., largely experiences an upsurge of squirrels -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-squirrels-live/">they live longer too</a>
.
Well, squirrels are comparatively cute and most of us may get attracted to them. In fact, we argue that squirrels are not like lions, bears, or wolves. But do squirrels attack humans?
<em>In brief, Yes, squirrels will attack humans whenever they feel threatened - their powerful bites may bring dangerous diseases. So, if you love watching or feeding squirrels in the backyard, you must keep some safe distance.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, if there are squirrels around your house or backyard, you&rsquo;ll need to hire professional <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-carry-ticks/">squirrel</a> control - these will help with inspection and control of the squirrel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-do-squirrels-attack-humans">Details: Do Squirrels Attack Humans?</h2>
<p>Despite being cute animals, squirrels are equally territorial and competitive mammals. Therefore, the males and females will compete for territories while building nests during fall.
Further, in winter, the squirrel&rsquo;s food is scarce and thus the animals must hide this resource from their rival squirrels. Therefore, the competition causes increased aggressiveness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, during such times squirrels will also attack humans since they can&rsquo;t stand having their babies or food being taken away from them.
Any human who gets near such as an aggressive squirrel may appear like a threat to these wild animals and thus it&rsquo;ll launch its self-defense for survival.</li>
<li>Therefore, I advise getting to some safe distance from the squirrels since they may seriously harm you or your pets.
Notably, squirrels have strong and sharp teeth that&rsquo;ll chew through soft metal, plastic, and wood. So, a bite on the human body may leave the person needing some stitches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-of-infection-from-squirrel-bites">Risk of Infection from Squirrel Bites?</h2>
<p>Squirrels have dirty claws as they use them largely for many of their daily hunting or attacking activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Injuries on humans caused by squirrel claws may bring diseases such as Plague, Salmonellosis, Tularemia, and Leptospirosis - these spread largely via feces and saliva.
Further, squirrels may also carry parasites such as fleas and ticks - but you may use
flea spray for the backyard</li>
<li>and these may cause diseases such as Encephalitis and Lyme disease.</li>
<li>Squirrels will not just attack humans while in the open yards, but may also follow you to the house or also give you a run in the attic as they seek nesting places.
For the attic, the squirrels will get into that space by clawing or chewing through roof gaps, chimneys, plumbing vents, and roof vents.</li>
<li>The animals will nest inside the attic around the insulation - where they destroy it or smear it with its body waste.
Such damage in damage by the squirrels will expose your roof to different environmental elements while also increasing your energy costs.</li>
<li>Besides, the squirrels will chew house elements like the electrical wires while also causing an attraction to pests like raccoons.

</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-we-do-when-a-squirrel-gets-inside"><strong>What Should We Do When a Squirrel Gets Inside?�</strong></h2>
<p>If a squirrel lands on your property, especially in the attic, you must take quick remedies to avoid further attacks on humans and pets. I recommend you;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use vinegar: Soak some rags into cider vinegar and place these around the door of the attic or at your fireplace.</li>
<li>Make noise: When the squirrel is already in the chimney or attic, make massive noises to help scare the animal away from your property.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu-q47fM020">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu-q47fM020</a>
Further, for any squirrel that is threatening to attack humans or is inside your property - consider hiring some professional remover and don&rsquo;t get overly close to the animals to avoid injury.</li>
<li>The pest control and removal experts will definitely understand the behavior of squirrels as compared to most of us.</li>
<li>Thus, the experts will remove the animals without hurting anyone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-keep-squirrels-off-your-humans-and-our-homes">Why Keep Squirrels Off Your Humans and Our Homes?</h2>
<p>Wild animals including squirrels can sometimes be unpredictable. The animals will become overly aggressive and attack humans if they feel threatened.
More squirrels in the backyard increase the likelihood of some of them chewing their way to your house, chimney, or also in the houses&rsquo; attic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, squirrels may drop their wet or dry body waste in the yard or in the house - these may pose a hazard to the pets and humans too.
As noted above, the squirrels may eat through electrical wires and hence may lead to a power outage, fires, and economic losses around the house.
Chewing or gnawing on plumbing works and pipes by the squirrels may lead to breakages and water leakages in the house or the backyard.</li>
<li>Squirrels will come from the wild environment and will thus carry bugs and parasites such as mites, ticks, and fleas -humans may get ear mites from dogs?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-removesquirrels">How to Remove�Squirrels</h2>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re not ready to allow the squirrels to leave your surrounding on their own or if they&rsquo;re attacking humans, then you need to adopt appropriate removal methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>A one-way squirrels exclusion door will work well in removing the animals since once they get out of the home or yard, they won&rsquo;t easily get back and attack humans.</li>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-yard/">Live-trapping of these squirrels</a>will help easily and humanely remove these animals from our spaces. For example, one may use cage traps in spaces such as holes and attics.</li>
<li>Further, after you&rsquo;ve trapped or caught the animals from the attic, you&rsquo;ll require to seal all the entry points that the squirrels used to access the spaces.</li>
<li>Despite that some DIY squirrel-control chemicals exist in the stotes, experts do not recommend these remedies as they may be dangerous to people and pets, especially when applied carelessly or incorrectly.
However, all in all, the best technique to use in getting rid of those squirrels is to use expert wildlife control and removal professionals.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, on whether squirrels will attack humans; I answer to the affirmative that if provoked and they feel endangered squirrels will attack humans and pets equally in the house or in the backyard.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders, those unwelcome houseguests! They often seek refuge indoors during colder months, especially in our cozy heated homes. When we spot them, we scramble to find ways to
eliminate them
, like considering <a href="/posts/does-bleach-kill-bed-bugs/">bleach</a> (Sodium Hypochlorite).
<strong>But does bleach  really work against spiders? Indeed, highly concentrated bleach (above 11%) with its potent acidity can effectively exterminate spiders, their eggs, and even other pests like flies when generously applied.�</strong>
However, it&rsquo;s important to be aware that bleach is not environmentally friendly due to its high toxicity. When using it indoors, protective gear is essential. Additionally, be cautious about using bleach on hardwood floors or natural materials such as wood and stone.</p>
<p>For a simpler and more efficient spider control solution, consider opting for specialized products designed to eradicate these arachnids, such as
spider bait traps
and
insect growth regulators (IGRs)
.</p>
<h2 id="is-bleach-effective-against-spiders"><strong>Is Bleach Effective Against Spiders?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="a-bleach"><strong>a. Bleach&rsquo;s Acidic Power</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, high-concentration bleach is effective against spiders and other arachnids and insects. Its acidity disrupts spider cell activity, leading to their demise.</p>
<p>You can also use bleach to remove webs and create a barrier outside your home to keep spiders away. For targeted applications, a bleach spray with a sprayer works best.

<h2 id="how-to-use-bleach-to-get-rid-of-spiders-at-home"><strong>How to Use Bleach to Get Rid of Spiders at Home</strong></h2>
<p>With nearly 40,000 spider species out there, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to find them in your bathroom. Luckily, you can use bleach to eliminate them due to its acetic acid properties. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need:
<strong>Materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum or broom</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Bleach</li>
<li>Spray bottle</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-mix-bleach-and-water"><strong>Step 1: Mix Bleach and Water</strong></h3>
<p>Mix bleach and water in a 1:3 ratio or use equal amounts if needed. Pour this mixture into your spray bottle and shake it well.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-spray-the-spiders"><strong>Step 2: Spray the Spiders</strong></h3>
<p>Spray the bleach solution directly on the spiders from a distance of 5 to 10 inches, ensuring you cover them adequately based on their size. Also, target the areas where you suspect spiders are hiding, along with their webs. Don&rsquo;t forget to clean up afterward to remove dead spiders and their eggs.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-clean-up"><strong>Step 3: Clean Up</strong></h3>
<p>Clean the treated areas to remove dead spiders and wipe off any bleach residue from various surfaces, including
clogged drains
.</p>
<p>Be cautious not to use bleach on surfaces that could react negatively with it, such as carpets, fabrics, and sofas. Wear protective gloves to avoid contact with your skin and eyes.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-vacuum"><strong>Step 4: Vacuum</strong></h3>

Clean any surfaces that came into contact with the bleach mixture thoroughly. Be mindful not to inhale chlorine fumes or let the mixture come into contact with your skin or eyes.</p>
<h2 id="will-bleach-kill-spider-eggs"><strong>Will Bleach Kill Spider Eggs?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, bleach is effective in killing not only spiders but also their eggs. The bleach mixture, when applied with a spray bottle, can kill young spiders and their eggs. The acidic nature of bleach ruptures the outer layer of the eggs and the exoskeletons of young spiders, effectively eliminating them.
<strong>Important Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure you spray the bleach solution on spider-prone areas in your home.</li>
<li>Watch out for hidden spider egg sacs, especially in places like old plant stems, and make sure to treat them with bleach as well.</li>
<li>Seal airtight containers holding food items before using bleach to prevent fumes from contaminating them.
By following these steps and precautions, you can effectively use bleach to deal with spiders and their eggs in your home.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is often considered a potential tool in the fight against pests like bed bugs. Understanding its effects on bed bugs and how it can be used as part of an integrated pest management strategy is important for those dealing with infestations. In this article, we will explore whether carbon dioxide can kill bed bugs and how it works in pest control.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-carbon-dioxide-co2">What is Carbon Dioxide (CO2)?</h2>
<p>Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring gas that makes up about 0.04% of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. It is produced by living organisms during respiration and by the burning of fossil fuels. In pest control, CO2 is sometimes used as a tool to monitor pest activity or to suffocate insects in a controlled environment.</p>
<h2 id="can-carbon-dioxide-kill-bed-bugs">Can Carbon Dioxide Kill Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Studies suggest that carbon dioxide can affect bed bugs, but its ability to kill them is limited. Carbon dioxide can cause bed bugs to become disoriented and even suffocate in high concentrations, especially in sealed environments. However, using CO2 alone is generally not enough to eliminate a bed bug infestation.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-carbon-dioxide-affect-bed-bugs">How Does Carbon Dioxide Affect Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>Bed bugs rely on oxygen for survival, and when exposed to high levels of CO2, they may experience respiratory distress. However, the CO2 levels needed to cause death in bed bugs are significantly higher than those found in most household environments. Additionally, bed bugs can survive in low-oxygen environments for extended periods, making CO2 alone ineffective as a sole treatment for infestations.</p>
<h3 id="co2-as-part-of-a-larger-strategy">CO2 as Part of a Larger Strategy</h3>
<p>While CO2 may not be a standalone solution for killing bed bugs, it can be an effective tool when combined with other pest control methods. For example, CO2 can be used to attract bed bugs to traps or monitoring stations. Some pest control professionals use CO2 in combination with heat treatments or insecticides for a more comprehensive approach to eliminating bed bugs.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-carbon-dioxide-for-bed-bug-control">Alternatives to Carbon Dioxide for Bed Bug Control</h2>
<p>If you are dealing with a bed bug infestation, it is important to consider a range of treatment options:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Heat Treatment:**Bed bugs are highly sensitive to heat and can be killed by exposure to temperatures above 113F (45C) for extended periods.</li>
<li>**Insecticides:**Chemical treatments can be effective when applied properly, though they may require multiple applications to fully eliminate an infestation.</li>
<li>**Vacuuming and Steam Cleaning:**Regularly vacuuming and steam cleaning infested areas can help remove bed bugs and their eggs.</li>
<li>**Professional Pest Control:**If you are dealing with a severe infestation, it is often best to consult with a pest control expert who can recommend the most effective treatment plan for your situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Carbon dioxide can affect bed bugs, but it is not a reliable standalone method for eliminating infestations. While it may be useful for attracting bed bugs or as part of an integrated pest management strategy, other methods such as heat treatment, insecticides, and professional pest control are more effective for dealing with bed bug problems. If you suspect a bed bug infestation in your home, it is best to consult with a pest control expert for advice on the most appropriate treatment options.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lavender <a href="/posts/how-to-clean-up-oil-spills-in-garage/">oil</a> is often praised for its calming scent and various health benefits, but can it also help in getting rid of fleas? Fleas are persistent pests that can cause discomfort for both pets and humans, and many people look for natural solutions to combat them. In this article, we explore whether lavender oil is effective in killing fleas and how it can be used as a natural flea repellent.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-lavender-oil">What is Lavender Oil?</h2>
<p>Lavender oil is an essential oil extracted from the lavender plant. It is widely known for its soothing aroma and is used in various forms, including oils, lotions, and sprays. Lavender oil is also believed to have insect-repelling properties, which is why it is often recommended as a natural remedy for fleas.</p>
<h2 id="does-lavender-oil-kill-fleas">Does Lavender Oil Kill Fleas?</h2>
<p>While lavender oil is known to repel fleas, it does not typically kill them instantly. However, studies have shown that lavender oil has insecticidal properties, and when used properly, it can help control flea populations. The active compounds in lavender oil, such as linalool and linalyl acetate, are toxic to fleas and can deter them from infesting an area or animal.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-lavender-oil-to-repel-fleas">How to Use Lavender Oil to Repel Fleas</h2>
<p>Lavender oil can be used in several ways to keep fleas away from pets and home environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Spray for Pets:**You can create a lavender oil flea spray by diluting a few drops of lavender oil in water. Use a spray bottle to apply the solution to your pets fur, but avoid their eyes and face. Be sure to test a small patch of skin first to ensure your pet doesnt have a sensitivity to the oil.</li>
<li>**Lavender Oil for the Home:**To repel fleas in your home, you can mix lavender oil with water and spray it around areas where fleas are likely to hide, such as carpets, furniture, and bedding. You can also place sachets of dried lavender in areas prone to flea infestations.</li>
<li>**Lavender Oil Bath:**Adding a few drops of lavender oil to your pets bathwater may help repel fleas and soothe their skin. Be sure to rinse thoroughly and avoid getting oil in their eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="precautions-when-using-lavender-oil">Precautions When Using Lavender Oil</h2>
<p>While lavender oil is generally safe to use for repelling fleas, there are a few precautions to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Concentration:**Always dilute lavender oil before applying it to your pet or home. Pure essential oils are potent and can cause skin irritation or other adverse reactions if used undiluted.</li>
<li>**Pet Sensitivities:**Some pets, especially cats, may be more sensitive to essential oils. It is recommended to consult a veterinarian before using lavender oil on pets, particularly cats, as they may not tolerate it as well as dogs.</li>
<li>**Ingestion:**Never allow pets to ingest lavender oil, as it can be toxic when ingested in large quantities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lavender oil can be a useful natural tool in repelling fleas, but it is not a guaranteed solution to eliminate them entirely. While it may not kill fleas instantly, it can help deter them from infesting your home or pet. Always use lavender oil with care, and consult your veterinarian if you have concerns about using essential oils on your pets.</p>

ants
like other natural essential oils.
Spiders use their legs in the sensing mission, and thus the peppermint smell will make them not to crawl through the treated surfaces.

      <description>Windex</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windex">Windex</a>
is a degreaser for hard-to-clean surfaces like fans and hoods. But, does Windex kill spiders and their eggs?
<strong>Well, here&rsquo;s my experience!�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recently, I glanced over in your son&rsquo;s room to see a<strong>venomous spider</strong>crawling down the wall. All I found near to kill the Windex degreaser. I sprayed it.</li>
<li>The spider drooped over and died. End of story? Nope! I promptly took on a search about Windex versus spiders.
<strong>So, is</strong>
<strong>Windex deadly enough to kill spiders? Yes! Spray enough Windex on a spider and it&rsquo;ll die fairly quickly. Windex has lethal ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) &amp;�</strong>
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CN100423640C/en"><strong>sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate</strong></a>
** thatll block the spiders book lungs, block its breathing to suffocate it.�**
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Windex&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="does-windex-kill-spiders-and-their-eggs">Does Windex Kill Spiders and their Eggs?</h2>
<p>This article will discuss the effectiveness of Windex to exterminate spiders &amp; its pros and cons as an
insecticide
.
<strong>Let&rsquo;s dive right in.�</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-surfactants-ammonium-hydroxide--sodium-dodecylbenzene-sulfonate">1. Surfactants: Ammonium Hydroxide &amp; Sodium Dodecylbenzene Sulfonate</h3>
<p>The ammonia and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate in Windex is deadly to spiders; they work collectively to kill the spider on contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use it as a spray, but make sure the spider is directly hit with the chemical, or else they&rsquo;ll flee into their webs after being sprayed</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s more effective to pour Windex on them since they get stuck in the liquid, but this will also kill any eggs that may be nearby
The Sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate accumulates and clings on the spiders air sacs, blocking the path of air into its respiratory system. Ammonium hydroxide is absorbed into the spiders bloodstream causing respiratory failure.</li>
<li>Therefore, oxygen is not absorbed by the blood in the spider&rsquo;s book lungs. Oxygen will get absorbed by ammonia instead of red blood cells. This means that when the bugs inhale Windex, it will suffocate (die) because there is no oxygen left for them to breathe.
Also, Ammonium (ammonia dissolved in water) is also a repellant for
<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Spider-Repellent-at-Home">insects like ants, termites, and fruit flies</a>
. Windex will release unpleasant gas that protects your house from these bugs. Windex is safe to use on surfaces, but you should not be in the room while it is being used.
However, when you use it to control kill stinging insects like bees, be careful because you may get stung before exterminating the insect.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-water-in-windex-drowns-spiders">2. Water in Windex Drowns Spiders</h3>
<p>The water in the Windex degreaser will drown insects including spiders and their eggs.
The Windex will lower the oxygen level in a spiders web and so it suffocates spiders by depriving them of air.
Water, with its higher surface tension, will also break the spiders web and force them to relocate.
Windex can kill spider mites with its liquid form, but it will not be as effective against other household pests such as ants or fruit flies because of their tiny size.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-time-does-windex-take-to-kill-spiders">How long (time) Does Windex Take to kill Spiders?</h2>
<p>Windex kills spiders on contact. It will take 1 to 15 minutes (maximum) to kill the spider when it is sprayed in a room and inhaled by a spider.
Windex will kill spiders based on the following factors:</p>
<h3 id="1-windex"><strong>1. Windex&rsquo;s Ammonia Concentration</strong></h3>
<p>Spiders react differently when exposed to ammonia gas in Windex (varied
concentration of ammonia
. If the concentration is high, it will kill them faster. But, if it is lower, it will take a little longer for them to die.
The size and age of the spider will also affect how long it takes to kill it. The older they are, the more time Windex needs to take effect on them.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, household Windex usually contains a small concentration�of ammonia<a href="https://www.immaculatejanitorialservices.com/2012/03/windex-not-just-for-cleaning-glass/">0.05 to 0.1 (5% - 10%)</a>, which will kill baby spiders and eggs - this may not kill large spiders instantly on contact.
The concentration of ammonia in Windex can be increased by adding more or less water to it. This will speed up the process, but increase cost and housekeeping time.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-area-sprayed-sq-feet">**2. Area Sprayed (**sq. feet)</h3>
<p>It takes more than one can/bottle of Windex to cover a large area of the spiders(more than 200sq feet) and kill or exterminate the spiders and their eggs.
Make sure the floors are sufficiently saturated with the ammonia in Windex before moving on to another area; otherwise, you will leave some spiders alive and well.
The ammonia in Windex does not cause any long-term damage to your floors. You can use it again and again without worry about damaging the surface.
Windex is perfect for killing house flies on hard surfaces such as counters or tables with a minimum amount of cleaning needed afterward.</p>
<h3 id="3-closed-or-open-space-">**3. Closed or Open Space? **</h3>
<p>Windex spray kills spiders faster in enclosed rooms than it does in open spaces or fields.
*Why does Windex kill spiders faster in enclosed rooms than it does in open spaces? *
Well, Windex sprayed in small, enclosed areas of a house or compound is more effective than spraying it around an entirely open space. It concentrates ammonia gas in a smaller space and the spider will die from suffocation instead of contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>To kill spiders, use Windex spray and direct it to the spider&rsquo;s hideouts in your house. Spiders hide in holes, cracks, and closets.
If the area is open or out in the field, it will be harder to kill bugs because the winds will blow off the Windex spray and thus kill fewer spiders.
If you&rsquo;re spraying indoors be sure not to miss any corners and to get any cracks or crevices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-windex-to-kill-spiders">How to Use Windex to Kill Spiders</h2>
<p>Windex is a product that you spray onto surfaces to clean them. You will need to follow these steps when using it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you use Windex, wear goggles and a nose mask to protect your eye and respiratory system respectively. Ammonium can make your eyes hurt or give you a headache. You might even have trouble breathing.</li>
<li>Spiders like to make their homes in holes, cracks, furniture, garages, rocks, and cobwebs. You can find the hiding spaces without disturbing the bugs.</li>
<li>If you are going to use Windex in your house, lock all the windows and doors.
Now, remove the top protection seal of the Windex bottle.</li>
<li>Shake the bottle well to release all of the liquid and separate any clumps that may have formed while it was sitting on a shelf.</li>
<li>Point the Windex&rsquo;s nozzle on the spider&rsquo;s hiding place. Then press the trigger to start spraying.</li>
<li>Spray the spider infestation and then leave before they attack.
Next, you will also need to spray other places within the room (to saturation) to boost Windex&rsquo;s killing power.</li>
<li>Lock the room for 30 to 60 minutes so Windex works well.</li>
<li>After the prescribed time, open the windows and doors to allow fresh air in for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Windex is for outside use only. If you are using Windex in an open area, cover the spider&rsquo;s hiding places with a bucket so they cannot escape before dying. You will also want to use Windex with a higher concentration.
NB: Windex is great to kill spiders in an indoor space. If you have a spider infestation that takes a while to die, I recommend that you use another type of spider killer or trap.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-windex-does-not-have-ammonia">Which Windex Does not Have ammonia?</h2>
<p>Windex, a glass degreaser is made from surfactants, solvents, ammonia, dyes, and fragrances.
Thus, ingesting Windex may cause vomiting, stomach upset, and minor throat and mouth irritation.

<li>Disinfectant Cleaner Multi-Surface</li>
<li>Vinegar Glass Cleaner</li>
<li>Ammonia-Free Glass Cleaner
However, for spider and insect control, we recommend using a Windex version that has ammonia.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-windex-kill-insects">Can Windex Kill Insects?</h2>
<p>Windex can kill other insects, such as spiders, bumblebees, wasps, ants, spider mites, and beetles. Spray them if they are near the colony and they will be dead in seconds.
Windex is quick-acting when you need to kill small insects and won&rsquo;t require special concentration packages. It is safe to use on regular household surfaces.
Windex will kill these bugs by blocking their breathing (spiracles). It does this because ammonia stays in the blood cells within hemocoel in insects&rsquo; bodies, and suffocating due to insufficient supply/circulation of oxygen.
Moreover, Windex (the ammonium component) will make these insects go away. The smell of ammonia makes them leave.</p>
<h2 id="is-windex-poisonous-to-humans-and-pets">Is Windex Poisonous to Humans and Pets?</h2>
<p>Windex contains chemicals that can be bad for humans and pets. The chemicals Ammonium hydroxide can hurt their skin and respiratory system. It can cause watery eyes or a burning skin sensation.
The fragrance and dye in Windex can cause problems with your respiratory systems. It also causes trouble for people who are allergic to it. The spray may also make your pets cough abnormally and even get choked.
Chemicals like
<a href="https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/2505-windexoriginalglasscleanerwithammoniad">Hexoxyethanol</a>
, Isopropanolamine, and Sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate can make you burn if they touch your skin or when they are breathed in. They can also cause irritation over time.
Note: When you are praying Windex, it is important to wear eye protection, gloves for your hands, and a breathing mask.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-methods-to-kill-spiders">Alternative Methods to Kill spiders?</h2>
<p>Apart from Windex, you can use the following substances or methods to kill spiders.
**1. Use of Vinegar **
Vinegar is a weak acid of pH between 4 to 8 that emits a smell that keeps off spiders in your house or compound without necessarily killing them. You will require to mix 1 cup of vinegar with 5 cups of water. Then, spray the concoction in the spiders hideouts to saturation. You will need to spray the mixture twice per day for 10 to 15 days.
You can also blend white vinegar with coconut oil in a 5:1 ratio. The coconut oil will form a thick layer on their body, blocking their respiratory system. Also, the mixture emits an unbearable smell that keeps off spiders.
You will have to spray this mixture daily for 2 to 6 weeks for the complete elimination of spiders in your home. This combination is friendly as it cause no adverse effect on the user on the application.
<strong>2. Using Black peppers.</strong>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your home has dust (which is practically in every home) there will be dust mites. These pests will eat dead skin flakes that have been shared by pets and humans.
The microscopic organisms (invisible)
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-dust-mites-bite/">won&rsquo;t bite humans</a>
like is the case with
bed bugs or head lice
.
If you have an indoor allergy, then dust mites can worsen your symptoms and so it is important to control them in your house.
Unfortunately, dust mites are microscopic pests. This makes it difficult to control the bugs when you can&rsquo;t even see them.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will find dust mites in the areas of your house that trap dust or where you stay for long such as carpeting, fabrics, and mattresses that aren&rsquo;t washed regularly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="description-of-dust-mites">Description of Dust Mites</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/allergens/dustmites/index.cfm">NIEHS</a>
define dust mites as tiny (microscopic)
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/">pests that look like insects</a>
and reside in house dust.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dust mites feed on dander - which are peelings of dead skin that are shed by pets and humans.
Immunologists and allergists note that dust mites are major irritants that will worsen asthmatic symptoms and spark allergic attacks.</li>
<li>However, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about dust mites if they do not cause allergic reactions to you.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hF8y41KXDM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hF8y41KXDM</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-dust-mites-make-humans-sick">How Dust Mites Make Humans Sick</h2>
<p>From the onset, I have to say that dust mites do not bite humans.
However, humans get sick when they get exposed to dust <a href="/posts/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/">mite</a> proof or faces, especially for people who have dust mite allergies.
The dust mite poop contains proteins that are perfectly sized and they will trigger allergy symptoms for anyone who is allergic to dust mites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, these foreign allergens (dust mites) are very common in the environment and so they will reach many people.
The symptoms of allergic reactions caused by dust mites will include difficulty breathing, wheezing, runny nose, and sneezing - these are the common signs of hay fever allergy and asthma.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-will-the-dust-mites-live">Where Will the Dust Mites live?</h2>
<p>In your house, dust mites will hide in areas that have dust such as curtains, carpeting, mattress, upholstered furniture, and bedding.
So, it is possible to control dust mite allergy (for the people its effects) by reducing the number of dust mites roaming in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, doctors may prescribe medications to manage asthma and leave the dust mite allergy symptoms.
<a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(02)91278-9/fulltext">Clinical Immunology</a>
reports that over 80% of US homes have dust mites on one of their beds.
So if you notice that you are sneezing when it is not allergy season yet, there could be dust mites in your spaces.
Pets will shed dead skin cells that will feed the dust mites and transport them around or into the house.
Because dust mites eat dead skin, you find them in high numbers in areas such as couches, mattresses, pillows, and rugs.
Dust mites will not remain in the air for a long time as they will settle quickly after they are disturbed.
However, the presence of dust mites in your house does not imply that you are unclean.</li>
<li>This is because every home (except in high attributes, and arid or dry climates) has some amount of dust mites settled somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symptoms-of-allergies-resulting-from-dust-mite">Symptoms of Allergies Resulting from Dust Mite</h2>
<p>The symptoms and signs of having a dust mite allergy in humans will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worsening eczema</li>
<li>Skin itching</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Ear canal itching</li>
<li>Coughing</li>
<li>Postnasal drip</li>
<li>Drippy nose</li>
<li>Sneezing</li>
<li>Watery and itchy eyes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-control-dust-mites">How to control dust mites</h2>
<h3 id="1-clean-the-bedding-regularly">1. Clean the Bedding Regularly</h3>
<p>Dust mites will thrive and reproduce better in a moist and warm environment where there are dead skin cells - this is the full description of most of our beds.
You should, therefore, change the bed linen regularly and also clean the bedding well if you need to control the dust mites.</p>
<ul>
<li>I advised to wash the bedding well using hot water (130 + degrees Fahrenheit) - this will kill the dust mites and remove various allergens.
The non-washable items on your bed must be closed into the dryer and the highest heat setting for about 20 minutes every week.
Also, you can freeze the non-washable items (inside some plastic bags) for about 24 hours to kill the dust mites.</li>
<li>This method (freezing) however won&rsquo;t remove the various allergens from the negotiable items.
For the kid&rsquo;s bedroom, wash the stuffed toys and animals using hot water.</li>
<li>Also, reduce the stuffed toys and animals that are in the kids bedroom.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2use-a-mattress-encasement">2.Use a mattress encasement</h3>
<p>Using a protective covering for the mattress will also help control the dust mites in your house.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also use similar coverings on the pillows and box springs
Ensure the coverings or the replacement are dust mite proof - some of the recommended ones are the zippered covers.</li>
<li>The dust mites therefore will be starved to death as they cannot access the dead skin cells.
However, experts recommend that you must steam clean the mattress twice yearly even after using the protective covering to kill the dust mites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-remove-the-wall-to-wall-house-carpeting">3. Remove the Wall-to-Wall House Carpeting</h3>
<p>Dust mites will love the carpeting that is in your house covering wall to wall since it allows dust to settle and also holds the dead skin cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such carpets, due to their size and material, are challenging to clean regularly.
So, if any member of the house has an allergy triggered by dust mites, you are required to remove the wall-to-wall carpeting.
Suitable materials that can replace the wall-to-wall carpeting include vinyl, tile, laminate, and wood - these will be easy to clean and mop daily.</li>
<li>However you can improve the comfort of your underfoot by using some area rugs that are easily washable.
Vacuuming the carpet (
with HEPA filter
) is the next advisable method when the wall-to-wall carpeting cannot be removed.
Also, you should still clean the carpeting occasionally but ensure the temperature of the steamer is 200 + degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-lower-the-house-temperatures">4. Lower The House Temperatures</h3>
<p>Dust mites will experience challenges reproducing when the temperatures are low.</p>
<ul>
<li>So it is advisable to lower the temperatures of the various rooms in your house to control the dust mites.
Dust mites will breed and multiply optimally at temperatures that are between 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit.
It is advisable therefore 2 have the room temperatures in your house be anywhere outside this range.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-lower-the-rooms-relative-humidity">5. Lower the Rooms&rsquo; Relative Humidity</h3>
<p>As noted above, dust mites will thrive in humid and moist conditions.
First, I know that most homeowners will clear steam in spaces such as the bathroom using some venting fan.
Other conditions will increase the humidity in the house: these will include improper ductwork, damp crawl spaces, and leaky windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can measure and control the humidity in the rooms using a hygrometer.</li>
<li>Maintain the relative humidity at under 50% to control dust mites.
Steps that you can take to lower the humidity levels in the rooms include using venting systems and fans, installing a dehumidifier, installing various moisture barriers, and treating the damp basements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-reduce-clutter-and-improve-the-hvac-air-filters">7. Reduce Clutter and improve the HVAC Air Filters</h3>
<p>Homeowners love keeping more and more items in the house even when the use of such items is limited.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reduced usage of such items will allow them to pick up dust.
So, if you&rsquo;re not using some items and you still need them around, I advise that you keep them in enclosed cabinets or covered boxes to prevent them from picking dust.
The heat pump system in your house will affect the amount of airflow available and also how much dust will gather on various items.
So, it will be good to install some air purifiers that will capture the dust mites before they get into the house.</li>
<li>How to also advise that you replace the air filters in the HVAC system
Regular and effective cleaning of the filters will reduce the dust mites in the house.</li>
<li>The filters to be cleaned regularly include those in the vacuums,clothes dryers, dehumidifiers, humidifiers, air purifiers and air conditioners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dust mites are closely related to spiders and ticks but they are microscopic in size.
On diet, as noted earlier, dust mites will eat the skin cells that are shed by humans and pets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to painting your home or project, choosing the right type of paint can make a big difference in the final result. Two of the most common types of paint are enamel and <a href="/posts/best-paint-brushes-for-latex-paint/">latex</a> paint. In this article, we will compare <a href="/posts/how-to-thin-enamel-paint/">enamel</a> paint and latex paint to help you decide which one is best for your needs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-enamel-paint">What is Enamel Paint?</h2>
<p>Enamel paint is a type of oil-based or water-based paint that dries to a hard, glossy finish. It is typically used for surfaces that need to be durable, such as doors, trim, cabinets, and metal surfaces. Enamel paint is known for its ability to resist scratches, stains, and wear, making it an excellent choice for high-traffic areas or surfaces exposed to moisture and outdoor elements.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-latex-paint">What is Latex Paint?</h2>
<p>Latex paint is a water-based paint that is popular for interior and exterior surfaces. It is made from acrylic, vinyl, or other synthetic resins and is easy to apply and clean up. Latex paint dries quickly and is available in a wide range of finishes, from matte to glossy. It is less durable than enamel paint, but it is more flexible, making it ideal for use on walls, ceilings, and other areas that experience movement or expansion.</p>
<h2 id="key-differences-between-enamel-and-latex-paint">Key Differences Between Enamel and Latex Paint</h2>
<p>Here are the main differences between enamel and latex paint:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Durability:**Enamel paint is more durable and resistant to wear, scratches, and moisture. It is ideal for high-traffic areas or surfaces exposed to the elements. Latex paint, while durable, is not as resistant to wear and tear and may need to be touched up more often.</li>
<li>**Finish:**Enamel paint provides a smooth, glossy finish that is resistant to stains and dirt. Latex paint can offer a variety of finishes, including matte, satin, and glossy, but it does not achieve the same level of gloss and durability as enamel.</li>
<li>**Drying Time:**Latex paint dries much faster than enamel paint. While latex paint may be dry to the touch within an hour, enamel paint can take several hours or even a day to fully dry.</li>
<li>**Cleanup:**Latex paint is easy to clean with soap and water, while enamel paint, especially oil-based varieties, requires solvents like turpentine or mineral spirits for cleanup.</li>
<li>**Flexibility:**Latex paint is more flexible than enamel, making it better suited for surfaces that expand and contract, such as wood and drywall. Enamel paint can crack or chip if applied to surfaces that move or flex.</li>
<li>**Odor:**Enamel paint, especially oil-based types, can have a strong odor due to the solvents used in its formula. Latex paint has a much milder odor and is generally considered safer for indoor use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-use-enamel-paint">When to Use Enamel Paint</h2>
<p>Enamel paint is best used for surfaces that require a hard, durable finish. It is ideal for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal surfaces (e.g., railings, gates, appliances)</li>
<li>Wood surfaces that need to withstand heavy use (e.g., doors, trim)</li>
<li>Outdoor surfaces exposed to harsh weather conditions</li>
<li>High-traffic areas such as kitchens and bathrooms</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-use-latex-paint">When to Use Latex Paint</h2>
<p>Latex paint is best used for surfaces that do not require as much durability but benefit from quick drying and flexibility. It is ideal for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interior walls and ceilings</li>
<li>Low-traffic areas or decorative surfaces</li>
<li>Surfaces that require frequent repainting</li>
<li>Exteriors in mild climates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both enamel and latex paint have their advantages and are suited for different types of projects. Enamel paint offers superior durability and a glossy finish, making it ideal for high-traffic areas and outdoor surfaces. Latex paint, on the other hand, is easy to apply, dries quickly, and is perfect for indoor applications that require flexibility and a wide range of finishes. Consider your specific needs when choosing between the two types of paint to ensure the best result for your project.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to enhancing the look of your yard or garden, <a href="/posts/house-painting-designs-and-colors/">painting</a> your <a href="/posts/how-to-paint-a-fence-with-a-roller/">fence</a> is one of the easiest and most affordable ways to do so. A freshly painted fence can instantly improve the curb appeal of your property, protect it from the elements, and even add a touch of personality. Here are some creative fence painting ideas to help you choose the best look for your outdoor space.</p>
<h3 id="1-classic-white">1. Classic White</h3>
<p>A classic white fence never goes out of style. Its clean, fresh, and looks great in any setting. White fences complement a wide range of landscaping styles, from traditional to modern, and they add a bright, crisp contrast to lush greenery or vibrant flowers. To keep your white fence looking pristine, you may need to repaint it every few years, as dirt and grime can accumulate over time.</p>
<h3 id="2-bold-and-vibrant-colors">2. Bold and Vibrant Colors</h3>
<p>If you want to make a bold statement, consider painting your fence in vibrant colors like red, blue, or green. These colors can give your yard a playful, eclectic vibe and make it stand out. Bold fence colors work particularly well in gardens or outdoor spaces where you want to create a fun, inviting atmosphere. Just be sure to choose a color that complements the other elements of your garden or yard.</p>
<h3 id="3-natural-wood-stain">3. Natural Wood Stain</h3>
<p>If you prefer a more natural look, a wood stain is a great option. Wood stains bring out the natural grain of the wood while protecting it from the sun and moisture. Whether you opt for a light oak stain or a deeper walnut tone, wood stains create a warm, rustic appearance that blends well with natural surroundings. Additionally, wood stains are often more durable than paint, requiring less maintenance over time.</p>
<h3 id="4-two-toned-or-accent-painting">4. Two-Toned or Accent Painting</h3>
<p>For a more unique look, consider using two tones or accent colors on your fence. This can be done by painting the posts and rails one color while the boards or panels are painted another. For example, you could use a light color for the boards and a dark color for the posts, or vice versa. You could also paint decorative elements like the top of the fence posts with a contrasting color for added flair. This approach adds depth and interest to the design.</p>
<h3 id="5-ombre-effect">5. Ombre Effect</h3>
<p>The ombre effect is a trendy, modern style where the color gradually fades from dark to light (or vice versa). This technique works beautifully for fence painting because it gives the fence a soft, blended look thats both sophisticated and stylish. You can create an ombre effect using shades of the same color or mix in complementary colors to add more dimension and visual interest to your fence.</p>
<h3 id="6-rustic-chalkboard-fence">6. Rustic Chalkboard Fence</h3>
<p>If youre looking for a fun and functional idea, consider painting your fence with chalkboard paint. Chalkboard paint turns your fence into a giant, reusable drawing board. You can use it to write messages, draw artwork, or display seasonal greetings. This is a particularly great idea for families with children or those who like to change up their outdoor decor frequently.</p>
<h3 id="7-transparent-sealer">7. Transparent Sealer</h3>
<p>If you like the natural look of your wooden fence but want to enhance its durability, consider applying a transparent sealer. These sealers protect the wood from moisture, UV rays, and mildew while allowing the natural grain and color of the wood to show through. Transparent sealers are especially useful in areas with harsh weather conditions, as they help maintain the woods integrity and extend its lifespan.</p>
<h3 id="8-dark-and-moody-shades">8. Dark and Moody Shades</h3>
<p>If you want to give your yard a more sophisticated, moody atmosphere, dark shades like charcoal, navy, or even black can create a dramatic effect. Dark colors contrast beautifully with greenery and flowers, making your garden stand out in a subtle, elegant way. Just keep in mind that dark colors can make your yard feel more enclosed, so they work best in larger spaces or areas where you want to create a sense of intimacy.</p>
<h3 id="9-stripes-or-geometric-patterns">9. Stripes or Geometric Patterns</h3>
<p>If youre feeling artistic, consider painting your fence with stripes or other geometric patterns. This style works particularly well with modern or contemporary garden designs and adds a unique, artistic touch to your outdoor space. You can go for bold, contrasting stripes or softer, more subdued patterns depending on the overall look you want to achieve.</p>
<h3 id="10-faux-finishes">10. Faux Finishes</h3>
<p>For a truly distinctive fence, try using faux finishes like stone, brick, or even marble. These finishes can be painted on a wooden fence to create the look of a much more expensive material without the high cost. Faux finishes require some skill and patience to apply, but the result is a one-of-a-kind fence that looks luxurious and stylish.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fence painting is an easy way to update your outdoor space and give your home a fresh, new look. Whether you go for a classic white fence, a bold color, or a rustic natural wood stain, there are countless ways to customize your fence to suit your style and preferences. Remember, the most important thing is to choose a paint or stain that suits your homes aesthetic and protects your fence from the elements. With these fence painting ideas, youre sure to find the perfect design to enhance the beauty of your yard.</p>

      <description>Cockroaches</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach">Cockroaches</a>
are unwelcome visitors in our homes - these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-get-ear-mites-from-dogs/">ear mites will even attack humans</a>
. Majority of roaches hibernate during winter to maintain their warmth. But, some remain active and get into our homes.
<strong>But can I freeze roaches to death? Yes. While this may sound like a lame suggestion, its a low-risk control tactic that wont cost you a dime. Why? Cockroaches die when temperatures fall to a certain level.��</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-can-i-freeze-roaches-to-death"><strong>Details: Can I Freeze Roaches to Death?�</strong></h2>
<p>Roaches prefer temperatures between 25-30 degrees Celsius. When they fall below this level, the roaches will move to a warmer place. This explains why infestations are high in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Although roaches are cold-blooded, they cant make the transition from room temperature to an extremely cold environment in a matter of seconds. Also, you can consider the
best roach killer
.</p>
<p>Cockroaches often die when exposed to temperatures below 15 degrees F. If you move the roaches from room temperature into a sub-zero freezer, they will die within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Its worth mentioning that you can only kill the eggs after prolonged exposure to a cold environment. The best strategy is to put the roaches into a sealed container and then place them into a freezer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DGgnj3L6Jw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DGgnj3L6Jw</a></p>
<h2 id="can-cockroaches-survive-in-winter">Can Cockroaches Survive In Winter?</h2>
<p>Since roaches can adapt to low temperatures, they will adjust to the immediate temperatures and stay warm. There are plenty of ways to avoid that exposure. Maybe you&rsquo;ve just

<ul>
<li>its time to act.</li>
</ul>
<p>Youll often find them creeping to your home when it gets too cold outside. Another survival tactic is to decrease the rate of perspiration and go into a temporary coma.</p>
<p>When the temperatures rise in spring, the nymphs start breeding to continue with the life cycle. According to modern science, roaches adapt to winter in different ways.</p>
<h3 id="1-german-cockroach">1. German cockroach</h3>
<p>German roaches can survive in cold winter months as long as theres ample supply of food. They group to stay warm during winter.</p>
<h3 id="2-american-cockroach">2. American cockroach</h3>
<p>They hide in decaying woodpiles. As the temperature drops, they move indoors.</p>
<h3 id="3-brown-banded-cockroach">3. Brown-banded cockroach</h3>
<p>When temperatures fall below 15 degrees F, they move to apartment buildings and heated kitchens. These roaches are attracted to warmth emitted by electrical appliances and live in high places.</p>
<h3 id="4-oriental-cockroach">4. Oriental cockroach</h3>
<p>They hide in crawlspaces, floor drains, and basements where they can reproduce. Unlike the other species, oriental roaches can tolerate lower temperatures. They mate once a year, especially during cold winter months.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-roaches-survive-in-extremely-low-temperatures">How Long Roaches Survive In Extremely Low Temperatures?</h2>
<p>When the temperature falls below 7 degrees Celsius, a cockroach can die within 10 hours. But this may not be the case when temperatures drop gradually.</p>
<p>When temperatures fall below 0 degrees F, the roaches will die within half an hour. Of course, cockroaches will enter the hibernation-like stage to slow the metabolic rate. Also,

<h2 id="what-do-roaches-do-during-winter">What Do Roaches Do During Winter?</h2>
<p>You may see a few running under the carpets but most of them will move to the kitchen. Here, they can eat and mate just like in normal temperatures. When the temperature rises again, you can easily spot them.
<strong>Can Roaches infestation during winter season?�Yes. This happens when they get inside our homes and hide in a warm place. When its too cold, we use heaters to keep our homes warm.�</strong>
That way, we create a favorable environment where roaches can live. And because roaches are nocturnal, they hide in crevices and behind kitchen appliances.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keeping your pets healthy is a top priority for any <a href="/posts/pet-lizards-that-look-like-dragons/">pet</a> owner. However, sometimes pests like rodents can become a threat to both your home and your pets. <a href="/posts/rodent-control-in-puyallup/">Rodent</a> infestations can lead to health risks for pets, including the spread of diseases, parasites, and even injury from trapped rodents. Effective rodent control not only protects your pets but also helps maintain a clean and safe living environment. In this article, well explore how to keep your pets safe and healthy by controlling rodent populations in and around your home.</p>
<h2 id="why-rodent-control-is-important-for-pets">Why Rodent Control is Important for Pets</h2>
<p>Rodents such as rats and mice are known to carry a variety of diseases and parasites that can affect both humans and animals. Some of the most common risks to pets from rodents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Diseases:**Rodents can transmit diseases such as leptospirosis, hantavirus, and salmonella, which can be harmful to both pets and humans.</li>
<li>**Parasites:**Rodents are often carriers of fleas, ticks, and mites that can infest your pets, leading to skin irritation, allergic reactions, and more serious health issues.</li>
<li>**Physical Harm:**Trapped rodents, particularly aggressive ones like rats, may bite or scratch pets in self-defense. This can result in injury or infection.
By controlling rodent populations, you are helping protect your pets from these dangers and ensuring their well-being.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-control-rodents-and-protect-your-pets">How to Control Rodents and Protect Your Pets</h2>
<p>There are various methods for controlling rodents that will help protect your pets from harm. Here are some tips on effective rodent control:</p>
<h3 id="1-seal-entry-points">1. Seal Entry Points</h3>
<p>One of the first steps in controlling rodents is preventing them from entering your home in the first place. Inspect your home for possible entry points, such as cracks in the walls, gaps around windows and doors, or holes around plumbing and electrical lines. Seal these openings with caulk, steel wool, or other materials to block rodents from entering.</p>
<h3 id="2-use-pet-safe-rodent-traps">2. Use Pet-Safe Rodent Traps</h3>
<p>If you suspect a rodent infestation, opt for humane traps that catch rodents without harming them. These traps allow you to relocate the animals outside, away from your pets. Always check the traps regularly and avoid using poison, as it can be harmful to pets if ingested.</p>
<h3 id="3-eliminate-food-sources">3. Eliminate Food Sources</h3>
<p>Rodents are often attracted to food, so its essential to keep your home clean and free of food crumbs. Store pet food, human food, and birdseed in sealed containers. Ensure that your pets&rsquo; feeding areas are clean and that any leftover food is promptly removed.</p>
<h3 id="4-maintain-a-clean-and-tidy-home">4. Maintain a Clean and Tidy Home</h3>
<p>Rodents thrive in cluttered environments where they can hide and nest. Keep your home clean by regularly vacuuming, sweeping, and removing clutter. Pay particular attention to areas where food is stored and where your pets spend time.</p>
<h3 id="5-use-natural-repellents">5. Use Natural Repellents</h3>
<p>Natural rodent repellents, such as peppermint oil, can deter rodents without posing a risk to your pets. You can place cotton balls soaked in peppermint oil in areas where rodents may enter or hide. Additionally, certain plants like lavender and bay leaves have been shown to repel rodents.</p>
<h3 id="6-regular-veterinary-checkups">6. Regular Veterinary Checkups</h3>
<p>Ensure your pets are regularly checked by a veterinarian to stay on top of any potential health issues related to rodent exposure, such as flea infestations or parasitic infections. Regular vet visits also help keep your pets up to date on vaccinations, which can protect them from diseases carried by rodents.</p>
<h2 id="rodent-control-products-safe-for-pets">Rodent Control Products Safe for Pets</h2>
<p>If you need to use rodent control products, look for ones that are specifically labeled as safe for homes with pets. Here are some pet-safe options:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Non-toxic rodent bait:**Many companies offer non-toxic rodent baits that are safe for pets but still effective at attracting and eliminating rodents.</li>
<li>**Electronic rodent repellers:**These devices emit high-frequency sound waves that deter rodents without affecting pets.</li>
<li>**Pet-safe traps:**As mentioned, traps that do not use poison are ideal for rodent control in a pet-friendly environment.
Its important to always follow the manufacturers instructions and monitor the use of any products in a household with pets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rodent control is crucial for the health and safety of your pets. By taking proactive steps such as sealing entry points, using pet-safe traps, and keeping your home clean, you can effectively manage rodent populations while minimizing risks to your pets. Always prioritize your pets well-being when choosing rodent control methods, and be sure to consult your veterinarian if you notice any health issues related to rodent exposure. With the right precautions in place, you can create a safe, pest-free environment for both you and your pets.</p>

      <description>Soil treatment for termites with</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soil treatment for termites with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-termite-killer/">chemical termite killers</a>
like fipronil and imidacloprid is the most common termite-removal method.
<em>Termites can eat your home&rsquo;s structural beams causing significant damage. But, which are the best home remedies for termites? One that&rsquo;s effective, budget-friendly, yet safe to the environment?�</em>
<em>In summary, the home remedies for termites (including dry wood�termites) include wet cardboard, orange oil, perimeter barrier, sunlight, nematodes, vinegar, and borates.�</em></p>
<h2 id="home-remedy-for-termites">Home Remedy for Termites</h2>
<p>These insects, like damp wood and dry wood termites, can be
<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Termites">challenging and expensive to control</a>
. So, how you treat the house for termites naturally?</p>
<h3 id="1-wet-cardboard-trap">1. Wet Cardboard Trap</h3>
<p>Do you corrugated boxes in the storage closet or garage? Then you have a great tool to make your termite trap.�Termites love water plus cellulose - so the wet cardboard (contains cellulose) will attract the termites.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick several cardboard pieces (flat strips), wet the cardboard, and position where you suspect a termite colony will pass or are already settled.</li>
<li>Next, termites will settle on the wet cardboard box as they feed on cellulose. Putting the cardboard bait down lures the termites to come together to a single point where you can control them.</li>
<li>After the termites have steeled on the wet cellulose cardboard, pick it with the bugs and burn it outside. This will kill all the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-a-termite-look-like/">termites and their babies</a>. Repeat this process until you can no longer see the termites moving around.</li>
<li>However, the wet cardboard trap won&rsquo;t remove the whole termite colony, and thus you&rsquo;ll need to couple this with other termite prevention methods.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-orange-oil">2. Orange Oil</h3>
<p>D-limonene is an active ingredient in orange oil, and it&rsquo;s highly poisonous to termites. It works, through direct contact, by breaking the termite&rsquo;s exoskeletons and killing its eggs.
But orange oil can also be used in fumigation to kill
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">termites - but works better</a>
as a spot treatment.
Orange oil is extracted from the orange peels or oranges rinds used in making several food additives and cleaning products like drain cleaners.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the termite inspection is costly for you, try DIY methods like sight inspections to advanced tactics, including sniffing dogs, audio detection, or bore-scope cameras.</li>
<li>Apply the orange oil into termite holes and other such openings using an injecting syringe on various affected building components, including wood.</li>
<li>So, you&rsquo;ll inject the orange oil into the hollowed-out sections of the wood since that&rsquo;s where the termites, their eggs, and babies live.</li>
<li>But be cautious as orange oil can irritate your eyes and skin - it must also not be ingested as it may lead to lung irritation.</li>
<li>However, for fumigation, double bag any edibles in the house, including pet food, before you commence the termite treatment process.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3-perimeter-barrier">3. Perimeter Barrier</h3>
<p>This involves creating a perimeter
<a href="https://www.termite.com/Termite-Barrier-Treatments.pdf">barrier against termites</a>
to protect your home and other built structures. Ideally, the perimeter barrier should have been made during the house building process.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, if not, you&rsquo;ll require to install your won barrier despite it being labor-intensive.</li>
<li>Jig small trenches around the house on the ground where you&rsquo;ll put your barrier.
[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;600&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<p>Image Source:
<a href="https://pestsolutions365.com//termites-101/full-perimeter-treatment/">PestSolutions365</a>
[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, apply the right termite treatment in the barrier trenches, and this will protect your structures against subterranean termites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-vinegar-for-termites">4. Vinegar for Termites</h3>
<p>Vinegar is an excellent home solution for controlling household and other termites. Mainly, this solution is used in cleaning showers or kitchen counters.
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/termites-how-identify-and-control-them">EPA</a>
outlines that nematodes are very effective in controlling termites in the lab. Vinegar is acidic, and thus it&rsquo;ll kill the termites readily on contact - but you&rsquo;ll need to spray regularly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix lemon juice (from 2 lemons) with 1/2 full cup of the vinegar. Now, put the &ldquo;juice&rdquo; into the spray bottle since it allows easier dispensing on termite-infested spots.</li>
<li>Spray the Vinegar-lemon mixture on termite mounds and hole entrances that are in or around your house. Spray on garden fences, wooden structures, plus corners of different structures.</li>
<li>Allow the vinegar mixture to slowly seep into the holes and cracks to kill the nasty termites.</li>
<li>After 3-7 days, conduct a termite inspection tosee if the bugshave died. Repeat the treatment if you notice signs of termites or their babies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-beneficial-nematodes">5. Beneficial Nematodes</h3>
<p>Nematodes enter the termite&rsquo;s body and start feeding on its blood and muscles. The parasitic roundworms release bacteria, and this causes blood poisoning for the termites, causing death. Nematodes are effective in killing termites.
You can purchase beneficial nematodes in different local or online stores to control invasive termites. Once the termite dies, the nematodes continue multiplying and move onto their next host and poison it to death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix the nematodes (the microscopic roundworms) with some water. But first, requirements are nematodes, water,�spraying bottle, stirring stick, and bowl.</li>
<li>Fill the bowl with water and pout the nematodes into it, ready to control the nematodes. Use the stirring stick to mix up the nematodes with the water. Leave for 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Put the nematode-water mixture into some spraying bottle and spray on places with a termite infestation or passing routes. Begin spraying from your backyard.</li>
<li>Ensure your spray holds the highest pressure, as this will help prevent blockage. Shake your sprayer while continuing with the spraying to prevent the nematodes from settling at the bottom of the bottle.
Caution: Spray at sunset or early morning as this is when the nematodes will be highly active. Further, the ground temperature must be below 60F to prevent nematode death.</li>
<li>One package of nematodes can treat an area of about 1,600 square feet for termites. The nematodes will be in powder or granule form to allow easier mixing and dissolving.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd8P5Nv7MLA&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd8P5Nv7MLA&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-borates">6. Borates</h3>
<p>Borax powder (Sodium borate) is mainly used as a laundry cleaner, but it&rsquo;s also an effective home remedy for controlling termites. You can mix the borax with water and spray or sprinkle the powered around the house - see
<a href="http://nisuscorp.com/pest-management-professionals/products/bora-care#The-Science-Behind-Bora-Care">this guide</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borates applied on the foundation penetrations, expansion joints, plumbing penetrations, concrete, and wood surfaces will penetrate and offer extended termite control. Keep the surfaces sealed to protect them from moisture.
Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) is the chemical component of borates is safe for plants and humans but relatively toxic to fungi and insects.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZFXPLG_Uy0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZFXPLG_Uy0</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Besides the home termite control methods outlined above, I recommend taking preventive measures against the bugs and their babies.
Keep any cellulose, cardboard, firewood, or wood away from the house as they tend to attract termites into the yard and home. Also, ensure adequate drainage and excellent ventilation for the interior and exterior of your house.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Lizard Lifespan - Probably you have come across the house lizard (commonly known as house gecko) in your house, yard, compound or zoo and wonder how long
these vertebrate
s live. Could House Lizards live just like human beings or survive for a couple of weeks?
<em>So, whats the house lizards lifespan?�</em>
**The simple answer is, house lizard live for 4 to 6 years on average. However, this lifespan is subject to factors such as the care given, environment/climate and availability of basic needs for the house lizard. **
<strong>Some house lizards may even live slightly longer than 6 years if the above factors are maintained. On the other hand, skin shedding problems and wounding occurrences may lower the lifespan of the house lizards.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for House Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-house-lizard-lifespan">What&rsquo;s the House Lizard Lifespan?</h2>
<p>The house lizard (also known as house gecko) has a life span of 4 to 6 years on average. This period is subjects to factors such as environment/climate, care given and availability of basic needs.
Most of the house lizards are faced with problems of wounding and skin shedding which lower their life span. For those house lizards that are well taken care of, they live slightly longer than 6 years.
The oldest House Lizard that ever lived recorded 27 years. House lizards are known to hatch in 60 days after which they grow to maturity in a couple of months (12 months) before breeding.

What Does a Garden Lizard Eat?</p>
<h2 id="general-factors-that-affect-the-lifespan-of-house-lizard"><strong>General Factors that affect the Lifespan of House Lizard</strong></h2>
<p>The lifespan of the House lizard is affected by the following factors.
<strong>1. Environment/Climatic conditions.</strong>
House lizards are known to live in warm environment. Being cold blooded (ectothermic), these reptiles are adversely affected by change in temperature (sudden rise or fall). You must ensure that your pet house lizard has suitable/optimal warmth in its cage.
House lizards living in cold climates live lesser years as compare to those living in warm temperate climate. This is because cold environment makes house lizards less active (inactive) forcing them to hibernate till summer.
The environment full of predators such as cats, dogs, snakes, skinks etc. posts risks to life house lizards. Most of house lizards are fed on by their predators before they reach full maturity. Large water bodies easily drown the house lizards since they tend to
walk on water instead of swimming
.
Very hot climate/environment like desert will kill the house lizards faster due to their ectothermic nature. Their body enzymes (protein in nature) are denatured by high temperature leading to death.
<strong>2. Availability of basic needs.</strong>
House lizards requires basic needs such as proper habitat, food and water and right care. The habitat should entail nice cage with proper lighting and temperature. The cage should also have a hideout option for your house lizard and comfortable beddings (leaves or plant materials that does not cause discomfort).
The presence of food and water is vital for the survival of house lizard. Provide a variety of food such as crickets, ants, flies, leafhoppers, mealworms, grasshoppers, moths, soft shell beetles, pupae of butterflies and moths to your pet house lizard. Lizards that lack enough food and water die earlier (short life span  less than 18 months)
Provide the right amount of water for your house lizard in shallow bowls and make sure you replace it regularly. You can even provide a small pod in the cage for your house lizard to swim. Lack of right basic needs for your house lizard will reduce its life span.
<strong>3. Care given.</strong>
Proper care is vital for the house lizard if you need to boost its lifespan.� Ensure that you take your pet house lizards to veterinary regularly. Monitor the health of your house lizard every 48 hours. Clean the cage regularly and quarantine new pet house lizards for the first one to two months.
Provide stimulation such as mist spay that cause house lizards to relax and active within the cage. You can have rocks, hollows, plants and hideouts within the cage. You can even hide food for your house lizard to make it do something else.
House lizards that have been given continuous proper care have lived even more than 6 years.</p>
<h2 id="health-problems-that-affect-the-lifespan-of-house-lizard"><strong>Health Problems That Affect the Lifespan of House Lizard�</strong></h2>
<p>The following are problems that affects the lifespan of the House Lizards mostly:
<strong>1. Wounding Problem.</strong>
House lizards have soft skin that is easily wounded. Scratch from the walls or spikes on the house lizards skin cause mild to severe wounds.
Normally, House Lizards would prefer to roll on soft surfaces. You must ensure that the substrate in the cage does not cause injuries on landing or while moving about. You can also provide some soft beddings in your House lizards hideout.
House lizard are easily wounded when they fall due to their soft skin. Their skin also get ruptured by impact force. The scratch from the paws of the other lizards while playing cause back and skin wounds. These would leads to severe bleeding and their autotomy nature (self-amputation of tail in case of danger) may lead to death if not attended.
Lizards that are often wounded have lower lifespan (1 to 2 years) whereas those house lizards that are less wounded have longer lifespan (4 to 6 years).�NB: In case your pet lizards are wounded, seek quick medication from your vet.
<strong>2. Skin Shedding Problem.</strong>
House Lizards do shed their skin often (after every 4 to 6 weeks). They, then, eat their skin such that you may not notice easily. However, their skin color change can be noticed.
Contrary, some house lizards have problem while shedding their skin. You will notice a thick/excess skin at the neck, back/dorsal, tail, at the head and around the eye due to the unshed skin. This skin cause extreme pain, unhappiness and continued discomfort to your house lizard.
Seek your veterinary assistance to help remove excess unshed skin on your pet house lizard.
<strong>3. Loss of Tail.</strong>
House lizards have tendency of losing their tail in case of attack as a defense mechanism. This cause the gecko to lose a lot of energy during replacement. In addition, the regeneration of the tail takes longer and makes your house lizard less active as compared to other tailed house lizards.
In case your house lizard undergoes through a several loss of tail, it will die earlier (less than 2 years) than its expected time even if normal care is carried out.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-bones/">Do lizards have bones</a>
?
To prolong the lifespan of your pet house lizard, do not hold it by the tail. Instead, lift your house lizard by the chest. Moreover, do not cause tension to your house lizard while in its cage too.</p>
<h2 id="weird-life-behaviors-of-house-lizard">Weird Life Behaviors of House Lizard</h2>
<p>House lizard has several weird behaviors that you may need to know. These behaviors include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eating their own shed skin</strong>. Gecko eat their skin -<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">using their teeth</a>- as soon as it is shed. You may not notice that, however, you will find a change in its new skin color.</li>
<li>**Female is parthenogenesis.**This mean that the female house lizard does not need a male to reproduce always. It have ability to reproduce without mating with male. However, it has been found that such offspring lack a certain gene needed for diversity.</li>
<li>**Lack eyelids and lick their eyes.**Unlike human beings, house lizards do not have eyelids. Instead, their eyelids forms a colorless membrane that protect the eyes. To moisten the eyes when dry, the house lizard licks them often unlike in human where eyes are moisten automatically by the eyelids.</li>
<li>**Have autonomy capability.**This means that house lizards can cause self-amputation of their tail. This is done when the gecko detects danger during which it uses this method as a defense mechanism since the predator your tend feed on the tail and let go the lizard.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the right house <a href="/posts/fence-painting-ideas/">painting</a> designs and colors can be a fun yet challenging task. The colors you choose for your home can influence the mood of each room and can even impact the value of your property. Whether you are updating the exterior or refreshing the interior, the right design and colors are key to achieving the look you want. In this guide, we will explore various <a href="/posts/house-lizard-lifespan/">house</a> painting designs and color schemes to help you make informed decisions for your home.</p>
<h3 id="why-house-painting-matters">Why House Painting Matters</h3>
<p>House painting does more than just improve the aesthetic appeal of your home; it offers several practical benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Protection:**A fresh coat of paint protects surfaces from environmental elements like moisture, mold, and UV rays, especially on exterior walls.</li>
<li>**Value Increase:**Well-maintained and stylishly painted homes often have better resale value, as a fresh coat of paint can give your property a new, well-cared-for appearance.</li>
<li>**Personalization:**The choice of colors and designs allows you to express your personal style and create an atmosphere that matches your preferences.</li>
<li>**Durability:**The right type of paint can enhance the durability of your walls, making them easier to clean and maintain over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exterior-painting-designs-and-colors">Exterior Painting Designs and Colors</h3>
<p>The exterior of your home is the first thing people see, so choosing the right colors and design is essential to making a positive impression. Here are some popular exterior painting ideas:</p>
<h4 id="1-traditional-color-schemes">1. Traditional Color Schemes</h4>
<p>Classic color schemes remain timeless and elegant. Neutral tones such as whites, grays, beige, or soft taupes are perfect for creating a clean, sophisticated exterior. These colors work well with various architectural styles, including Colonial, Victorian, and Craftsman homes. You can add contrasting trim colors like deep green, navy blue, or charcoal gray to highlight architectural features like windows, doors, and moldings.</p>
<h4 id="2-bold-color-choices">2. Bold Color Choices</h4>
<p>If you want to make a bold statement, consider using brighter and more vibrant colors for your exterior. Colors like teal, mustard yellow, or deep red can create an eye-catching effect. Pair these bold shades with neutral accents such as white or black for balance. Bold colors work best with modern or contemporary homes and are ideal for creating a unique and personalized exterior.</p>
<h4 id="3-earthy-tones">3. Earthy Tones</h4>
<p>Earthy tones such as browns, terracotta, olive greens, and muted oranges are perfect for homes with natural surroundings, such as those with large gardens or near wooded areas. These colors blend harmoniously with the environment and create a warm, inviting exterior. Pair earthy tones with stone or wooden textures to enhance the natural look.</p>
<h4 id="4-monochromatic-palette">4. Monochromatic Palette</h4>
<p>A monochromatic color scheme uses different shades of the same color to create depth and visual interest. For example, you can use various shades of gray or blue, from light to dark, to paint the walls, trim, and accent features of your home. This design is simple yet elegant and works well with modern, minimalist, and contemporary homes.</p>
<h3 id="interior-painting-designs-and-colors">Interior Painting Designs and Colors</h3>
<p>When it comes to interior house painting, colors play a significant role in setting the tone and atmosphere of each room. The right design and color scheme can make a small space feel larger, create a cozy atmosphere, or enhance the functionality of a room. Here are some popular interior painting ideas:</p>
<h4 id="1-light-and-airy-colors">1. Light and Airy Colors</h4>
<p>Light, neutral colors like soft whites, light grays, pale blues, and pastel shades can help make small rooms feel more spacious and open. These colors reflect light, giving your home a fresh and airy feel. They work well in living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens where you want to create a bright, welcoming atmosphere.</p>
<h4 id="2-dark-and-moody-colors">2. Dark and Moody Colors</h4>
<p>If youre aiming for a more dramatic and intimate ambiance, dark colors like deep blues, charcoal, or forest greens can add depth to your interiors. These colors are ideal for creating a cozy atmosphere in bedrooms or creating a sophisticated vibe in living rooms. Pair dark walls with lighter furniture and decor to maintain balance.</p>
<h4 id="3-bold-accents">3. Bold Accents</h4>
<p>For a contemporary and lively design, consider using bold accent colors. You can choose bright and vibrant hues like mustard yellow, coral, or teal for accent walls or to highlight architectural features. Bold accents work well in spaces like home offices, dining rooms, or bathrooms, where you want to introduce energy and personality without overwhelming the entire space.</p>
<h4 id="4-color-blocking">4. Color Blocking</h4>
<p>Color blocking is a modern design trend where two or more contrasting colors are used in separate sections of a room, creating a bold, geometric look. For example, you might paint the lower half of a wall one color and the upper half another. This design works best in contemporary and minimalist interiors and is perfect for creating visual interest in large, open spaces.</p>
<h4 id="5-neutral-tones-for-sophistication">5. Neutral Tones for Sophistication</h4>
<p>Neutral tones such as beige, taupe, and gray are versatile choices for any room in your home. These colors create a calm, sophisticated atmosphere and work well in a variety of decor styles. You can use neutral tones as a base color and add accents in bolder shades for a more dynamic look.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-the-right-paint-finish">Choosing the Right Paint Finish</h3>
<p>In addition to choosing the right colors and design, its important to consider the paint finish. Different finishes have varying levels of sheen and durability, and they are suitable for different types of rooms and surfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Matte Finish:**Ideal for ceilings and walls in low-traffic areas, matte finishes provide a smooth, non-reflective surface.</li>
<li>**Satin Finish:**A great option for bedrooms, living rooms, and dining rooms, satin finishes offer a subtle sheen and are easy to clean.</li>
<li>**Semi-Gloss Finish:**This finish is ideal for high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms. It is durable, easy to clean, and resistant to moisture.</li>
<li>**Gloss Finish:**Glossy finishes are best for trim, doors, and cabinets. They offer a high-shine finish that reflects light and is easy to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>House painting designs and colors are essential to creating a home that reflects your personal style while enhancing the atmosphere and functionality of each room. Whether youre updating the exterior or refreshing the interior, its important to choose colors that suit your homes architecture and your tastes. With the right design choices and a bit of creativity, you can transform your space into a beautiful and inviting place to live.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Spiders (Parasteatoda tepidariorum) popular as the American house spider or common house spider are classified under the
<a href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdf/IN/IN39400.pdf">Parasteatoda genus</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>House spiders mainly live in cosmopolitan areas and are described as synanthropic meaning they live near and in human dwellings.
House spiders are largely found indoors (in the house). Also, a spider and its webs will prove to be a nuisance in the house - which makes homeowners classify it as a challenging pest.</li>
<li>You mainly find house spiders in Canada and the United States but they are also in other areas worldwide.
In this article, I will outline the facts, physical appearance, and behaviors of the house spiders.
Let&rsquo;s dig in!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identification-of-the-house-spider">Identification of the House spider</h2>
<p>The house spiders will take shelter in man-made structures such as your home barns and sheds.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you noticed many cobwebs around the house, then house spiders must be this first suspect.
The spiders have a bulbous abdomen and produce uniquely-tangled webs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mc3eU6MdI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mc3eU6MdI</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-body-shape">1. Body Shape</h3>
<p>The female House spiders have an elevated (almost spherical) abdomen and they measure about 5 mm to 8 mm in length.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the male house spiders have abdomens that are elongated and their body length is about 3.7 mm to 4.8 mm.
The spider will appear grey or brown but will have some dark Chevron markings on its body.
The eggs of a house spider hatch in one week leaving it to go through different Instar development.</li>
<li>The female house spiders will go through 7 instars while the males will go through 6 instars.
The ballooning process will then take place - it involves dispersing the spiderlings from the silk threads to other habitats.
The adult house spiders can live 4 for a year or more.
These adults will be brown or yellow in color with their abdomens being Grey (dark and brown-banded legs) and having white marks.</li>
<li>Another differentiating characteristic of the house spiders is that the males and females can live together and thus mate many times.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-color">2. Color</h3>
<p>House spiders are generally around or yellowish Brown in color.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its abdomen is dirty white in color and has a number of dark stripes that meet at an angle.
First, on reproduction, a female house spider will lay roughly 250 eggs that will be wrapped in around (brownish) silken suck that is shaped like a flask.</li>
<li>In its lifetime, the house spider will produce 3700 + eggs that will be put into about 15+ silken sacs.
The house spiders are non-threatening and small in size. The bites are painful but then it will only bite for self-defense.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-legs">3. Legs</h3>
<p>Spiders have eight legs with an elongated bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the characteristic color of the house spiders is yellow-brown or brown.
However, its legs will have dark-colored rings but will still be largely brown.
The eight-legged arachnid has two body segments and lacks both an antenna and wings.
The house spider has 2 palps (pedipalps or appendages) in front of its legs.
If you have noticed some house spiders that have long legs, then outside these are the cellar spiders mainly found in the basements and cellars - damp and dark areas.</li>
<li>In fact, due to their thin and long legs, people refer to these cellar spiders as &ldquo;daddy longlegs&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Canada and the United States have about 20 species of these cellar spiders.
On comparing the common house spider with brown recluse - here&rsquo;s my take;</li>
<li>A sure way of identifying the brown recluse is with its eyes -they have six eyes as opposed to 8 most spiders.</li>
<li>The Brown recluses abdomen lacks markings that you will find in the common house spider and also they have smooth legs.
The brown recluse will also mainly occupy the warmer, darker, and quieter location where they will feed and reproduce.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-house-spider-habitats">3. House Spider Habitats</h3>
<p>House spiders generally love and hide in dark places where they can easily trap insects (such as flies and
bed bugs
) and camouflage from predators.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the outdoor spaces, the house spiders will largely hide under leaves and around windows, particularly around light sources that tend to attract insects.</li>
<li>In the indoor spaces, house spiders will mainly hide in crawl spaces, garages, basements, window frame angles, inside closets, under furniture, and in the upper corners.
Finally, in the warehouse, the house spiders will hide in corners around those that are always open.
The house spiders select the location of their webs through trial and error.</li>
<li>Therefore, the spider webs may build up very fast and also attract a lot of dust in a short time - you&rsquo;ll also see many<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-poop/">spider droppings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="controlling-the-house-spiders">Controlling The House Spiders</h2>
<p>House spiders are generally not dangerous but they make many humans fearful.</p>
<ul>
<li>So to maintain your peace at home and avoid possible venomous attacks you need</li>
<li>to control the spiders in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-spray-spider-insecticides">1. Spray Spider Insecticides</h3>
<p>Spray the house and the surrounding structures with insecticides that are formulated for spiders.
But since the spiders have long legs, it is important to ensure that the spray touches the spider&rsquo;s body directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, avoid squashing the spiders since this could lead to the fastest production of spider eggs and spiderlings will be distributed all over.
If the space under consideration has some cracks, then you should spray on them since spiders can hide inside there.</li>
<li>Since the crack space is small, then the spray chemicals will easily get into contact with the spider&rsquo;s body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-remove-possible-pest-food-sources">2. Remove Possible Pest Food Sources</h3>
<p>Spiders don&rsquo;t eat human food but other pests and insects will and so it is important to remove the foods.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the best and various insects are well fed, then the spiders will also be full and hence reproduce better.
So clean up the various scrubs and open food sources that may be lying around.
I advise that you keep all the food containers well sealed, wash the counters, and wipe all the food crumbs.
Doing such cleaner consistently we&rsquo;ll keep off the insects since they have less food - this will also reduce the spiders in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-adopt-great-pest-prevention-methods">3. Adopt Great Pest Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>The house spiders primarily feed on bugs and insects that get into the house and hence it is important to prevent their entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the entry points into your house will include screen tears, crevices, cracks, or drainages.
Some of the excellent pest prevention methods you can adopt for this include repairing the leaks or broken screens and sealing up the cracks.</li>
<li>This will limit the foods (insects and bugs) that are available for the spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-use-glue-traps">4. Use Glue Traps</h3>
<p>For areas of the house where you are sure to have spiders walking around, I advise that you set up some quality glue traps.</p>
<ul>
<li>The glue traps must be set up in places such as the basement or ceiling where there is darkness.
Spiders have great vision and they will see insects that are trapped and will attempt to catch them.</li>
<li>As the spider attempts to eat the trapped insect, it will also be trapped by the glue.
But remember to position the glue traps in quiet, and dark places like near the beds and around baseboards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-vacuum-the-house-thoroughly">5. Vacuum the house thoroughly</h3>
<p>To prevent the entry and fast reproduction of spiders, I advise that you vacuum the house thoroughly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to vacuum the hard-to-reach places such as the door frames, window frames, and baseboards.
The vacuum machine will help kill the live spiders while sucking up the egg sacs and the spider webs.</li>
<li>The vibrations, chemicals, and trauma caused by the vacuuming process will kill the spiders fast.
Male spiders have real height inside crawl spaces, basements, closets, under furniture, and in the ceiling corners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-dangerous-are-the-house-spiders">How Dangerous Are The House Spiders?</h2>
<p>House spiders aren&rsquo;t dangerous humans but will cause considerable nuisance and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">pain</a>
in case they bite - just like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/wolf-spiders/">the wolf spiders</a>
.
So these spiders won&rsquo;t cause considerable health damage to humans but they may make the house or various spaces feel unwelcoming.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spiders will trigger nervousness among the family members and sleeping off the webs will also be a demanding task.
You can do the spider control as a DIY Project but it is best you hire a professional with knowledge of the various spiders.</li>
<li>You can prevent the entry of spiders and various insects by sealing up cracks using some silicone-based caulk.
If house spiders have gained entry into the house, you should vacuum the spaces to remove the webs, egg sacs, and adult spiders.
Avoid using a broom only in the cleanup since most of the adult spiders will escape.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>House spiders may not pose a great health risk to humans (and like spiders such as the
black widow spiders
) but they are bites are painful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, their presence may cause nervousness among family members.
So it is important that you adopt effective prevention and control of the house spiders.</li>
<li>Prevention will involve filling up cracks that may allow spiders and insects to get into your spaces.</li>
<li>You can control the house spiders byusing spider bombs, spider sprays, and vacuuming.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bearded dragons are docile and beautiful reptiles that you&rsquo;ll love for their low maintenance.�In this article, I will let you know how big bearded dragons (Beardies) can grow while in captivity.
**In brief, an adult (and fully-grown) bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">dragon</a> will have a length of 16 - 24 inches and have a weight of between 380 - 510 grams. However, this reptile will be classified as unhealthy (suffering stunted growth) when it&rsquo;s under 300 grams all under 16 inches after one year - mainly due to cognitive or physical sickness. **</p>
<ul>
<li>**The bearded dragons reach sexual maturity at around 1 to 1.5 years and this is when they achieve full size. **
If the Beardies length is more than 24 inches, then this could be a German giant or what we call an uncommon mophr. The German giant achieves around 1,000 grams and a length of 32 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stage-1-of-growth-juvenile-bearded-dragon-size">Stage 1 of Growth: Juvenile Bearded Dragon Size</h2>
<p>If you are rearing a bearded dragon I&rsquo;m thinking of getting one, this information will help you prepare issues such as maintaining its general health, diet, and tank size.</p>
<p>A baby or juvenile bearded dragon is classified as one between the ages of 2 - 7 months.</p>
<p>Bearded dragons have different growth rates for stage 1 &amp; stage 2;</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1 growth rate: 1 to 3 inches every month</li>
<li>Stage 1 growth rate: 1 to 2 inches every week
The bearded dragons have a small rate of growth after one year but around this age, they&rsquo;ll have a thick tail base and their belly will be filled out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to its demanding body growth needs, a bearded dragon requires great nutrition (and regular feeding) at this age.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, you may need to feed this pet about 50 crickets daily to satisfy their dietary requirements.
Also, provide each of these pets with a separate cage of about 30 gallons. This is because they&rsquo;ll grow very dormant and territorial.</li>
<li>In fact, the large-sized dragons will dominate the hideouts, the lovely basking areas, and the food bowl.
Therefore, the small-sized dragons could be deprived of suitable lighting and adequate nutrition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stage-2-of-growth-size-of-baby--hatchlings-bearded-dragon">Stage 2 of Growth: Size of Baby / Hatchlings Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>The hatchlings of bearded dragons are about 3 inches in length and 4 grams in weight.</p>
<p>In the initial 2 months of growth, the bearded dragons grow at a rate of 1 inch to 1.5 inches every week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, in the first two months, these hatchlings will acquire about 3 grams to 5 grams.
So, to maintain a normal weight of the hatchlings of the baby bearded dragons, you need to weigh them weekly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I advise you to monitor the room lighting and the baby dragons feeding habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>I noted that some of the hatchlings would have diseases such as metabolic bone disease or also they could experience feeding competition leading to dietary deficiency.
Thus, Critical factors to consider and provide to the hatchlings of the baby dragons in their first year of growth are; proper bedding, nutrition, and appropriate lighting.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Notably, You should feed the babies of the bearded dragons with a diet that has a higher proportion or ratio of proteins (insects) as compared to the number of salads included.</li>
<li>You should also include a Tube light (T5 UVB) On the outer side of the Dragon smash but at a minimum of six inches.
Therefore, as noted, the survival and growth of bearded dragons or their babies are highly dependent on the environment and diet that you provide.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sizes-of-various-bearded-dragons-by-breed">Sizes Of Various Bearded Dragons By Breed</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons come in 8 subspecies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, You should note that these subspecies have different adaptations that allow them to live in a specific region;</li>
<li>This is because the various subspecies live in various locations of Australia.

What&rsquo;s The Growth Rate Of The Bearded Dragon?</li>
</ul>
<p>During the early life (i.e. 1 - 3 months), the bearded dragons tend to grow at a highly accelerated rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be summarised as the growth of about 10 to 50 g every month and 2 inches in each month.
However, the growth rate of the bearded dragons will have slowed down after 3 months since hatching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, the reptiles in the juvenile stage will gain about 50 g every month and roughly 1 inch to 1.5 inches every month.</p>
<ul>
<li>And rid of skin-shedding, these pets will shed about 1 to 2 times every month.
However, once the bearded dragons achieve their full size (this is in around 1 year), the bearded dragons will shed their skin at a slower rate which is about 1 - 2 times every year.</li>
<li>Another critical factor to notice is that the bearded dragons will have around 350 g in one year and will gain more slowly in the second year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-average-and-maximum-weight-at-each-growth-stage">The Average and Maximum Weight at Each Growth Stage</h2>
<p>The growth rate of a bearded dragon is highly impacted by factors such as their health, their diet, and their environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, experts recommend that you use some approved growth charts that will help you make some accurate guesses on the growth rate of bearded dragons.
The growth charts require that you check the juveniles&rsquo; growth rate during the first six months.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the bearded dragon will be 15 + inches while it&rsquo;s 6 months old, I&rsquo;ll say that your pet may grow to be among those large beardies in their species. Id predict that the bearded dragon could Grow to be around 25 inches in length.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, if the bearded dragon is only about 11 inches at 6 months, I&rsquo;ll say that the animal might only (as a full-grown adult) get to around 16 to 18 inches.
Between 8 to 18 months, the bearded dragon we have achieved sexual maturity and itll have stopped growing in size.</li>

<h2 id="the-factors-that-affect-the-size-of-the-bearded-dragon">The Factors That Affect The Size Of The Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons tend to grow very fast and their clothes are considerably first time in their first year but there are some factors that will also affect how fast they grow.</p>
<h3 id="1-husbandry"><strong>1. Husbandry</strong></h3>
<p>If a bearded dragon has some sickness, or has poor health care, then the animal could have a lower weight and be smaller in size than expected for its age.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notable parasites and diseases like impaction can affect the number of nutrients that are bearded dragons get from their diet.
Such health issues and illnesses will affect the physiological functioning of the Dragon and this slows down the rate of growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check for health issues such as extreme appetite changes, the Dragon becoming overly sluggish, bloating, and significant weight loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you notice such health issues on your dragon ensure to talk to the pets vet</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-housing-">**2. Housing **</h3>
<p>The type and size of the house ( among other environmental factors) is a major factor affecting how big to do bearded dragons will grow.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should provide an enclosure (for the bearded dragon) that has adequate room for feeding, movement, or exercise.</p>
<p>If the enclosure has a small size compared to the subspecies of reptile, then the pet cool experience stunted growth cheese that home is not adequate for exercise and normal growing.</p>
<p>For example, you will require a tank of 40 gallons capacity for a juvenile bearded dragon and one of 120 gallons capacity for the adult.</p>
<p>Also, provide appropriate and enough lighting in and outside the enclosure to avoid stunted growth of your lizard.</p>
<ul>
<li>With enough UVA or B rays or adequate heat, the bearded dragon will synthesize vitamin D and also absorbed other nutrients correctly.
Hence, the lizard will escape getting the metabolic bone disease and it will have a healthy metabolic function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-diet"><strong>3. Diet</strong></h3>
<p>The bearded dragon will grow and developed if you provide them with a balanced and complete diet.</p>
<p>Notably, to escape stunted growth, don&rsquo;t feed the animals with low-nutrient bites such as iceberg lettuce.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, don&rsquo;t feed the lizards with nutrients that are improperly balanced such as*grubs. *
Also, remember to alter the diet of the bearded dragons as the age advances.</li>
<li>The adults will require lesser proteins compared to the juveniles. So, you feed the juvenile lizards with 25% plants ( such as fruits, vegetables, and greens) end 25% are their diet should be insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-gender"><strong>4. Gender</strong></h3>
<p>The sex or gender of the bearded dragon will also affect how big they grow.</p>
<ul>
<li>These pets can be described as sexually dimorphic.
The females of the bearded dragons have a slender (slim) tail but with a broader body.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the mals have wider (larger) heads and longer bodies compared to the females.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-genetics-">**5. Genetics **</h3>
<p>The maximum size of the bearded dragon is also affected by their genetics animal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the bearded dragon will grow as big or close to the size of the parents.
Are the characteristics that will differ with the lizard subspecies include the spikes, scales, and color.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the German giant morph will achieve 35 ounces in weight and 32 inches in the length.</p>
<h2 id="but-is-my-bearded-dragon-really-overweight">But Is My Bearded Dragon Really Overweight?</h2>
<p>Youll know where&rsquo;s the bearded dragon is overweight if its belly is bulging and it extends beyond the lizard&rsquo;s sides well it&rsquo;s standing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The chest area also is plump and the legs are very thick.
However, if the bearded dragon is female and it has an enlarged belly then the animal could need surgery since it could be suffering from egg retention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, when you believe that the bearded dragon might be overweight, you should begin the examination with the tank temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>notably, the tank area used for basking must not exceed a temperature of between 95 degrees Fahrenheit to 200 degrees Fahrenheit for normal body weight.
Unique characteristics that may point that your bearded dragon is over it include having a full chest, fat limbs, looking around, and being a little stout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowing exercises such as walking, offering an appropriate diet (foods with high protein and fats), and also lowering the temperature of the tank (heat tends to make the lizards eat more) will assist the pets to have fewer weight issues.</p>
<h2 id="but-is-my-bearded-dragon-really-underweight">But Is My Bearded Dragon Really Underweight?</h2>
<p>Unique features that will show your bearded dragon is underweight include protruding spine and ribs, sunken fat pads, and sagging skin(wrinkly and sullen).</p>
<ul>
<li>If the lizards are underweight in the first two to three months (growth phase) might be due to hibernation (brumation), illness, all nutritional challenges.</li>
<li>Also, the plate could lose its appetite due to temperature or food quality changes - lower temperatures trigger a slower metabolism.
For the underweight dragons, experts recommend you feed them with supplements, appetite stimulants, and a diet that is high in fats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So on the question of how big the bearded dragons can grow, I&rsquo;ll see that these will not have a straightforward response but they are important considerations to make.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, you should ensure that the bearded dragons have the correct tank, proper nutrition, and diet to allow the animals to draw their maximum possible size.
Cheers!</li>

      <description>Maybe in your yard, you spotted a mouse or a rat, or its a mole but you can tell the difference. How can you tell if you have moles in your yard?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe in your yard, you spotted a mouse or a rat, or its a <a href="/posts/do-moles-have-eyes/">mole</a> but you can tell the difference. How can you tell if you have moles in <a href="/posts/how-to-clean-your-laptop-keyboard/">your</a> yard?
<strong>Well, here are the signs of moles in the yard; moulding, drying plants and grass, and sighting a mole. You need to deal with them, the moment you spot them before the level of damage can be extensive.</strong>
In this regard, there are a few questions to answer to help you understand what we are dealing with. Check also the
gopher traps
. If you want to know you have moles in your yard, here are some commons things you have to look out for.</p>
<h2 id="common-signs-of-moles-in-your-yard"><strong>Common Signs of Moles in Your Yard</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1moulding">1.<strong>Moulding</strong></h3>
<p>The first and the most visible signs of mole infestation in your yard are moldings. These are heaps of soil comes as a result of moles burrowing up the soil from the underground tunnels.
From the molds, you are likely to find the opening to the tunnel, though its not a 100% guarantee.
Tactically, the moles
and raccoons
do this when looking for food from underground. They can dig these tunnels of up to 8 ft. in an hour leaving several heaps of soil above the ground.</p>
<h3 id="2drying-plants-and-grass">2.<strong>Drying plants and grass</strong></h3>
<p>Another sign is the drying of grass and other plants in your yard.� As the moles burrow underground, they destroy the roots of anything they find on their way.
Most tunnels are shallow and easily reach plant roots. This destroys the grass and other plants along the tunnels leaving them dry and weathered.
With their strong and sharp claws, moles can tear down even the strongest of the plant&rsquo;s root system turning them yellowish and weathered.</p>
<h3 id="3sighting-a-mole">3.<strong>Sighting a mole</strong></h3>
<p>Moles spend a lot of their time in the underground and its a rare occurrence to spot one
They are mostly active in the evening and early morning. At this time, you may chance to spot them. Alternatively, they have a preference for loamy soils especially when the ground is moist.
Also sometimes after a light rainfall, you may spot them coming to get some warmth from the surface. Moles are loners and mostly move alone. Sometimes, most of the damage you see in the yard could be the work of just a single mole.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beAhFAmqfSY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beAhFAmqfSY</a></p>
<h2 id="what-are-moles">What are moles?</h2>
<p>Mole is basically some burrowing animals that are found underground. They feed on underground insects and worms for survival. They vary in sizes between 4-11 inches.
Some people confuse moles with rodents like mice or even rats.
However, you can also identify them by their physical appearances like a thin and a long snout, strong front feet, small eyes with grey to brownish or black fur.
Their eyesight is poorly developed but their snout compensates for that by being oversensitive to touch. If this is what you have spotted in your yard, then you are dealing with moles in your yard.

<h2 id="what-attracts-moles-to-my-yard"><strong>What attracts moles to my yard?</strong></h2>
<p>The reason why moles will burrow into your yard is that they are looking for food. As I said, they feed on earthworms, immature insects, white grubs, beetles, crickets among other insects.
They will dig multiple tunnels as they search these insects.
Another factor though not common is moist and loamy soil. Moles love to inhabit these kinds of soils. They burrow to keep their bodies cool since they spend most of their time underground.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-fastest-way-to-get-rid-of-moles-in-your-yard"><strong>What is the fastest way to get rid of moles in your yard?</strong></h3>
<p>To eliminate moles from your yard, here are quick ways of doing it;</p>
<h3 id="1traps">1.<strong>Traps</strong></h3>
<p>Traps are one of the best and the most
effective way to eliminate moles
and stop further destruction. You can get these traps from local retailers or from animal experts</p>
<h3 id="2baits">2.<strong>Baits</strong></h3>
<p>Baits are used to attract moles into the traps. For the best baits, you can use what moles love best and that is worms, grubs, and crickets. This is a good way to lead them into a trap and capture them.</p>
<h3 id="3removing-the-food-sources-from-your-yard">3.<strong>Removing the food sources from your yard</strong></h3>
<p>By removing what the moles come for in your yard, you actually starve them giving them no opportunity to be in your yard. You can achieve this through lawn maintenance and observing good landscape hygiene.
This can be a preventive measure as well as a way of eradicating them in an already infested yard.</p>
<h3 id="4using-repellents">4.<strong>Using Repellents</strong></h3>
<p>Repellents are a polite way of telling the mole, you are in the wrong place. It makes the environment inhabitable for the moles leaving them no choice but to leave.
You can purchase these repellents from retailers or use a homemade one. If you buy from retailers, you are likely to get them either in granules or liquid form.
Though am not an expert in homemade repellents but I know soap and castor are used to make them. The good thing with these repellents is that they are safe without causing harm to either the human or moles.

<h2 id="how-do-you-naturally-get-rid-of-moles"><strong>How do you naturally get rid of moles?</strong></h2>
<p>In a bid to control moles from getting into your yard, there are several natural remedies for you.</p>
<h3 id="1planting-repellent-plants">1.<strong>Planting repellent plants</strong></h3>
<p>The mole&rsquo;s snout is very sensitive to smell and touch which makes use of repellent plants very effective. You can use plants such as those from the allium family that produce a stringent smell. You can also plant other repellents like marigolds, daffodils, etc.
By planting them along the borderline, will keep off the moles from coming into your yard. If you are unable to get these plants, you can get more information from your local gardener.</p>
<h3 id="2digging-border-trenches">2.<strong>Digging border trenches</strong></h3>
<p>You can do this trench along the border of your garden to keep the moles. For convenience, dig the trench at 2 ft. deep and at least 6 inches wide.
To improve it, you can fill it with stones reinforced with wire mesh to create a strong barrier which moles cannot pass.
Though the process may be tiresome and also consume your time its worth protecting your lawn and beautiful landscape.</p>
<h3 id="3keep-your-lawn-clean">3.<strong>Keep your lawn clean</strong></h3>
<p>Last but not least keeping your lawn clean also serve as a natural way of keeping the moles off from your yard.
Some maintenance practices like mowing the grass, keeping large chunks of mulch, and maintaining a relatively dry yard can be very helpful in keeping off the moles.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How Do Lizards Mate? Maybe you have pet lizards at home or have seen one and wishes to know how they mate. Do they court like human being before mating? Well, in this article we shall answer the question, How Do Lizards Mate?
*During Mating, the male <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> (vertebrates) clings on the females back and support itself by biting the females neck. Then, the male lizards connects is hemipenes/male organ to the females cloaca (female organ) and pours its sperms that move up the oviduct to fertilize the ova (female egg). *
<em>However, before mating, the male and female may have 1 to 2 months of courtship during the mating season (spring). After fertilization, the lizard (Savannah, monitor, iguana, or Komodo dragon) lays eggs, which hatch into baby lizards in 4 to 8 weeks.�</em>

<h2 id="details-how-do-lizards-mate-and-reproduce"><strong>Details: How Do Lizards Mate and Reproduce?</strong></h2>
<p>Lizards undergo the following steps/stage during mating. Contrary, some viviparous lizards such as the blue-tongue skink and Solomon Island skink give live birth to their baby lizards.</p>
<h2 id="step-1how-lizards-attract-their-mate-for-sex-mating---courtship">Step 1:<strong>How lizards attract their mate for sex (mating - courtship)</strong></h2>
<p>Before mating, lizards court for 1 to 60 days to create a strong friendship/bond and form a royal pair that may last them their entire lifetime. During this time, there are some of things/techniques that lizards (either male or female) use to attract their mate for copulation or coitus. These may include:
<strong>1. Tactile commination�</strong>
Some lizards such as monitor lizards use touch as a way of attracting their mates to sexual engagement. The Komodo dragon likes to lick its female mate to see if its sexually ready or responsive.
The direct touch is used severally by lizards to create a close bond -

.
<strong>2. Auditory calls�</strong>
The lizards use the auditory call to entice the mate they intend to court with. Many lizards may not use this method since the predators may take advantage and catch/trace them using auditory call signals.
However, Tokay Gecko are known to use auditory calls when looking for courting mate. But

<strong>3. Use of visual display�</strong>
The lizards mostly use visual displays such as, swaging of tail, changing of colors, frequent gapping of the mouth, moving of the tongue, special body posture, head bobbing as well as inflation and push-ups to attract its mate for courtship.
Flying lizards and Anoles lizards, males have well-developed and brightly colored throat dewlaps and fans which open and close and use them to attract the female lizards for courtship. This method is most used and pronounced as compared to others.
<strong>4. Chemical Cues�</strong>
The lizards produces a chemical pheromones that when smelled will attract the mate for courtship. Normally, female lizards produces these chemical cues to attract the male lizard for mating purpose.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-mating-process">Step 2**: Mating Process�**</h3>
<p>During mating, the male lizard climbs over the female lizard. Then, it connects its hemipenes into the cloaca of the female lizard and pours the sperms into the cloaca from where the sperms swim up the uterus to the oviduct to fertilize the ova (singular - ovum).
The puring process is not a bumpy liquid but continuous drips. The male lizard must wait until the whole pouring process is completed.
The male lizard usually bites the neck of the female lizard to support itself during coitus/copulation. In addition, the male lizard will produce/secret cellular debris that have scent, which makes the couple be able to locate each other in a colony of lizards. Moreover, this debris prevent the male lizard from sliding during mating.
During mating, the female lizard raises the tail slightly to enable the male access the cloaca (you may see as if lizards are coiling while mating). There is no kissing in lizards. However, lizard species such as Komodo dragon and monitor lizards lick their female mates during copulation/coitus.</p>
<h3 id="step-3after-mating-occurrences">Step 3:<strong>After mating occurrences.</strong></h3>
<p>Once the male lizard mates with female lizard, it leaves the female and go to search for other female (most lizards are polygamous). The female searches for a nice place where it intends to lay the eggs.
This place can be in warm holes, leaves, under the sand, seashores or in caves where predator cant locate them (the eggs have strong eggshells that offer further protection).
Then, the female lizard lays the fertilized eggs in batches may have 1 to 20 eggs. Eastern Bearded Dragon usually lay 5 to 17 per batch. Water Dragon will lay between 6 to 18 eggs per batch while Blue tongue lizard will lay 10 to 20 eggs per batch.
The eggs are left to hatch after 4 to 8 weeks. The female lizards rarely take care of the eggs.�Some lizards such as the blue-tongue skink and Solomon Island skink give birth to young live offspring after 10 weeks.
However, these lizards do not have mammary glands to breastfeed their baby lizards. Baby lizards usually have low life expectancy since they face many predators and less care from the adult lizards.

<h2 id="which-is-the-matingbreeding-season-for-lizards">Which is the Mating/breeding season for lizards</h2>
<p>Normally, lizards prefer to court and mate during the spring season. This is favored by warm temperatures that provides a conducive outdoors bonding for lizards. During this time, the male lizard undergo through spermatogenesis (sperms production) and mates with the female lizard after courtship.
The female lizard will then store the sperms in its oviduct until ova (female egg cells) are produced and mature for fertilization. The warmth in spring makes lizards more sexual active such that, they can mate severally in a given day.
The ability of the female lizard to store sperms in some species makes them easier to carry fertilization even when they are not mating.�Some lizards such as Iguanas and Monitor lizards love mating during summer due to high temperature, which activates the copulation/coitus urge for the mates.
The Asian Water dragon becomes bright red during mating season while North American Lizards become orange skinned when mating season approaches.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-lizards-reproduction-organs-specialized-for-mating-in-lizards">How Are Lizards Reproduction Organs Specialized for Mating in Lizards.</h2>
<p>Lizards, unlike human beings, have special reproduction/sexual organs. The male have hemipenis (plural hemipenes) or penis (tubular) that is used during copulation (sexual intercourse). These organs are sac-like and lack erectile tissues as in human being or other animals.
The testicles and the hemipenes in male lizards are stored inverted inside the body at the back of the tail and are only used during copulation (they are not used for urination or egestion). The testicles of male lizards enlarge during the breeding season (you may notice the bulge part at the back of the lizards tail).
The female lizard has two oviducts, which join to form the cloaca (a special type of female organ). The cloaca is a multi-purpose organ in female lizards as it is used during mating, egestion and urination too.
During mating, the male lizard connects and pours into the cloaca of the female lizard from where the sperms swim to the uterus and up the oviduct to fertilize the ova.
The uterus of the female lizards (especially the viviparous lizards  those that give birth) has large volume that help carry many eggs/baby lizards.
During mating, the cloaca stops completely its other functions i.e. urination and egestion. You can locate the tiny pole at the back of the tail in each sex (male or female lizard) that represents the sexual organ.

<h2 id="do-all-female-lizards-need-to-mate-to-get-fertilized-or-pregnant">Do All Female Lizards Need to Mate to Get Fertilized or Pregnant?</h2>
<p>No. Not all lizards that need mating to lay eggs. Some lizards such as gecko, rock lizards, monitor lizards are parthenogenetic (do no need to mate to lay eggs). These lizard species lay eggs (though not fertilized), which hatch to baby lizards.
However, the young ones from these eggs do not have genes that favor diversity like those from fertilized eggs.�The asexual lizards (parthenogenetic) usually have both chromosomes that are provided by the male sex cell thus helps in grow of the egg to maturity.
Other lizard species such as Komodo lizards are bisexual- they can reproduce sexually or by parthenogenesis. In most cases, the bisexual lizards would prefer mating as it offers the bonding chance that make them create a colony for daily activities or defense purposes.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-babiesoff-springs-do-lizards-hatch">How Many Babies/Off Springs Do Lizards Hatch?</h2>
<p>The number of eggs laid by a give lizard species determines the number of baby lizards that are raised in a given season. After mating, the female lizard lays 1 to 20 eggs per batch in a warm environment.
In a given breeding season, female lizards can lay 2 to 3 batches, which may lead to breeding problem on hatching. 80 to 90 percent of the laid eggs normally hatch to baby lizards in 50 to 57 days.
About 1 to 40 lizards are hatched in a given breeding season from a single female lizard. However, due to large predation in the breeding ground, 60 percent of the population do not survive to maturity. Most of them are eaten away or die due to adverse weather conditions and less parental care.
Species such as Blue tongue lizard can raise between 5 to 18 baby lizards. The Asian water dragon manages 5 to 12 baby lizards while Bearded Dragon can hatch between 15 to 20 young ones.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-baby-lizards-take-to-mature">How Long Does The Baby Lizards Take To Mature?</h2>
<p>Baby lizard takes about 12 months to acquire full maturity. During this time, the baby lizard is fed partially by the adult ones and also engaged in light hunting of food.
At this age, the lizard can carry out reproduction (can mate and lay eggs). The adult lizard then assumes the duties of food gathering (hunting) since its old enough to even have its own shelter/cage.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When mating, the male lizard climbs over the female lizard and introduces its hemipenes (male organ) into the cloaca (female) of the female lizard and pours the sperms that swim to the oviduct where they fertilize the ova (singular ovum).
The male lizard has scary underneath skin with debris, which prevent it from sliding during coitus. The male and female lizard must court before mating begin.</p>

<p>The methods include water treatment and water filtering including
<a href="https://upurifywater.com/best-portable-water-purifier/">emergency water purifiers</a>
to use during camping or exploration missions.
Water purification will involve passing the water via filters (make from fiberglass or ceramic) that&rsquo;ll remove the soil sediments and other bad microorganisms.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-portable-water-filters-work">How Do Portable Water Filters Work?</h2>
<h3 id="1-squeeze-filters"><strong>1. Squeeze Filters�</strong></h3>
<p>Squeeze filters are lightweight, easy to use and hence you can carry them upcountry, camping, or just general road and off-road traveling.
So, readily filter your water and take safe and clean water with unmatched confidence. Luckily, most can readily fit into your hands - easy to use, and it&rsquo;s highly packable.
Squeeze filters will mainly consist of pores that are as small as 0.1 microns. They&rsquo;ll come with some printed usage instructions to allow easier operation.
It may come with a drinking cup, back-flush cup for easy sharing into other bottles or drinking. Further, some purifiers may have a back-flush plunger.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNCzjJCEjK8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNCzjJCEjK8</a>
The water filters have tiny pores that&rsquo;ll only let molecules of water to go through them while filtering out protozoa (cryptosporidium plus giardia) or bacteria such as e-coli.
However, various microorganisms including bacteria need filters that have pores measuring under 0.2 microns for effective removal. Further, water filters having carbon elements will assist in improving the water flavor.
Squeeze filters work akin to the pump filters but won&rsquo;t need additional housing material and weight like it is with other general pumps.
On operation of the squeeze filters, you&rsquo;ll simply need to squeeze the pouch or bottle and this will make the water move out - hence are good for camping or backpacking.

<h3 id="2-pump-filters"><strong>2. Pump Filters�</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://ufonline.ufl.edu/infographics/five-water-purification-designs/">Pump water filters</a>
will utilize your body&rsquo;s energy for pumping out water via the filter. These are excellent for quick water filtration like when you&rsquo;re on camping or exploration missions.
Considering your pumping energy - you can get clean and safe water within a very short time - buts its filters will age fast and it requires high amounts of energy for the pumping process.
However, get a pump filter that&rsquo; easy to use and clean - this enables you to rejuvenate the pump filter within a short time. The pump filters are equally light-weight and easy to use.</p>
<h3 id="3gravity-filters">3.<strong>Gravity Filters�</strong></h3>
<p>Gravity filters profit from the force of gravity to get rid of contaminants and sediments in your water. It has 2 chambers - a lower one and a
mediator
one that holds
filter elements.
Also, the gravity filters equally utilize similar filters like the pump filters - you can let it rest while filtering as you do your comping or other leisure activities in the wild.
In comparison, gravity filters weigh less than the pump filters and hence are considered more portable and usable on travels or camping.
So, as you camp in the wild, take some dirty water, and simply let it get down through the gravity filters as you wait for your safe and clean water. Read Also:

<h2 id="water-treatment">Water Treatment</h2>
<h3 id="1-chemicals"><strong>1. Chemicals�</strong></h3>
<p>Water treatment using various methods like water purification tablets - luckily these will kill micro-organisms including protozoa and bacteria. Those with iodine or chlorine dioxide chemicals.
Strain the dirty water through a shirt or bandanna to remove the debris and finally pass them through the chemical treatment process to kill micro-organisms like viruses.
However, chemical water treatment solutions could leave some bad after-taste and may need that you leave the water standing for some time before drinking.</p>
<h3 id="2-uv-light-treatment">2. UV Light Treatment</h3>
<p>You can also treat the water using UV light that&rsquo;s generated by a special type of water filter - this will remove the debris, sediments, and kill various micro-organisms.
Boiling the water can also be effective in treating the water but may not be as great as the chemical methods like water purification tablets.
Ensure that the water continues boiling for about 1 minute or more at elevated temperatures to exterminate all the dangerous microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s it on how do portable water filters work? So, the filters through gravity force, physical human force, or electric powered motors.
However, you can also use other water treatment methods including water purification tablets or boiling the dirt water at elevated temperatures for some minutes.</p>

The application of paint creates a barrier that shields the surface from environmental factors. Here are the key ways painting prevents corrosion:</p>
<h3 id="1-barrier-protection">1. Barrier Protection</h3>
<p>One of the primary ways that painting prevents corrosion is through barrier protection. When paint is applied to a metal surface, it forms a protective layer that prevents direct contact between the metal and corrosive elements such as moisture, oxygen, and salts. This prevents the oxidation process that leads to rusting.</p>

<p>Certain types of paint are formulated with chemical-resistant properties that prevent corrosion caused by exposure to chemicals or harsh substances. These paints are ideal for environments where metal surfaces are exposed to industrial chemicals, acids, or alkalis.</p>
<h3 id="3-sacrificial-protection">3. Sacrificial Protection</h3>
<p>Some paints, especially those containing zinc or similar elements, provide sacrificial protection. The sacrificial metal corrodes instead of the surface underneath, thus extending the life of the metal structure.</p>
<h3 id="4-thermal-protection">4. Thermal Protection</h3>
<p>High-temperature paints help prevent corrosion by providing thermal protection to metal surfaces that are exposed to high heat. These paints help to maintain the integrity of the surface by creating a heat-resistant layer that can prevent degradation caused by extreme temperatures.</p>
<h3 id="5-aesthetic-and-protective-coating">5. Aesthetic and Protective Coating</h3>
<p>Beyond protection from corrosion, painting also enhances the appearance of metal surfaces. It can improve the durability of structures by providing an extra layer of protection from mechanical wear, harsh weather conditions, and environmental contaminants.
Painting is one of the most effective and affordable ways to prevent corrosion, helping to preserve the structural integrity of metal surfaces and extend their service life. Whether youre working on construction projects or maintaining household items, the right coating can make a significant difference in protecting materials from corrosion.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas are tiny, pesky insects that can cause discomfort to both pets and humans. While fleas are commonly associated with pets like dogs and cats, they can also infest human hosts. Understanding how long fleas can <a href="/posts/can-fleas-live-in-carpets/">live</a> on humans is important for preventing bites and controlling infestations. Lets explore the lifespan of fleas on humans and how you can deal with them effectively.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-do-fleas-live-on-humans">How Long Do Fleas Live on Humans?</h2>
<p>Fleas do not typically live on humans for long periods of time. While they may bite humans to feed on blood, they prefer to stay on the fur of animals, particularly pets. However, fleas can still be a nuisance for humans, and understanding their behavior can help in managing an infestation.</p>
<h3 id="the-flea-life-cycle">The Flea Life Cycle</h3>
<p>To better understand how long fleas live on humans, its important to first understand their life cycle. The flea life cycle consists of four stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Egg:**Fleas lay eggs on their hosts, and these eggs fall off into the environment.</li>
<li>**Larva:**The eggs hatch into larvae that feed on organic matter, including flea feces, which contain undigested blood.</li>
<li>**Pupa:**After feeding, larvae turn into pupae, where they will remain until they mature into adult fleas.</li>
<li>**Adult:**Adult fleas are the ones that feed on blood and lay eggs, continuing the cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-long-fleas-live-on-humans">How Long Fleas Live on Humans</h3>
<p>Adult fleas generally do not stay on humans for an extended period. When a flea jumps onto a human, it may stay for a short time to feed. Typically, fleas remain on humans for
<strong>a few hours to a few days</strong>
at most, depending on whether they can find a suitable environment to continue feeding. They prefer to stay on animals where they can access fur, which provides protection and warmth.
Fleas will often leave a human host once they have finished feeding. If they cannot find a pet or animal to host them, they will jump off and search for a more suitable environment.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-remove-fleas-from-humans">How to Remove Fleas from Humans</h3>
<p>If you suspect that fleas have bitten you or are infesting your body, its important to act quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Shower Immediately:**Washing with soap and water will help remove fleas from your skin.</li>
<li>**Use Flea Treatment:**Topical flea treatments or flea repellents can be applied to prevent further bites.</li>
<li>**Clean Your Environment:**Fleas may have laid eggs in your living space. Wash your bedding, clothes, and vacuum frequently to eliminate flea eggs and larvae.</li>
<li>**Check Your Pets:**If you have pets, ensure they are treated with flea prevention treatments, as they are the main source of the infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-fleas-breed-on-humans">Do Fleas Breed on Humans?</h3>
<p>No, fleas do not breed on humans. They may bite and feed, but they lay their eggs on the ground or on animal hosts. Fleas are not capable of reproducing on human skin or in human hair, and the adult fleas you encounter will eventually leave if no suitable host is available.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-flea-infestations-on-humans">Preventing Flea Infestations on Humans</h3>
<p>Preventing fleas from living on humans requires addressing the source of the infestation. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Regularly Treat Pets:**Use flea treatments or preventive medications on your pets to prevent fleas from infesting them and transferring to humans.</li>
<li>**Maintain Clean Living Spaces:**Clean your home regularly, especially areas where your pets spend a lot of time, such as their bedding or favorite lounging spots.</li>
<li>**Protective Clothing:**If you are around areas with a flea infestation, wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants can help keep fleas away from your skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fleas are not likely to live on humans for extended periods, but their bites can be annoying and uncomfortable. They prefer animal hosts but will jump onto humans to feed when necessary. By maintaining a clean environment, treating your pets, and using flea repellents, you can minimize the risk of flea infestations on humans. If you notice signs of flea bites or an infestation, take immediate action to eliminate the fleas and prevent further discomfort.</p>

<ul>
<li>Could be, you have spotted a beetle, a moth, a grain weevil. All these and others are the common pantry bugs we expect to find in kitchens, stores, and warehouses.
After noting several pantry bugs in my kitchen, this prompted me to know more about these bugs and how long they live.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live---pantry-bugs-life-cycle">How long do pantry bugs live? - Pantry Bugs Life Cycle</h2>
<p>The life span of pantry bugs totally depends on their species. If you want to know how long a pantry <a href="/posts/bed-bugs-vs-other-pests/">bug</a> live, you first need to know its species.</p>
<p>The most common pantry bugs in our kitchen and stores are moths. But which moths are they exactly? I have analyzed some of these common bugs and for easy identification and listed their life cycles.</p>
<h3 id="1-warehouse-beetle">**1. **<strong>Warehouse Beetle</strong></h3>
<p>This warehouse beetle is a very common pantry bug in your food store and kitchen. In most cases, you will find it in cereals, flour, cookies, nuts, cornmeal, dried peas, and beans among others.</p>
<p>This beetle is oval in shape and has a reddish-brown color with a yellow pattern on its wings.
**Life cycle **
The warehouse beetle has a life span of approximately 3-6 months. But its life cycle from egg to adult can take approximately 30-45 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its life cycle begins when a female beetle lays her eggs on the infested food. The female beetle can lay about 90 eggs in its lifespan. These fertilized eggs hatch into larvae after about 6 days.</li>
<li>The larvae stage is the most active stage and also very destructive. When they grow, the larvae develop hair and the abdomen also elongates. They also develop setae which they later shed and leave on the food.</li>
<li>Consuming this seta is very irritating and unhealthy too. If your food is infested by setae, it is advisable to dispose of it.
The larvae later turn into a pupa which takes about 6 days to turn into an adult. After this metamorphosis, the adult mates and can easily be spotted on light bulbs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-indianmeal-moths-">**2. ****Indianmeal Moths **</h3>
<p>This is the most common pantry bug in the kitchen. They are commonly found in North America, Europe among other areas. Their common scientific name is
<em>Plodia Interpuctella</em>
You are likely to spot them in your homestead in foods like cereals, rice, dried vegetables and fruits, flour, nuts, candies, and chocolates among others.
**Life cycle **
This moth has 4 growth stages-egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. The full life cycle takes between 30-300 days from egg to an adult moth.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female Indian meal moth can lay an average of 60-400 eggs in its life span. A female moth lays all the eggs within a span of 18 days. These eggs are laid on the food surface and take about 4-10 days for them to hatch into larvae.</li>
<li>This larvae stage is the most destructive and takes about 2-3 months. It consumes the food while excreting the waste (frass) and webbing which contaminates the whole package making it inconsumable.</li>
<li>The number of days on this stage is also dependent on so many other factors like food and temperatures and some larvae can live up to 210 days.
The larvae then transform into a pupa which is dormant and the non-feeding stage. The larvae make cocoons and live there.</li>
<li>Within 15-10 days, the pupae transform into an adult pantry moth. The adults break from the cocoon and can be easily spotted as they fly over the lights and walls.</li>
<li>The adult stage takes between 5-25 days and its major purpose is mating. Surprisingly, the adult moths do not have mouths and are not able to feed.
In general, the Idianmeal moth has a life span of 27-300 days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-red-and-confused-flour-beetle-">**3. ****Red and Confused Flour Beetle **</h3>
<p>These are two species of small beetle that are very similar and are reddish-brown in color. The red flour beetle and the confused flour beetle.</p>
<ul>
<li>To differentiate them the red flour beetle has the last 4 segments enlarged while the confused flour beetle has the last 3 segments enlarged towards the tail.
These are a common pantry bug in the United States and mostly attack grains, nuts, and milled cereals.
**Life cycle **
The red and the confused flour beetles have an average life span of 1-2 years. Their life cycle begins when a female lays eggs with sticky secretion on the grains and cereals. Its life cycle has 3 cycles-egg, larvae, and adult.</li>
<li>The females lay about 200-500 eggs in their life span. These eggs are small, clear, and white and hatch in a span of 5-12 days.</li>
<li>The larvae take about 30-120 days to mature but this depends on the temperature and food. These larvae feed grain kernels and slowly turn into white pupae. As the pupae grow it slowly turns yellow.</li>
<li>As it turns into an adult beetle, the pupae change color into reddish-brown.
This life cycle from eggs to adults takes about 6 weeks. However, the life cycle of the red flour beetle is shorter than that of the confused flour beetle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adult stage feeds and mates and the cycle continues.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-control-pantry-bugs">How to Control Pantry Bugs</h2>
<p>Most pantry bugs have a very fast multiplication rate-they lay eggs in hundreds and have a very short to average life span. Moreover, some bugs can survive for many days without feeding making it a challenge to control them.</p>
<h3 id="1-use-of-pheromone-traps-">**1. Use of Pheromone Traps. **</h3>
<p>The pheromone stick traps are some of the best ways to control pantry bugs. They are useful if there is already an infestation in your kitchen and food store.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have already spotted moths and beetles in your stores, it&rsquo;s a clear indication that there is a high infestation that needs to be stopped.</li>
<li>Pheromone traps play an important role in stopping any further reproduction and multiplication of the bugs.
It is also chemical-free and also safe for use in your household. You can find these traps in the local retailers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-proper-sealing-and-sanitation">2. Proper Sealing and Sanitation</h3>
<p>Most pantry bugs enter the foods and drugs because of the poor and open packaging. The moment they get inside they get a good chance to feed and multiply.</p>
<p>By keeping your foods tightly sealed and in a properly sanitized area, you are able to control any infestation of your food.</p>
<h3 id="3-disposing-of-the-already-infested-foods-">**3. Disposing of the already infested foods **</h3>
<p>If your food is already infested with pantry bugs, sometimes the best way to prevent any further infestation is through disposing of it.</p>
<p>Disposing of will also prevent any risk of consuming the pantry bugs which could pose a health risk.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>How long do pantry bugs live? Well, there are different kinds of pantry bugs and their life span depends on the species and their life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some bugs are destructive at certain stages of the life cycle-say larvae and others at another stage-say adult.</li>
<li>If you spot these pantry bugs in your home, you can also take a physical action and employ the control measures listed above to stop their further spread.</li>
<li>Most importantly, nobody wants bugs in their home, and proper sanitation and proper and constantly checking your store and foods could minimize the potential of infestation.
Lastly, ensure your food product is tightly sealed at all times.</li>

just like with chipmunks
) and they have a different life span and
Well, I was in the same situation as you a few years back when I had squirrels all over my garden. This prompted me into finding out more about squirrels. Here is what I found.

<h2 id="how-long-do-squirrels-live"><strong>How Long Do Squirrels Live?</strong></h2>
<p>The life span of a <a href="/posts/do-squirrels-attack-humans/">squirrel</a> is dependent on its species and the predisposing factors.�For instance, squirrels in captivity live longer than those that live in the wild. The life span of the squirrels in the wild is shorter than those that live in captivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squirrels have predators like hawks, dogs among other carnivores in the wild. They barely survive even two years of their life. In case this happens, most of these squirrels can live between 6-12 years on average.</li>
<li>Squirrels can be categorized into 3 species which include flying squirrels, ground and tree squirrels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-ground-squirrels-">**1. Ground squirrels **</h3>
<p>Ground squirrels&rsquo;�life span varies from 2-4 years. Female squirrels live longer with a life span of 4 years while male squirrels live up to 2 years. This is according to the research carried out on California ground squirrels.</p>
<h3 id="2-american-red-squirrel-">**2. American red squirrel **</h3>
<p>The average life span of an American red squirrel is 5 years. Though this is not the case with most squirrels and 25% will live beyond one year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike ground squirrels, male red squirrels live longer than female ones.</li>
<li>It takes about 2-4 years for this squirrel to attain its maturity. But, in captivity, their life span can go up to 8 years.
The oldest living red squirrel was recorded to be 10 years.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-fox-squirrels-">**3. Fox squirrels **</h3>
<p>They are popularly known as eastern fox squirrels. They are mostly found in North America and are known for their distinct color of rich and chest brown.</p>
<ul>
<li>They have a lifespan of 18 years while living as wild squirrels. Females have a longer lifespan than males. A female can live up to 13 years of age while a male can live up to 8 years of age.</li>
<li>However, most of these squirrels will barely live up to maturity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-southern-flying-squirrel-">**4. Southern flying squirrel **</h3>
<p>These are the only flying squirrels in North America. They have an average life span of 3-5 years.
Although the oldest recorded squirrel was 19 years, most flying squirrels will live up to 10 years when in confinement.</p>
<h3 id="5-black-squirrels-">**5. Black Squirrels **</h3>
<p>Black squirrels and the eastern grey squirrels belong to the same species with the only difference being the amount of melanin. The black species has more melanin than the fox grey species.
If in the wild, this species can live up to 6 years but this can increase up to 18 years when in captivity.

<h3 id="6-eastern-grey-squirrels-">**6. Eastern Grey Squirrels **</h3>
<p>This is a common squirrel in the Midwest. They have a lifespan of 12-24 years. The oldest recorded grey squirrel was 20 years.</p>
<h2 id="factors-that-affect-the-life-span-of-squirrels-">**Factors That Affect the Life Span of Squirrels **</h2>
<p>If you are keeping a squirrel as a pet, there are different factors that can lower or raise the life span of any squirrel. Below is an outline.</p>
<h3 id="1-pest-and-diseases-">**�1. Pest and diseases **</h3>
<p>Squirrels like any other animals are prone to pests and diseases which if not treated, can lead to death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squirrels are very much prone to viral diseases and the most common viral disease is squirrel pox. It is transmitted by insect bites which later turn into a tumor in some squirrels. In others, this virus can lead to skin ulcers, lesions, and scabs.</li>
<li>There are some other squirrels like the European red squirrel who are so vulnerable that they can even die from the infection. However, there are also those squirrels like the grey squirrel that are resistant to the virus.
The most common pests are ticks and
fleas
. There are also parasites that you are likely to see in squirrels-such are flesh fly that lays its larvae on the ground squirrel. These larvae penetrate the squirrels skin and continue feeding on the body tissues of the squirrel.</li>
<li>In this case, the squirrel can only survive for 5-6 days if not treated.</li>
<li>Other parasites are single-celled coccidia which is found in the digestive system. Though its not fatal, it affects can lead to health deterioration of the squirrel.
Also, they can be attacked by nematodes and flatworms.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-predators-">**2. Predators **</h3>
<p>In the food chain, squirrels are prey to many animals and carnivorous birds. The most common predators are hawks and owls. Their preference for squirrels makes them the number one predators.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other predators include foxes, weasels, skunks, rattle, and black snakes. Unlike other predators, snakes prefer feeding on the young squirrels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-squirrels-in-town-">**3. Squirrels in town **</h3>
<p>Though there are not many predators in the urban areas, squirrels are exposed to all sorts of dangers including being hit by cars, attack by dogs among others.</p>
<ul>
<li>The attacks on the squirrels are less but only skillful and the well-camouflaged squirrels can survive in the urban set-up.
The grey squirrels do very well in the adapted urban set-up as compared to other types of squirrels due to their color.

</ul>
<h3 id="4-loss-of-eyesight-">**4. Loss of eyesight **</h3>
<p>When squirrels become older, they develop cataracts and have a high likelihood of losing vision.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is very dangerous because most of them depend on that to easily spot their predators and run away from danger. Poor eyesight makes them a soft target and an easy way for them to die.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-loss-of-teeth-">**5. Loss of teeth **</h3>
<p>Squirrels are rodents who greatly use their incisors in gnawing and eat. These incisors are sharp and continually grows throughout a squirrels life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anytime the scissor is broken, damaged, or lost this means inability by the squirrel to feed which can lead to death through starvation.</li>
<li>Some squirrels may also suffer a condition called malocclusion where it has misaligned incisors-these affects their feeding in a great way. The good thing is that this condition can be corrected and the squirrels lead a normal life.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>How long do squirrels live? This will totally depend on the predisposing factors and also the species of the squirrel.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is also good to note that, most squirrels in captivity live longer than those in the wild. Most probably, a lot of squirrels have a longer life span if they survive the first and the second year of their life.
Besides all these factors that lead to a shorter lifespan, it is good to be nice to the squirrels and other animals in your garden. If you have spotted squirrels frequently in your garden, maybe you need to consider doing a feeding area for them.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll tackle this question - how long do ticks <a href="/posts/can-no-see-ums-live-in-my-hair/">live</a> on humans? Definitely, longer engagement with ticks could result in infections and conditions such as
anemia just with flea infestations
.
So, in summary, various <a href="/posts/ticks-diseases-index/">tick</a> species will stay on humans for different numbers of hours - but this will also vary with the Host immunity and the life stage of the tick.
However, if the ticks are in the different life stages remain undisturbed on humans, where is the amount of time that they will stay on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult female ticks - 7 to 10 days</li>
<li>Tick nymphs - 3 to 4 days</li>
<li>Tick larvae - roughly 3 days
Let&rsquo;s dig in!

<h2 id="details-how-long-do-ticks-live-on-humans">Details: How Long Do Ticks Live on Humans?</h2>
<p>Ticks will bite humans to suck their blood but will also cause irritation and leave them with red skin around the bite area.
Unfortunately, ticks can also transmit different diseases to dogs and also to humans.
But will the ticks fall off from humans on their own?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, yes, if the tick remains undisturbed (either mechanically or through chemicals), it will only fall off from your skin (within a few days to weeks) once it is fed with blood to its fill.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-ticks-feeding-process">1. Tick&rsquo;s Feeding Process</h3>
<p>Unlike stinging insects like flies and mosquitoes, ticks will bite and remain attached to the human skin for anywhere between hours to weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, ticks will mainly stay in one place for a long time as they suck their hosts&rsquo; (either humans or animals) blood.
Ticks are amazing crawlers and climbers but they can&rsquo;t jump.
So, the pest (ticks) will wait for a suitable host on some tall grass or plant from where they will crawl or climb onto the human being or animal.</li>
<li>Once the tick lands on the animal or human being, it will get an inconspicuous location on the animal&rsquo;s body where it will settle and suck blood.
In humans, ticks will mainly bite and suck blood around an area with a crevice such as a groin or the underarm.
In animals such as dogs, ticks will target and invade locations such as between toes and the ears.
On the tick&rsquo;s feeding mechanism, these organisms will bite their host (animal or human being) and insert a &rsquo;tube&rsquo; that they will use to suck blood.
Additionally, there are tick species that will generate a &lsquo;glue&rsquo; (sticky liquid) that attaches them to their host during the feeding process.</li>
<li>Other tick species have tiny hooks to enable them to remain attached to their hosts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-feeding-to-its-fill">2. Feeding to its Fill</h3>
<p>Ticks suck blood from the host at a slow rate and so these pests can remain in one place for hours up to about 3 weeks.
During the feeding process, the ticks will suck blood from human beings but they also secrete their saliva and inject it into your bloodstream.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, if the tick has an infection or disease, it will inject it into your bloodstream together with the saliva causing an illness in the host
So, how long the tick will remain on its host will depend on its species and life stage. For example, tick nymphs tend to fall off from humans in a short time compared to adult ticks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-the-ticks-die-once-they-bite-me">Will the Ticks Die Once they Bite Me?</h2>
<p>Ticks can live for 1+ years after taking a blood meal from their hosts.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the tick will eventually die if you can&rsquo;t get another blood meal from its last time of feeding.
However, it&rsquo;s incorrect to state that the tick will die once it falls off from the human body - it definitely has a long grace period to survive and I wait for another suitable host.</li>
<li>Most tick species will bite humans and attach themselves there, sucking blood.</li>
<li>They will also inject their saliva into the human bloodstream - this saliva may be carrying disease-causing organisms.
Some people say that disease transmission from ticks to humans mainly happens at the end of the feeding period when the animal gets full.

<h2 id="how-to-find-and-remove-ticks-from-humans">How to find and remove ticks from humans</h2>
<p>Detecting ticks can be a challenging task for most hosts (including humans and dogs) - and this is not just because the kids have small bodies.
The reason is that, just like fleas and bed bugs, ticks inject an anesthetic into the host&rsquo;s body and thus they&rsquo;re able to feed for longer without being detected or felt.</p>
<ul>
<li>The anesthetic allows the host not to feel pain and thus the tick remains undetected.
If the tick remains for a longer time on the human being, there is a likelihood of it transmitting diseases such as Lyme.
For example, deer ticks are known to start transmitting their infections and diseases to their hosts after around 36 hours of sucking blood.
Once you find the tick that is stuck in your body, grab and remove the pest using tweezers and ensure to get very close to the skin.</li>
<li>Next, drop the tick into some rubbing alcohol to exterminate these pests.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-signs-of-tick-bites-on-humans">What are the signs of tick bites on humans?</h2>
<p>A tick bite may transmit diseases to pets and humans or trigger allergic reactions - 10 diseases may turn out deadly or dangerous.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the outdoor spaces, ticks will live in leaf piles, shrubs, trees, and grass.
Ticks will be adapted to pets and humans - they can jump between these two easily.
The arachnids are small (eight-legged) and blood-sucking pests have colors ranging from black, reddish-brown, or brown.

notes that ticks attack the body of pets and humans, especially in locations that are moist and warm such as the hair, groin, and armpits.
Most tick bites tend to generate more sentences but for people that are allergic, you can experience some of these signs;</li>
<li>breathlessness when the tick allergy is severe</li>
<li>blisters</li>
<li>burning sensation</li>
<li>Rashes</li>
<li>Swelling and pain

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in this article, my aim was to outline (in detail) how long a tick will remain on your skin before falling off.
Yes, ticks will fall off from the human body once it&rsquo;s done sucking blood (feeding to their fill). Ticks feed for about 3 to 4 days but this time may increase up to 3 weeks when the insects are engorged.
So, it will be better if you notice (and remove) the tick from your body earlier to reduce the chances of it injecting diseases (such as Lyme disease) and infections into your body through its saliva.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">Flea</a> eggs are one of the most important stages in the flea life cycle, and understanding how long it takes for them to hatch can help you effectively manage a flea infestation. Flea eggs typically hatch within a certain period, depending on environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of a host. This article will provide an overview of how long it takes for flea eggs to hatch and what you can do to speed up the process of eliminating fleas from your home.</p>
<h2 id="flea-egg-hatching-process">Flea Egg Hatching Process</h2>
<p>Flea eggs are laid by adult fleas, and once they are deposited, they can begin the hatching process. Under optimal conditions, flea eggs typically take about 2 to 10 days to hatch. However, the timing can vary based on environmental factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Temperature:**Warmer temperatures speed up the hatching process. Flea eggs are most likely to hatch when the temperature is between 70F to 90F (21C to 32C).</li>
<li>**Humidity:**Fleas thrive in humid conditions, and eggs are more likely to hatch quickly when the humidity is above 50%. Lower humidity levels can slow down the process or even prevent eggs from hatching.</li>
<li>**Presence of a Host:**Fleas detect vibrations and the presence of a host, which may also encourage eggs to hatch. If fleas sense a potential food source nearby, they may hatch sooner.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-the-hatching-time-matters">Why the Hatching Time Matters</h2>
<p>Understanding the hatching time of flea eggs is important for several reasons. Fleas reproduce rapidly, so its essential to prevent eggs from hatching to avoid further infestations. Taking the right preventive measures and using flea control products can help reduce the hatching cycle and prevent adult fleas from developing.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-control-flea-eggs">How to Control Flea Eggs</h2>
<p>Controlling flea eggs requires a comprehensive approach that targets the different stages of the flea life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Vacuuming:**Vacuuming regularly is an effective way to remove flea eggs, larvae, and pupae from carpets, upholstery, and other surfaces. Be sure to empty the vacuum bag or canister immediately to prevent reinfestation.</li>
<li>**Flea Control Products:**Use flea treatments such as flea sprays, powders, and treatments that target flea eggs. Many products contain insect growth regulators (IGRs) that prevent flea eggs from hatching or stop larvae from maturing into adult fleas.</li>
<li>**Washing Bedding and Fabrics:**Wash pet bedding, linens, and other fabric materials frequently in hot water to kill flea eggs and larvae. Dry these items on high heat to ensure that any remaining eggs are destroyed.</li>
<li>**Treating Pets:**Use flea treatments on your pets to prevent adult fleas from laying new eggs. Consult with your veterinarian to find the best treatment for your pet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="factors-that-influence-flea-egg-hatch-time">Factors That Influence Flea Egg Hatch Time</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the time it takes for flea eggs to hatch can be influenced by several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Egg Quality:**Flea eggs laid by healthy, well-fed adult fleas are more likely to hatch quickly. Eggs laid by malnourished fleas or under less-than-ideal conditions may take longer to hatch.</li>
<li>**Environmental Disruptions:**Any sudden changes in the environment, such as cleaning, can disrupt the flea life cycle. Flea eggs might take longer to hatch if the temperature or humidity drops unexpectedly.</li>
<li>**Stage of Flea Development:**Flea eggs will go through different stages of development before hatching, and this process can be delayed if fleas are in the pupal stage or if they are in an environment that is not conducive to hatching.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Flea eggs generally take between 2 to 10 days to hatch, but this timeline can vary depending on temperature, humidity, and the presence of a host. If youre dealing with a flea infestation, its important to take action quickly to prevent eggs from hatching and causing further problems. By using flea control products, vacuuming regularly, and washing bedding, you can help control the flea population and prevent future infestations. Always ensure your pets are treated for fleas, and consult with a veterinarian for the best approach to managing flea problems.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Painting the interior of a <a href="/posts/house-lizard-lifespan/">house</a> is a rewarding project that transforms living spaces, adding vibrancy and freshness. However, many homeowners wonder: <em>how long does it take to paint a house <a href="/posts/best-paint-for-interior-doors/">interior</a>?</em> The answer depends on several factors, including the size of the house, the number of rooms, the level of preparation, and the techniques used.</p>
<h2 id="factors-affecting-the-time-to-paint-a-house-interior">Factors Affecting the Time to Paint a House Interior</h2>
<h3 id="1-size-of-the-house">1. Size of the House</h3>
<p>The size of the house significantly impacts the time required to paint. A smaller home or apartment may take a few days, while a larger house could take up to a week or more.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>1,0002,000 square feet:</em> Approximately 35 days</li>
<li><em>2,0003,000 square feet:</em> 57 days</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-number-of-rooms">2. Number of Rooms</h3>

<p>Heres an approximate timeline for painting a standard 12x12 room:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Preparation:**23 hours (cleaning, repairs, taping)</li>
<li>**Priming:**12 hours</li>
<li>**Painting:**35 hours (2 coats with drying time)</li>
<li>**Cleanup:**1 hour
Total: ~711 hours per room</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-to-speed-up-the-process">Tips to Speed Up the Process</h2>
<p>To complete your interior painting project more quickly, consider these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use high-quality paints for better coverage with fewer coats.</li>
<li>Invest in efficient tools like roller extenders and paint sprayers.</li>

<li>Plan and organize your workspace to minimize interruptions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The time required to paint the interior of a house depends on various factors, including size, preparation, and the number of coats. While smaller projects may take a day or two, larger homes can extend to a week or more. By planning efficiently and using the right tools and techniques, you can ensure a smooth and timely painting process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thus, for cardio endurance, you can do 4 sets of 20 reps with 60 seconds of rest in between.</li>
<li>Conversely, you can do 5 sets of 5 reps for power and strength using a higher box <a href="/posts/why-do-crickets-jump-towards-you/">jump</a>.
If youre new to box jumping or just want to increase or enhance the level of your jumps, you might wonder how many boxes jumps you need to do to attain the best results.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-how-many-box-jumps-should-i-do-you-might-be-wondering"><strong>So, How Many Box Jumps Should I Do? You Might be Wondering</strong></h2>
<p>Well, I will answer this question in two dimensions. First, if youre doing Box Jumps to improve your cardio endurance and lose fat you need to do at least 4 sets of 20 reps using a lower box. Rest for about 60 seconds then continue. The key here is to listen to your body and stop whenever you need to.</p>
<p>Secondly, if your intention is to build power and overall body strength, youll need to focus on quality over quantity. Do at least 5 sets of 5 reps using a higher box. Rest for 1to 3 minutes. If you feel strong enough push it a little further, but dont overdo it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-about-box-jumps">What You Need To Know About Box Jumps</h2>
<p>Box jumps require a lot of concentration and coordination to perform them correctly. Youll need to engage your lower body and the core to attain a better jump.</p>
<p>Ensure that you include box jumps at the beginning of your workout routines. If possible, after you warm up you can start with box jumps. This way you avoid being excessively fatigued before jumping. This strategy enhances your safety.</p>
<h2 id="simple-tips-for-beginner-box-jumps">Simple Tips for Beginner Box Jumps</h2>
<p>As a beginner, you need to take box jumps slowly, go at your own pace, and eventually, youll see success. I coach both men and women at the gym through various exercises including box jumps.</p>
<p>Most of those that I have trained have acquired the required skills for jumping, but they didnt start that way. Just like lifting, jumping is a skill that you can easily work on and perfect. You need to practice and train more and eventually, youll see success.</p>
<p>Of course, most beginners are scared to death when it comes to box jumps. Thus, I will walk you through some crucial tips you need to keep in mind as a beginner in box jumps.
<strong>Tips to Improve Beginner Box Jumps</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-dont-be-afraid">1. Dont Be Afraid</h3>
<p>I had a client, who really struggled with jumps, she was so afraid of jumping. Her body was so stiff. She couldnt jump properly. Nevertheless, with patience and practice, she did better over time.</p>
<p>While jumping its crucial that you relax. Relax your arms, let them move unrestrictedly, and then take a nice relaxed jump.</p>
<p>Avoid being stiff and dont clench or make fists with your hands. These actions will work against you, just relax and let everything flow.</p>
<h3 id="2-land-softly">2. Land Softly</h3>
<p>Its crucial that you practice landing from the box softly. Soft landing allows the legs to absorb your weight. Therefore, before starting your jumping exercises you can build your strength by doing deadlifts, squats, amok other workouts.</p>
<p>Strength and mobility are important foundations for your box jumping exercises.</p>

<p>Ensure that you adopt a good jumping form and technique. Well talk about the best jumping form and technique later on in this article.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-should-athletes-do-jump-training">How Often Should Athletes Do Jump Training</h2>
<p><strong>2-3 box jumps per week</strong>
If youre wondering how often athletes should do jump training, then this section is for you.</p>
<p>As an athlete, youll need to do 2-3 box jumps training per week. This is crucial because youll give your body and the nervous system enough time to recover.</p>
<p>Overdoing the box jumps may cause joint stress plus other serious injuries to your body. Dont tax your body a lot.</p>
<p>Besides, a

comparing between low- moderate- and high- levels jump has revealed that overdoing the jumps may not bring in the desired results.</p>
<p>This study advocates doing better jumps and at a Moderate-frequency i.e. 2-3 jumps per week. You dont need to perform higher frequency jumps per week to attain positive results. If you do this, youll cause unnecessary stress to your joints and the body wont have enough recovery time.</p>
<h2 id="how-manysets-and-reps-ofbox-jumps-should-i-do">How many�sets and reps of�box jumps should I do?</h2>
<p>If youre a beginner in box jumps you can start with a set of 5 with 510 reps. Rest for 60 seconds between sets to give your body time to recover before you take on the next rep. However, listen to your body and stop if you need to.</p>
<h2 id="rules-for-better-box-jumps">Rules for Better Box Jumps</h2>
<p>Just like other workout routines, box jumps are a great workout alternative that you can engage in at the gym. However, its crucial that you do the jumps correctly to avoid injuries. If its your first time jumping go easy on yourself and follow the rules.</p>
<p>So, what are the Rules for better box jumps?</p>
<h3 id="1-practice-landing">1. Practice Landing</h3>
<p>The correct landing will help you avoid stress on joints or the lower back. If this is your first time doing box jumps, dont let fear hold you back. You need to build on your confidence by doing progression exercises.</p>
<p>First, you can step onto the box then step down. Continue doing this process until you feel comfortable enough with the movements.</p>
<p>Next, incorporate your arms; let them swing freely as you step up the box. Youll notice that your coordination has improved and youre ready for your first jump.</p>
<h3 id="2-develop-correct-squatting-posture">2. Develop Correct Squatting Posture</h3>
<p>If you do squats correctly and youre comfortable doing them, then youre highly likely to perform well in box jumps.</p>
<p>However, if you are not good at squats you can practice. Check your form while squatting. Ensure your hips and knees are bends and your weight is in your heels. Chest out, then squat.</p>
<p>While doing box jumps avoid dropping into deep squat positions. Deep squatting may make jumping difficult. Instead, drop into a snap position before jumping. Hips should be above the knees. Knees should remain stable and apart.</p>
<h3 id="3-start-with-a-low-box-height">3. Start With a Low Box Height</h3>
<p>Start with a low-height box before advancing to the higher ones. Master the art of effective jumping first to avoid getting injuries.</p>
<p>Dont feel intimidated when you see others exercising on a 50-inch box or a height higher than the one youre currently using. Everyone has his or her own fitness journey, as you must start somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="4-best-box-jump-height-for-beginners"><strong>4. Best box jump height for beginners</strong></h3>
<p>6 inches box height is ideal for a beginner box jumper. If you feel strong you can go a bit higher and start at 12 inches.</p>
<p>Athletes who are new to box jumping need to use low-height boxes for their exercise. As you master the art of box jumping, you can progress with the height. Avoid progressing to a higher box if you still can&rsquo;t attain a set of 5 good jumps on the low box youre using.</p>
<h2 id="box-jump-alternative">Box jump alternative</h2>

      <description>Bed bug infestations are a significant concern for homeowners, renters, and property managers. These tiny pests can cause both physical discomfort and emot...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/bed-bugs-vs-other-pests/">Bed</a> <a href="/posts/how-to-find-bed-bugs-during-the-day/">bug</a> infestations are a significant concern for homeowners, renters, and property managers. These tiny pests can cause both physical discomfort and emotional distress, as they often leave itchy, red bites and are notoriously difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>While DIY treatments might seem like a cost-effective solution, hiring a professional exterminator is often the most reliable and efficient option. However, the cost of bed bug extermination can vary based on a variety of factors. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of what to expect when it comes to the cost of bed bug extermination services.</p>
<h2 id="1-average-cost-of-bed-bug-extermination">1. Average Cost of Bed Bug Extermination</h2>
<p>The cost of hiring a professional exterminator to eliminate a bed bug infestation typically ranges between $300 and $5,000. This broad range reflects several influencing factors, including the size of the property, the severity of the infestation, and the type of treatment selected.</p>
<p>For a typical home with a moderate infestation, you can expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,500 for professional bed bug extermination services. However, larger properties, particularly multi-unit buildings, can incur significantly higher costs. In contrast, smaller homes or apartments with minimal infestations may cost less to treat. Its essential to remember that the cost of extermination is an investment in your health and peace of mind.</p>
<h2 id="2-factors-affecting-the-cost-of-bed-bug-extermination">2. Factors Affecting the Cost of Bed Bug Extermination</h2>
<p>Several factors can influence the final cost of bed bug extermination. Understanding these elements can help you anticipate the potential expenses and make an informed decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Property Size:**The larger the property, the more expensive it is to treat. If you live in a multi-story home or a multi-unit building, the cost of extermination will increase due to the increased square footage. Larger homes with multiple bedrooms or larger common areas require more time and resources to treat, thus increasing the cost.</li>
<li>**Severity of the Infestation:**The extent of the bed bug problem plays a significant role in determining the overall cost. A minor infestation thats confined to a single room will cost less to treat than an extensive infestation that has spread throughout the home. In cases where bed bugs have infiltrated multiple rooms or floors, exterminators will need to spend more time and use more resources, which increases the cost of the treatment.</li>
<li>**Type of Treatment:**Different extermination methods come with varying price tags. For instance, heat treatment typically costs more upfront but may only require a single visit. On the other hand, chemical treatments or fumigation may need multiple visits, which can increase the overall price. The treatment method selected depends on the severity of the infestation, the property size, and the preference of the homeowner or exterminator.</li>
<li>**Location:**The region in which you live can also affect the cost of pest control services. Urban areas, particularly large cities, tend to have higher costs for pest control due to higher operating expenses for pest control companies. In more rural areas, the prices may be more affordable. Its also worth noting that the cost of labor and the availability of pest control services may differ between regions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-heat-treatment-vs-chemical-treatment">3. Heat Treatment vs. Chemical Treatment</h2>
<p>When it comes to bed bug extermination, there are primarily two types of treatment methods: heat treatment and chemical treatment. Both methods have their pros and cons, and the best choice depends on the specific circumstances of the infestation.</p>
<h3 id="heat-treatment">Heat Treatment</h3>
<p>Heat treatment is one of the most effective ways to eliminate bed bugs. This method involves raising the temperature of the affected area to a level that is lethal to bed bugs, typically around 120F to 140F (49C to 60C). The heat is applied to all infested areas, including furniture, cracks, and crevices, ensuring that no bed bugs survive.</p>
<p>Heat treatments are highly effective and typically only require one visit. They are especially useful for severe infestations and for properties where the use of chemicals is not preferred, such as in homes with young children or pets. However, heat treatment can be expensive, typically ranging from $2,000 to $4,000, depending on the size of the property and the severity of the infestation. Despite the high cost, many homeowners opt for this method because it is fast and effective.</p>
<h3 id="chemical-treatment">Chemical Treatment</h3>
<p>Chemical treatment involves the use of insecticides and pesticides to target bed bugs in various stages of their life cycle. This method can be less expensive, with costs ranging from $300 to $1,500. However, chemical treatments often require multiple visits and can take several weeks to fully eradicate the infestation.</p>
<p>The chemicals used in these treatments can also pose risks to human health if not properly applied, making it essential to work with a licensed pest control professional.</p>
<p>While chemical treatments are effective, they may not always eliminate all the bed bugs on the first try. In some cases, bed bugs may develop resistance to certain chemicals, making the treatment less effective over time. For this reason, many pest control experts recommend using chemical treatments in conjunction with other methods, such as vacuuming or heat treatment, for more comprehensive results.</p>
<h2 id="4-diy-vs-professional-extermination">4. DIY vs. Professional Extermination</h2>
<p>Many homeowners attempt to control bed bug infestations on their own, using DIY products such as sprays, powders, and traps. These products typically cost between $50 and $200, depending on the brand and type.</p>
<p>While DIY solutions may seem like a more affordable option, they are often less effective than professional extermination services. In particular, DIY treatments can be insufficient for severe infestations or for areas that are difficult to reach.</p>
<p>Bed bugs are notorious for being challenging to eliminate. Even if DIY products seem to provide some relief, they often dont address the root of the problem. As a result, the infestation may return, leading to additional costs and frustration. Professional exterminators, on the other hand, have the expertise, experience, and tools to provide a thorough, lasting solution.</p>
<h2 id="5-cost-of-follow-up-visits">5. Cost of Follow-Up Visits</h2>
<p>In many cases, bed bug extermination requires follow-up visits to ensure the infestation is completely eradicated. Exterminators typically charge between $100 and $400 per visit for follow-up treatments. These visits are necessary to inspect the property, ensure that the treatment was effective, and reapply any necessary treatments.</p>
<p>Follow-up visits are particularly important if the infestation is extensive or if the original treatment was not fully effective. Some exterminators may include follow-up visits in the initial cost, while others may charge them separately. Its essential to clarify the pricing structure with your exterminator before committing to a service.</p>
<h2 id="6-additional-costs-to-consider">6. Additional Costs to Consider</h2>
<p>In addition to the direct costs of extermination, there are other expenses you may need to account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Pre-treatment preparation:**Some exterminators charge additional fees for pre-treatment tasks such as removing furniture, cleaning the home, or packing away personal items. These tasks can add to the overall cost of the service.</li>
<li>**Cleaning and repair:**After the bed bugs are eradicated, you may need to replace or repair items affected by the infestation, such as furniture, linens, or carpets. Additionally, you may need to launder or dispose of infested clothing and bedding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While bed bug extermination can be costly, its important to view it as an investment in your health, comfort, and property. The cost of professional pest control services varies depending on several factors, including the size of your home, the severity of the infestation, the treatment method, and your location.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although DIY treatments might seem like a cheaper alternative, they are often less effective in eliminating bed bugs. If you suspect a bed bug infestation, its best to consult with a licensed pest control professional to evaluate the situation and recommend the most effective course of action.
Prompt treatment is crucial to preventing the infestation from spreading and to minimizing the financial and emotional impact of these resilient pests.</li>

<h2 id="when-to-hire-a-professional-spider-exterminator">When to Hire a Professional Spider Exterminator</h2>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve seen a single or few spiders around and you&rsquo;re wondering is it time I called the exterminator?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s important to know the type and number of spiders that you can handle along and when you need to make that call to your exterminator for help with spider control.
**Hire a Spider Exterminator? **
If you can observe the spider and figure out which type it is - harmless or poisonous, then it&rsquo;ll be easy to determine if you should call the exterminator.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just an average, harmless spider in the house then there is no need for any help at all from pest control specialists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, the market hasspider trapsand catchers that enable spider control without touching or coming near the bug.
A spider catcher is a tool that is used for catching and releasing spiders.</li>
<li>A spider catcher usually consists of a long pole with a loop at the end, which can be either an open or closed hoop. The very tip of this rod has soft bristles - what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;the hook&rdquo;.
As soon as you see any type of spider crawling on your wall, in front of windows, etc., simply flick it out using the hooked part to release it outside from where it came from!</li>
<li>These tools will save you all types of panic attacks and stress from spider attacks
In this video, exterminator Jim Triggs provides some tips on how to kill spiders at home using a spider catcher.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwPECUavj8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwPECUavj8</a></p>
<p>Well, a number of factors are important to consider in deciding whether or not you should contact an exterminator. But, before reaching out to a pest control company, take a look at</p>
<ol>
<li>What the company can do for you, and</li>
<li>If this type of problem is within their scope.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="so-how-much-do-spider-exterminators-cost">So, How Much Do Spider Exterminators Cost?</h2>
<p>That depends on a number of factors.</p>
<p>Every company has its own pricing structure that may not be clear upfront, which means you need to take time and research prices before committing to anything.</p>
<p>And even then, there&rsquo;s no guarantee what your actual budget will end up being because rates vary by the city!</p>
<ul>
<li>You also have other factors like how many treatments they offer per year as well as if they provide any type of warranty or guarantees with the service.</li>
<li>Some companies offer monthly packages so make sure you find out this information ahead of time so you know what your total investment will be long-term versus
<strong>1. Cost of a Reactive Spider Treatment</strong>
Reactive treatment to control spiders inside your home can cost anywhere from $100 - $300. This will generally just get rid of any recent, active spiders in the house.</li>
<li>In reactive treatment, exterminators will spray pesticide in areas such as inside baseboards, ceilings, and the crawl spaces around your house.
It&rsquo;s not likely to offer any long-term protection from future infestations because it doesn&rsquo;t get rid of anything outside (in the yard or on neighboring properties) and it won&rsquo;t protect against more spiders coming into your house in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-preventive-spider-treatment">2. Preventive Spider Treatment</h3>
<p>Preventive spider treatment�will cost you anywhere from $500 - $1,000, but it can offer a lot more protection.</p>
<p>In this type of treatment, an exterminator will spray pesticide outside your house and on neighboring properties to deal with any spiders that could come in.</p>
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;ll also seal up the exterior cracks or gaps around your house so those spiders won&rsquo;t be able to get inside either.</li>
<li>This will involve spraying the outdoor-facing areas like various entry points, eaves, door frames, and windows to prevent a spider invasion.
One approach in preventive treatment is to set up a contract with an exterminator who will visit your property quarterly, annually, or both.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information-to-give-the-exterminator-for-spiders">Information to give the Exterminator for Spiders</h2>
<p>Working together, the exterminator and you can effectively get rid of spider infestations inside your spaces - office, yard, or home.</p>
<p>Before you call an exterminator, make sure to know what kind of information they&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<h3 id="1-spider-species-in-question">1. Spider Species in Question?</h3>
<p>The type of spider in question can affect the extermination measures, so it&rsquo;s important to tell your exterminator the specific spider they will be working with.</p>
<p>You can provide the exterminator with a call describing what types of spiders are present as well as their general physical characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Among the most common arachnids found in homes are funnel web,<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/spider-chart"><strong>jumping</strong></a>,<a href="http://entomology.wsu.edu/outreach/bug-info/yellow-sac-spider/"><strong>yellow sac</strong></a>,<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/longbodied-cellar-spider"><strong>cellar spider</strong></a>,<a href="http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/brown-recluse-spiders"><strong>brown recluse</strong></a>,�and<a href="https://texasinsects.tamu.edu/southern-black-widow-spider/"><strong>black widow</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-spider-location">2. Spider Location</h3>
<p>Gathering information about the spiders&rsquo; location will ensure that your exterminator is better prepared for effective treatment.</p>
<p>The exterminator will need to know the specifics of your home or space, such as the spider-infested areas. This will allow them to begin work without wasting time studying coverage areas.</p>
<p>It is important to call your pest control company as soon as you see any evidence that there is a spider problem in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>One way to identify this is seeing webbing anywhere from corners up the walls and in dark spaces like under cabinets, crawl space, or the attic.</li>
<li>Also, check webbing around windowsills, near hanging indoor plants, or behind curtains on window frames that extend floor-to-ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-duration-of-the-spider-infestation">3. Duration of the Spider Infestation</h3>
<p>A spider infestation can be short or long in duration.</p>
<p>If the spiders are only coming inside your home during rainy periods, it might just be a temporary issue with an open window which should clear up when the weather changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>But their webbing keeps increasing over time, then this indicates that professional intervention may need to happen sooner rather than later.
At the time of service, you will have to answer questions about the first spider sighting. This will allow the exterminator to assess the severity of the spider infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-recurring-spiderwebs">4. Recurring Spiderwebs</h3>
<p>If you have been seeing evidence of spider webs for more than six months and there is no reason why they would come indoors (or go outdoors).</p>
<p>Spiders will spin webs periodically, but they are usually only in one place for a short time.</p>
<p>A recurring spiderweb can be an indication that there is a nest of spiders nearby and the web is their hunting ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>The webs will get bigger or recur as more spiders come to feed on prey (i.e., you) until it gets so big that the structure collapses or washes away with rainwater.
This would be especially true if your house has another pest, such as insects or rodents which could attract spiders.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this happens contact exterminators who specialize in removing these pests from homes even before they cause any damage!</p>
<h3 id="5-any-spider-eggs-seen">5. Any Spider Eggs Seen?</h3>
<p>If you spot spider eggs in your home, it&rsquo;s a sign that you have spiders. Spider mothers can lay up to 100 eggs at one time and they will hatch within two weeks of being laid.</p>
<p>Spider eggs are a sign that you have spiders, and if they hatch before extermination is done then it will cause more problems for your home.</p>
<p>So, let the exterminator know if you&rsquo;ve seen spider eggs, and don&rsquo;t spray insecticides indoors without first asking for the exterminator&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may notice egg sacs that are woven on the ceiling or wall, on leaves of any indoor plant, or under the spiderweb inside the corners of a room.
When you notice a number of egg sacs laying around in different corners of the rooms, it is possible an infestation has already begun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-to-ask-the-spider-exterminator">What to Ask the Spider Exterminator</h2>
<p>When it comes to getting rid of spiders, finding the right exterminator matters.</p>
<p>To find out if youve found the right one, ask them these critical questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How often should I expect an exterminator to come?</li>
<li>What are your methods of extermination for spiders and other bugs?</li>
<li>What is the procedure for spider removal from inside walls, ceilings, or window screens?</li>
<li>Would you be picking up any furniture that needs to be sprayed with insecticide?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-licenses-and-credentials">1. Licenses and Credentials</h3>
<p>Certifications and credentials are important, but also only tell one part of the story.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask what licenses they hold instead, especially if you live in a state with specific laws about pest control (like California).</p>
<p>What kind of entomology certification do they have? If there is no response given by the company about their qualifications, it could mean that either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person doesn&rsquo;t know because he has never been asked before</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re too busy trying to get your business</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s something fishy
When looking for the right company to handle your spider infestation, it&rsquo;s important that you ask about their qualifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>You want written proof of their certifications, licenses, and registration. Ask for these documents before hiring the extermination company.</p>
<h3 id="2-references">2. References</h3>
<p>What are former customers saying about the services the spider extermination company offers?</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, ask them how long have they been in business, and how many customers do they serve on a regular basis?
Check the competence of the company by asking previous clients about their experience.</li>
<li>Reliable exterminator review websites such as Angie&rsquo;s List and HomeAdvisor can help you find a qualified specialist in your region.
Interview the past clients on the quality of service that the exterminator provided - especially on spider control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-extermination-methods-and-chemicals">2. Extermination Methods and Chemicals</h3>
<p>Ask the exterminator about their methods of spider elimination. Do they use environmentally safe chemicals?</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, spider control mainly uses<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.html"><strong>pyrethrin</strong></a>as the key ingredient since it kills the bugs on contact.
Barrier treatments, such as those using synthetic
<a href="https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/ent-6003/"><strong>pyrethroids</strong></a>
can offer additional protection.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to know what chemicals will be used by the exterminator in treatment before any chemicals are applied to your spaces.</p>
<p>Spider control can be achieved by using environmentally safe chemicals.</p>
<ul>
<li>This method is best for sensitive areas such as schools and hospitals, or in homes with pets and children.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-spider-control-guarantees"><strong>3. Spider Control Guarantees</strong></h3>
<p>As a homeowner, you want to know that the problems with your spider infestation are going to be treated properly and effectively.</p>
<p>The best way to know for certain that your spider infestation is under control is with a guarantee.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spider Control Guarantees to ensure you don&rsquo;t have any more spiders or be able to come back and treat the problem at no additional charge if they do return.
Many companies offer their clients guarantees, but there are many other factors to consider before selecting which company&rsquo;s services will work best for you.</li>
<li>Some of these considerations include price, length of the service contract, whether it includes maintenance agreements, and what type of chemicals they use in treatment.
Most companies offer a money-back guarantee and limited reapplication, but the duration of the warranty may differ.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-how-many-treatments-are-required">3. How many Treatments are Required?</h3>
<p>To get rid of spiders in your home, you will need to do a few treatments.</p>
<p>The number of spider treatments will depend on how bad the problem is with the spiders and how many there are.</p>
<p>Therefore, discuss the number of treatments required on the space after the exterminator conducts the property inspection.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-handle-pets-during-spider-treatment">How to Handle Pets During Spider Treatment</h2>
<p>When spider control treatment is initiated, it&rsquo;s important to know how to keep your pet safe.
**1. Isolate Pets to Untreated Rooms **
Spider infestations generally don&rsquo;t involve hundreds of spiders. They will typically only cover a small section of the house.</p>
<p>The pet might need to stay elsewhere during an insect treatment service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore the exterminator can accommodate them by giving you the choice of a room or two where they will not be applying pesticides - may be in the living room or bedroom.
If your pet is not allowed out of the house or if you have a cat, then just try to limit their access to areas where they may come into contact with spider control treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you let your pets roam around outside and are treating for spiders in the yard, make sure that all windows and doors are closed so no one can get inside without being noticed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to keep an eye on any plants around the house because some treatments do affect plant life as well as insects and other pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is something that concerns you, it will be best to discuss details with someone from the company before services take place. They should be able to give insight on how much exposure there would be during spider control treatment if needed
<strong>2. Lock them in Pet carriers</strong>
As this article explains, the kennel is one of the best options for pet owners when dealing with pest control in residences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pet owners should consider locking their pets in a kennel when treating pests at home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pet carriers are more portable and lighter than traditional cages, making it easier to move your pet from one location to another.
Pet carriers will offer short-time refuge for the pets against the spider control chemical but it&rsquo;s required.</li>
<li>In the event that you have any questions about how to best handle your pets during spider control treatment, we recommend discussing this with someone from the chosen pest control company.
They should be able to give insight on how much exposure there would be if needed and provide guidance for ensuring pet safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a kennel is not available or can&rsquo;t be used as an alternative option, it will likely be necessary to lock them inside one of their normal crates while spraying takes place in the vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-take-after-the-spider-extermination-or-treatment">Steps To Take After the Spider Extermination or Treatment</h2>
<p>**1. Continnauly Check for Spiders **
First, once the exterminator is done treating your home for spiders, run a dry inspection to check for spiders that may have survived and report, if any, to the exterminator.</p>
<p>After a spider treatment, it is normal for live spiders to continue dying over the next few days and with less frequency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to check indoor areas regularly
<strong>2. Don&rsquo;t Clean Immediately</strong>
Professional exterminators won&rsquo;t leave a mess on the spider-treated spaces. Thus, you must not mop or clean the spaces and floors immediately.</li>
<li>While some treatments are applied directly to the baseboards, others come in granular form that can be vacuumed up after application - avoid this as it&rsquo;ll reduce its effectiveness.
After your pest control service has treated your home, you are left with an insect carcass or two and messy traps - but don&rsquo;t do a deep cleaning at least for a few days.
<strong>3. Repair any leaks</strong>
While looking out for possible survivors, make time to barricade your property against future invaders.</li>
<li>This can be done by sealing cracks and gaps, minimizing prolonged exposure to the outdoors, and avoiding clutter.
Be sure to keep all food in sealed containers if it&rsquo;s not eaten. This will prevent pests from coming in to get their next meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seal up any openings and cracks on the outside of your homes, such as around pipes, doors, or windows.</p>
<p>When painting over these areas use a paint that contains residual insecticide so it&rsquo;ll act as an extra line of defense against unwanted wildlife. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether the new paint is chemical-free, ask for a material safety data sheet (MSDS) before applying it yourself.</p>
<p>If you have gaps smaller than a one-half inch or vents less than 12 square inches then they need to be sealed with steel wool.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-alert-the-neighbors-about-the-spider-treatment">Should You Alert the Neighbors about the Spider Treatment?</h2>
<p>Noticing a spider infestation in your home could mean that you are not on your own!</p>
<p>Homeowners often have a misunderstanding of spiders. On one hand, they only move when it is necessary to do so; yet this doesn&rsquo;t indicate that they cant find their way into better hiding places if needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of the pests must start at every level: inside and outside the property - including on your neighbor&rsquo;s property and thus you should alert them before the spider treatment.
Watch the video below to see how spiderlings hatch from their egg sacs and migrate.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the question of how much do spider exterminators cost? it is far more imperative that you get on top of the infestation as soon as possible before it becomes worse.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-painters-and-their-earning-potential"><strong>Types of Painters and Their Earning Potential</strong></h3>
<p>Not all painters are the same, and their income often depends on the type of work they do. Heres a breakdown of the main categories of painters and what they typically earn:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fine Artists (Art Painters):<strong>Fine artists create original works of art, such as paintings, murals, and illustrations.

However, top-tier artists can earn six figures or more, especially if their work gains recognition in the art world.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial and Residential Painters:<strong>These painters work on buildings, homes, and other structures. Commercial painters typically handle larger projects like office buildings, while residential painters focus on homes and apartments. The BLS reports that the median annual wage for painters in construction and maintenance was</strong>42,130in2022.Entrylevelpaintersmaystartataround42,130in2022.Entrylevelpaintersmaystartataround29,430</strong>, while experienced professionals can earn upwards of**$67,960**.</li>

The price for hiring a professional exterminator can vary based on several factors, including the severity of the infestation, the type of service provided, and the location. In this article, we will explore the typical costs associated with hiring an exterminator for <a href="/posts/best-poison-for-mouse/">mice</a> and what you can expect during the process.</p>
<h2 id="factors-that-affect-the-cost-of-exterminating-mice">Factors That Affect the Cost of Exterminating Mice</h2>
<p>Several factors can influence the cost of extermination services for mice, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Size of the infestation:**The larger the infestation, the higher the cost. A few mice may only require a one-time treatment, while a larger infestation may need multiple visits and more intensive treatments.</li>
<li>**Type of service:**Exterminators may offer different types of services, such as one-time treatments, monthly visits, or ongoing pest control programs. The more extensive the service, the higher the cost.</li>
<li>**Location:**The cost of extermination can vary based on where you live. Urban areas or regions with a high demand for pest control services may charge more compared to rural areas.</li>
<li>**Size of your home:**The larger your home, the more it will cost to treat. Exterminators typically charge based on the square footage of your home or the number of rooms that need to be treated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="average-cost-of-hiring-an-exterminator-for-mice">Average Cost of Hiring an Exterminator for Mice</h2>
<p>On average, you can expect to pay anywhere from $100 to $600 to hire an exterminator for mice. Here is a breakdown of the typical costs based on different types of services:</p>
<ul>
<li>**One-time treatment:**A one-time treatment for mice typically costs between $100 and $300. This service usually includes a thorough inspection of your home, placement of traps or bait, and removal of any dead rodents.</li>
<li>**Ongoing services:**If you opt for ongoing pest control services, you may pay anywhere from $200 to $600 for a treatment plan that involves multiple visits. This may include routine inspections and treatments to ensure that the infestation does not return.</li>
<li>**Inspection and assessment fees:**Some exterminators charge a separate fee for an initial inspection and assessment, which can range from $50 to $200. This cost may be included in the overall treatment price or charged separately.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-costs-to-consider">Additional Costs to Consider</h2>
<p>In addition to the base price for extermination services, there are other potential costs to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Repairs and exclusions:**In some cases, you may need to repair holes or cracks in your home that mice are using to enter. Exterminators may offer exclusion services, such as sealing entry points, which can add to the total cost of the treatment.</li>
<li>**Follow-up visits:**Depending on the severity of the infestation, you may need follow-up visits to ensure that the mice have been completely eradicated. These visits can cost $50 to $150 each, depending on the service provider and location.</li>
<li>**Rodent-proofing:**Some exterminators may offer rodent-proofing services, which involve making your home less inviting to mice in the future. This can include sealing gaps, installing barriers, and setting up preventative measures. The cost for these services can range from $200 to $1,000, depending on the size of your home and the level of work required.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diy-vs-professional-extermination">DIY vs. Professional Extermination</h2>
<p>If you are trying to save money, you may be tempted to handle the mouse infestation yourself. While there are many DIY solutions available, such as traps, baits, and repellents, hiring a professional exterminator is often the more effective option. Here are some pros and cons of DIY versus professional extermination:</p>
<ul>
<li>**DIY:**DIY solutions can be less expensive upfront, but they may not fully eliminate the infestation. Mice can be difficult to trap, and an incomplete solution may lead to a recurring problem.</li>
<li>**Professional extermination:**Professional exterminators have the experience and tools to effectively identify the source of the infestation and eradicate it. While it is more expensive, you are more likely to get long-lasting results and avoid the need for multiple treatments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-for-reducing-the-cost-of-mice-extermination">Tips for Reducing the Cost of Mice Extermination</h2>
<p>While hiring an exterminator can be expensive, there are ways to reduce the overall cost of the service:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Schedule a consultation:**Many exterminators offer free consultations or inspections. Take advantage of these services to get an estimate of the cost before committing to treatment.</li>
<li>**Bundle services:**If you need other pest control services (such as for ants or termites), you may be able to bundle them with your mouse treatment for a discounted price.</li>
<li>**Preventative measures:**Taking preventative steps to keep mice out of your home, such as sealing entry points, keeping food stored properly, and removing clutter, can reduce the need for professional extermination services in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The cost of hiring an exterminator for mice can range from $100 to $600, depending on factors such as the size of the infestation, the type of service provided, and your location. While DIY solutions may be less expensive initially, hiring a professional exterminator is often the most effective way to eliminate a mouse infestation and prevent future problems. By understanding the costs involved and taking steps to prevent infestations, you can keep your home mouse-free and avoid unnecessary expenses in the future.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Painting the exterior of your house is an important maintenance task that helps protect the structure from the elements while also improving its curb appeal. However, the question of how often you <a href="/posts/how-often-should-you-repaint-interior-walls/">should</a> paint your house exterior can vary depending on several factors. In this article, we will explore the factors that influence how often you should repaint your house and provide some general guidelines to help you determine the best timing for your home.</p>
<h2 id="factors-that-affect-how-often-you-should-paint-your-house-exterior">Factors That Affect How Often You Should Paint Your House Exterior</h2>
<p>There are several factors that influence how often you should paint your house exterior:</p>
<h3 id="1-climate-and-weather-conditions">1. Climate and Weather Conditions</h3>
<p>The climate in your area plays a significant role in how often your homes exterior needs repainting. Homes located in areas with harsh weather conditions, such as intense sun, rain, or snow, will require more frequent repainting. UV rays from the sun can cause paint to fade, crack, and peel more quickly. Areas with high humidity or moisture can lead to mildew and mold buildup, which can also damage the paint.</p>
<h3 id="2-type-of-paint-and-finish">2. Type of Paint and Finish</h3>
<p>The type of paint and finish you choose for your exterior can impact how long it lasts. For example, high-quality paints with durable finishes may last longer than cheaper paints or those with lower durability. Satin and semi-gloss finishes tend to last longer than flat finishes, making them ideal for high-exposure areas like trim and doors.</p>
<h3 id="3-material-of-the-exterior-surface">3. Material of the Exterior Surface</h3>
<p>The material of your homes exterior also affects how often you need to repaint. Different materials have varying levels of durability when it comes to paint adherence. Heres a general guideline:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Wood:**Wood surfaces tend to require repainting every 3 to 7 years because wood is susceptible to moisture damage, warping, and fading.</li>
<li>**Stucco:**Stucco homes typically need to be repainted every 5 to 6 years, as stucco can crack and allow water to seep in, which can lead to peeling paint.</li>
<li>**Brick:**Brick homes are more durable and can go 5 to 10 years without needing a fresh coat of paint. However, the type of paint used can affect this timeline.</li>
<li>**Vinyl:**Vinyl siding does not require as frequent repainting. It generally lasts around 10 years before needing touch-ups.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-exposure-to-sunlight">4. Exposure to Sunlight</h3>
<p>The amount of sunlight your homes exterior receives can impact the lifespan of the paint. Homes facing direct sunlight for extended periods will typically need repainting more often due to the suns fading effect on paint. North-facing sides tend to last longer because they receive less direct sunlight.</p>
<h3 id="5-maintenance-and-care">5. Maintenance and Care</h3>
<p>Regular cleaning and upkeep can extend the life of your exterior paint. Keeping your exterior free from dirt, mildew, and debris can prevent premature wear and tear on the paint. Pressure washing the exterior every 6 to 12 months can help remove buildup and maintain the appearance of your paint.</p>
<h2 id="general-guidelines-for-how-often-to-paint-your-house-exterior">General Guidelines for How Often to Paint Your House Exterior</h2>
<p>While the factors above play a role in determining when your house should be repainted, here are some general guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Wood siding:**Every 3 to 7 years</li>
<li>**Stucco siding:**Every 5 to 6 years</li>
<li>**Brick siding:**Every 5 to 10 years</li>
<li>**Vinyl siding:**Every 10 years</li>
<li>**Metal surfaces:**Every 5 to 7 years</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signs-its-time-to-paint-your-house-exterior">Signs Its Time to Paint Your House Exterior</h2>
<p>There are certain signs you can look for that indicate its time to repaint your homes exterior:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Faded or dull color:**If the color of your homes exterior has faded significantly, it may be time for a fresh coat of paint.</li>
<li>**Peeling, cracking, or bubbling paint:**This is a clear indication that the paint is no longer adhering properly and needs to be replaced.</li>
<li>**Visible mildew or mold:**Mildew and mold can cause significant damage to the paint and should be addressed promptly with new paint.</li>
<li>**Chalking or dust:**When the paint starts to chalk or leave a dusty residue on your fingers, its time for a new coat.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The frequency with which you should paint your house exterior depends on several factors such as climate, paint type, material, and maintenance. By taking these factors into account and following general guidelines, you can maintain your homes appearance and protect it from the elements. Regular maintenance and timely repainting will ensure that your home remains beautiful and protected for years to come.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bearded dragons are often hailed as one of the most intelligent reptiles, just behind some lizards.</p>
<p>Do bearded dragons behave like mammals? Do they respond to training? It is possible to train them?</p>
<p>This article will look at the intelligence of
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/reptile/care/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-bearded-dragons"><strong>bearded dragons</strong></a>
and answer these questions.
<strong>How smart are bearded dragons?�</strong>
<em>Bearded dragons may be less intelligent than some lizards, but these reptiles are equally smart.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>*They can learn to solve problems and are capable of imitating other bearded lizards (an intelligent skill thought to belong to mammals of higher cranial capacity). *</li>
<li>*Bearded dragons can tell if you are their owner or a person who feeds them. They will be happy or sad, depending on how they feel about you. *</li>
<li><em>They can be trained with actions (patterns and routines) like a head pat or push-ups and feeding time to reinforce desired behaviors.</em>

<h2 id="how-smart-are-bearded-dragons-research">How Smart are Bearded Dragons? Research</h2>
<p>While humans may have once been the only species capable of imitation, new research has shown that some lizards are on equal footing with us in the intelligence department.</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2014/09/970.asp">University of Lincoln, U.K research</a>aimed to provide a better understanding of the intelligence of bearded dragons - through imitation testing.
The bearded dragons were studied while in terrariums. They were offered a wire door and get to the sumptuous mealworm.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Group 1</strong>- One bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">dragon</a> was shown a video where another bearded dragon was opening the wire door from the left</li>
<li><strong>Group 2</strong>- Another bearded dragon was shown a video where another bearded dragon was opening the wire door from the right</li>
<li><strong>Group 3</strong>- Another bearded dragon was shown a video where a human being was opening the wire door</li>
<li><strong>Control group</strong>- Four bearded dragons didn&rsquo;t get any video instruction on how to open the wire door
**The results and conclusion? **</li>
<li><strong>Group 1 and Group 2</strong>(shown videos of other bearded dragons opening the wire door) acted in exactly the same way and even followed the direction used in opening the door in the video.</li>
<li><strong>Group 3</strong>- But bearded dragon showed a video of human beings opening the wire door didn&rsquo;t open the door; i.e. no imitation observed.</li>
<li>Finally, in the control group (the bearded dragons were not shown any videos) and the finding was that they did not learn door opening.
**Conclusion? **</li>
<li>Bearded dragons are clever animals and they can learn from one another especially through imitation.</li>
<li>Bearded dragons use their intellectual ability to imitate other bearded dragons better than they can mimic humans.</li>
<li>It took about three weeks for bearded dragons to understand and imitate the video instruction.

<h2 id="intelligence-signs---recognize-owners-or-feeders-feeding-time-routines">Intelligence Signs? - Recognize owners or Feeders, Feeding-time Routines</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragons are <a href="/posts/roku-smart-soundbar-review/">smart</a>; they learn and recognize their owners or people who feed them by use of sight, smell, pleasure, or anger.</p>
<p>The research showed that bearded dragons are intelligent as they can imitate other bearded dragons.</p>
<ul>
<li>But people with Bearded Dragons pets have seen other smart things they do for a long time.</li>
<li>A lot of animals kept as pets learn patterns and routines.
They are more intelligent than other reptiles like geckos, Gila monsters, or Komodo dragons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bearded dragons are highly motivated by food; they&rsquo;ll remember and adhere to feeding-time routines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the owner enters its cage, the Bearded Dragon smells his/her presence and while using its sight its able to recognize the owner/feeder  you will fill Bearded Dragon approach him/her on entering the cage.</li>
<li>It relaxes and also enjoys the pleasure of being held by the owner without resistance.
When it&rsquo;s mealtime, bearded dragons usually gravitate to the same spot as their food bowls - if you position it at a single location in their enclosure.</li>
<li>You can teach your bearded dragon to come when it hears its name, by calling them before they eat.</li>
<li>Also, the bearded dragon associates its human owner with pleasurable experiences, such as and eating.
Bearded dragon has great animal intelligence; they&rsquo;ll acknowledge waving and nodding by humans or bearded dragons because they understand that these gestures are signs of politeness, even though they don&rsquo;t have the ability to speak.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, the Bearded Dragon would not resist any presence of an intruder in its cage who is not the owner/feeder or someone or an animal who caused them a painful or bad experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, Bearded Dragon may generate anger (an aggressive posture) and begin to run away, or even attack.
Therefore, have a cover or screen on the reptile&rsquo;s enclosure, so that it can hide from any intruder who is not the owner/feeder.</li>
<li>Also, don&rsquo;t the bearded dragon be out of their cage without supervising them.

<h2 id="can-i-train-my-bearded-dragon">Can I Train My Bearded Dragon?</h2>
<p>First, dragons are not difficult to train on routine including potty training. But they won&rsquo;t perform tricks like cats or dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that your bearded dragons are much less intelligent than iguanas and tegus.
You can also train Bearded Dragon. The experiment carried out by researchers at the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom shows that a Bearded Dragon was able to be trained and learn how to open doors to access its food.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was achieved by placing Trained Breaded Dragon with untrained ones. When untrained Bearded Dragons saw trained ones open the door to access food, they were also able to open too.</p>
<p>In fact, these animals are able to imitate other reptiles (bearded dragons) and practice the learned skills - but their learning time varied.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed how bearded dragons respond to both negative &amp; positive daily experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best way to keep your bearded dragon from associating you with fear, anger, or pain is by giving it positive attention.
So, keep your beardie happy by giving him food like super worms and mealworms.</li>

<h2 id="how-to-tame-your-bearded-dragon">How to Tame your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>First, the sign of stress in most bearded dragons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hiding from other bearded dragons or you</li>
<li>Their beard turning dark-colored</li>
<li>Having an expanded or frilled beard</li>
<li>Bobbing their head
It is possible to train your Bearded Dragon so that it may conform and respond to some activities you may desire. Such activities may include:</li>
<li>Recognizing its name/sound.</li>
<li>Accessing a place to take their food.</li>
<li>Recognize their owner or people who feed them.</li>
<li>Locate a place to poop/excrete.</li>
<li>Wave to people/visitors.</li>
<li>Escape danger.
To achieve these skills in the Bearded Dragon, you must train one skill for a given period of time. It is not possible for the Bearded Dragon to master all these skills simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normally, Bearded Dragons are shy by nature. It wont be possible to train them in any of the above skills until you create a close bond between you and Bearded Dragon. To do this, you will need to carry out the following steps for your newly acquired Bearded Dragon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you bring a new Bearded Dragon in your home, allow it to have its free time without touching it. Feed it from a distance so that you dont create tension or fear. Ensure it is living in a large enclosed place.</li>
<li>Start to Hand Feed your Bearded Dragon. This will make your Bearded Dagon get free and comfortable with your touch. It will also boost its trust in you. Bearded dragons are normally harmless  they may not bite you when hand feeding.</li>
<li>Make sure you spend a lot of time in the cage where the Bearded Dragon lives. You can be there cleaning, making its sleeping place, or feeding it. This will create recognition with time.</li>
<li>Allow the Bearded Dragon to move about in an enclosed cage for some hours. This can be done effectively by setting up little food in bowls at various points to attract its movement. Keep watch from a distance to see if it has any signs of stress (showing an aggressive posture).</li>
<li>Once you realize that your Bearded Dragon is now free with you, pick it with your hand and softly rub its back softly to kill its tension or fear. Do not lift the Bearded Dragon from behind  this may make it get angered or generate fear. Never raise it up by the tail  it may startle. The tail of the Bearded Dragon does not grow back once cut. Slowly and calmly pick your Bearded Dragon from the front and support its trunk gently. In case it reacts restrictively, taps its back softly as you tend to put it on the ground.</li>
<li>Further, calm your Bearded Dragon until it&rsquo;s stress-free. This will be shown by indicators such as warm relaxations and lack of aggressiveness.
Once you are able to handle your Bearded Dragon with your hands freely without it reacting, then it will be easier for you to train it other skill as indicated above through the use of Conditioned reflex action.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Every time you handle your bearded dragon, try to get in the habit of washing your hands; you dont want to pass salmonella on to your pet.</li>
<li>Bearded dragons have an exceedingly high tolerance for pain, so never attempt to restrain them by grabbing their tail.</li>
<li>To reassure them, stroke their backs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-you-potty-train-the-bearded-dragon">Can you Potty Train the Bearded Dragon?</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragon report that they&rsquo;ve effectively potty-trained some of these pets.</p>
<p>Some bearded dragons don&rsquo;t quickly learn to use the litter. However, most will get into the habit of going in one spot on their own within a week or two.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reptiles hate the smell and sight of their poop, and thus they learn to avoid it by choosing a single pooping litterbox�spot that&rsquo;s far.</li>
<li>Also, the bearded dragons have a tendency to go out of the cage to poop.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-bearded-dragons-friendly">Are Bearded Dragons Friendly?</h2>
<p>Yes, Bearded Dragons are docile. These reptiles rarely show aggression unless you get too close to their space, at which point they may try to flee the area.</p>
<p>Bearded Dragons are a good pet because they do not bite people and they are easier to tame; they&rsquo;ll curl or turn when held as a sign of cool pleasure.</p>
<p>These reptiles will not attack your children when in their cage or when invading their hideouts.</p>
<p>Bearded Dragons do not cause any rebellion against other pets. If you have a bearded dragon, then you can also have other pets in the same cage.</p>
<p>But, when Bearded Dragon gets aggressive, it begins to Hiss, open its mouth, stare, bobbing its head, puffing the beards or generate stress marks.</p>
<p>The reaction may be caused by stress, stiff competition in the case, being scared often, shedding, hormonal imbalances, breeding season, or environmental change.</p>
<h2 id="do-bearded-dragons-show-affection">Do bearded dragons show affection?</h2>
<p>Yes! Bearded Dragons are special as compared to other reptiles in that they are eagerly waiting for their owner or the person feeding them. You will find them warming up as you approach which is a sign of affection and appreciation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Bearded Dragons Voluntarily seek to be held by their owner. You will find them preferring to feed on your hand instead of using their bowls.</p>
<p>The affection of the Bearded Dragon increases with age. You will find that it likes to always be closer to you/owner. In addition, it will even climb over you for fun. Therefore, Bearded Dragon is an incredibly affectionate reptile.</p>
<h2 id="are-bearded-dragons-nocturnal">Are Bearded Dragons Nocturnal?</h2>
<p>No! Bearded dragons are very inactive at night. Indeed, these lizards are diurnal  they are active during the day and sleep the whole night. We noted that
Leopard Geckos are<strong>crepuscular</strong>
Bearded Dragons are docile reptiles. They are active when the room temperature rises during the day to a level that can make them go hunting or move around in the cage.</p>
<p>Normally, the light will make the Bearded Dragons wake up while Darkness makes them sleep. Artificially, you can control the sleeping style of the Bearded Dragon in an enclosure/cage by switching off and on light or using a time switch.</p>
<p>However, it would be problematic to make your Bearded Dragon be active in the presence of light. They will sleep often during the day, especially after feeding.</p>
<h2 id="do-bearded-dragons-respond-to-their-names">Do Bearded Dragons Respond to Their Names?</h2>
<p>Yes! Bearded Dragons will respond to their names. However, they do not respond to those names as a human does. You must associate the given name/voice with something that will attract (at first) the Bearded Dragon such as food.</p>
<p>Any time you give the Bearded Dragon food, mention the name. With time, it will connect that voice with itself and food too.</p>
<p>It is not easy to take Bearded Dragons to respond to their names though with commitments and repetition, you will have them respond to your call even without food.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On how smart are bearded dragons; YES, they&rsquo;re smart - they&rsquo;ll imitate other Bearded Dragons and learn feeding-time routines such as name-calling.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can easily tame it for a given task through a conditioned reflex action method.</li>
<li>In case you want to feed your Bearded Dragon, you can this by calling it a given name just before giving it food. With time, Bearded Dragon will associate that sound/name with food or your presence.
We cannot say that Bearded Dragon is the most intelligent reptile we have. However, we can attest that Bearded Dragon is smart and able to learn with continuous training.</li>

Also, this technique is not highly recommendable by experts because when strong winds or storm strikes its likely that the legs of the trampoline will pull away from the cement and still cause damage.
It is advisable to use anchoring kits that are made to hold the trampoline down. These wind anchoring kits if well installed have low cases of pulling away or letting the trampoline pull off.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, Ill take you through different cardio workouts planned to assist you to lose weight, even when you have a <a href="/posts/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/">bad</a> <a href="/posts/running-with-bad-knees/">knee</a> - How to exercise with bad knees to lose weight.</p>
<p>But first, the term
<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/moving-away-from-knee-osteoarthritis">bad knees</a>
is way too broad. However, with bad knees, you should work your knees without jarring them to reduce pain and to make them stronger.</p>
<p>Appropriate workouts for your bad knees should incorporate non-plyometric exercises such as sitting back in the squat and avoiding the plyometric exercises such as jumping.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_QZ4dh51ic">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_QZ4dh51ic</a></p>
<h2 id="how-to-exercise-with-bad-knees-to-lose-weight">How to Exercise With Bad Knees to Lose Weight</h2>
<h3 id="1-walking">1. Walking</h3>
<p>Walking is awesome low-impact cardio that will reduce your knee pain. Unlike most bad pain sufferers who take up activity avoidance, you adopt different aerobic exercises such as walking. Such exercises are
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279766">recommended</a>
as they will improve your knees muscle quality and fight sarcopenia.</p>
<p>Luckily, walking and light
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/">running with the right footwear</a>
and cushioned shoes�is a non-pharmacologic therapy, and thus you wont need to take medications. Notably, walking has been wide studies and approved for the disabled and elderly population.</p>
<p>Further, taking long-term walking plans can largely improve your knee pain and body functioning and slows physical function declining, also among the disabled people.</p>
<p>According to a recent
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15696558">study</a>
, increased mobility such as walking in the aerobic treatment is significantly correlated with better ankle and knee angular velocities. Also, adhering to physical activity plans improves physical function and general mobility.</p>
<p>Walking increases your heart rate and would be appropriate during bad weather as you can do it indoors. However, avoid walking on just one place for an extended period since it can strain your knees: mix up the steps for best results.</p>
<p>While walking, make sure you keep your upper body nice and tall while your shoulders should be back and down and pull your abs towards your spine to lose the most amount of calories possible.</p>
<h3 id="2-elliptical-trainer">2. Elliptical Trainer</h3>
<p>Like walking and stationary bicycles, elliptical trainers are considered low impact exercises because they produce circular motion.</p>
<p>The elliptical trainers mimic the cross-country skiing movements, and thus youll exercise through pedal resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, increasing the pedal resistance will enable your muscles to work harder and enhancing aerobic exercise.</p>
<p>Interestingly, with the elliptical trainer  unlike the treadmill  your feet will not leave the machine pedals, and thus there is a reduced possibility of injuring the bad knees.</p>
<h3 id="3-swimming">3. Swimming</h3>
<p>Swimming with your bad knee will be effective in losing weight. Itll assist in improving your flexibility and strengthening your muscles and bones.</p>
<p>Compared to other cardio exercises, swimming will have minimal stress on the bad knees. The buoyancy force will act on your body and hence reduce the tension on the knees and your joints.</p>
<p>Further, due to the reduced pain, youll find yourself working out longer in the water compared to other cardio training.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Therefore, if you are suffering from a specific condition or injury, you should know that not all the exercises we described will appropriate. Therefore, listen to your bodys reaction and follow your doctors recommendations, if are under some for that condition.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/bed-bugs-vs-other-pests/">Bed</a> bugs are notoriously elusive pests that are most active at night when they feed on their hosts. However, they don&rsquo;t just hide at nightthey also spend a significant portion of their time hiding during the day. This can make it difficult to spot them when you&rsquo;re not experiencing an active infestation. In this article, we will guide you on how to find bed bugs during the day, including signs of infestation, tools to use, and the most common places they hide.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-bed-bugs-hide-during-the-day">Why Do Bed Bugs Hide During the Day?</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are nocturnal creatures, meaning they are most active at night when they feed on blood. During the day, they hide in cracks and crevices to avoid light and predators. They come out at night to feed, making it difficult to spot them unless you know where to look. Understanding their hiding habits is crucial for detecting them during the day.</p>
<h2 id="common-hiding-spots-for-bed-bugs">Common Hiding Spots for Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are experts at hiding in small, tight spaces during the day. They typically look for places that are close to their food source, which is often a bed or sofa. Here are some of the most common places to look for bed bugs during the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Mattresses and Bed Frames:**Check around the seams, folds, and tags of your mattress and box spring. Bed bugs often hide in these areas because they are close to their food source.</li>
<li>**Cracks and Crevices:**Inspect furniture, baseboards, and walls for cracks where bed bugs can hide.</li>
<li>**Upholstered Furniture:**Bed bugs may hide in the cushions and seams of chairs, sofas, and other upholstered furniture.</li>
<li>**Electrical Outlets:**Bed bugs can squeeze into electrical outlets and other small openings in walls.</li>
<li>**Behind Wall Hangings:**Posters, paintings, or pictures hung on walls can provide hiding spots for bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-look-for-bed-bugs-during-the-day">How to Look for Bed Bugs During the Day</h2>
<p>Finding bed bugs during the day requires a combination of tools and techniques. Follow these steps to thoroughly check for signs of infestation:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Use a Flashlight:**Since bed bugs are small and hide in dark areas, a flashlight can help illuminate hard-to-see places.</li>
<li>**Check for Bed <a href="/posts/how-much-do-bed-bug-exterminators-cost/">Bug</a> Eggs:**Bed bug eggs are small, white, and often found in clusters. Look for them in cracks, corners, and seams of furniture.</li>
<li>**Look for Shed Skins:**Bed bugs molt several times as they grow. Shed skins can be found in places where they hide.</li>
<li>**Check for Fecal Stains:**Bed bug droppings are small, dark spots that resemble pepper or ink stains. These can be found near their hiding spots.</li>
<li>**Use a Bed Bug Detection Kit:**If you are unsure or cannot find any visible signs, consider using a bed bug detection kit, which can help confirm the presence of bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signs-of-a-bed-bug-infestation">Signs of a Bed Bug Infestation</h2>
<p>In addition to finding bed bugs during the day, you should also look for other signs of infestation. Some common signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Red, Itchy Bites:**Bed bugs feed on human blood, and their bites can cause itching and irritation.</li>
<li>**Musty Odor:**Bed bugs release a distinct, musty odor when they are disturbed.</li>
<li>**Visible Bed Bugs:**While bed bugs are typically nocturnal, you may see them during the day if the infestation is severe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finding bed bugs during the day can be challenging, but with patience and the right tools, you can uncover their hiding spots. Always check common hiding areas like mattresses, cracks, and furniture, and look for signs of infestation like eggs, droppings, and bites. If you suspect an infestation, it is best to contact a professional pest control service for help with exterminating the bed bugs.</p>

; start with a vacuum for removing webs, get some sticky traps, and spider repellent on hiding places such as garages, attics, and basements.
Brown recluse is venomous and you&rsquo;ll mainly find them hiding in dark places on the yard and home.� - and they&rsquo;ll be equally challenging to control.
These brown recluses will seek shelter in hidden areas - comparable to the venomous Black Widow - and you&rsquo;ll get them in locations like North America.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders">Details: How to Get Rid of Brown Recluse Spiders</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-inspection-for-brown-recluse-spiders">Step 1: Conduct Inspection for Brown Recluse Spiders</h3>
<p>The fiddle-back spider or Brown recluse have markings but will also have many shades such as light or dark brown - you can get them in Kentucky, western Georgia, and central Texas.
These nocturnal hunters will prey on mosquitoes, and flies among other insects. But they won&rsquo;t harm humans - but act in self-defense and they&rsquo;ll use their bites.</p>
<p>You may confuse the Brown recluse with wolf spiders but these ones have eight eyes and larger in body size. The recluse has fine hairs and six eyes but smaller in size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite that bites from brown recluse are rare, they are itchy and become reddish - and may become<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spider-bites/symptoms-causes/syc-20352371">an open sore</a>taking even a weak to heal.
On the body shape, these spiders are violin shape (and dark brown) on their cephalothorax - the section where the bug&rsquo;s legs are attached.</li>
<li>The spider has a uniformly-colored abdomen and legs - it has no multiple abdomen pigments.</li>
<li>It has no spines� but some fine hairs on its legs
The bug has 6 (not eight) eyes arranged in pairs but has some small space that separates the egg pairs. But don&rsquo;t confuse these spiders with the spitting spiders in the Scytodes genus.</li>
<li>Conduct an effective inspection for the spiders - check cobwebs in clutter, in wall voids, and under insulation. Check for irregular and loose webs - destroy them.
Get some vacuum hose - this will help remove spider webs and fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-remove-propitious-favourable-conditions-for-brown-recluse">Step 2: Remove Propitious (Favourable) Conditions for Brown Recluse**</h3>
<p>**
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef631">Brown recluse naturally live</a>
in
debris, woodpiles, logs, and rocks -
outdoors spaces. They&rsquo;ll live in
indoor spaces - even in attics or
unheated basements during winters with no
water or food.
The spiders will hunt during the night for their dead or living prey.� - they may employ suspended webs around outdoor vegetation, ceilings, corners, and walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, to get rid of these Recluse Spiders, ensure to first remove the propitious (favorable) conditions in the yard or home - such acts will remove their shelter of preying areas.</li>
<li>The Brown recluse will hide in locations that are warm, dark, and dry such as in rubber tires, bedding, furniture, shoes, clothing, and boxes - including in cellars, basements, and closets.
The adaptable Brown recluse is largely active (but non-aggressive) in temperatures around 45F to 110F - they&rsquo;ll survive for about 6 months with no water or food.</li>
<li>You can repel the spiders using essential oils such as tea tree, lavender,� and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-peppermint-oil-repel-spiders/">peppermint oil</a>- spray the oils and you may also use Hedge apples to repel the spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3inspect--clean-brown-recluse-hiding-places">Step 3:<strong>Inspect &amp; Clean Brown Recluse Hiding Places�</strong></h3>
<p>Inspect your spaces and clean - using some good vacuum cleaner, and use some suitable aerosol such as Zenprox (with longer residue effect) or CB 80.
As noted earlier, Brown recluse will take refuge in warm and dark places - and hence cleaning practices that&rsquo;ll hit such places will help remove the bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, clean all the objects that could attract Brown recluse such as food sources - don&rsquo;t drop crumbs around the spaces as they&rsquo;ll attract the bugs.</li>
<li>Next, move any boards, lumber, firewood that&rsquo;ll be around your house. Cover these objects and store them away from the ground - and cut all dense vegetation near structures.
Next, cut the tall grasses and trim the bushes - remove items on the garage floor and clean that space. But remove all the clutter that could harbor any brown recluse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-setup-multiple-brown-recluse-traps">Step 4: Setup Multiple Brown-Recluse Traps</h3>
<p>Next, its trap-time - set up multiple spider traps in the house - locate the traps around the bed, water heater chamber, and under your bathroom sink.
The glue traps set up for the spider will help capture the bugs - in the apartment or house. I recommend using a Catchmaster trap - as approved by Kansas University researchers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The glue traps will help identify the type of bugs that are insider your residence or house.
The sticky traps are excellent bug or pest controller gadgets - these will kill or immobilize the spiders that are wandering in your spaces.
Most of the traps are &ldquo;passive&rdquo; and hence it won&rsquo;t require complicated setting-up or attending - just check them occasionally and dump them if they&rsquo;re full of spiders.
But, a major drawback with glue traps is that they trap or even kill both harmful and helpful insects. For example, arthropods and Centipedes may be trapped.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5dust-and-spray-the-brown-recluse">Step 5:<strong>Dust and Spray the Brown recluse</strong></h3>
<p>Dust and also spray the spiders&rsquo; hiding spaces using some
residual ins
ecticide like Onslaught and Suspend Poly Zone (perimeter sprays).</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply sprayunder furniture andinsidebaseboards - places that the brown recluse run. Theresidual insecticides likeZenprox or Suspend Poly-zone - combined withdusting and cleaning.</li>
<li>Ensure the dust or spray (for Brown recluse) gets to the places that are difficult to reach. The Talstar bifenthrin insecticide is a pyrethroid that will repel the brown recluse.
The spayed or dusted surfaces will influence how long the insecticide will remain active. For example, masonite and wooden surfaces allow the insecticide to keep its power for about 7 days.</li>
<li>However, spraying or dusting the insecticide (even with handheld dusters) on vinyl surfaces will maintain the residue active and powerful for about 60 days.
**Residual sprays: **</li>
<li>These insecticide sprays are liquid and you should use them on room perimeters, storage areas, closets edges, eaves, and exterior foundation.</li>
<li>Sprays offering a residual-killing activity that is long should be chosen. Avoid sprays made from oils and botanical extracts that have not been proven to work on the brown recluse.
<strong>Residual dust:�</strong></li>
<li>Dust (such as D-Fence Dust) created to work as residual insecticides must be applied on your crawl spaces that are inaccessible, attics, and also wall voids.</li>
<li>The insecticide dust will easily penetrate those places that won&rsquo;t be easy to hit with spider sprays - and thus give longer brown recluse control.</li>
<li>Treating the attics (area-wide) won&rsquo;t work well because you might contaminate the storage places or even drift to your house through ventilation or light-fixtures.
<strong>Aerosol or ULV sprays:�</strong></li>
<li>The aerosol or ULV (ultra-low volume) sprays that have resmethrin or pyrethrins will effectively control the brown recluse.</li>
<li>The ULV treatment will be effective for controlling spiders in the shingle roofing, attics, and under the wood. They&rsquo;ll irritate the recluse as they contact and move on surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-6-sanitationnon-chemical-treatment">Step 6: Sanitation<strong>Non-Chemical Treatment�</strong></h3>
<p>Sanitation will effectively help clear the Brown Recluse - as it&rsquo;ll remove them from different structures like homes and buildings - including various�hiding places.
I approve of the subsequent practices to get rid of the brown recluse.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut short the different tall grasses around the various structures. Check the garages and basements - improving storages - don&rsquo;t store objects on the floor.</li>
<li>Check the building foundation and cut the heavy vegetation plus remove the piles of debris, boards, stones, firewood, and lumber.
Remove the spiders with egg sacs and webs of the brown recluse - use a vacuum after spotting the spiders during the inspection step - and remove the vacuum bag.
Use caulk to seal gaps and cracks in the cables, wires, pipes, vents, surrounding eaves, and building exterior. Inspect stored items and boxes - and use some vacuum hoses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-7-usediatomaceous-earth-food-grade">Step 7:� Use�Diatomaceous Earth (Food-Grade)</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth
has proven effective and safer for controlling the brown recluse - they have an abrasive effect that&rsquo;ll break the exoskeleton of the spiders.
Sprinkle the powder onto the gaps and spaces on the bedroom closets, inner bedroom spaces, under cabinets in the kitchen, and wall cracks - but avoid damp situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove food sources loved by brown recluse including water, food, and shelter - just like with the moths,ants, flies, and roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lastly, on how to get rid of brown recluse spiders remove all the external openings and gaps.
This will block the brown recluse from getting into the house. Also, cover the gaps around the doors and windows.
Further, lessen the amount of indoor humidity as this will repel the spiders - you may use a dehumidifier - manage the humidity in the storage spaces, bathrooms, and closets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roaches are notoriously difficult to get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">rid</a> of. But don&rsquo;t let them win! In this article, I outline How to Get Rid of Cockroaches in Apartments. If roaches find shelter, food, and water in your apartment, they are staying for as long as they want to!
<strong>First, notify the property manager about any roach activity on their property so that they can take action against this pest infestation. Next up, try using some baits (roach traps), dusting with silica powder or diatomaceous earth (DE) as well as a boric acid solution for long-term control measures.�</strong>
<strong>You may also want to set some glue traps around your apartment if you&rsquo;re not too keen on using toxic chemicals. Finally, if you want to get the roaches out for good (and your landlord doesn&rsquo;t have any better ideas), hire an exterminator!�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Roach Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches-in-apartments">Details: How to Get Rid of Cockroaches in Apartments</h2>
<h3 id="1-notify-the-property-manager-or-landlord-know-your-rights">1. Notify the property manager or landlord; Know Your Rights</h3>
<p>To control them, first, notify the property manager (or the landlord).�The property manager or landlord will handle the roach infestations as outlined by their lease agreement or offer some quick tips on how to deal with these bugs themselves (for example, sealing up cracks around doors).
It&rsquo;s important to know your rights as a tenant in regards to pest control.
Some leases may require the landlord or property manager to provide roach extermination services, while others just offer some tips on how you can manage them yourself (or not!). Read your lease agreement carefully!
For example, if you pay monthly fees to cater to pest control - the property manager may owe you some roach control rounds for that month.</p>
<h3 id="2-locate-the-roach-nest-and-seal-it-off-from-human-contact">2. Locate the Roach Nest and Seal it off from human contact</h3>
<p>Find that elusive
roach nest</p>
<ul>
<li>their breeding and hiding location; and eliminate it. The inspections for these nocturnal bugs must be undertaken at night.
Try to identify if you have a high infestation in one area or if there are scattered sightings throughout your apartment; different strategies need to be used for each scenario.
An Integrated Pest Management approach would work better for a low-level infestation while complete elimination may require hiring exterminators with stronger chemicals like Cypermethrin.
Dispose of any exposed food or water sources, including anything that is spilling out of your garbage can (in particular those moist foods) - as they will also be attracting more roaches.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kXfEmupXc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kXfEmupXc</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-clean-up-the-apartment">3. Clean Up the Apartment</h3>
<p>The most important thing is getting rid of the food sources roaches are looking for in your apartment: crumbs on counters, pet food bowls, spoiled produce (especially potatoes), dirty dishes left overnight&hellip;anything that might attract roaches!
Dispose of garbage properly-use more than one bag if necessary because roach infestations usually start from trash cans outside that have been improperly disposed of away
Remove clutter and provide a clear path for these pests as they roam around seeking out food or hiding places (for example, keep dishes on top of shelves).
Make sure all surfaces are clean - including floors, walls, window sills, countertops/sinks&hellip;everything! Not only will this help with any infestations but it also
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-the-bathroom/">helps prevent ant</a>
s and other insects from coming inside.
Roach droppings can carry diseases like E-coli so be careful not to stir up dust bunnies while cleaning too close to where people eat when mopping up spills.
Clean up behind the cabinets, dishwasher, fridge - these would make great hiding places for cockroaches.
Keep your counters and sinks clean - this also helps prevent ants from making their way inside.
Don&rsquo;t leave dishes in the sink to collect dust or harbor bacteria, rinse them off as soon as possible after each use.
Clear away clutter (think pantry shelves) that could be hiding cockroaches or other pests like spiders! Cockroaches are opportunistic so they will take any opportunity to come inside if there are food sources available for them.</p>
<h3 id="4-seal-all-holes-and-cracks-in-plumbing-windows-and-doors">4. Seal all Holes and Cracks in Plumbing, Windows, and doors</h3>
<p>Roaches can get into small spaces, so sealing up as many of these areas as possible will help. You should also look for other potential openings or cracks in your home&rsquo;s foundation.
Covering any gaps with steel wool is a good temporary solution to keep them out while you seal the area permanently.
Use a caulk gun to fill cracks and holes where cockroaches could enter. Make sure you are sealing all sources of entry, including plumbing or electrical outlets - roaches will make their way inside if they smell food!
Inspect your home for any drafts that might be coming from the window sealings or door frames. Tighten up these areas using weather strips, caulking, or foam insulation to keep the roaches insects out.
Look around windows as well for signs of insect pests such as small piles of sawdust near them which may indicate an ant infestation right outside the wall in between things like wood siding and brick homes.
Seal openings in the plumbing system (particularly under the sink) - as the roaches will be attracted by water and food droppings.</p>
<h3 id="5-use-baits-sprays-and-treatments">5. Use baits, sprays, and treatments</h3>
<p>Consider a pre-emptive bait that will create an environment lethal for roaches - one well-known in particular is Combat Roach Killing Bait Gel which can be purchased at most hardware stores.
The process usually starts by placing bait stations such as apple cider vinegar &amp; soap in areas that roaches frequent (though these can also attract other pests like ants).
In a few days, they will come back with either poison bait or glue traps for capturing them alive so they may not pose any future problems if released into the wild. This is important because some poisons used in extermination could lead to secondary poisoning among pets who eat poisoned bugs.
Keep it out of reach of children as, if handled improperly, this could lead to poisoning or even death!
Sprays and other treatments will also work to kill roaches but are not always as effective. Some effective roach sprays include the Bengal Gold and the Ortho Home defense.
The insecticide sprays mainly contain Permethrin�or pyrethroids (comparable to botanical�insecticides�- pyrethrins). Sprays will also kill other insects, so be careful with where you are spraying.</p>
<h3 id="6-sprinkle-diatomaceous-earth">6. Sprinkle Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Some people have noticed success by using
Diatomaceous Earth (food grade)
sprinkled around their house but this treatment can take months for visible results. This should also only be used when pets are excluded from the spaces.
Diatomaceous earth�powder will create that abrasive effect which will break the roaches&rsquo; exoskeleton and exoskeleton.
Sprinkle the DE in areas where roaches are present, including all cracks and crevices around cabinets, behind refrigerators (baseboards if possible), along walls underneath appliances, especially under sinks.
Consider pouring it into any holes or gaps found on your countertops so that they can not crawl back out again. You should also sprinkle some inside of drawers for those places hidden from sight.</p>
<h3 id="7-cockroach-traps---boric-acid-or-dish-soap">7. Cockroach Traps - Boric acid or Dish soap</h3>
<p>For an extra effect set a trap with either boric acid or dish soap mixed with apple cider vinegar as bait by placing them at strategic points like corners and near drains.&quot;
You can make the DIY roach killer - from boric acid ( Cup)�&amp; peanut butter ( Cup).
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">Boric acid powder</a>
, if ingested, will exterminate the roaches while the peanut butter acts as an attractant.</p>
<h3 id="8-roach-treat-the-perimeter-walls-and-environment">8. Roach Treat the Perimeter Walls and Environment</h3>
<p>If you have already been successful with getting rid of them from inside the house but are still seeing signs outside (like small piles of sawdust), then you may need to take care of some around the perimeter.
This might involve using insecticides like cypermethrin on trees or shrubbery near. You may apply some insecticide dust on the exterior walls, inside the wall void, electrical outlets, and the light switch plates.</p>
<h3 id="9-hire-a-roach-exterminator">9. Hire A Roach Exterminator</h3>
<p>If you have tried everything else and are still seeing signs of cockroaches, it might be time to hire an exterminator that uses bait stations and commercial grade insecticides with pyrethrins or cypermethrin like Tempo Ultra Max Insecticide Spray Concentrate.
The pest control company will inspect your home for any areas where there is activity -including inside walls- before beginning treatment in those locations.
They typically spray along baseboards, cracks in corners (especially near doors), door jams, window frames.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on how to get rid of cockroaches in apartments - If you are a tenant in an apartment, be sure to notify the property manager immediately when roaches are spotted.
Use baits like boric acid or traps including apple cider vinegar mixed with soap and placed near drains. Also, conduct a thorough cleaning of the apartment.
Consider using diatomaceous earth as dusting under your appliances and along walls for more protection against them. Finally, if all won&rsquo;t work, hire that roach exterminator.</p>

<p>they are
really teeny tiny mosquitoes.
They can
fly through the screens if you have a

screened-in windows.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best No-See-Ums Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-no-see-ums">How to Get Rid of No-See-Ums</h2>
<p>The biting and blood-sucking no see ums bugs are quite dangerous.
You might mistake them for wasps, bees, gnats, or mosquitoes - their features and effects will match those of the biting Midges or No See Ums.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-identify-noseeums">Step 1: Identify Noseeums</h3>
<p>The bugs are very small and you&rsquo;ll find them around the yard, lawn, or your garden. It&rsquo;s critical to correctly identify the noseeums.
This is to ensure that you&rsquo;re truly dealing with or controlling noseeums and not just mosquitoes. This will affect the bug-control technique you&rsquo;ll employ.
<strong>1. Standing water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The No See Ums will be around some standing water as they require it for procreation.
Thus, check if your property or home has standing water that hasn&rsquo;t been drained for long. This can play host or homage to the no see ums.
Further, the bugs love eating nectar - which&rsquo;s largely available in lawns and gardens.
<strong>2. Have saw-like�mouthparts</strong></li>
<li>The mouthparts of no see ums are saw-like since they&rsquo;re created for sucking blood.
Therefore, the bugs will bite humans and pets frequently (painful bites) particularly in the yard or outdoor spaces.
<strong>3. They carry diseases</strong></li>
<li>The No See Ums do carry diseases including Leishmania and Carrions Diseases (Bartonella bacilliformis).
The bites for the bugs around the tropical regions may lead to chronic illnesses like phlebotomus and may equally transmit worms like the Filarial worms.
The noseeums will equally make humans sick (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-no-see-ums-live-in-my-hair/">maybe hiding in your hair</a>
) besides leaving marks that are itchy and painful. Thus, homeowners consider it urgent to control the bugs.
<strong>4. They have winged hairs</strong></li>
<li>The bugs also have varied color patterns and winged hairs. It has segmented antennae (15) that it uses to suck blood from wild animals, pets, and humans.
The tiny bugs measure about 1/8-inch or under and are grey-colored.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-noseeums-inspection">Step 2: Noseeums Inspection</h3>
<p>Inspecting for noseeums will help you in the bug control phase. This phase helps identify the places ( &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;) where the bugs will get attracted to, congregate and breed.
<strong>1. Hotspots to inspect�</strong>
So, if you&rsquo;re wondering about the hotspots to check the noseeums. I noted above that they&rsquo;ll mainly hide around standing water just like with mosquitoes.
So, inspect those swampy and muddy areas - there are the
places they&rsquo;ll lay eggs - also check on moist soil, streams, and lakes.</p>
<p>The bugs will largely attack humans in the outdoor spaces and thus you should start the inspection there. Check for all standing water around the home.</p>
<p>I would check the pets&rsquo; water bowls, uncovered (and undrained) garbage cans, puddles, tree stumps, rain barrels, potted plants, ornamental fountains, rain gutters, and birdbaths.</p>
<p>Indoors, I would inspect the utility rooms, bathrooms, and kitchens as these are also areas that the no see um will hide ready to bite - if there is standing water or leaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vMkQfEVCsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vMkQfEVCsU</a>
<strong>2. Cues to Check for</strong>
But what cues will you be looking for as you inspect for no see um? We&rsquo;ve noted that you&rsquo;re largely checking for standing water.</p>
<p>But since the no see um will be tiny to see clearly, you&rsquo;ll require to check on the hotspots for signs of their breeding or hiding. Also, is there wet mulch, yard debris, or moist soil?</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve identified the breeding area of the no see ums, you&rsquo;ll thus easily apply the bug treatment you&rsquo;ve selected to exterminate them.
<strong>3. No See Um Treatment�</strong>
No wits time for treating the no see ums after you&rsquo;ve identified their activity.</p>
<p>But before going deeper into the bug treatment, carefully read and adhere to the product label instructions such as putting on the PPEs advised.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-no-see-ums-control">Step-by-Step: No See Ums Control</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-removing-standing-water">Step 1: Removing Standing Water</h3>
<p>First, before you apply that no see um treatment, you&rsquo;ll require to remove the bug&rsquo;s breeding grounds.
So, remove the moisture grounds (and water) including the standing water in and around the house or property.
First, drain the yard, unclog the rain gutters, empty the foundations, and turn over the buckets to remove the standing water.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-use-igrs-treatment">Step 2: Use IGRs Treatment</h3>
<p>Nest, you&rsquo;ll need to undertake outdoor no see um treatment using products like Tekko Pro or Reclaim IT IGR.</p>
<p>These insecticides will exterminate or repel a variety of pests including these no see um in the outdoor spaces like the patio, garden, or yard.</p>
<p>For example, the Tekko Pro IGR will exterminate different no see um stages (undeveloped stages) including eggs and larvae that could be lurking in the property.</p>
<p>Mix Tekko Pro and Reclaim IT IGR (1 fl. oz. + 1 ounce respectively); then spray on the outdoor spaces using that pump sprayer on an area of about 1,500 square feet.</p>
<p>Begin spraying on the front and yard including on the ornamentals, groundcover, flower beds, and mulch beds. This must be more on areas with standing water and moist soil.</p>
<p>For safety, avoid letting pets and humans going onto the places treated for no see um until it&rsquo;s fully dry. Next, you&rsquo;ll require to spray around the property perimeter.</p>
<p>Further, spray around windows, outdoor lighting fixtures, tree trunks, garages, foundations, and siding to control the Midges using the Tekko Pro &amp; Reclaim IT.</p>
<p>Further., reapply the no see um treatment within 1-2 weeks to reduce the bug population. But you may require a fogging or misting machine for serious infestations or commercial spaces.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-treat-indoors-usingpyrid-aerosol">Step 3: Treat Indoors Using<strong>Pyrid Aerosol</strong></h3>
<p>To remove no see um in the indoor spaces or also the house, you&rsquo;ll like to use the Pyrid Aerosol. But vinegar plus dish soap can also help in exterminating the bugs.</p>
<p>Pyrid aerosol is excellent for indoor no see um treatment as it&rsquo;s a good space and contact spray that&rsquo;ll easily and fast knock down the bugs. The aerosol will remove or repel the bugs from the pets and humans around your house.</p>
<p>However, ensure to remove all the food objects like pots, bowls, and glasses. Also, ensure to close doors, windows, and your air conditioner.�The Pyrid Aerosol should be applied over 1,050 cubic ft for 1-3 seconds.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t let humans or pets get into the sprayed spaces for 15 minutes - and also undertake proper ventilation before allowing living beings into the spaces. Also, wipe those countertops and the eating surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-no-see-um-prevention">Step 4: No See Um Prevention</h3>
<p>Some of the no see um prevention steps include:
<strong>a.</strong>
Spray Pivot 10 IGR and Reclaim IT prior to the start of the no see um season - especially the time when these bugs are most active in the region. Also, re-apply the insecticides within 1-2 weeks if this is required for an area with massive no see um infestation.
<strong>b.</strong>
Put on long clothing while working, playing, or relaxing in the outdoor spaces to reduces the chances of no see um bites and related infections. I would recommend getting long stockings, long-sleeved shirts and also long pants.
<strong>c.</strong>
Fix all the faulty plumbing and leaky faucets to reduce the habitats or hiding spots for the no see um bugs. Also, install some screens on the doors and windows.
<strong>d.</strong>
Repair, fix, or reduce any moisture areas in and around the house. Further, check that the rain gutters operate effectively, and remove any buckets that may hold storm or rainwater.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The last step on how to get rid of no-see-ums is undertaking appropriate prevention steps.</p>
<p>This can be undertaken without conducting massive changes to the yard or garden environment.</p>

<h2 id="best-palmetto-bug-killers">Best Palmetto Bug Killers</h2>
<p>If you want to get rid of palmetto bugs without further ado, make use of these effective bug killers to quickly eliminate the creepy crawlies in your house.</p>
<h3 id="1-boric-acid-killer">1. Boric Acid Killer</h3>
<p>Using boric acid is one of the most effective techniques to kill palmetto bugs. Its a natural mineral thats able to kill the palmetto bugs. The acid disrupts the digestive system and nervous system of the bugs causing death. The downside is that you wont see its effect right away. Patiently wait for a few days to notice the bugs disappear over time.</p>
<h3 id="2-non-toxic-roach-traps">2. Non-Toxic Roach Traps</h3>
<p>Using roach traps is a maintenance-free method to get rid of palmetto bugs. These are quite different from the conventional roach traps. These traps employ non-toxic ingredients to bait the roaches towards the sticky glue surface. These traps should be placed strategically in the kitchen, cupboards and garage.</p>
<h2 id="getting-rid-of-the-palmetto-bugs">Getting Rid of the Palmetto Bugs</h2>
<p>We know youre disgusted by them and dont want to go anywhere near them. Learn ways by which you can free your house of the palmetto bugs before you start seeing them everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="1-roach-glue-traps">1. Roach Glue Traps</h3>
<p>Get hold of sufficient amount of roach glue traps and set it in multiple positions all over the house. Its better and safer if you use non-toxic roach traps, especially if youve got toddlers or pets at home.</p>
<p>Some areas where you must place these traps are the kitchen, cupboards, wardrobes, bathroom, basement and garage. The higher the number of traps, the more effective they will turn out to be.</p>
<h3 id="2-homemade-boric-acid-roach-baits">2. Homemade Boric Acid Roach Baits</h3>
<p>This is definitely the most efficient and cost effective way to deal with palmetto bugs. Although you wont see on the spot results through this method, but we assure you that the palmetto bugs stand no chance against it once theyve consumed it or are exposed to the mineral.</p>
<p>There are two ways through which boric acid works on the palmetto bugs. One of it is through its consumption. In case the palmetto bug digests the boric acid, it would result in the disintegration of its digestive system. Over time, it can lead to even more disruption inside the nervous system of the bug.</p>
<p>The other way is through the abrasive property of the mineral. The boric acid creates an itchy sensation on the exoskeleton of the palmetto bug and it gradually dries out. As the bug is unable to maintain the internal fluid balance, it doesnt last for a long time.</p>
<p>Cover your hands with a pair of gloves and mix different ingredients to make bait for the palmetto bug. Use the boric acid and mix it with a small quantity of flour, sugar and Crisco. The mixture would end up with a sticky dough-like texture. Leave the mixture alongside familiar insect-entry points.</p>
<p>Although boric acid is a naturally occurring mineral, keep in mind that it has a mild level of toxicity. So in case youve got pets or little kids, its best to avoid this method, as accidental ingestion could be dangerous for their safety. There are other safer alternatives available that you can opt for in that case.</p>
<p>Related:
Do Cockroaches Eat Bed Bugs?</p>
<h3 id="3-food-grade-diatomaceous-earth">3. Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>This is also an organically occurring white powder and is used to achieve the same result to boric acid. Similar to boric acid, it also comes with a naturally-abrasive property.</p>
<p>Diatomaceous earth has a painful effect on the bugs that come into contact with it. Its sharp microscopic edges feel like stepping on shards of broken glass for them.</p>
<p>Take hold of a sack of food-grade diatomaceous earth and cover the areas where you think palmetto bugs are likely to pass from with sufficient amounts.</p>
<p>Ensure that you dont accidentally get pool-grade powder instead, as its extremely poisonous. Food-grade diatomaceous earth is fairly safer, unless you somehow breathe in large quantities of powder.</p>
<h3 id="4-sealing-cracks-and-gaps">4. Sealing Cracks and Gaps</h3>
<p>Gaps, holes and cracks along the house walls provide an easy entrance point for these insects. Simply seal these entry points and youd notice the number of palmetto bugs decreasing overtime.</p>
<p>Although they are reasonably bigger in size, theyre still somehow able to slip though the little cracks and gaps, and sneak into your house.</p>
<p>Carry out a detailed inspection of your entire house. Check if all the openings are blocked with materials such as caulk. These bugs can even make way in your house via the electrical outlets.</p>
<h3 id="5-a-pet-cat">5. A Pet Cat</h3>
<p>As surprising as it may sound, a pet cat can be a lot of help against the palmetto bugs. So in case you were planning to bring a pet cat home, heres one more reason why you should.</p>
<p>If youve got friends who have cats at home, youd notice that youve never seen palmetto bugs roaming around their houses. Thats because cats do a killer job to get rid of them. Cats not only play with them, but also at times eat them.</p>
<p>We know it sounds disgusting as you can imagine those bugs crawling in unhygienic places. So you should train your cat to only catch the palmetto bugs and not consume them.</p>

<p>Warm and humid environments are an ideal hideout for the palmetto bugs. This is why youd notice that the number of palmetto bugs inside your house start to increase when the weather outside becomes cool and dry.</p>
<p>Create an environment inside your house that isnt preferred by them. You can make use of a dehumidifier as itll help to dry out the inside air.</p>
<p>Inspect your house and look for potential water leakages coming from the broken pipes, broken faucets and roofs. Anything that might cause some areas of the house to become wet; even blocked drains, should be fixed on an immediate basis.</p>
<h3 id="2-leftover-food-wastage">2. Leftover Food Wastage</h3>
<p>Make sure that all the food scraps in the kitchen is discarded in an enclosed trash bin. Always use airtight sealed containers to store food that isnt placed in the refrigerator, making sure that the palmetto bugs are unable to reach the food. You dont want them feeding on your food and surely wouldnt enjoy the sight of them as toppings on your food.</p>

<em>Consider changing the current storage method as well and avoid re-stocking your pantry immediately upon cleaning as this may lead to the moth&rsquo;s re-occurrence. Importantly, take thorough measures in your house to prevent future re-infestation.�To gain in-depth insight, let us get into the discussion.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-pantry-moths">How to Get Rid of Pantry Moths</h2>
<h3 id="1-removeclear-everything-from-pantry">1. Remove/Clear everything from Pantry</h3>
<p>Remove and clear all dry food on the shelves or pantry. Whether contaminated or not, you need to clear your pantry sufficiently and inspect the presence of pantry moths.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful to check the larvae too  this can be done using a hand lens or convex lens.</li>
<li>Consider removing crockeries, open cans, and closed items as well before actual cleaning is undertaken. The idea of items removal encompasses opening up space for direct observation of moths and their life cycle.
Further, this approach scares moths from their hideouts, thus making it easier to capture and fumigate them to death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-wipe-pantry-with-a-mixture-of-warm-water-vinegar-and-peppermint-oil">2. Wipe pantry with a Mixture of Warm water, Vinegar, and Peppermint oil</h3>
<p>The mixture of vinegar, water, and
peppermint oil repels moths
away and prevents future infestation.
Further vinegar inhibits moths eggs hatching into larvae, while the solvent disinfects the surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Soak a piece of cloth into a mixture of vinegar, warm water, and peppermint oil. Wipe your pantry gently. Wash your shelves using the solution and clean storage containers in this solvent as well before rinsing them in hot water.
Leave the cleaned surface to dry to touch before restocking your pantry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-remove-and-clean-all-shelf-liners">3. Remove and Clean all Shelf liners</h3>
<p>Carefully, remove all shelf liners. Clean the liners with soap and hot water - to remove and kill moths eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can opt to vacuum underneath liners or dust appropriately.
For old shelf liners, its advisable to remove and replace them with new ones. In case you arent willing to remove your shelf liners, you can opt to wipe the surface with moist clothe soaked in a disinfectant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-dispose-of-non-airtight-storage-cans">4. Dispose of non-airtight Storage Cans</h3>
<p>Loose or non-tight storage containers should be disposed of accordingly - the gap left offers a pathway for pantry moth to access stored dry food.</p>
<ul>
<li>More so, internal threading and folds that come with loose storage cans provide a breeding ground for pantry moths - their eggs hatch and mature without disturbance in such areas.
Those storage containers that have pronounced gaps and holes should be disposed of first as you fix containers with tiny gaps (use seal) instead of disposing of them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-thoroughly-dry-pantry-plus-washed-storage-containers">5. Thoroughly Dry Pantry plus Washed Storage Containers</h3>
<p>Upon cleaning, your pantry should be dried perfectly - this act reduces the chances of re-infestation or further contamination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pantry Moth&rsquo;s eggs may cling on the surface upon cleaning thus hatching later and resulting in a new colony in the process.</li>
<li>Moreover, washed storage containers/plastic bags should be dried in sun or wiped sufficiently with a dry piece of cloth.
Moisture traces will not only attract pantry moths back but also initiate mold formation, which leads to food contamination.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-vacuum-pantry-area-thoroughly---wipe-with-vinegar-and-water">6. Vacuum Pantry Area Thoroughly - wipe with vinegar and water</h3>
<p>By
vacuuming your pantry
, you will not only eliminate adult moths, but youll also get rid of their eggs and larvae. Further, the vacuum cleaner also clears cocoons effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the vacuum cleaner to a power source and turn it on. Gently, vacuum pantry surface, cupboard, shelves, pinholes, cracks, joints, corners, and storage container.</li>
<li>Empty the waste and inspect the presence of pantry moths  this enables you to make the decision whether to discard stored dry food.
Avoid using the very powerful vacuum cleaner as it may destroy the storage containers or your pantry. Upon vacuuming, wipe the shelves and pantry using a piece of cloth soaked in a mixture of water and vinegar.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-change-the-current-storage-method">7. Change the Current Storage Method</h3>
<p>Perhaps your current storage method isn&rsquo;t secure enough and thus ends up allowing pantry moths infestation - alternative methods such as the use of new plastic bags and tightly sealed tins would shield dry food sufficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, you can opt to store nuts and dried grains in a refrigerator/freezer entirely rather than in a cupboard or pantry.</li>
<li>Food items such as groceries should be kept far away from the pantry - they are a key attractant to fruit flies and other insects as well.
Adversely, food bought from the market should be stored separately and monitored for a week to ensure that no traces of moths are present.
Storing dry food together with a tray of eggs is an amazing preventive method since eggs smell repel Pantry moths from the vicinity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-scrub-pantry-thoroughly-with-soap-and-hot-water">8. Scrub Pantry Thoroughly with Soap and Hot water</h3>
<p>Dip a sponge or a piece of cloth in hot water and apply soap. Scrub doors, floor, wall, and liners of your pantry gentry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that door hinges are thoroughly cleaned - try to clean every possible area where moths, larvae, and eggs may be found.</li>
<li>Hot water kills moth&rsquo;s eggsplus its larvae instantly upon contact. Adult moths are scared away from their hideouts by hot water.
NB: Be careful when handling hot water lest you burn yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-wash-storage-jars-or-containers-in-the-pantry-with-soapy-and-hot-water">9. Wash Storage Jars or Containers in the Pantry with soapy and Hot water</h3>
<p>If your store dries food in plastic containers or jars; then, you need to clean them thoroughly in soapy warm water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often, these storage containers may have come into contact with pantry moths. Chances of pantry moths laying eggs in storage containers are high - therefore, you need to presoak all storage items before actual cleaning is undertaken.
Then, scrub the jars/containers with soap and hot water and rinse with clean water before leaving them to dry to touch.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-avoid-re-stocking-your-pantry-immediately---wait">10. Avoid Re-stocking your Pantry Immediately - wait</h3>
<p>By not restocking your pantry immediately after cleaning, you will prevent cases of pantry moths re-infestation. Often, pantry moths eggs may remain in the storage containers, especially if thorough cleaning was not undertaken.</p>
<ul>
<li>If keen measures are not put into place, these eggs hatch and infest the entire storage containers.</li>
<li>By delaying restocking, you will be taking cautious attention towards diagnosing possible occurrences of pantry moths into your storage containers/jars.
Also, larvae may be left in the containers upon which they mature and become adults if not removed before restocking.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-get-rid-of-infested-or-contaminated-food-substances">11. Get Rid of Infested or Contaminated food Substances</h3>
<p>Any contaminated or moth-infested food should be discarded or thrown away. The food may include either recently opened dry food or moth-infested dry food. Its difficult to observe moths eggs with naked eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you need to get rid of the entire container as soon as you notice a single moth.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can opt to store the infested food in a freezer for 7 days.
Then, sieve the dry food before cooking  low temperature inactivates
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live/">the live moths</a>
and kills their egg/larvae. For easier identification, you will notice tiny holes on the packaging container/sack that you never saw previously.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-signs-of-pantry-moths-infestation-in-your-place">What are Signs of Pantry Moths Infestation in Your Place?</h2>
<p>Pantry moths may not be identified easily, especially if the infestation is big enough to form a swam. Therefore, it&rsquo;s always advisable to be keen in looking for other possible signs that are highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-presence-of-adult-moths-or-larvae">1. Presence of adult moths or larvae</h3>
<p>Search for larvae or adult pantry moths in your cupboard or pantry. To do this, you will need to look for gray-colored insects with either white or red strips/patches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly, adult pantry moth measures approximately 1/2 an inch long. Pantry moth larvae (which is about 1.25cm long) appear like a worm with 5 pairs of legs.</li>
<li>You will easily spot adult pantry month flying in your pantry at night often than in day time.
During the inspection, check dry food such as rice, grains, cereals, and even flour - turn the grains thoroughly since some of these pantry moths hide deep inside.</li>

<h3 id="2-presence-of-holes-in-dry-food-packaging">2. Presence of Holes in Dry food packaging</h3>
<p>While undertaking your routine inspection in your pantry, the presence of small holes on packaging bags/containers for dry food is a clear indicator of pantry moths infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though other insects such as termites may pierce and make holes on packaging containers, chances are low that they reached your pantry.</li>
<li>Observing two or three holes is too much to let go of before opening the entire containers to inspect if there is any sign of pantry moth contamination. Also, inspect plastic wrapping and boxes as well.
When purchasing sealed dry food, check if there are tiny holes on the surface - such food may be contaminated with pantry moths right from the source.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-visible-cocoon-webbing">3. Visible Cocoon webbing</h3>
<p>By observation, check the presence of cocoon webbing in your pantry or storage containers. For boxes and cupboards, take a keen look at corners and edges.</p>
<ul>
<li>The stringy and clumpy network is left by pantry moths as they crawl along. These insects also build cocoons in which they lay hundreds of eggs.
If you are keen, you will observe webbed cocoons beneath shelves, or at the folds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-brings-pantry-moths-in-your-house">What Brings Pantry Moths In Your House?</h2>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raccoons are clever, resourceful animals that can be a real nuisance when they invade your home or property. Known for their masked appearance and dexterous hands, raccoons often find ways to enter attics, basements, garages, and even inside walls, leading to damage and health concerns.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with a raccoon infestation, this guide will provide you with effective strategies to safely and humanely remove these pesky animals.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-raccoons-invade-homes">Why Do Raccoons Invade Homes?</h2>
<p>Raccoons are opportunistic feeders and are attracted to areas where food, water, and shelter are readily available. Urban and suburban areas provide them with plenty of opportunities to scavenge, especially when garbage cans, pet food, or compost bins are easily accessible. Raccoons are also known to seek refuge in attics or chimneys, as these spaces provide them with a warm, secure environment for nesting, especially in the colder months.</p>
<p>Common signs of a raccoon problem include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noises in the attic or walls, especially at night when raccoons are most active</li>
<li>Droppings or urine stains around entry points</li>
<li>Damaged or torn vents, shingles, or roofs from attempts to enter your home</li>
<li>Tracks or footprints around your property, especially near trash bins or entry points</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-by-step-guide-to-get-rid-of-raccoons">Step-by-Step Guide to Get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">Rid</a> of Raccoons</h2>
<h3 id="1-identify-the-problem">1. Identify the Problem</h3>
<p>The first step in addressing a <a href="/posts/how-to-repel-raccoons/">raccoon</a> infestation is identifying where they are entering your home. Look for gaps around windows, doors, chimneys, vents, or the roof. Raccoons are known to squeeze through very small spaces, so you may need to inspect these areas thoroughly.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve located the entry points, it&rsquo;s important to check if there are any raccoon nests or young inside. If there are babies, its best to wait until they are old enough to leave before closing the entry points. Raccoons are protective of their young, and removing babies prematurely can lead to dangerous situations.</p>
<h3 id="2-seal-entry-points">2. Seal Entry Points</h3>
<p>After identifying the entry points, the next step is to seal them securely. This will prevent further access to your home. Use sturdy materials like steel mesh, hardware cloth, or metal flashing to cover gaps or holes. Avoid using materials like wood or plastic, as raccoons can easily tear through them.</p>
<p>Be sure to check around your roofline, vents, and chimneys, as raccoons often make their way into these spaces. Also, check if there are trees near the house that raccoons can climb to gain access to upper levels.</p>
<h3 id="3-set-traps">3. Set Traps</h3>
<p>Live traps are one of the most humane ways to remove raccoons from your property. Set up the traps near the entry points or where you&rsquo;ve seen signs of raccoons. Bait the trap with food like cat food, marshmallows, or canned tuna, which raccoons find irresistible.</p>
<p>Check the traps regularly to ensure that any captured animals are not left in them for too long. Once a raccoon is trapped, contact a wildlife control expert or local animal services for advice on how to handle the animal. In many areas, it is illegal to relocate raccoons, as they are considered a nuisance species and may carry diseases.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-repellents">4. Use Repellents</h3>
<p>While repellents can be effective as a deterrent, they should be used in combination with other methods. There are several types of raccoon repellents available:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Chemical repellents:**These are often made from natural ingredients like predator urine or capsaicin (the compound that makes peppers hot), which raccoons find unpleasant.</li>
<li>**Ultrasonic devices:**These emit high-pitched sounds that are irritating to raccoons but are inaudible to humans.</li>
<li>**Homemade repellents:**A mixture of ammonia, vinegar, or garlic can be sprayed around areas where raccoons have been active to repel them.
While repellents can provide temporary relief, they are not a long-term solution and should be used alongside other control methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-remove-attractants">5. Remove Attractants</h3>
<p>Raccoons are primarily attracted to food sources, so its crucial to eliminate any potential attractants around your property. Secure trash cans by using raccoon-proof lids, and never leave pet food outside overnight. If you have fruit trees, pick any fallen fruit promptly.</p>
<p>If you have a compost bin, make sure its properly covered to prevent raccoons from digging through it. Additionally, keep bird feeders out of reach of raccoons, as they will take advantage of the seeds.</p>
<h3 id="6-clean-up-droppings-and-nesting-areas">6. Clean Up Droppings and Nesting Areas</h3>
<p>If raccoons have been living in your attic or basement, they may have left behind droppings, urine, and nesting materials. It&rsquo;s important to clean these areas thoroughly to prevent the spread of disease and to discourage future visits.</p>
<p>Wear gloves, a mask, and protective clothing when handling any raccoon waste, as it can carry diseases like leptospirosis, rabies, and parasites such as roundworms. Disinfect the affected areas with a solution of bleach and water to kill any harmful pathogens.</p>
<h3 id="7-consider-professional-help">7. Consider Professional Help</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unable to get rid of the raccoons on your own or if the infestation is severe, it may be time to call in a professional wildlife control service. These experts have the knowledge, experience, and tools necessary to deal with raccoon problems safely and effectively.</p>
<p>A wildlife control professional can assess the situation, identify all entry points, and implement a comprehensive removal plan that includes trapping, exclusion, and deterrents.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-future-raccoon-infestations">Preventing Future Raccoon Infestations</h2>
<p>Once youve successfully removed raccoons from your property, its important to take steps to prevent future infestations. Here are some preventative measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly inspect your home for new entry points and seal any gaps or holes.</li>
<li>Trim tree branches that overhang your roof to prevent raccoons from climbing onto your house.</li>
<li>Maintain your yard and remove debris where raccoons might find shelter.</li>
<li>Store food securely and dispose of garbage promptly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dealing with a raccoon infestation can be challenging, but with the right approach, its possible to safely and effectively remove these animals from your home. By identifying the source of the problem, sealing entry points, and using traps and repellents, you can keep raccoons out of your home. Remember to always consider humane methods, and dont hesitate to reach out to professionals if the situation becomes overwhelming.</p>

<h2 id="5-ways-to-deal-with-roof-rats">5 Ways to Deal with Roof Rats</h2>
<p>Once you are sure that roof rats have inhabited your attic, we suggest that you take action to get rid of roof rats in the attic! The following are some of the most effective ways of dealing with the issue.</p>
<h3 id="1-clean-up">**1. **<strong>Clean Up</strong></h3>

This will leave little room for roof rats to move around and they will eventually be restricted to one area. As you clean, use disinfectants to ensure a healthy environment for your family.</p>
<h3 id="2-baiting--trapping-">**2. ****Baiting &amp; Trapping **</h3>
<p>This is the most traditional way of getting rid of roof rats in the attic because the right kind of baits can easily lure the rats into a trap. Unlike other rats, roof rats are attracted to bait such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cried fruits and nuts</li>
<li>Berries and peanut butter</li>
<li>Insects and snail shells</li>
<li>Dental floss or other nesting material
You may also use chemically treated poisonous baits that kill the roof rats and you can get rid of them permanently.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use bait to lure a rat, make sure to place it along with a trap in an area with rat activity because roof rats can detect any unusual placement of food and stay away from the bait. Dont forget to check on the traps so that you can timely dispose of any dead rats.</p>

roof rats in your attic. Based on the kind of trap you opt for, the rat can be caught without even being harmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more common traps are:</p>
<h4 id="--snap-traps">*- *<em>Snap Traps</em></h4>
<p>These conventional traps have a metal bar that snaps down when it catches a rat. They are extremely effective in getting rid of roof rats in the attic, but it is difficult to set them up and each trap only tends to kill one.</p>

<h3 id="4-block-the-entry-points">4. Block the Entry Points</h3>
<p>While you make efforts to get rid of roof rats in the attic, dont forget to block all the entry passages to discourage the roof rats from entering the attic.</p>
<p>This will not only help you catch the ones inside the attic but also prevent other rats from entering. You may block the passages by spraying or keeping repellant agents near the entry points or covering holes with material that cant be chewed such as steel wool.� Some of the more likely entry passages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaps in shingles</li>
<li>Vent covers that are damaged</li>
<li>Cracks</li>
<li>Holes in the walls or ceilings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-use-natural-predators">5. Use Natural Predators</h3>
<p>Another way to get rid of roof rats in the attic is to smartly utilize employ natural predators of roof rats such as cats, dogs, and even snakes.</p>
<p>Cats are usually the best option due to their agility and flexibility that enables them to reach out to places like the attic, where other predators cant reach easily.</p>
<p>But know that this may not be the best way to get rid of roof rats in the attic because some predators may ignore the roof rats and may even end up sharing food with them.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts!</h2>
<p>If there is a huge population of roof rats in your attic, you should consult a professional pest control company to help you out.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders will have many benefits, as a homeowner, in your garden including preying on other dangerous insects. But why are spiders among the most loathed pests in the world?
Some spiders can be dangerous, a nuisance, and outright freaky especially black widows and the brown recluse.
Thus, it&rsquo;s terrifying that you may be sleeping under the same roof with these

.
In this article, I&rsquo;m going to show you how to get rid of spiders using a simple Four-Step process. The methods will range from chemical-laden and all-natural techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>As the local temperatures increase, so do the bugs come out in numbers. Hence, you&rsquo;ll require to think seriously consider pest control including getting rid of spiders.�</em>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-spiders-7-effective-tips">How to Get Rid of Spiders (7 Effective Tips)</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-spider-identification">Step 1: Spider Identification</h3>
<p>On
<a href="https://owlcation.com/stem/spider-identification">spider identification</a>
, the 8-legged arachnids (with fangs (chelicerae) and 2 body parts ) belong to the same group as mites, ticks, and scorpions.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-antennae/">Spiders have no antennae</a>
or wing.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are over 35,000 species of spiders worldwide but just a fraction of them will be in your yard or home.</li>
<li>The most common species will be black widows, brown recluses, jumping spiders, orb-weaver, and wolf spiders.</li>
<li>Only black widow and brown recluse have life-threatening venom but other spiders may also leave a nasty and irritating bite.
During the identification process, check the spider&rsquo;s behavioral patterns, color, size, number, and the set pattern of their eyes - but note that spiders will mainly be in some hidden areas.
*Are spiders dangerous? *</li>
<li>Well, most spider species (such as wolf spiders, hobo spiders, orb-weaver spiders, and garden spiders) are harmless.</li>
<li>But, some spiders (including brown recluse and black widow spiders) are dangerous with their venom causing hazardous health issues to humans.
<em>Why do I have a spider problem?�</em></li>
<li>The insects in your home, properties, or yard will attract spiders. They&rsquo;ll move inside during winter and late fall as they prey on insects.
<em>Where will I find spiders?�</em></li>
<li>As reclusive and shy creatures, spiders will live (either outside or inside) in the secluded, quiet, and dark places where they build webs or burrow.
<strong>NB:�</strong></li>
<li>Spiders that build webs such as orb-weaver, garden spiders, or black widows will create such webs in doorways, roof eaves, high trees, shrubs, and decks.</li>
<li>But, the burrowing spiders such as wolf spiders will nest on rockpiles, fallen trees, woodpiles, shrubs, and under bushes.
For the indoor spaces, the spiders will hide in the less-frequented areas such as under furniture and sinks, attics, garage, around windows and ceilings fixtures, closets, and basements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-declutter-and-vacuum">Step 2: Declutter and Vacuum</h3>
<p>Some spider species love dark and damp corners such as rarely-used closets and basements while others will hide in dry plus warm areas like attics.
<em>Declutter�</em>
First, declutter your house - most times spiders will be found in cluttered places such as basements, attics, and garages.
So, reorganize and throw out as many objects as possible - leaving spiders in the open and hence there will be no harborage areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic cleaning and maintenance n your house and spaces will be very important to get rid of spiders. Besides, vacuuming, you must declutter the spaces too.</li>
<li>Decluttering the spaces will remove those hiding places that are in your garage or home. Keenly dust and clean the clutter to reduce the spider-hiding areas.
<em>Vacuum�</em></li>
<li>Since you&rsquo;ve spotted the spiders around your home or yard, there must be some egg sacs lurking around the dark spaces such as crevices and cracks.</li>
<li>So, vacuum the whole house from closet corners and also under the furniture. Further, as you vacuum remember to remove all the spiders and spider webs - and finally dispose of that vacuum bag.
<em>Regular Cleaning:�</em></li>
<li>Regularly clean your spaces, garage, and home regularly to hinder new spider infestations - also dust the tabletops and open spaces to remove cobwebs.</li>
<li>Remove all clutter from the floors, conduct wall-to-wall vacuuming and move objects on countertops, and clean thoroughly</li>
<li>Once monthly, move the small furniture, light fixtures, and dust the ceilings - dusting and vacuuming effectively behind these fixtures.</li>
<li>Also, once monthly, clean under the bed and don&rsquo;t forget any item store beneath there, and for the floor, registers get the vent covers off to dust easily.
<em>Seasonal cleaning:�</em></li>
<li>Clean fire accessories and the fireplace by opening the chimneys flue to remove all cobwebs. Keenly clean and vacuum all items including the screens and fireplace logs.</li>
<li>Check and clean the attic for any cobwebs and leaks. Clean the storage boxes plus your attic floor - and remember to seal all the containers and boxes stored in the attic.</li>
<li>Inspect walls and basement for crack and leaks - fixing all of them while also dusting all the storage boxes and sweeping the surfaces and floors. Clean around the furnace and water heater.</li>
<li>Clean the garage, after getting the car outside to clean it thoroughly and sweep the walls and ceilings plus the exterior door.

<h3 id="step-3-use-terro-t2302-to-kill-any-spiders">Step 3: Use TERRO-T2302 to Kill any Spiders</h3>
<p>TERRO-T2302 gives install-killing results on spiders - quick and easy. Just spray around the holes, garden, crevices, and house or directly on that spider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spider killer will prevent spider re-occurrence for about 6 weeks. It&rsquo;ll kill pests and spiders like black widows and the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">brown recluse</a>, bed bugs, cockroaches, ants, and scorpions.
Spray this TERRO-T2302 on or around the spider&rsquo;s or ant&rsquo;s nest. You can spray it both outdoors and indoors while also controlling cockroaches and Asian-lady beetles.
But is Terro Spider really a spider-killer safe? Well, don&rsquo;t let
pets, kids, and even adults into the sprayed areas before the chemical is dried - avoid direct contact.</li>
<li>With 0.02 % Deltamethrin and 0.05% Pyrethrins as the active ingredients, TERRO-T2302 offers dual function - it&rsquo;ll know down the spiders and also offer 12 weeks bug control.</li>
<li><a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf">Pyrethrins</a>are extracted from chrysanthemum will trigger paralysis and eventual death as it excites the spider&rsquo;s nervous system.</li>
<li>Further,<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/DeltaGen.html">Deltamethrin</a>will disrupt the spider&rsquo;s nervous system killing the insects on contact. But TERRO-T2302 is not waterproof and thus don&rsquo;t use it during the rainy reason.
<em>To use TERRO-T2302 fo spiders�</em></li>
<li>For indoor spraying, use TERRO-T2302 on the non-food locations that pests will hide and pests - remember the spaces behind appliances or shelves and around windows and doors.</li>
<li>But for outdoor spraying, ensure to pint your spray nozzle at a downward angle but away from your body and face - but don&rsquo;t spray in a windy environment.</li>
<li>TERRO-T2302 will kill spiders and other insects on picnic areas and patios surface. The product willkill fleas, silverfish, crickets, ants, and cockroaches.
Ensure that the TERRO-T2302 must come into direct contact with the spider - so spray the outside and inside including the window and door frames.
Remember to spray TERRO-T2302 to get to those difficult spider webs. Also, don&rsquo;t remove the egg sacs and spider webs from those spaces until the spray is fully dried.
Spray the outdoor spaces including on non-crop or bushy areas, and the spider-infested weeds - including on lumber and firewood. Wash the clothes and skin using water plus soap.
Avoid using this spider spray around aquatic animals as it&rsquo;ll be toxic to them including to fish.

<h3 id="step-4-usecatchmaster-72mb-spider-catching-glue-boards">Step 4: Use<strong>Catchmaster 72MB Spider-Catching Glue Boards�</strong></h3>
<p>After monitoring the spider activity, you can use the Catchmaster 72MB as a glue trap to catch multiple insects that&rsquo;ll also capture spiders straying around the room.
Set up these traps around areas that you&rsquo;ve noticed some spider activity - this may include around the closet storage spaces and garage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insects including spider will wall on the glue board and they&rsquo;ll get stuck - ready for disposal. You can also remove the spider webs using the web out spray.</li>
<li>Spray the product under or inside your patio coverings - and this will help break down the spider web and then clean them up using a broom.</li>
<li>Sticky traps are mainly used forcockroachesandrodentsbut will also work against spiders - simply place the traps on hidden spaces such as the attic, basement, closet corners.
Catchmaster 72MB will capture the insects in a non-toxic way (no rodenticides or insecticides ) to get rid of roaches, ants, and mice - but the bugs will be attracted by the scent of the peanut butter.
Ensure to keep the spider traps in some moderate temperatures, avoid freezing or overly hot temperatures. You may also fold the trap to form some tunnel shape - and hence avoids dust.</li>
<li>For indoor use, position your glue boards in a horizontal direction on corners, or against the baseboards. Don&rsquo;t position on the moist surfaces or places near water.</li>
<li>Avoid using on areas with extreme heat. Also, for cold places like the walk-in fridge, get Catchmaster 48WRG which&rsquo;s great for cold temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-use-peppermint-oil">Step 5: Use Peppermint Oil</h3>
<p>Scientific evidence denotes that
peppermint oil will repel or exterminate spiders
working like a natural insecticide against spiders and other arachnids.
It is thought that spiders dislike either the monoterpenoids (with fumigants) or strong odors found in the oil as outlined in a
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014752/#!po=85.2941">2010 study by StudyTrusted</a>
.
But how do you use peppermint oil in controlling or repelling spiders? Just get a water-filled spray bottle and put peppermint oil (about 5- 20 drops) - add some
dish soap</p>
<ul>
<li>shake to mix.
Next, you&rsquo;ll require to spray the water-peppermint mixture around the dark corners and house perimeter plus other spider-hiding areas.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to apply this peppermint oil mixture onto various surfaces once weekly. When the spiders come back prior to wend-of-week, increase the frequency - maybe daily spraying?
You can position some peppermint plants around some strategic areas inside and outside the house. Further, sprinkle some ground peppermint leaves on areas frequented by some spiders.
Here are additional repellents (natural) that&rsquo;ll repel spiders, mainly essential oils:</li>
<li>Citronella Oil</li>
<li>Tea Tree Oil</li>
<li>Lavender Oil</li>
<li>Eucalyptus Oil</li>
<li>Lemon Oil
Spread some cedar mulch near the home to deter or repel the spiders - maybe you can drop some cedar sachet on the drawers and closet.

</ul>
<h2 id="2-dont-feed-them">2. Dont feed them</h2>
<p>Squirrels come to the home because you feed them. Surprised?
Yes, we are feeding these squirrels unintentionally. These squirrels come to our home regularly because they find something to fill their belly up every time they come.
So its high time we figure out what they eat and start keeping such things away from them. Please dont give them an easy meal to have and a party at your place.</p>
<h2 id="3-applyapple-cider-vinegar">3. ApplyApple Cider Vinegar</h2>
<p>The usage of apple cider vinegar has turned fruitful in an attempt to free place from squirrels.
It works very simply by adding apple cider vinegar into a spray bottle and spray it near the holes, open corners, flower pots, or any other place where squirrels frequently visit.
The factor that makes this method useful is its pungent acidic smell, which squirrels couldnt handle.</p>
<h2 id="3-use-electric-fencing">3. Use Electric Fencing</h2>
<p>This method is an old fashioned one but mighty effective. Squirrels find it very easy to nibble the wires and extremely difficult to manage these fences.
Even these fences have been upgraded to an electric type. Therefore, it is highly advisable to use an electric fence around your place rather than mere wires.</p>
<h2 id="4-use-of-safflower">4. Use of Safflower</h2>
<p>Seeds of safflower are very bitter and acidic in taste and can be life-taking in squirrels. If these rodents are to be kept away from bird feeders, put safflower seeds in it.
On the one hand, these seeds are devastating for the squirrels and, on the other hand, harmless for birds, making it a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="5-sprinkle-pepper-chilli">5. Sprinkle Pepper (Chilli)</h3>
<p>A mixture of chili pepper and birdseed has turned into a good natural weapon to free place from squirrels. This mixture can be placed in the feeder for birds.
As the previous method of Safflower, this method keeps the squirrels away while keeping the birds unharmed and normal.</p>
<h2 id="6-hot-peppers-and-garlic-cloves">6. Hot Peppers and Garlic Cloves</h2>
<p>Talking about mixtures, one more mixture has become very useful. This is a mixture of finely grounded hot peppers and garlic cloves in almost equal proportions.
Then add some water to mix it and a paste of it. Once the powdery paste is ready, sprinkle it to the parts where squirrels normally visit.</p>
<h2 id="7-jalapeno-pepper">7. Jalapeno Pepper</h2>
<p>In the list of the mixture, one more mixture has recently gained popularity, i.e., the mixture of jalapeno pepper, water, and vinegar.
Shake it as hard as you can and like the other methods, spray it to the corners and commonly used places by squirrels.

<h2 id="how-to-scare-away-squirrels">How to Scare Away Squirrels</h2>
<p><strong>1. Squirrel Exclusion Collars</strong>
<em>Want to scare the squirrels?�</em>
Scaring the squirrel can be an effective and proactive approach for the exclusion of squirrels. One of the things that really scare out these squirrels is the collar typically made up of sharp metal.
These collars are positioned around the trees, poles, and bird feeders. When this animal tries to
climb up the pole
, it finds it extremely difficult to climb a smooth metal disk. Not only is it difficult to climb up, but it also injures the squirrels, perhaps the reason for their fright.
<strong>2. Usage of chemicals</strong>
As science has evolved, different kinds of chemicals have been explored and used to clear the place from squirrels; at
times, chemicals can be damaging for squirrels also, which aids in creating a fear factor in these species&rsquo; minds.
Attics are dry, warm, and mostly uninhabited. Thus, it makes it an ideal place for squirrels to settle down, build a place for them, a nest, store food, and try to be protected from other enemies outside.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-attic">How to Get Rid Of Squirrels in the Attic</h2>
<p><strong>1. Close Attic Entry Points</strong>
The basic thing to protect an attic from squirrels is to close all possible and visible entry, and exit points squirrels can utilize.
Make sure you use nails and a hammer to seal all such spots. Please dont give them an easy access point to come over and live and build.
<strong>2. Use of mothballs</strong>
Usage of mothballs has gained acceptance and popularity in the ear past, as they have proven themselves enormously useful when it comes to getting rid of squirrels.
Mothballs are made up of naphthalene balls, which is the chief element in driving out these species. The cost of this method is very affordable, hence the grown usage.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-roof-space">How to Get Rid Of Squirrels In Roof Space</h2>
<p>These days, squirrels are regarded as the peskiest of the pests, mainly due to their tenacity coupled with their devastating fretting and chewing on woodwork.
The two options that have proven themselves most effective are Exclusion and Trapping.
Upon removing squirrels, you must sot let them these species come again to your home.
You must carry out repairs and make sure you animal-proof your property, and consequently, more of this creature will come in to replace their evicted numbers.
People are not very aware of this type of trap. Different agencies are marketing it, hoping that this will gather popularity and acceptance.
<strong>1. Cage Traps</strong>
An evergreen method of catching squirrels is to trap them in cages. This method has remained a useful option ever since its inception.
Even today, its being used very aggressively to get rid of squirrels. Again like previous methods, this one also scares and annoys the squirrels.
One way exclusion doors.
As the name indicates, this box has only a way in and no way out for squirrels. This is a slightly newer kind of trap box that has come into the market.</p>
<h2 id="killing-squirrels-with-anti-freeze">Killing Squirrels with Anti-Freeze</h2>
<p>*Have you ever thought anti-freeze can kill these squirrels? Trust me, they can, but the process is risky. *
Anti-freezes active and decisive ingredient is its Ethylene Glycol. Its taste is quite sweet, hence that attraction for squirrels.
Its proven now that anti-freeze works as an outstanding
pest control
poison that curbs or eliminate rodents from your home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Its risky because these are dangerous for our
pets like dogs and cats
, as they also like the sweetness of it and fall in the trap thats being laid, not for the squirrels.
The anti-freeze works as a useful and effective homemade
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-poison-for-squirrels/">squirrel poison</a>
; its dark side is it puts our pets&rsquo; lives at risk also.</p>

<li>particularly after a termite inspection - comprehensive steps for prevention and total termite extermination.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the most common technique includes
soil treatment
and
chemical termite killers
with active ingredients such as fipronil and imidacloprid. Further, you may also directly treat the wood and furniture to get rid of termites�(
check termite images
).
While at it, you may also position baits in the house and lawn. Such chemicals will release IGRs. After contacting the termites, the termites will go back to their colony and kill them through poisoning.

<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-termites---pest-control-tips">Details: How to Get Rid of Termites - Pest Control Tips</h2>
<p>Termites have
2,300 species, and they&rsquo;ll gnaw wood in your home and other properties plus included furniture - they&rsquo;ll weaken or damage wooden structures. These bugs have three body parts and six legs.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Subterranean Termites</em>- Subterranean termites (cream-brown colored) create mud tubes to get to wooden structures, particularly in the humid or warm regions. These bugs measure about1/8 inches in length and are largely found in the Southeast.</li>
<li><em>Dry-wood Termites</em>- The dry-wood termites will build nests on and eat dry wood and furniture. These termites are tan- or light-brown colored and measure about3/8 inches in length. The dry-wood termites largely live in coastal states and the Southwest.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYPQ1Tjp0ew&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYPQ1Tjp0ew&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
<li><em>Damp-wood Termites</em>- These termites feed on damaged or wood-soiled damp wood. The damp wood could includelogs, lumber, and stumps. Damp-wood termites are brown in color and measure about inch long plus they&rsquo;re mainly found in Pacific regions like southern Florida.</li>
<li><em>Formosan Termites</em>- Formosan Termites is a highly dangeroussubterranean termite (they love both wet soil and moist wood) and will get into your structures through cracks, unsealed joints, or wood that&rsquo;s in contact with the soil. Formosan Termites are yellow-brown and measure inch long, living in wall nests and underground in the warmer South climates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-inspection---how-to-do-a-termite-inspection">1. Inspection - How to Do A Termite Inspection</h2>
<p>A termite
inspection
is a dirty job requiring you to have a flat-head screwdriver or pocket knife, flashlight, gloves, and coveralls.</p>
<h3 id="i-what-to-look-fobelowow-are-some-of-the-objects-to-look-out-for---including-live-termites-damaged-woods-and-mud-tub-during-the-termite-inspections">i. What To Look FoBelowow are some of the objects to look out for - including live termites, damaged woods, and mud tub during the termite inspections.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Termite wing Piles - Termite swarmers tend to shed wings as they molt to their nextlife stage- and these wings will be piled around light sources such as near windows. Swarmers will have four wings pairs of the same size anddouble in length as the bug&rsquo;sbody.</li>
<li>Damaged furniture or wood - Massive termite infestation will lead to damaged wood when the bugs destroy the structure&rsquo;s joints&rsquo; integrity. Tap the dry wood using a pocket knife or screwdriver - a dull thud will signify termites in wood tunnels.</li>
<li>Mud tubes - Termites, particularly subterranean termites, will build mud tube nests from wet soil, and these will run-up to the wood where they&rsquo;ll get their food. So, if you see the mud tubes running across or around the wooden structure - this shows the presence of termites.
The potential termite infestation places include wooden structures in crawl spaces and basements, window frames and sills, porches, and wooden decks. Additional areas include cement, wood debris, expansion joints, and brick construction cracks and piles, plus wooden porches and slabs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ii-probe-the-ground">ii. Probe the Ground</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to probe the suspected ground using
screwdrivers or picks. Dig into the wood or soil around the house&rsquo;s foundation and examine any mud tubes or wing piles. You&rsquo;ll notice that the mud tubes will measure a diameter of about
inches.
The mud tubes will be moving towards the wooden structures, but you must note that there is also a massive termite infestation for large tubes. Also, termites will escape direct sunlight, and hence they&rsquo;ll be hiding in bushes and shrubs - insulation, floors coverings, and behind walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal weather and behavior - During the warm climates, the termites will go into hiding while they&rsquo;ll start mating and getting new sites insummer and spring.However, in winter,subterranean termites will start burrowing deeper into the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-termite-treatment">2. Termite Treatment</h2>
<h3 id="i-termite-trenching">i. Termite Trenching</h3>
<p>For effective treatment control, termite treat your home&rsquo;s exterior with Taurus SC, among other effective termiticides that&rsquo;ll fully exterminate the termites. The treatment prevents new termites from getting into the structure while also exterminating the termites as they exit their nest.
You&rsquo;ll require a pump sprayer, a medium-sized bucket, and a pickaxe or trench shovel. However, if there is a concrete block on your way, you&rsquo;ll need concrete drill bits (1/2 inches by 24 inches or 1/2 inches by 18 inches) and a hammer drill. Here&rsquo;s the process;</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig trenches that are 6 inches deep by 6 inches wide on then house&rsquo;s foundation and particularly on the external wall - locations that termites bore and build their nests. Make the trench to go a minimum of 10 feet in length or as far as the termite infestation goes.</li>
<li>Next, prepare the termiticide termite treatment. Take your bucket and put water up to about 3/4 of its total level. Next, pour the recommended termiticide treatment to create the right concentration, also using a stirrer to get the right concentration.</li>
<li>Next, pour the termite treatment solution into the trench you&rsquo;ve already created on the wall near the termite nest - this should be done gently for even distribution. Also, pour some of the termite treatment on the soil evacuated from the &ldquo;termite trench.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Spray the soil excavated to ensure that it&rsquo;s an effective treatment as you return it into the termite trench - ensure that the spraying leaves this soil in a moist condition.
If you are drilling any concrete blocks on the way, either on a sidewalk or carport slab - use the tangible drill bits plus your hammer drill to make work easier. Make 2&quot; to 3&quot; drilled holes plus allow distancing of about 12 inches between the holes.
However, ensure you pass through the concrete and make a big hole in the soil under the stone. Finally, fill the drilled holes with the termite treatment solution - a plastic or metallic funnel would also help apply the termiticide into the holes.
Allow the holes and the soil to soak up properly with the treatment solution - come back after 1 hour and repeat the treatment process - this should be some about three times. Finally, patch the holes using concrete using Trebor plugs or a patch filler to get the concrete slat to its initial state.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ii-termite-bait-stations">ii. Termite Bait Stations</h3>
<p>Termite bait stations or Termite traps are excellent treatment options either above or in the ground around the yard or home. The stations have baits (either cellulose, paper, or wood) that contain some poison aimed to kill the termites by design.
Bait stations will be useful in situations where termite trenches are undesirable or impracticable. Luckily, this method is easy to install, cheap (besides using many attractants) don&rsquo;t use harmful chemicals, and it&rsquo;s not labor-intensive. However, the
bait stations require regular inspection -
maybe within three months.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require a post hole digger, 3/4 inches electric, or hand augers (2 in total) for thistermite treatment process. Typically, you&rsquo;ll install the termite bait stations to create a termite barrier around the home - roughly 3-4 feet from the house&rsquo;s foundation.</li>
<li>Install the bait stations in narrow holes (8-10 inches drilled using augers) and spaces them between 8 and 10 feet apart. However, you may reduce the separation between the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/home-remedy-for-termites/">termite bait stations around then home</a>for a massive infestation.</li>
<li>Ensure that the hole you drill is deeper with about 2 inches to 4 inches than the bait station&rsquo;s bottom - this enables any rainwateror otherwise to drainunder the bait station. Don&rsquo;t damage water, utility, or gas lines as you drill the holes.</li>
<li>Also, install the baits at about 1 foot - 2 feet from the house&rsquo;s foundation, and thus it&rsquo;ll be easy to avoid tampering with previously installed soil treatments or termite barriers - or any that&rsquo;ll be installed at a later date.</li>
<li>Ensure that the bait&rsquo;s lip will be flush with the soil. Finally, create a map of your house and each bait station&rsquo;s locations so that it&rsquo;ll be easier to trace them later.
The next step will require monitoring the termite bait station using a pre-bait made from objects such as an inspection cartridge or wood. However, this process may take several months up to even a year (monitor the station every three months) because it will not immediately attract the termites.
Next, when you notice that the termites are feeding or tampering with the pre-bait, it&rsquo;s now time to install an active bait such as dead or live termites or mud tubes. Don&rsquo;t rush to install the poisoned termite bait as you may end up exterminating the workers required to create the feeding.
Finally, it&rsquo;s now time to install the active or poisoned bait onto the termite bait station. However, monitor the bait station as you&rsquo;d done earlier every three months. Keep records of all the changes, particularly of feeding activity, to allow the bait to rest on the station more - repeat the treatment process monthly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-termite-prevention">3. Termite Prevention</h2>
<h3 id="i-seal-off-windows-and-doors">i. Seal off windows and Doors</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to seal off the house or property from the termites - this is especially important for windows and doors. Therefore, the bugs won&rsquo;t quickly get into your wooden house - you&rsquo;ll need to seal up the crevices and cracks in the rooftops and sidings.
Important is you analyze any possible entry areas that the termites can use and seal them off completely. Further, you&rsquo;ll need to inspect the wooden floors and furniture - including beams and joists, to ensure that the termites aren&rsquo;t wreaking havoc on your house.</p>
<h3 id="ii-repair-leaking-pipes-and-tapes">ii. Repair L**eaking **Pipes and Tapes</h3>
<p>Termite prevention will save you both time, money, and furniture or structure integrity in the future. However, the most important fact is avoiding moisture getting ton your wooden structures - this will help kill off the termite colonies.
So, repair any leaking pipes and tapes - including those of the hot water lines near or around the house. Hence, the lack of moisture around the home will reduce the conditions necessary for the thriving of subterranean termites.
Also, mop all the moisture around your house and remove all the water that could be in water puddles around the house or property - or even inside the home. Keep the house plus floors and carpets dry and well-aerated all round then year.
Also, avoid the overflows from the various air-conditioning and hot water lines away from the house and its sides.</p>
<h3 id="iii-clear-idle-wooden-materials">iii. Clear idle Wooden Materials</h3>
<p>Inspect the house for breached or damaged shielding installed to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/top-7-natural-termite-control-can-easily/">control termites</a>
. Further, remove all idle wooden materials, including cellulose, debris, and timber that may be lying inside, under, or around your house or yard - equally use
yard flea treatments
.
Such timber may act as good food for the termites and equally a hiding place for subterranean termites (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">check their treatments</a>
) and may also conceal termites inside the dead leaves and base-work work-spaces. You&rsquo;ll also require to remove all clothes piles lying around idle as they&rsquo;ll provide food (have cellulose) and shelter for termites.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s how to get rid of termites - for the active termite colony in the wooden structure or house, you&rsquo;ll need to undertake appropriate treatment steps.
But first, undertake termite inspection before taking treatment further, including using
termite baits stations
and soil treatment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6M_84t3oa4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6M_84t3oa4</a></p>
<h3 id="1-pesticides">1. Pesticides</h3>
<p>Most pesticides and Insecticides in the local market kill wolf spiders and
hobo spiders
by paralyzing them before death takes place.
The toxic chemicals in pesticides/insecticides also inhibit spider&rsquo;s eggs from hatching and further break down their breeding grounds (webs).</p>
<ul>
<li>When purchasing your pesticides/insecticides, be careful to check on the spider labels or recommendations for killing assurance.</li>
<li>Tempo SC Ultra is a good example of an outdoor wolf spider insecticide that kills over 100 other pests. The product is extra concentrated to boost killing power and allows further dilution to form 30 gallons of effective solvent - covers a wide surface area.
When dealing with pesticides/insecticides, be careful since residue left behind may affect your pets or kids upon contact.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-trap-wolf-spiders-in-a-container">2. Trap wolf spiders in a container</h3>
<p>Wolf spider trap container is an ideal method of capturing one or two spiders. Usually, you need a plastic or a glass container and a piece of cardboard or wood -
spiders have no antennae
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon spotting a wolf spider, cover it with a plastic container immediately. Then, gently slide a piece of cardboard beneath the container - be careful that the spider may not escape.</li>
<li>This method encloses the wolf spider and prevents it from crawling or running away. You can easily release the spider far away from your compound - may be in the fields. Don&rsquo;t throw live wolf spiders into a dustbin or garbage pit.
When trapping wolf spiders, wear protective gloves to avoid the case of being bitten in the process. Though wolf spider&rsquo;s bite is less venomous, it may trigger a reaction, for allergic sensitive individuals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-boric-acid-solvent">3. Boric Acid Solvent</h3>
<p>Boric acid solvent, when inhaled by wolf spider, chocks and suffocate it to death in a couple of seconds. The toxic gas blocks the breathing system, thus denying it the oxygen needed for life support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon contact, boring acid solvent weakens and breaks down the wolf spider&rsquo;s exoskeleton - this action exposes internal tissues, which are further dehydrated leading to death.
During preparation, ensure that the boric acid solvent is super concentrated for excellent action.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-use-an-organic-pesticide">4. Use an organic pesticide</h3>
<p>Unlike
commercial chemical-based pesticides
, organic pesticides are manufactured using a special plant-based solvent (Hexa-hydroxyl), which is a non-pollutant.
Actually, these pesticides won&rsquo;t kill wolf spiders directly; instead, the organic substance destroys all insects in which the spider feeds.
By eliminating the wolf spider&rsquo;s primary source of food; then, you will eventually get rid of spiders in the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, organic pesticides come in powder or dust form - you just need to sprinkle it in an area infested with wolf spiders and leave it for a couple of minutes to act.
The organic substance in the pesticides (Hexa-hydroxyl) is safe for both kids and pets - won&rsquo;t cause intoxication or contact reaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-hunt-wolf-spiders-down">5. Hunt wolf spiders down</h3>
<p>Hunting down wolf spiders is a tactical way of elimination where you physically search for these arachnids in their hideouts. Usually, hunting is successful at night more than daytime due to limited light sources, which eases escape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a torch, flashlight over wolf spiders hideouts intermittently - this could be at corners, holes, cracks, woods, patches, or shrubs.</li>
<li>The disc eye shape found in the wolf spiders reflects light at night making them more visible.
Upon spotting the spider, you can opt to kill or capture them alive using a trap. Remember to wear protective gloves when hunting wolf spiders for your own personal safety. Avoid disturbing other animals in the vicinity when hunting.

</ul>
<h3 id="6-spider-spray">6. Spider Spray</h3>
<p>Spider sprays are specific products manufactured for wolf spiders elimination - the product may be chemical-based or organic, depending on the manufacturer or intended area of use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spider sprays come in pressurized and concentrated forms that act instantly upon contact. Indeed, the toxic substances in the spray integrate a quick-acting formulation that kills instantly upon contact.</li>
<li>Demon Max is a classic example of spider spray that integrates complex chemical formula, which not only kills wolf spiders but also inhibits their re-infestation.
Terro Spider Spray is a market lead spider killer that comes in a 16oz canister and works both indoors &amp; outdoors. Further, Terror Spray instantly kills spiders and other insects such as cockroaches, scorpions, crickets, and ants in the process.
Remember, spider sprays are user-specific, either indoors or outdoors - consider checking the labels before use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-place-sticky-traps-around-the-house">7. Place sticky traps around the house</h3>
<p>If you suspect that wolf spiders are lurking in your compound or house; then, consider using the sticky traps method. The traps are just cardboard pasted with sticky glue on the surface, which acts as the sticking/trapping agent.</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea in this method is that when the wolf spider steps on the sticky surface, it gets stuck and unable to crawl along - this act denies it food leading to death.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to prepare or purchase several sticky traps.
Then, lay them down strategically at places you suspect wolf spiders may pass or crawl (it may be your bedroom, garage, kitchen, store, yard, or toilet) and leave them for 5 days or so. Later, come and inspect your trap for any capture.
Any trapped wolf spider should be disposed of far away from the compound. Ensure the sticky traps are placed far from kids and pets whatsoever.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_kAVhRspJg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_kAVhRspJg</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-wash-spiders-away">8. Wash spiders away</h3>
<p>Using pressurized water, from a hosepipe or jet stream, you can wash away wolf spider infestation. Usually, you aim water jet at the spiders&rsquo; hideouts - the water pushes the spiders out instantly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon removal, the spiders (plus their eggs) float in water and are easily washed away.</li>
<li>This method is best for outdoor wolf spiders&rsquo; elimination.
Also, the drainage through which the washed spiders flow should be sufficiently linked to sewer or septic to prevent re-infestation.
When washing away wolf spiders infestation, wear protective gear (gumboots, gloves, goggles, etc.) for your personal safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-kill-the-spider-with-a-broom">9. Kill the spider with a broom</h3>
<p>By using a standard broom, you can strike and kill a live wolf spider - as
they lack wings
. Normally, you need to aim and hit the spider fast before it senses danger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wolf spiders are fast running - they quickly pace to their hideouts as soon as they detect danger in their vicinity.</li>
<li>Smaller wolf spiders are likely to slip away when striking; thus, making the broom ineffective - you, therefore, need to check the size of the wolf spider before settling for this method.
Alternatively, you can use a solid object or a pair of shoes to hit the spider too. Dead spiders should be disposed of accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-rid-your-yard-of-clutter-and-debris">10. Rid your yard of clutter and debris</h3>
<p>Clutters and debris in the compound or house are possible hideouts for wolf spiders during the day. Heaps of glass, firewood, mulch, bins, compost, or leaves should be cleared from the compound to eliminate breeding grounds for wolf spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, objects such as grills, unused toolboxes, stones, empty flower vases among others should be removed or inspected regularly.
When undertaking the cleaning process, wear protective gear such as boots, gloves, overalls, and gloves for personal safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-seal-cracks-and-holes-in-the-outer-wall">11. Seal cracks and holes in the outer wall</h3>
<p>By sealing cracks and holes on your perimeter wall or house, you will not only keep off wolf spiders from infestation but also inhibit further breeding ground for other insects too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holes and cracks are immediate hideouts for wolf spiders and often than never, they breed in such areas.</li>
<li>You can successfully seal the cracks/holes using patty or caulk - both indoors or outdoors.
Broken window screens should be removed replaced immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-remove-vegetation-from-the-perimeter-of-the-house">12. Remove vegetation from the perimeter of the house</h3>
<p>Heavy plant cover (vegetation) in your compound provides ample ground for wolf spiders infestation. Shrubs, thick flowerbeds, and untrimmed grass cover shied wolf spiders and offer suitable breeding grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>By trimming vegetable covers and clearing plant waste in the compound, you will be exposing wolf spider hideouts; thus scaring them away, if any.
It&rsquo;s recommendable to trim grass cover sufficiently and avoid crowded flower beds in your compound.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-install-insect-screens">13. Install insect screens</h3>
<p>Insect screen in a fine-mesh framework that is firmly fixed at the vent leading to outside. Basically, it&rsquo;s believed that wolf spiders can get into your house through these vents or chimneys as they search for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to install screens all over the vents in your house or perimeter wall, in order to prevent wolf spiders from crawling in through these points.
Though expensive, this method works excellently and prevents other insects from your home too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-remove-or-change-your-outdoor-lighting">14. Remove or change your outdoor lighting</h3>
<p>The presence of light attracts insects such as flies, mosquitoes, moths among others, which are food for wolf spiders. In response, wolf spiders will come to feed on these insects leading to infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should swift off lights at night, especially if it&rsquo;s not in use. Install light shades in your place instead of floodlights.
Alternatively, go for sodium vapor light in place of a normal/standard outdoor lighting system. As much as you can, maintain dim light at night since wolf spiders love hunting for food at night than daytime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homemade-remedies-for-eliminating-wolf-spiders">Homemade Remedies for Eliminating Wolf Spiders?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for homemade wolf spiders elimination alternative to fix your problem; then, consider the options highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-use-of-hexa-hydroxyl">1. Use of Hexa-Hydroxyl</h3>
<p>Hexa-hydroxyl is naturally blended using plant extracts and oil additives to boots sent. The organic substance can be used to kill wolf spiders by spraying or sprinkling over wolf spider-infested areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>All you need to do ispeppermint, lavender leaves, and red peppers. Mesh these items in a motor and add little water. Sieve the mixture and repeat the process again.</li>
<li>You can opt to add Aloe Vera plant to boost the killing action. The solvent extract kills wolf spiders on contact. Further, the toxic gas released suffocates the spiders to death too
Hexa-hydroxyl is also available in the local market too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-by-using-glue-strips">2. By Using Glue Strips</h3>
<p>Glue can be poured along paths suspected to be used often by wolf spiders. Whether office glue or rubber adhesive, provided that the glue has a substantial adhesive force to hold the spider in place; then, you are good to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>When wolf spiders step on the glue, they will get stuck/trapped and starve to death. Remember, you should use glue that is easier to remove without affecting the primary material upon which it&rsquo;s applied.
Alternatively, you can smear a piece of wood with glue and place it in wolf spiders infested area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-dish-soap">3. Dish Soap</h3>
<p>Highly viscous dish soap act as sticking surface upon which wolf spiders get stuck. However, it&rsquo;s difficult for the spider just to step into dish soap for no reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you will need to have spider&rsquo;s bait placed in the dish soap - this could be a moth, housefly, or any other insect eaten by spiders.</li>
<li>Prepare dish soap sufficiently - add water and stir to form a thick viscous paste. Using a sweep net, capture moths or flies from the fields. Place the dead flies on the dish soap.
Place dish soap in various points where you suspect wolf spider will pass - it may be your garage, shelves, kitchen, or bedroom. Inspect the trap after a day or so to see the presence of trapped spiders.
Scoop and throw away trapped spider. Always refill the dish soap after capture. This method may also traps crawling insects such as ants as well as houseflies.

<h2 id="what-attracts-wolf-spiders-in-the-house">What Attracts Wolf Spiders in the House?</h2>
<p>Some of the following things could attract wolf spiders to your house:</p>
<h3 id="1-food">1. Food</h3>
<p>Food such as flies, moths, mosquitoes, among others is key attractants for wolf spiders into your house. Usually, wolf spiders will hunt them individually.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, in most cases, the spider prefer visiting place where hunting will be less cumbersome.</li>
<li>Home dustbins or stores are common places where such insects thrive and breed in large colonies. Therefore, wolf spiders often build their webs, which acts as traps.
When wolf spiders realize there is plenty of food in your house or compound, they tend to breed and multiply - they end up building a shelter there.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-shelter">2. Shelter</h3>
<p>Wolf spiders love living in a quiet place far from any disturbances. Your quiet house could be such as a serene place for wolf spiders where they would prefer living in.
Moreover, wolf spiders like hideouts that are less inhabited by other insects - like cracks, holes, gaps, shelves, etc. Perhaps your house has room for such hideouts; then, you are likely to find wolf spiders coming to your home.</p>
<h3 id="3-breeding-ground">3. Breeding ground</h3>
<p>Breeding is critical for wolf spiders as they undertake reproduction life in quiet places far from any commotion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your house, especially the ceiling is a good environment that will attract wolf spiders.</li>
<li>Pinholes, vents, cracks, and shelves are the suitable breeding grounds for spiders too - if they located such options in your place during their visit; then, chances are that they will breed and live there.
Remember, wolf spiders will build their web before they lay eggs - this could be a physical sign of infestation in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-wolf-spiders-infestation">How to Prevent Wolf Spiders Infestation</h2>
<p>Below are some of the wolf spiders preventive measures:</p>
<h3 id="1-clutter-cut-down">1. Clutter Cut down</h3>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Labeling <a href="/posts/best-plastic-gutter-guards/">plastic</a> chairs through scratching is a method for customizing or identifying items, whether for personal, business, or institutional purposes. Scratching involves physically etching text, numbers, or symbols into the surface of a plastic chair.
This process is durable, inexpensive, and efficient for mass marking. In this guide, we will explore how to label plastic chairs using this method, along with the necessary tools, techniques, and considerations for achieving professional results.</p>
<h2 id="1-why-label-plastic-chairs-through-scratching">1. Why Label Plastic Chairs Through Scratching?</h2>
<p>Before diving into the &ldquo;how,&rdquo; it is essential to understand the &ldquo;why.&rdquo; Labeling plastic chairs using scratches has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Durability: The marks are permanent and cannot be washed off, unlike stickers or paint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost-effective: Requires only basic tools, making it an affordable solution for large quantities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customization: Allows for personal or branded inscriptions, such as names, logos, or serial numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security: Prevents theft or loss by marking ownership or identifiers that are difficult to remove.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-tools-needed-for-labeling-plastic-chairs-by-scratching">2. Tools Needed for Labeling Plastic Chairs by Scratching</h2>
<p>To scratch labels into plastic chairs, you&rsquo;ll need a few basic tools. The type and quality of tools will determine the precision and neatness of the outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Engraving Tool or Electric Etcher: These tools provide controlled scratching with adjustable speeds and fine tips for detailed work. A battery-powered engraver with a fine point is ideal for intricate designs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scratch Awl or Metal Scraper: These hand tools are useful for simple, bold labels. A scratch awl works by manually applying pressure and dragging it across the plastic surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fine Sandpaper (Optional): This can be used to smooth out rough edges after scratching to give a more refined appearance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stencils (Optional): For consistent, professional labeling, stencils can guide your scratching. You can create custom stencils for logos or other intricate designs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permanent Marker (Optional): Before scratching, a marker can outline the design, ensuring accuracy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-preparing-the-plastic-surface-for-scratching">3. Preparing the Plastic Surface for Scratching</h2>
<p>Preparation is key to ensuring that the scratching process goes smoothly and that the final result is clean and legible.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clean the Surface: Begin by thoroughly
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-lysol-kill-bed-bugs/">cleaning the surface</a>
where you intend to label the chair. Plastic chairs tend to accumulate dust, dirt, and oils over time, which can interfere with the scratching process. Use a mild detergent or alcohol wipe to clean the area, then allow it to dry completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the Right Spot: The location of the label is important. Select an area on the chair that is easily visible, yet not prone to excessive wear. The backrest or underside of the seat is typically ideal for labeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark Your Design: Using a pencil or a fine-tip permanent marker, sketch the text or design on the chair before beginning to scratch. This ensures that your lettering is evenly spaced and correctly aligned. If using a stencil, secure it in place to prevent shifting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4-techniques-for-scratching-labels-on-plastic-chairs">4. Techniques for Scratching Labels on Plastic Chairs</h2>
<p>Once the tools and surface are prepared, you can start scratching your label into the chair. Different techniques can yield varying results, depending on the complexity of the design and the tools used.</p>
<h3 id="a-freehand-scratching-with-manual-tools">A. Freehand Scratching with Manual Tools</h3>
<p>For simpler designs or labels like serial numbers and basic text, a manual tool such as a scratch awl or a sharp metal scraper can suffice.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Apply Steady Pressure: Hold the tool firmly and press into the plastic surface, but avoid pressing too hard. Excessive force can result in deep gouges, which might crack the plastic. Instead, use steady, moderate pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Short Strokes: Begin by scratching short, controlled strokes, working your way around the outline of each letter or number. For curves or rounded letters (e.g., &ldquo;O&rdquo; or &ldquo;C&rdquo;), move slowly and maintain even pressure to create a smooth, consistent curve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check Your Work: Periodically step back to check the progress and ensure that the design is being transferred as expected. Make adjustments where necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b-using-an-engraving-tool-for-detailed-work">B. Using an Engraving Tool for Detailed Work</h3>
<p>For more complex designs, such as logos or intricate text, an electric engraving tool offers precision and speed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the Right Tip: Engraving tools often come with multiple tips. For detailed work, select a fine-point tip, while broader tips are better for larger text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the Speed: Many electric etchers come with adjustable speed settings. Start with a low speed and increase it as you become comfortable. A slower speed allows for more control over the tool and ensures finer detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engrave Slowly: Move the tool slowly and deliberately across the surface. Unlike manual scratching, engraving tools work best when they glide smoothly. Avoid rushing the process to maintain control and accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct Mistakes: If you make a minor error, such as a stray line, you can often blend it into the design or smooth it out with fine sandpaper after finishing the engraving.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="5-post-scratching-finishing-touches">5. Post-Scratching Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>After completing the scratching process, there are a few finishing steps you can take to enhance the appearance and durability of your label:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Smooth the Edges: Use fine-grit sandpaper to gently smooth any rough edges around the scratch marks. This is especially helpful for rounded letters or logos with more intricate designs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Color (Optional): If you wish to make the label more visible, you can apply a coat of paint or fill the scratch marks with a permanent marker. For example, after scratching the label, run a black or white marker over the scratched lines, then wipe away the excess ink with a cloth, leaving the ink only in the grooves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-considerations-and-best-practices">6. Considerations and Best Practices</h2>
<p>When labeling plastic chairs through scratching, it&rsquo;s essential to keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Practice First: If you are new to the technique, practice on an old or unused chair to gain confidence before applying your label to the intended piece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid Over-Scratching: Over-scratching or pressing too hard can weaken the plastic, leading to cracks or a rough appearance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check Plastic Type: Some plastics may be harder or more brittle than others. Polypropylene and polyethylene, commonly used in plastic chairs, are relatively easy to scratch, but always test a small, inconspicuous area first.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-common-uses-for-scratched-labels">7. Common Uses for Scratched Labels</h2>
<p>Labeling plastic chairs through scratching is particularly useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Schools and Institutions: For labeling chairs with room numbers, class sections, or inventory numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Personal Customization: Individuals can personalize their patio furniture by etching their names, artwork, or even motivational phrases into the chair.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Labeling plastic chairs by scratching is a cost-effective and durable method for adding personalized or identifying marks.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the right tools and techniques, you can create permanent labels that stand the test of time, making this an excellent choice for individuals, institutions, and businesses alike.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Painting a fence with a <a href="/posts/best-paint-roller-for-ceilings/">roller</a> is an effective way to give it a fresh look while saving time and effort. Using a roller for painting allows for a smooth and even finish. Heres a step-by-step guide to help you paint your <a href="/posts/fence-painting-ideas/">fence</a> like a pro.</p>
<h2 id="materials-you-will-need">Materials You Will Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exterior paint or stain</li>
<li>Paint roller (preferably a long-nap roller for rough surfaces)</li>
<li>Paint tray</li>
<li>Drop cloths or plastic sheeting</li>
<li>Painter&rsquo;s tape (optional)</li>
<li>Extension pole for the roller (optional)</li>
<li>Paintbrush (for touch-ups and edges)</li>
<li>Gloves</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-prepare-the-area">Step 1: Prepare the Area</h3>
<p>Start by preparing the area around the fence. Lay down drop cloths or plastic sheeting to protect the ground from paint spills. If there are any plants or objects near the fence, cover them as well. This will save you time on cleanup later.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-clean-the-fence">Step 2: Clean the Fence</h3>
<p>Before painting, its important to clean the fence to remove dirt, grime, or any previous peeling paint. Use a pressure washer or scrub the fence with soapy water and a stiff brush. Allow the fence to dry completely before moving to the next step.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-tape-off-edges-optional">Step 3: Tape Off Edges (Optional)</h3>
<p>If you want to create clean, sharp lines along the edges of the fence, use painters tape to tape off areas that should not be painted. This could be the areas where the fence meets the ground or any neighboring structures. Make sure to press down the tape firmly to avoid any paint bleeding underneath.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-choose-the-right-roller">Step 4: Choose the Right Roller</h3>
<p>For a smooth and even finish, its best to use a roller with a long nap (around  inch or more) for rough or textured surfaces. A long-nap roller will help you cover more surface area and apply paint more evenly to the wood grain.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-load-the-roller-with-paint">Step 5: Load the Roller with Paint</h3>
<p>Pour your paint into a paint tray and load your roller by dipping it into the paint. Roll the roller back and forth on the trays slanted surface to evenly distribute the paint across the roller. Be sure to load the roller generously, but avoid overloading it, as excess paint can drip.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-apply-the-paint">Step 6: Apply the Paint</h3>
<p>Start painting by rolling the paint onto the fence in sections. Use long, even strokes to apply the paint in a W or M pattern to ensure full coverage. Begin at the top of the fence and work your way down to avoid drips. If you are painting large sections, work in smaller manageable areas, and dont forget to roll the paint along the edges.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-touch-up-edges-with-a-brush">Step 7: Touch Up Edges with a Brush</h3>
<p>Use a paintbrush to touch up any areas that the roller cant reach, such as corners or along the fence posts. Its best to do this while the paint is still wet for a seamless finish.</p>
<h3 id="step-8-apply-a-second-coat-if-necessary">Step 8: Apply a Second Coat (If Necessary)</h3>
<p>Once the first coat has dried (follow the manufacturers recommended drying time), inspect your fence. If the coverage is uneven or the fence is still showing through, apply a second coat. Repeat the process as needed to achieve full coverage.</p>
<h3 id="step-9-clean-up">Step 9: Clean Up</h3>
<p>Once youre finished painting, remove the painters tape carefully while the paint is still wet for crisp lines. Clean your roller and paintbrush with water (for latex paints) or the appropriate solvent (for oil-based paints). Dispose of any paint waste properly and store leftover paint in a cool, dry place for future touch-ups.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-success">Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
<li>**Pick the Right Paint:**Choose a paint that is specifically formulated for outdoor use, as it will be more durable against the elements.</li>
<li>**Work on a Dry Day:**Paint on a dry day with mild temperatures to ensure the paint dries properly and adheres to the surface.</li>
<li>**Use an Extension Pole:**If you have a tall fence, an extension pole for your roller will make the job easier and allow you to reach the higher sections without a ladder.</li>
<li>**Don&rsquo;t Rush:**Take your time with each coat to ensure even coverage and a professional-looking finish.
With these simple steps, you can easily paint your fence with a roller and achieve great results. Whether you&rsquo;re refreshing an old fence or giving it a brand-new look, this method will help you save time and effort.</li>

<h3 id="why-paint-bathroom-cabinets">Why Paint Bathroom Cabinets?</h3>
<p>There are several reasons you might consider painting your bathroom cabinets:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Budget-Friendly Update:**Painting is a low-cost way to refresh the look of your bathroom without the expense of replacing the cabinets.</li>
<li>**Customize Your Space:**You can choose any color or finish that suits your style, making it easier to match your bathroom decor.</li>

<li>**Durability:**When done properly, painted cabinets can be just as durable as new ones, with proper maintenance ensuring a long-lasting finish.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-you-will-need">What You Will Need</h3>
<p>Before you start painting your bathroom cabinets, gather the necessary materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Paint:**Choose a high-quality paint designed for cabinets or a semi-gloss or satin finish, as these finishes are durable and easy to clean.</li>
<li>**Primer:**A bonding primer helps paint adhere to the cabinet surface, especially if its made of wood, laminate, or MDF.</li>
<li>**Sandpaper:**Medium-grit sandpaper (around 120-150 grit) to prep the surface and smooth out any imperfections.</li>
<li>**Paintbrush and Roller:**A small angled brush for detailed areas and a foam roller for larger, flat surfaces will provide a smooth finish.</li>

<li>**Cleaning Supplies:**Clean cloths or a damp sponge for removing dust and dirt from the cabinet surfaces before painting.</li>
<li>**Drop Cloth:**To protect your floors and surrounding areas from paint drips, use a drop cloth or plastic sheeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-paint-bathroom-cabinets">How to Paint Bathroom Cabinets</h3>
<p>Follow these steps for a smooth and lasting paint job on your bathroom cabinets:</p>
<h4 id="1-remove-the-cabinet-doors-and-hardware">1. Remove the Cabinet Doors and Hardware</h4>
<p>Start by removing the cabinet doors and drawers. This will make it easier to paint all surfaces without worrying about getting paint on hardware or hinges. Use a screwdriver to remove handles, knobs, and any other hardware. Store these in a labeled bag to make reinstallation easier.</p>
<h4 id="2-clean-the-cabinets">2. Clean the Cabinets</h4>
<p>Before you start painting, thoroughly clean the cabinet surfaces to remove dust, grime, and oils. Use a mild cleaner and a cloth or sponge to wipe down the cabinets. If theres any heavy buildup, use a degreaser to ensure the surface is clean and ready for paint.</p>
<h4 id="3-sand-the-surface">3. Sand the Surface</h4>
<p>Sanding is a crucial step to help the primer and paint adhere properly. Lightly sand the cabinet surfaces with medium-grit sandpaper (120-150 grit). This will help smooth out any imperfections and create a slightly rough surface for the paint to grip. Be sure to sand the cabinet doors, drawers, and frames evenly. Once youre done, wipe away any dust with a clean cloth.</p>
<h4 id="4-apply-primer">4. Apply Primer</h4>
<p>Next, apply a bonding primer to the cabinet surfaces. Primer helps paint adhere better, especially on glossy or slick surfaces like laminate or previously painted cabinets. Use a paintbrush for edges and corners, and a foam roller for larger surfaces. Let the primer dry completely according to the manufacturers instructions. If the cabinet color is particularly dark or youre painting over a darker color, you might need to apply a second coat of primer.</p>
<h4 id="5-sand-again">5. Sand Again</h4>
<p>After the primer has dried, lightly sand the surfaces again with fine-grit sandpaper (around 220 grit) to ensure a smooth finish. This step is optional but recommended, especially if the primer has left any rough spots. Once sanded, wipe away any dust.</p>
<h4 id="6-apply-the-paint">6. Apply the Paint</h4>
<p>Now its time to apply the paint. Choose a high-quality paint designed for cabinets or a durable semi-gloss or satin finish that can withstand moisture and frequent cleaning. Use a small brush for edges and corners, and a foam roller for large, flat surfaces. Apply the paint in thin, even coats, starting with the cabinet doors and then moving to the cabinet frames. Be careful not to overload the brush or roller with paint, as this can lead to drips and an uneven finish.</p>
<h4 id="7-allow-the-paint-to-dry">7. Allow the Paint to Dry</h4>
<p>Allow the first coat of paint to dry completely. The drying time will vary depending on the type of paint youre using, but it typically takes around 2-4 hours for the first coat to dry. Once dry, lightly sand the surfaces again with fine-grit sandpaper to ensure a smooth finish. Wipe away any dust before applying the second coat of paint.</p>
<h4 id="8-apply-a-second-coat-of-paint">8. Apply a Second Coat of Paint</h4>
<p>For best results, apply a second coat of paint to ensure even coverage. Repeat the same process as the first coat, using thin, even layers. Allow the second coat to dry completely.</p>
<h4 id="9-reattach-the-cabinet-doors-and-hardware">9. Reattach the Cabinet Doors and Hardware</h4>
<p>Once the paint is completely dry, carefully reattach the cabinet doors, drawers, and hardware. Take your time to ensure everything is aligned and securely fastened.</p>
<h3 id="tips-for-painting-bathroom-cabinets">Tips for Painting Bathroom Cabinets</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Be Patient:**Take your time with each step to ensure a smooth and durable finish. Rushing can lead to mistakes or an uneven application.</li>
<li>**Ventilate the Area:**Make sure your bathroom is well-ventilated while painting, especially if youre using oil-based paints or primers.</li>
<li>**Use Thin Coats:**Applying several thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat ensures better adhesion and a smoother finish.</li>
<li>**Choose the Right Paint:**Be sure to use paint thats designed for high-moisture areas like bathrooms. This ensures durability against humidity and frequent cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Painting bathroom cabinets can dramatically change the look of your bathroom and is a great DIY project. With the right tools, materials, and techniques, you can achieve a professional-looking result thats both durable and beautiful. Follow the steps above, and your newly painted cabinets will give your bathroom a fresh, updated appearance for years to come.</p>

<p>Tetherball is a two-player game where opponents face off on opposite sides of a pole, hitting a ball tethered to it by a rope. The objective? Wrap the rope completely around the pole in your designated direction while preventing your opponent from doing the same in theirs.</p>
<p>Its a test of agility, strategy, and hand-eye coordination, making it a timeless favorite for
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-material-for-playground-surface/">kids and adults alike</a>
.�The beauty of tetherball lies in its simplicity.
All you need is a tetherball pole, a ball attached to a rope, and a flat playing area. While its often associated with schoolyards, tetherball can be enjoyed in backyards, parks, or anywhereyou can set up the equipment.</p>
<h3 id="equipment-youll-need">Equipment Youll Need</h3>
<p>Before you start playing, lets go over the basic setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tetherball Pole</strong>: A sturdy, vertical pole, typically 10 feet tall, anchored into the ground or a weighted base.</li>
<li><strong>Tetherball</strong>: A ball (similar to a volleyball) attached to the pole with a rope, usually 6-7 feet long.</li>
<li><strong>Court</strong>: A circular playing area, about 20 feet in diameter, with a dividing line splitting it into two equal halves.
You can purchase a tetherball set from a sporting goods store or improvise with a DIY setup. Just ensure the pole is secure and the rope is strong enough to withstand vigorous play.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-game">Setting Up the Game</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Install the Pole</strong>: If youre using a portable set, secure the base with sand or water as instructed. For permanent setups, the pole should be cemented into the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Attach the Ball</strong>: Tie the rope to the top of the pole so the ball hangs about 2-3 feet above the ground when at rest.</li>
<li><strong>Mark the Court</strong>: Draw or imagine a circle around the pole and a line through the center to divide the space into two sidesone for each player.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="basic-rules-of-tetherball">Basic Rules of Tetherball</h3>
<p>Tetherball rules are straightforward, but they can vary slightly depending on where you play. Heres a standard set to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: One player tries to wrap the rope around the pole clockwise, while the other aims for counterclockwise. The first to fully wrap the rope in their direction wins.</li>
<li><strong>Starting the Game</strong>: Decide who serves first (flip a coin or play rock-paper-scissors). The server hits the ball in their chosen direction to begin.</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay</strong>: Players hit the ball back and forth, staying within their half of the court. You can use your hands, fists, or forearms to strike the ball.</li>
<li><strong>Winning</strong>: The game ends when the rope is fully wrapped around the pole, and the ball can no longer be hit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-fouls-and-penalties">Common Fouls and Penalties</h3>
<p>To keep the game fair, watch out for these infractions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crossing the Line</strong>: Stepping into your opponents half is a foul. Penalty: The other player gets a free hit.</li>
<li><strong>Rope Touching</strong>: Grabbing or holding the rope is not allowed. Penalty: Loss of the point or a free hit for the opponent.</li>
<li><strong>Double Hit</strong>: Hitting the ball twice in a row (without it passing to the other side) is a foul. Penalty: The opponent gets a free hit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-play-step-by-step">How to Play: Step-by-Step</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Position Yourself</strong>: Stand in your half of the court, facing the pole. Stay light on your feet, ready to move.</li>
<li><strong>Serve the Ball</strong>: If youre serving, hit the ball with an open hand or fist in your chosen direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).</li>
<li><strong>Respond to Hits</strong>: As the ball swings toward you, strike it back in your direction. Timing is keyhit too early or late, and you might lose control.</li>
<li><strong>Defend Your Side</strong>: Anticipate your opponents moves and block their attempts to wrap the rope in their favor.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Going</strong>: Continue hitting until the rope is fully wound around the pole in one direction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips-for-beginners">Tips for Beginners</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice Your Swing</strong>: Start with gentle hits to get a feel for the balls movement. As you improve, add power.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Mobile</strong>: Move around your half of the court to position yourself for the best angle.</li>
<li><strong>Watch the Rope</strong>: Keep an eye on how much rope is left - knowing when youre close to winning (or losing) can guide your strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advanced-techniques">Advanced Techniques</h3>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-remove-paint-from-walls/</guid>
      <description>Removing paint from walls can be a challenging task, whether youre dealing with old, peeling paint or want to repaint a room with a fresh color.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Removing <a href="/posts/wall-paint-design-ideas-with-tape/">paint</a> from walls can be a challenging task, whether youre dealing with old, peeling paint or want to repaint a room with a fresh color.</p>
<p>With the right tools and techniques, you can efficiently strip paint from walls without causing damage to the surface underneath. Heres a comprehensive guide on how to remove paint from walls effectively.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-paint-from-walls">How to Remove Paint from Walls</h2>
<h3 id="1-use-a-paint-stripper-or-remover">1. Use a Paint Stripper or Remover</h3>
<p>The most common and effective method for removing paint from walls is using a paint stripper or remover. These products are formulated to break down the paint, making it easier to scrape off.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are different types of paint strippers available, including solvent-based, caustic-based, and bio-based options. Be sure to choose a product thats safe for the type of <a href="/posts/best-paint-brushes-for-walls/">wall</a> youre working with.</li>
<li>To use a paint stripper, apply a generous layer to the painted surface using a paintbrush. Let it sit for the recommended amount of time (usually around 15 to 30 minutes), and then scrape off the loosened paint using a paint scraper or putty knife.
Always follow the manufacturers instructions and take
necessary safety precautions
, such as wearing gloves and a mask, as some paint removers can be toxic.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-use-a-heat-gun">2. Use a Heat Gun</h3>
<p>If you want to avoid using harsh chemicals, a heat gun is another option for removing paint. A heat gun works by emitting hot air that softens the paint, making it easier to scrape off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by heating a small section of the wall with the heat gun, and then use a paint scraper to gently remove the softened paint. This method is ideal for small areas or for stripping paint from detailed surfaces like trim and moldings.
Be cautious when using a heat gun, as the heat can cause the wall surface to become damaged if held too long in one spot. Always keep the gun moving and work in small sections at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-sand-the-walls">3. Sand the Walls</h3>
<p>Sanding is an effective method for removing paint from walls, especially if the paint has already begun to peel or chip. Use a power sander or a sanding block to gently sand the painted surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>This technique works best for small touch-up areas or when the paint is not too thick.
Start with a coarse-grit sandpaper and then gradually switch to a finer grit to smooth the surface. Keep the sander moving to avoid damaging the drywall underneath the paint. Wear a dust mask to protect yourself from inhaling the paint dust.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-try-a-natural-removal-solution">4. Try a Natural Removal Solution</h3>
<p>If you prefer a more natural approach, you can make your own paint remover using household ingredients. One popular DIY solution is combining baking soda and water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a paste by mixing the two ingredients, and apply it to the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/living-room-paint-colors-with-brown-furniture/">painted surface</a>. Let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes, then use a scraper to remove the softened paint.
This method is more labor-intensive but can be effective for small areas or delicate surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-use-a-multi-step-approach">5. Use a Multi-Step Approach</h3>
<p>In some cases, a multi-step approach works best for removing stubborn paint. Start by applying a paint remover or using a heat gun to remove the majority of the paint.</p>
<p>Once the paint is mostly gone, you can use sandpaper or a power sander to smooth out any remaining paint patches and finish the surface - to leave it amazingly clean.</p>
<p>This combination of methods ensures that youre left with a clean, smooth wall surface, ready for a fresh coat of paint.</p>
<h3 id="tips-for-removing-paint-from-walls">Tips for Removing Paint from Walls</h3>
<p><strong>Test the Wall:</strong>
Before starting, test your chosen paint removal method on a small, inconspicuous area to make sure it wont damage the wall surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Work in Small Sections:**To make the process more manageable, break the task into smaller sections, working one area at a time.</li>
<li>**Protect Surrounding Areas:**Cover furniture, floors, andany other surfacesthat might be affected by the paint removal process with drop cloths or plastic sheets.</li>
<li>**Ventilate the Area:**Make sure the room is well-ventilated when using chemicals or heat, as these processes can release fumes that are harmful to your health.</li>
<li>**Consider Hiring a Professional:**If the paint removal process seems too complicated or youre dealing with a large area, it might be worth hiring a professional to handle the job.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Removing paint from walls can be a time-consuming process, but with the right tools and techniques, its a task that can be accomplished with ease.</p>
<p>Whether you choose a paint stripper, heat gun, sandpaper, or a natural solution, always make sure to work carefully and safely. With patience and persistence, youll have your walls ready for a fresh coat of paint in no time.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/can-you-paint-over-rust/">Rust</a> is a common problem that can significantly damage metal surfaces, especially large objects exposed to the elements over time. While rust doesnt always render an item unusable, it can be unsightly and, if left untreated, lead to structural damage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are several effective methods to remove rust from large metal objects, restoring their appearance and functionality. This guide will walk you through the best techniques and tools for rust removal, as well as tips to prevent rust from returning.</p>
<h3 id="1-understanding-rust-and-its-causes"><strong>1. Understanding Rust and Its Causes</strong></h3>
<p>Rust forms when metal, particularly iron or steel, reacts with oxygen and moisture in the air. This chemical reaction creates iron oxide, the reddish-brown substance we know as rust. Objects exposed to water, humidity, or moisture are especially prone to rusting. Over time, rust can weaken the metal, making it brittle and compromising its structural integrity.</p>
<p>Key factors that accelerate rust formation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to rain, snow, or humidity.</li>
<li>Saltwater or coastal environments.</li>
<li>Scratches or damage to protective coatings.</li>
<li>Lack of maintenance or cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-manual-methods-for-rust-removal"><strong>2. Manual Methods for Rust Removal</strong></h3>
<p>For smaller or less severe rust spots, manual methods can be effective. These techniques are ideal for large objects with localized rust or for those who prefer a hands-on approach.</p>
<h4 id="sanding"><strong>Sanding</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>**How it works:**Use sandpaper or a power sander to remove rust. Start with coarse-grit sandpaper (e.g., 80-120 grit) to remove the bulk of the rust, then switch to finer grits (e.g., 220-400) to smooth the surface.</li>
<li>**Best for:**Large objects with minor rust or uneven surfaces.</li>
<li>**Tip:**Wear a dust mask and safety goggles to protect yourself from metal particles.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="wire-brushes"><strong>Wire Brushes</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>**How it works:**Use a wire brush to scrub away rust manually. Wire brushes come in various sizes and can be attached to power tools like drills for faster results.</li>
<li>**Best for:**Removing surface rust from flat or curved surfaces.</li>
<li>**Tip:**For stubborn rust, use a brass or steel wire brush, depending on the metals hardness.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scraping"><strong>Scraping</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>**How it works:**Use a putty knife, scraper, or chisel to chip away at thick rust layers.</li>
<li>**Best for:**Heavy rust buildup or hard-to-reach areas.</li>
<li>**Tip:**Be careful not to gouge the metal while scraping.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-chemical-rust-removers"><strong>3. Chemical Rust Removers</strong></h3>
<p>When manual methods arent enough, chemical rust removers can provide a more powerful solution. These products break down rust, making it easier to wipe or scrub away.</p>
<h4 id="phosphoric-acid"><strong>Phosphoric Acid</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>**How it works:**Converts rust into a black, paintable surface by chemically reacting with iron oxide.</li>
<li>**Best for:**Large objects with moderate rust.</li>
<li>**Tip:**Rinse the metal thoroughly after application to neutralize the acid.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oxalic-acid"><strong>Oxalic Acid</strong></h4>
<ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below is�how to repel raccoons?�A <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-raccoons/">raccoon</a> is probably one of the most tenacious and clever pests that boasts a wide variety of athletic skills.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon">Raccoons</a>
can jump, climb, run, or swim with ease, and they have an unparalleled ability to break into trashcans near your home.</p>
<p>Since they are omnivores, raccoons will eat anything they can get their dirty little hands on and this has made them a menace especially in suburban areas.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-repel-raccoons">How to Repel Raccoons</h2>
<p>Yards and gardens are their perfect hangout spot and sometimes they can decide to move into your basement or attic especially when looking for a safe place to raise their kids.</p>
<p>Raccoons may be nice to look at from far but you don&rsquo;t want them getting anywhere near your home. They will steal your food, spread illnesses, and if you run into them, they can scratch you up and leave you with painful injuries.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-identify-their-areas-of-damage">Step 1: Identify their areas of damage</h3>
<p>First, you need to find out where raccoons are gaining entry into your home or compound. Knowing where the raccoon spends most of its time when at your house and identifying the damage it&rsquo;s causing will help you determine the best way to repel them. Common raccoon activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raiding trashcans outside your house.</li>
<li>Eating your veggies.</li>
<li>Attacking your bird feeders.</li>
<li>Living under the porch.</li>
<li>Invading the attic.</li>
<li>Invading the basement.</li>
<li>Digging holes in the yard.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-choose-the-right-repelling-techniques">Step 2: choose the right repelling techniques</h3>
<p>Raccoons display high levels of persistence and ingenuity that can be alarming when you&rsquo;re trying to deter them. However, there are various ways you discourage raccoons from making your home or yard their home:
a) Protect your trash - raccoons love trash bins, so you&rsquo;ll need multiple
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-smells-do-raccoons-hate/">repelling strategies</a>
in this area.
Always lock your trashcans or secure non-locking trashcans with cinder blocks or bungee cords to prevent raccoons from opening them. Double-bag waste meat to reduce the odor that attracts raccoons to your trashcans.
b) Clean up - raccoons thrive in yards dirty and untidy yards with plenty of places to hide. To prevent this, always keep your lawn mowed and prune any overgrown shrubs.
c) Seal entry points - seal the spaces around the decks and bases of sheds that raccoons could use to gain entry into your home. Seal all the entry points to the chimneys, eaves or attics with hardware cloth or chicken wire to keep raccoons out.
d) Fence your garden - installing a fence can help protect your home from raccoons, but since they are excellent climbers, you will need a really tall fence or an electric fence to keep them out. Use a two-wire electric fence, with the wires 6 and 12 inches above the ground.
e) Use floodlights - raccoons hate light and having floodlights lighting up your yard can discourage raccoons from coming near your home. Even better, you can install motion-activated floodlights to stop raccoons in their tracks when they get too close.
f) Use motion-activated sprinklers - you can also install some motion-activated water sprinklers that blast raccoons with water when they get too close.
g) Use chocolate - scatter some chocolate bars outside your home. The raccoons will love eating the chocolate but since it&rsquo;s toxic to them, it will make them sick. After this, the raccoons may mark your home as a no go zone.
h) Use a repellent - there are various types of raccoon repellents you can use based on the places the raccoons are frequenting. Most of these repellents contain capsaicin which is a spicy ingredient extracted from cayenne peppers.
Liquid repellents are great for surface protection against raccoons in areas like garbage cans, bird feeders, plants, hard surfaces, and the roof. You will need to respray regularly as the repellent wears off.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-remove-all-attractants">Step 3: Remove all attractants</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to repel raccoons if you still have attractants like food, water, and shelter. Keep your yard clean and never let your trashcans fill up. Remember to wash the cans periodically to get rid of odors that attract raccoons.</p>
<p>Close any fence gaps and fix broken vents and screens to keep raccoons out. Remove any water sources outside your home and remember to clean up bird seed and pet food that could attract raccoons.</p>
<p>Raccoons are nocturnal in nature, wandering out in the wee hours to search for food.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Granular repellents are great for perimeter protection and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-raccoons/">creating a barrier</a>
around areas like the gardens, raccoon dens, flower beds, barns, sheds, attics, crawl spaces, and other raccoon pathways.</p>
<ul>
<li>They work best where there are flat surfaces and they last longer than liquid repellents.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before painting a <a href="/posts/best-car-wash-soap/">car</a>, sanding is a crucial step that helps create a smooth surface for the paint to adhere to. It ensures that the new paint will go on evenly and helps avoid imperfections. Whether you&rsquo;re painting your car yourself or preparing it for a professional paint job, proper sanding is key. In this guide, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the process of sanding your car before painting, step by step.</p>
<h2 id="why-sanding-is-important">Why Sanding Is Important</h2>
<p>Sanding your car before painting serves several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Creates a smooth surface:**Sanding removes any imperfections, rust, or old paint, providing a clean and smooth surface for the new paint.</li>
<li>**Improves paint adhesion:**Sanding helps the new paint bond better to the surface of the car, ensuring a longer-lasting finish.</li>
<li>**Removes contaminants:**Sanding eliminates dirt, grease, and other contaminants that could interfere with the paint job.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="materials-youll-need">Materials Youll Need</h2>
<p>Before you begin sanding your car, make sure you have the following materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandpaper (variety of grits)</li>
<li>Sanding block or orbital sander</li>
<li>Masking tape</li>
<li>Plastic sheeting or drop cloths</li>
<li>Automotive cleaner</li>
<li>Primer (if necessary)</li>
<li>Safety gear (gloves, goggles, and a respirator mask)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-by-step-guide-to-sanding-a-car">Step-by-Step Guide to Sanding a Car</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-preparation">Step 1: Preparation</h3>
<p>Before you begin sanding, you need to properly prepare the area. Start by cleaning the car thoroughly with an automotive cleaner to remove dirt, grease, and other contaminants. Once clean, dry the car completely. Mask off areas that you dont want to sand or paint, such as the windows, trim, and tires, using masking tape and plastic sheeting.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-choose-the-right-sandpaper-grit">Step 2: Choose the Right Sandpaper Grit</h3>
<p>The type of sandpaper you use depends on the condition of your cars surface. For initial sanding, start with a coarser grit, such as 80 to 120 grit. This will help remove any old paint, rust, or imperfections. Once the surface is smoothed out, switch to a finer grit, like 220 or 400 grit, to create a smooth finish for painting.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-sand-the-cars-surface">Step 3: Sand the Cars Surface</h3>
<p>If youre using a sanding block, apply even pressure as you sand the cars surface. Keep the block moving to avoid sanding too much in one area. For large areas, consider using an orbital sander for faster and more consistent results. Start sanding in small sections, working your way around the car. Be sure to sand in circular motions to avoid leaving any visible lines or grooves.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-check-for-smoothness">Step 4: Check for Smoothness</h3>
<p>After sanding the car with the coarser grit, check the surface for smoothness. Run your hand over the car to feel for any rough spots or imperfections. If needed, continue sanding those areas until the surface feels even. Once youve completed the sanding with the coarser grit, move on to the finer grit for the final smooth finish.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-clean-the-car-again">Step 5: Clean the Car Again</h3>
<p>Once youve completed the sanding process, clean the car once more to remove any dust or debris. Use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe down the entire surface. Its important that the surface is completely clean before you apply the primer or paint.</p>
<h2 id="optional-apply-primer">Optional: Apply Primer</h2>
<p>If the cars surface has any bare metal spots or if youre painting over a particularly rough surface, applying a coat of primer may be necessary. Primer helps improve paint adhesion and ensures a smoother finish. Apply primer in light, even coats, and allow it to dry completely before moving on to painting.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sanding a car before painting may take time and effort, but its a critical step to ensure that the paint adheres properly and that the final finish is smooth and professional-looking. By following these steps and using the right materials, you can achieve a high-quality paint job that will last for years to come.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Selecting the perfect <a href="/posts/10-trees-to-grow-in-containers/">tree</a> for your yard is a long-term investment that can significantly enhance your property&rsquo;s beauty, provide shade, support local wildlife, and even increase your home&rsquo;s value. However, with so many options available, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one. This guide will walk you through the essential factors to consider to ensure you select a tree that thrives in your specific environment and meets your aesthetic and functional goals.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-assess-your-site-conditions">1. Assess Your Site Conditions</h2>
<p>The most crucial step in selecting a tree is understanding the unique characteristics of your yard. Matching the tree to the site is paramount for its long-term health and your satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="climate-and-hardiness-zone">Climate and Hardiness Zone:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>USDA Plant Hardiness Zones:</strong> This is the most fundamental factor. The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map divides North America into zones based on average annual extreme minimum winter temperatures. Choose trees that are rated hardy for your specific zone. Planting a tree that isn&rsquo;t suited to your climate&rsquo;s cold or heat extremes will likely lead to its demise.</li>
<li><strong>Microclimates:</strong> Even within your property, you might have microclimates. Areas sheltered from wind, spots that receive more intense sun, or those with unique drainage can influence a tree&rsquo;s performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="soil-type-and-quality">Soil Type and Quality:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soil Test:</strong> Before planting, consider getting a soil test. This will tell you your soil&rsquo;s pH (acidity/alkalinity), nutrient levels, and texture (sandy, loamy, clay, silty). Different trees have specific soil preferences.
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandy Soil:</strong> Drains quickly, may lack nutrients. Trees that prefer well-drained conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Clay Soil:</strong> Holds water, can become compacted. Trees that tolerate poor drainage, or amend with organic matter.</li>
<li><strong>Loamy Soil:</strong> Ideal balance of sand, silt, and clay; generally good drainage and nutrient retention. Most trees thrive here.</li>
<li><strong>Silty Soil:</strong> Smooth texture, holds moisture well but can compact.</li>
<li><strong>Peaty Soil:</strong> High organic matter, retains moisture, may need pH adjustment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drainage:</strong> Dig a test hole (12&quot; x 12&quot; x 12&quot;) and fill it with water. If it drains within a few hours, drainage is good. If water stands for more than 12-24 hours, you have poor drainage, and you&rsquo;ll need to select trees that tolerate wet feet or amend the soil.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sunlight-exposure">Sunlight Exposure:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Sun:</strong> At least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.</li>
<li><strong>Partial Sun/Shade:</strong> 3-6 hours of direct sunlight, often in the morning or late afternoon.</li>
<li><strong>Full Shade:</strong> Less than 3 hours of direct sunlight.</li>
<li>Most trees prefer full sun for optimal growth, but some thrive in partial shade. Few trees do well in dense, full shade.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="space-constraints-above-and-below-ground">Space Constraints (Above and Below Ground):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mature Size:</strong> This is arguably the most overlooked factor. Research the tree&rsquo;s mature height, spread (canopy width), and root system. A small sapling can grow into a massive tree that overwhelms your yard, interferes with power lines, sidewalks, driveways, foundations, or neighboring properties.</li>
<li><strong>Overhead Utilities:</strong> Avoid planting tall trees directly under power lines.</li>
<li><strong>Underground Utilities/Foundations:</strong> Be mindful of where water, sewer, and gas lines are buried. Some trees have aggressive root systems that can damage these or house foundations. Allow ample clearance.</li>
<li><strong>Proximity to Structures:</strong> Plant trees far enough from your house to prevent branches from scraping the roof, leaves from clogging gutters, or roots from affecting the foundation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-define-your-purpose-and-desired-function">2. Define Your Purpose and Desired Function</h2>
<p>What do you want the tree to do for your yard? Its intended role will heavily influence your selection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shade:</strong> For cooling your home or creating a comfortable outdoor living space. Look for trees with dense, spreading canopies (e.g., Oak, Maple, Sycamore).</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Screen/Windbreak:</strong> For blocking views or reducing wind. Evergreens with dense foliage are excellent choices (e.g., Arborvitae, certain Pines, Leyland Cypress).</li>
<li><strong>Aesthetics/Ornamental Value:</strong> For adding beauty, seasonal interest, or a focal point. Consider flowering trees (e.g., Dogwood, Cherry, Crape Myrtle), trees with interesting bark (e.g., River Birch), or vibrant fall color (e.g., Maple, Ginkgo).</li>
<li><strong>Wildlife Attraction:</strong> To provide food and habitat for birds, pollinators, and other creatures. Choose trees that produce berries, nuts, or nectar-rich flowers (e.g., Serviceberry, Crabapple, Oak).</li>
<li><strong>Fruit/Nut Production:</strong> For edible harvests (e.g., Apple, Pear, Pecan). Be aware of potential mess and increased maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Noise Reduction:</strong> Dense trees can help absorb sound.</li>
<li><strong>Soil Stabilization:</strong> Trees with strong root systems can help prevent erosion on slopes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-consider-tree-characteristics-and-maintenance">3. Consider Tree Characteristics and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Beyond site and purpose, think about the practicalities of living with the tree.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth Rate:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast-growing trees:</strong> Offer quicker results but often have weaker wood, shorter lifespans, and require more frequent pruning.</li>
<li><strong>Slow-to-moderate growing trees:</strong> Generally stronger, longer-lived, and require less frequent maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deciduous vs. Evergreen:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deciduous:</strong> Lose their leaves in fall, providing winter sun exposure and vibrant autumn color.</li>
<li><strong>Evergreen:</strong> Retain their leaves year-round, offering constant privacy and winter interest, but no winter sun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Needs:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaf/Fruit Drop:</strong> Some trees are &ldquo;messier&rdquo; than others. Consider if you&rsquo;re willing to rake leaves, clean up fruit, or deal with sticky sap.</li>
<li><strong>Pruning Requirements:</strong> Some trees require regular pruning for health or shape, while others need minimal intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Pest and Disease Resistance:</strong> Research common issues in your area and choose species known for their resilience. Native species are often more resistant to local pests and diseases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Root System:</strong> Understand if the tree has shallow, spreading roots that can lift pavement or foundations, or deeper, less problematic roots.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-native-vs-non-native-species">4. Native vs. Non-Native Species</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native Trees:</strong> Are adapted to your local climate and soil conditions, generally require less water and fertilizer once established, and provide essential food and habitat for local wildlife. They often have better resistance to native pests and diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Native (Exotic) Trees:</strong> Can sometimes introduce invasive issues or be more susceptible to local environmental stressors. If you choose a non-native, ensure it is not an invasive species in your region.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-consult-with-experts-and-reputable-nurseries">5. Consult with Experts and Reputable Nurseries</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Arborists/Extension Services:</strong> These professionals can provide invaluable advice tailored to your specific location and yard conditions. They can help with soil testing, site assessment, and tree recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Reputable Nurseries:</strong> Purchase trees from a trusted local nursery. Their staff are knowledgeable about what grows well in your area and can offer guidance on selecting healthy specimens.
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspect the Tree:</strong> Look for a strong, straight trunk, well-spaced branches, healthy foliage, and a root system that isn&rsquo;t circling or heavily matted in the pot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary-of-key-considerations">Summary of Key Considerations:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site Conditions:</strong> Climate Zone, Soil (type, pH, drainage), Sunlight, Available Space (mature size above and below ground).</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Shade, Privacy, Aesthetics, Wildlife, Fruit/Nuts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Tree Characteristics:</strong> Growth Rate, Deciduous/Evergreen, Maintenance (leaf drop, pruning), Pest/Disease Resistance, Root System.</li>
<li><strong>Local Context:</strong> Native species, reputable local sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>By carefully considering these factors, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to selecting the right tree that will thrive in your yard and bring you joy for many years to come.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/best-acrylic-paint-for-wood/">Acrylic</a> paint is a versatile medium that works well for airbrushing, but to achieve smooth and even results, it needs to be thinned to the proper consistency. Thinning acrylic paint for airbrush applications is a simple process, and it can make a big difference in your projects. In this guide, well walk you through the best methods for thinning acrylic paint for your airbrush, ensuring that you get the best results every time.</p>
<h2 id="why-thin-acrylic-paint-for-airbrush">Why Thin Acrylic Paint for Airbrush?</h2>
<p>Acrylic paint is generally too thick to be used directly in an airbrush. Thinning it helps to improve flow, prevent clogging, and create a smoother finish. It also ensures that the paint is atomized properly when sprayed through the airbrush, which results in a finer mist and smoother surface.</p>
<h2 id="materials-needed">Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Acrylic paint (your chosen color)</li>
<li>Airbrush thinner or water</li>
<li>Mixing container or cup</li>
<li>Stir stick or palette knife</li>
<li>Airbrush</li>
<li>Paper towels or rags (for cleaning)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steps-to-thin-acrylic-paint-for-airbrush">Steps to Thin Acrylic Paint for Airbrush</h2>
<h3 id="1-choose-the-right-thinner">1. Choose the Right Thinner</h3>
<p>While water can be used to thin acrylic paint, its often best to use a specialized airbrush thinner. These thinners are formulated to work with acrylic paint, ensuring that the paint maintains its pigment strength and consistency. Using the right thinner will prevent the paint from becoming too runny and losing its color quality. If you dont have an airbrush thinner, distilled water can be used in a pinch.</p>
<h3 id="2-add-thinner-to-the-paint">2. Add Thinner to the Paint</h3>
<p>Start by adding a small amount of thinner to your acrylic paint. A good rule of thumb is to use a 1:1 ratio of paint to thinner, but this may vary depending on the paint brand and airbrush type. If youre unsure, start with a 50/50 ratio and adjust as necessary. If you want to achieve a very fine mist, you may need to use slightly more thinner.</p>
<h3 id="3-stir-the-mixture">3. Stir the Mixture</h3>
<p>Once the thinner is added to the paint, stir the mixture thoroughly using a stir stick or palette knife. Make sure the paint and thinner are fully blended to avoid any clumps or lumps that could clog your airbrush. Stir until the consistency is smooth and uniform.</p>
<h3 id="4-test-the-consistency">4. Test the Consistency</h3>
<p>To test the consistency of the paint, place a few drops of the mixture onto a piece of paper or a surface similar to the one youll be painting. Use your airbrush to apply a light mist and check the result. If the paint flows too easily and runs, youve added too much thinner. If the paint is too thick and doesnt flow smoothly, add a bit more thinner. The paint should flow easily, but it shouldnt be watery or too runny.</p>
<h3 id="5-adjust-the-air-pressure">5. Adjust the Air Pressure</h3>
<p>Once the paint is thinned to the right consistency, adjust the airbrushs air pressure to match the paint flow. Lower air pressure is generally better for fine detail work, while higher pressure is suitable for broader coverage. Test the spray pattern by spraying onto a scrap piece of paper or canvas, and adjust as needed.</p>
<h3 id="6-clean-your-airbrush">6. Clean Your Airbrush</h3>
<p>After using the airbrush, its important to clean it thoroughly to prevent any clogs. Run water or airbrush cleaner through the airbrush immediately after use, and clean the needle and nozzle to keep everything in working order.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-thinning-acrylic-paint-for-airbrush">Tips for Thinning Acrylic Paint for Airbrush</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always thin the paint gradually. Its easier to add more thinner than to fix paint thats too watery.</li>
<li>Use distilled water if possible, as tap water may contain impurities that can affect the paints quality.</li>
<li>Test the paint on a piece of scrap material before starting your project to ensure the right consistency.</li>
<li>If youre painting with multiple colors, mix only the amount youll need for each session to avoid wastage.</li>
<li>Some brands of acrylic paint may have specific recommendations for thinning, so always check the manufacturers instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thinning acrylic paint for airbrush use is a simple yet essential process for achieving the best results. By choosing the right thinner, adjusting the consistency, and testing the paint before you begin, you can ensure that your airbrush projects are smooth, even, and professional-looking. Remember to clean your airbrush thoroughly after each use to maintain its performance.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Semi-gloss <a href="/posts/airless-paint-sprayer-cleaning-solution/">paint</a> is a popular choice for high-traffic areas due to its durability, ease of cleaning, and attractive finish. However, there are instances when you might need to thin semi-gloss paint to achieve the right consistency for application. Thinning the paint can improve its flow and ease of application, especially when using it with a sprayer or in specific conditions. In this article, we will guide you through the process of thinning semi-gloss paint, the tools you will need, and tips for achieving the best results.</p>
<h3 id="why-thin-semi-gloss-paint">Why Thin Semi-Gloss Paint?</h3>
<p>There are several reasons you might want to thin semi-gloss paint:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Improved Application:**Thinning paint can help it flow more smoothly, making it easier to apply, especially with a paint sprayer.</li>
<li>**Better Coverage:**For certain applications, a thinner consistency allows the paint to spread more evenly, providing better coverage on surfaces.</li>
<li>**Achieving the Right Finish:**If your paint is too thick, it might leave visible brush strokes or an uneven finish. Thinning the paint helps create a smoother, more professional appearance.</li>
<li>**Use with a Paint Sprayer:**When using a paint sprayer, paint needs to be thinned to a specific consistency to prevent clogging and ensure a smooth, even coat.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tools-needed-for-thinning-semi-gloss-paint">Tools Needed for Thinning Semi-Gloss Paint</h3>
<p>Before you begin thinning your semi-gloss paint, make sure you have the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Paint Thinner or Water:**Depending on whether your paint is oil-based or water-based, you will need either a paint thinner or water to thin the paint.</li>
<li>**Paint Stir Stick:**A clean stir stick will help you mix the thinner with the paint thoroughly.</li>
<li>**Measuring Cup:**To ensure the correct ratio of thinner to paint, use a measuring cup.</li>
<li>**Paint Strainer (Optional):**A paint strainer can help remove any debris or clumps that may have formed in the paint before you use it.</li>
<li>**Paint Container:**A clean container to mix the paint and thinner together.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-thin-semi-gloss-paint">How to Thin Semi-Gloss Paint</h3>
<p>Follow these simple steps to thin your semi-gloss paint:</p>
<h4 id="1-determine-the-type-of-paint">1. Determine the Type of Paint</h4>
<p>First, you need to determine whether your semi-gloss paint is oil-based or water-based. This will determine the thinning agent you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Oil-Based Paint:**For oil-based semi-gloss paint, you will need a paint thinner or mineral spirits.</li>
<li>**Water-Based Paint:**For water-based semi-gloss paint, you can use water to thin the paint.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-measure-the-paint-and-thinner">2. Measure the Paint and Thinner</h4>
<p>Once you have the right thinner, measure the amount of paint you are using and then add the appropriate amount of thinner. A common ratio for thinning paint is:</p>
<ul>
<li>**For Paint Sprayers:**10% to 20% thinner to paint, depending on the sprayer and the surface being painted.</li>
<li>**For Brush Application:**5% to 10% thinner to paint to improve flow without compromising coverage.
Always check the manufacturers instructions on the paint can for specific thinning recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-add-the-thinner-to-the-paint">3. Add the Thinner to the Paint</h4>
<p>Slowly add the thinner to the paint while stirring continuously. This ensures that the thinner is fully mixed into the paint without leaving clumps or inconsistencies. If youre using a paint sprayer, its especially important to mix the paint thoroughly to avoid clogging the sprayer.</p>
<h4 id="4-test-the-consistency">4. Test the Consistency</h4>
<p>After mixing, check the consistency of the paint. It should have a smooth, pourable consistency that flows easily off the stir stick. If the paint is still too thick, add a little more thinner and mix again. Keep testing the consistency until you achieve the desired result.</p>
<h4 id="5-strain-the-paint-optional">5. Strain the Paint (Optional)</h4>
<p>If you notice any debris or clumps in the paint, strain it through a fine mesh paint strainer before applying it to your surface. This will ensure a smooth, clean finish.</p>
<h4 id="6-apply-the-paint">6. Apply the Paint</h4>
<p>Once the paint is thinned to the right consistency, you can begin applying it to your surfaces. Whether you are using a brush, roller, or sprayer, the paint should flow smoothly and evenly, with minimal brush strokes or roller marks. If you are using a paint sprayer, ensure that the paint is properly thinned to prevent clogging or spitting during application.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips-for-thinning-paint">Additional Tips for Thinning Paint</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Start with a Small Amount:**Its always a good idea to start with a small batch of paint and thinner to ensure that the mixture is the right consistency before applying it to large areas.</li>
<li>**Mix Thoroughly:**Make sure to mix the paint and thinner thoroughly. Any lumps or inconsistencies can affect the finish.</li>
<li>**Test Before Application:**If youre unsure about the consistency, always test the thinned paint on a small, inconspicuous area before proceeding with larger areas.</li>
<li>**Follow Manufacturer Guidelines:**Always check the paint manufacturers instructions for specific recommendations on thinning, as this can vary depending on the brand and type of paint.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Thinning semi-gloss paint can significantly improve its application, whether youre using it with a paint sprayer or applying it by hand with a brush or roller. By following the steps outlined above and using the right tools, you can achieve a smooth, professional finish for your painting projects. Remember to always measure carefully, mix thoroughly, and test the consistency before applying the paint to ensure the best possible results.</p>

<h3 id="step-1select-a-raccoon-trap">**Step 1:�**Select a Raccoon Trap</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.esf.edu/aec/adks/mammals/raccoon.htm">Raccoons</a>
are adaptive wild animals. They host pests like roundworms and spread rabies, and will forage in your garbage bins. Killing or hunting raccoons is illegal in some states.</p>
<p>You can trap and then relocate them. Raccoon traps are a humane way to remove these fur-bearing wild animals.</p>
<p>Exterminators recommend getting raccoon traps that are either extra-large or large-sizes (with its length measuring roughly 32 to 42 inches).</p>
<p>Raccoon traps will come with 1 or 2 doors  from which youll select the one that serves your specific purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-Door Trap Model</strong>: This model is a favorite among raccoon exterminators and provides superior level of protection on the trap bait. Allows faster and simple enter/ trapping of the raccoons and other wild animals.</li>
<li><strong>Two-door Trap Model</strong>: Allows double entry allowance and thus provides improved raccoon catch rate. Also, since its a see-through traps, the raccoons will be calmed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-decide-on-the-trap-placement-location">Step 2: Decide on the Trap Placement Location</h3>
<p>First, set up the trap around areas that you&rsquo;ve seen raccoons frequent or where there is evidence of their damage. Place the raccoon trap on a flat surface.</p>
<p>I had tried trapping some raccoons (around a creek that had animals tracks, near barns/ houses) for about a month but they kept eloping me.�However, raccoons will generally love location such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mulch beds</li>
<li>Attics</li>
<li>Woodpiles</li>
<li>Hollow Trees</li>
<li>Porches</li>
<li>Along walls</li>
<li>Below structures</li>
<li>Fence lines</li>
<li>Sheds

<h3 id="step-3-bait-the-racoon-trap">Step 3: Bait The Racoon Trap</h3>
<p>I noted great success with using trap baits like penut butter, marshmellows, sardines, cat food, fish oil spray, and vanilla. Ensure you put wool at the bottom as it&rsquo;ll hold the scent of the liquid for longer.</p>
<p>Raccoons, like most wild animals, definitely love sweet snacks and food such as watermelon and marshmallows.</p>
<p>However, keenly place the bait in the right position of your raccoon trap. This should be in a location thatll allow the raccoon to fully enter the trap.</p>
<p>Notably, some nasty wild animals like raccoons may knock over the trap as they target to steal your hard sourced bait. Further, place a brick or weight on the trap  this will secure the trap is safe.</p>

<h3 id="step-4finally-set-the-raccoon-trap">Step 4:�Finally, Set the Raccoon Trap</h3>
<p>Now, its now that you keenly set the traps door or doors in the raccoon traps ready to trap the nasty wild rodents. Do this keenly on a flat or even surface.</p>
<p>Check the trap usage instruction in the manual for different requirements. After setting the trap, now, its time to test-drive the trigger-and-close systems through pressing down the provided trigger plate.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re setting the trap in hard surfaces such as concrete, first lay down a protective surface like plywood to protect the animal&rsquo;s paws when attempting to dig its way out of the tar.</p>

<h3 id="1-open-trap-doors-only-at-night-raccoons-are-nocturnals"><strong>1. Open Trap Doors only at Night (Raccoons are Nocturnals)</strong></h3>
<p>Raccoons are very cunning wild animals (rodents for that matter). Therefore, recent
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74116.html">research</a>
shows that the back of the raccoon trap must be covered using a half-inch wire mesh to ensure that the raccoon wont steal the bait from outside the trap.</p>
<p>Definitely, the rodents will attempt to get the bait via the trap bars. However, because raccoons are nocturnal, you should only open the traps during the night. This&rsquo;ll prevent the trap catching animals such as cats or rats.</p>
<h3 id="2place-bait-trap-leading-to-trap-door">**2.�**Place Bait Trap leading to Trap Door</h3>
<p>Next, place the bait in a manner that itll leave a trail that leads to your raccoon trap. For example, one piece of the raccoon bait must be positioned around the raccoon trail.</p>
<p>Also, you can place it around places food was located. This will trap the raccoon as it attempts to get back to where it ate the food last time.� But first, ensure you remove the food.</p>
<h2 id="3-practices-for-humana-raccoon-trapping">3. Practices for Humana Raccoon Trapping</h2>
<p>For human treatment of the Raccoons, you
<a href="http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/nuisance/trapping.html">should</a>
put 1-2 tennis balls in the raccoon traps and thus allow the large rodents to release its frustration and energy. Further, for the smaller animal, you can offer some piece of wood.</p>

<p>So, you&rsquo;re wondering how venomous is a black spider with white dots?
<em>Well, most black spiders with white spots are jumping spider that aren&rsquo;t venomous to humans. However, other similar species like the immature black widow are very poisonous. But this is just a faction of the 3,000 spider spices found in North America. Thus, you must know how to differentiate the spider species.�</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you spot a <a href="/posts/cockroach-eggs/">cockroach</a> in your house, the first thing that might come to your mind is whether you might have a roach infestation.�Well, roaches bring a host of negative effects to our homes and may cost hundreds of dollars to eradicate.</p>
<p>So, I understand the cause of panic when homeowners spot a single cockroach in their house.�But should you be worried about the one roach you have spotted?
<strong>A short answer is NO</strong>
. The sight of one roach is not a single indicator that you have a roach infestation to deal with. These pesky creatures are attracted to our homes as they search for water, food, shelter and warmth. So, the one roach that you spot, could have just moved in search of conditions to survive. However, you should treat this one roach seriously to ensure that it doesnt develop into an infestation.</p>
<p>You need to know that cockroaches have evolved with humans for many years and have developed many survival tactics which have made them survive numerous mass extinction. They stay out of sight during the day, only coming out during the night to terrorise your house.</p>
<p>That means, unless you have an infestation, you will rarely see cockroaches. But there are a few signs that may indicate a possible roach infestation.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-cockroach-infestation"><strong>Signs Of Cockroach Infestation</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-seeing-roaches-during-the-day">**1.��� **<strong>Seeing Roaches During The Day</strong></h3>
<p>The sight a cockroach is obviously the surest sign of a roach problem. And while the best time to spot these nocturnal insects is during the night, sometimes it possible to see them during the day. If you spot a roach during the day, there is a high chance that you might be dealing with a horde of them.</p>
<p>Although roaches tend to hide during the day, overcrowding and competition for food and water may cause them to spill out during the day in order to survive. So, if you find roaches during the day, its probably the right time to start a treatment plan or seek help from pest control professionals</p>
<h3 id="2-dead-roaches-lying-around">**2.��� **<strong>Dead Roaches Lying Around</strong></h3>
<p>Basically, life and death is part of a roach infestation. Thus, it is common to find carcasses of cockroaches in the places they hide. Signs of dead roaches mean that roaches are already in your house but not necessarily an infestation.</p>
<h3 id="3-roach-droppings">**3.��� **<strong>Roach Droppings</strong></h3>
<p>Another possible indicator of roach infestation, is the presence of fecal matter around your house. These creatures have a high metabolism rate, meaning they can excrete a substantial amount of fecal matter. The droppings differ in appearance, depending on the species and sizes of cockroaches.</p>
<p>Adult roaches will defecate cylindrical pellets-like feces while droppings from small roaches resemble ground coffee. The location and the quantity of roach feces can give you a hint of the extent of the infestation.</p>
<p>Check the areas most frequented by roaches such as behind the sink and food storage areas for roach droppings. If theres a substantial amount of feces, this could be a clear indicator of a high roach traffic.</p>
<h3 id="4-presence-of-roach-eggs">**4.��� **<strong>Presence Of Roach Eggs</strong></h3>
<p>Roaches breed and multiply rapidly in just a few days. So, the sight of oothecae (egg casings) left after hatching is a clear sign of infestation. Oothecae are the brown casings that are discarded after hatching. Most roach species produce an ootheca with 10 to 20 eggs but the stubborn German roach will have up to 50 eggs in a single ootheca.</p>
<p>Normally, most roach species attach their ootheca in secure places where pesticides and enemies like humans have a difficulty reaching.</p>
<p>However, the German roach carries with it the ootheca until the eggs hatch, making it hard to spot. If you have an infestation, you will spot egg castings inside closets, cabinets, around appliances such as refrigerators, ovens, stoves etc.</p>
<h3 id="5-unusual-smells">**5.��� **<strong>Unusual Smells</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, roaches have a characteristic oily odour which tends to become pungent as the infestation gets worse. The oily smell is possible with a large number of cockroaches, but can also result from oleic acid produced by decomposition of dead roaches. German roaches produce quite an intense smell than other roaches. The smell of cockroaches remains in the air and can even interfere with the taste of food.</p>
<h2 id="what-attracts-roaches-">**What Attracts Roaches? **</h2>
<h3 id="1-food-or-something-to-eat">**1.��� **<strong>Food Or Something To Eat</strong></h3>
<p>Exposed food is one the most common attractant for roaches. Roaches will crawl and remain in your house as long as they have something to eat. They are not selective at all. From food crumbs on surfaces to left overs on utensils, roaches will eat almost anything they come across.</p>
<p>But armed with simple housekeeping measures, you can minimise these avenues for roach proliferation. For example you can clean the house thoroughly and disinfect the surfaces. In addition keep all food substances in sealed vessels.</p>
<p>However, remember that roaches do not entirely rely on foodstuffs like us. Some cockroach species will feed on non-food substances like wood, cardboard, glue, paper etc.</p>
<h3 id="2-presence-of-damp-dark-and-hidden-places">**2.��� **<strong>Presence Of Damp, Dark And Hidden Places</strong></h3>
<p>Even if roaches are deprived of foodstuffs, these creatures are known to be sturdy enough to survive up to a month without feeding. During this time, roaches tend to cling to any dark, hidden and wet places in the house. Hence, you might find them around garbage points, garage and bathroom and behind the sink.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, these creatures will hide in place where theres seldom disturbances and away from human predators.</p>
<h3 id="3-exposed-trash">**3.��� **<strong>Exposed Trash</strong></h3>
<p>Just like foodstuffs, exposed trash will attract roaches like magnet. They will not only find something to eat but also a quiet haven to hide and breed.</p>
<p>If you want to get roaches out of trash areas, be sure to empty the garbage collection bins and clean them thoroughly.</p>
<h3 id="4-water">**4.��� **<strong>Water</strong></h3>
<p>Roaches can survive up to a month without food but not without water. They dehydrate quickly and will barely survive a month or two without water. Thats why roaches are attracted to wet places like under the sink, leaking pipes, around pets water and any other wet surface.</p>
<p>However keeping your house as dry as possible can reduce the persistence of roaches in your house.</p>
<h3 id="5-overgrown-vegetation">**5.��� **<strong>Overgrown Vegetation</strong></h3>
<p>Overgrowing grass and weed around the house and along pathways leading to the doors may be good breeding areas for roaches. In addition natural mulch and overstayed mown grass (i.e. before disposal), may harbour roaches because of the moist and warm conditions underneath.</p>
<p>However such roach threats can be minimised by maintaining a clean and tidy garden through clearing and damping overgrown vegetation.</p>
<h3 id="6-things-you-bring-home">**6.��� **<strong>Things You Bring Home</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike bed bugs, roaches do not hitch a ride home on things like clothes and furniture. Roaches like hiding in electrical appliances and cardboard boxes. They love the warm and quiet conditions inside appliances, so be keen not to bring them home.</p>
<p>You risk bring them home if you buy second hand appliances that come from a roach infested place. If you are not sure whether such appliances harbour roaches, you can cast the doubts by wrapping the items in airtight plastic bags together with Nuvan strips and leave them for a week or so.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-roach-do-i-have"><strong>What Type Of Roach Do I Have?</strong></h2>
<p>Of the 4600 known species of roaches, only 30 species have evolved and adapted to live with humans. Out of these, there are 5 main types of roaches that you are likely to find near households. These include:</p>
<h3 id="1-german-cockroach">**1.��� **<strong>German Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Blattella germanica. It is the type of roach you will commonly find in warmer climates. Though it is small in size, merely about  in, this is one roach you dont want to have anywhere near your house. They harbor numerous disease-causing bacteria and may cause allergy relation reactions. German roaches are also known for their resistance against common pesticides. Their color ranges from dark brown to tan and they dont fly.</p>
<h3 id="2-american-cockroach">**2.��� **<strong>American Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Periplaneta Americana. This is the largest type of roach that you will see in your house. Its reddish brown, readily flies and about 1 in. Although its the most abundant, this roach is not very dangerous. Its however associated with a lot of nasty diseases to humans.</p>
<h3 id="3-oriental-cockroach">**3.��� **<strong>Oriental Cockroach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Blatta orientalis Linnaeus. Its commonly known as the water bug due to its tendency to inhabit damp areas such as the basements. Its color ranges from dark brown to black but the wings are non-functional.</p>
<h3 id="4-brown-banded-roach">**4.��� **<strong>Brown Banded Roach</strong></h3>
<p>The scientific name for this roach is Supella longipalpa. This roach resembles the German roach but can be distinguished by the brown bands on their body. In addition, just like the German roach, this roach skin castings and excretions are associated with allergic reactions.</p>
<h3 id="5-smoky-brown-roach">**5.��� **<strong>Smoky Brown Roach</strong></h3>
<p>Last but not the least is the &ldquo;Smoky Brown Roach&rdquo;. The scientific name for this roach is Periplaneta fuliginosa. The name of this roach comes from its characteristic mahogany color. They commonly inhabit areas around the garage and woodpiles.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>The sight of one roach should not cause you a lot of panic. This should rather get you ready for a roach control plan. Since roaches breed very rapidly, one female roach can quickly cause a roach infestation in your home.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you embark on appropriate roach prevention plans such as eliminating conducive environments. In addition, you can seek advice from a professional pest exterminator.</p>

and you wonder whether these reptiles are a source of food. Can they be eaten?</p>
<p>Can Wall Geckos cause food poisoning or be poisonous when eaten by humans or carnivores? So,
<em>is wall <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs/">gecko</a> poisonous if eaten?�</em>
**The simple answer is NO! <a href="/posts/how-to-remove-paint-from-walls/">Wall</a> Gecko is not poisonous to humans or other animals when eaten. The meat from the Wall Gecko is non-toxic (has no toxins) and is safe for human consumption. **
<strong>However, there are some parts of Wall Gecko that should not be eaten e.g. skin and mouth-part. These sections are known to house pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which multiply rapidly and cause food poisoning when eaten.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Geckos&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-is-wall-gecko-poisonous-if-eaten">Details: Is Wall Gecko Poisonous If Eaten?</h2>
<p>The Wall Gecko is safe and edible reptile that does not cause any harm to human beings when eaten. Their meat does not have toxins and can also be eaten by other carnivores without causing any food poisoning.</p>
<p>However, the mouth-part and skin of wall Gecko house the salmonella bacteria and pathogens that may cause food poisoning when eaten.</p>
<h3 id="1-what-to-eat-in-wall-gecko">1. What to eat in wall Gecko</h3>
<p>The Wall Gecko can be eaten by humans, your pets such as cats and dogs as well as other carnivores. However, not all parts of Wall Gecko can be eaten. You will need to be cautious when killing the Wall Gecko as it can bite (mild bite) and instill pain. The following are some of the parts that are preferably eaten.</p>
<ol>
<li>**The body meat.**Once you kill your Wall Lizard, peel of the skin (this can be used to make drum as in Thailand) and dissect it to get body meat. The body meat (somatic) it best to feed on since its soft and tender. This meat does not contain any toxins that may cause food poisoning. The Meat from the Wall Gecko may not be that big, like goat or cow, so, you will need to be precise while slicing. Take care of bones as they should be separated from steak meat.</li>
<li>**The Internal organs.**The internal organs such as lungs, heart, kidneys and intestines. Organs like heart and kidneys are very small and may not be substantial to eat. Intestines need to be cleaned thoroughly before boiling them to kill any bacteria that may be in the digestive track. Care should be put into place when handling the liver not to damage the gall bladder (it contains the bile juice, which may poison the meat).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>**The Bones.**Bones can be boiled to form marrowbone soup which when added some spices becomes very delicious. Before boiling, the bone skin (limb bones) must be removed as well as cleaning thoroughly the toe-webbed skin  the skin houses a lot of bacteria and pathogens which lead to food poisoning. You can pass the limbs over the fire (grill) to dry the skin fully before boiling.
Nevertheless, you should not eat any of these parts of Wall Gecko:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>**The skin.**Ensure to dissect the Wall Geckos skin perfectly well to detach it with body meat completely. This prevents the meat from being contaminated with the pathogens and bacteria that may be housed in the skin. Never eat the Wall Geckos skin since the salmonella bacteria found in it will be transfer with the meat to your digestive track causing food poisoning. Moreover, the bacteria and pathogens on the skin multiply very fast.</li>
<li>**The mouthpart.**The mouth of Wall Gecko is known to house variety of pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella. These bacteria hide in the teeth gaps, under the tongues, in the air sack region, on the palate and even along the throat. Normally, these bacteria cause infections when lizards bite you. When killing the Wall Gecko, it is advisable to get rid of the mouthpart completely or heat-treat it with high temperature (above 110 degree centigrade) to eliminate any living bacteria or pathogens.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>**The Toes.**The toes of Wall Gecko are partially webbed. The tip of the toes have crawls that provides a suitable hideout of bacteria and pathogens. It is difficult to remove these bacteria due to the coiling of the crawls. It is therefore necessary to cut of these sections. In case you must feed on them, carry out thorough cleaning and heat treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-how-to-cook-wall-gecko">2. How to cook Wall gecko.</h2>
<p>Before you cook meat from a Wall Gecko, ensure that you clean it with warm water thoroughly to remove any contamination that may come from the skin. The body meat should be slice into sizable piece that can be handled using a fork.</p>
<p>You can roast, boil or fry the body meat from the Wall Gecko. Do not overcook when boiling (5 to15 minutes are enough) since the meat breaks easily into watery soup.</p>
<p>The Wall Gecko body meat is best when fried or roasted at a lower temperature (lesser than boiling temperature).</p>
<p>Before boiling the Wall Gecko bones for soup, it is important to preheat them (steam or fry slightly) to kill any bacteria or pathogens that may get into soup. Ensure that you spice your soup to make it more delicious.</p>
<h3 id="3-poisonous-parts-of-wall-gecko">3. Poisonous parts of wall gecko</h3>
<p>The skin and the mouthpart of the Wall Gecko are poisonous. They house pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which multiply rapidly and cause food poisoning when eaten. The Skin contain scales that offers options for bacteria hideouts.</p>
<p>The mouth provides optimal environment for growth and multiplication of bacteria such as salmonella and other pathogens. These microorganisms hide under the tongue, in the teeth gaps, on the palate and throat too. They cause food poisoning and infection in case you are bitten.</p>
<p>The toes of Wall Gecko have short curved crawls at the tip. These parts house and incubate the disease causing pathogens and bacteria.</p>
<h3 id="4-precautions-when-eating-gecko">4. Precautions when eating Gecko**.**</h3>
<p>In case you would like to eat your Walk Gecko, it is necessary to observe the following precaution as a way of preventing food poisoning that may occur.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your Wall Gecko thoroughly with hot water after killing it (to remove and kill bacteria and pathogens). You can crap off the scale using a knife or any sharp object.</li>
<li>Clean the body meat thoroughly after slaughtering your Wall Gecko to remove any trace of germs or bacteria.</li>
<li>When slaughtering your Wall Gecko, check keenly on the gall bladder to prevent it from rapturing/damage (the bile juice will poison the meat making it unsuitable for human consumption).</li>
<li>Remove webbed toes of the Wall Gecko carefully and throw them away.</li>
<li>Never eat the mouthpart of the Wall Gecko  it contains pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which cause food poisoning. Throw away the mouthpart.</li>
<li>You can involve the veterinary to check the health status of the Wall Gecko before eating.</li>
<li>Burry the leftovers of the Wall Gecko meat or grind them into soft powder. It is not good to give your dog or cats plan bones from the Wall Lizards. The bones are sharp and when swallowed affect their digestive track.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-do-you-keep-wall-gecko-as-pet"><strong>How Do You Keep Wall Gecko As Pet?�</strong></h2>
<p>Wall Gecko are cold-blooded (ectotherms) reptiles and thus need special care. As a Pet, Wall Gecko needs a cage that is well aerated and spacious. Access to water and food without strain is important. You can use bowls and shall water cans which the Wall Gecko cannot tend to swim in.</p>
<p>Provide a warm pod where your Pet Wall Gecko can swim in at will. Normally, Wall Gecko will walk or run on water unlike other species of lizards such as Marine Iguanas and Komodo dragon.</p>
<p>Wall Gecko loves climbing on walls and branches, try piles stones in the cage and cross some branches (you can place some logs) to offer alternatives for climbing.</p>
<p>Ensure you warm the cage during the night to keep your pet active in case your cage is under a roof where there is no direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Wall Geckos can easily climb out of the roof, kindly ensure that you place some stop barriers such as extended flat tops.�Feed your Wall Gecko, just like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-leopard-gecko-eat/">leopard geckos</a>
, 2 to 3 times in a day. This will make it active and friendlier always.</p>
<p>Carnivores such as cats and dogs can feed on the Wall Gecko. Ensure you keep such pets away from the cage where your pet Wall Gecko is housed. Moreover, wall gecko may have some of the infectious pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which can infect your humans and other pets.</p>
<p>Make sure that you seek frequent medical checkup from your veterinary to ensure that your Wall Gecko pet is healthy always.�Do not overfeed you Wall Gecko as this may cause it to generate unusual obesity, which may lead to locomotion problems or get inactive.</p>
<h2 id="which-animals-can-eat-wall-gecko">Which Animals Can Eat Wall Gecko?</h2>
<p>Wall Gecko is highly hunt due to its edibility and defenseless lifestyle. The reptile rarely fight back. Instead, it escapes by running away. Though Wall Gecko can bite in case it lacks refuge, the bite isnt intense.</p>
<p>However, these bites are infectious since the mouth of Wall Gecko is habited with numerous pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella.</p>
<p>Apart from human beings who hunt them from meat, Wall Gecko are eaten carnivores such as cats, dogs, crocodiles, snakes and large lizards such as Komodo dragons and Breaded lizards as flesh.</p>
<p>These carnivores swallow the Wall Gecko alive while others may slice it before feeding. Wall Gecko does not poison the carnivores. There is no case that has been reported of an animal that died after feeing on Wall Gecko.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wall Geckos are safe and harmless reptiles whose meat does not poison either human beings or carnivores. The meat do not contain toxins that may lead to food poisoning.</p>
<p>However, the skin and mouthpart of Wall Gecko contain pathogens and harmful bacteria, which may cause food poisoning and therefore should not be eaten. Proper care and precautions should be taken when preparing a Wall Gecko meat for a meal.</p>

      <description>Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria of the genus</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria of the genus
<em>Leptospira</em>
. This disease can affect both humans and animals, and it is often contracted through contact with contaminated water, soil, or animal urine. It is considered a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted between animals and humans. In this article, we will explore the symptoms of leptospirosis, how the disease is transmitted, and its treatment and prevention methods.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-leptospirosis">What is Leptospirosis?</h3>
<p>Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that can cause a wide range of symptoms in humans, from mild flu-like symptoms to severe illness. It is caused by bacteria from the
<em>Leptospira</em>
genus, which are typically found in the urine of infected animals, including rodents, livestock, and wildlife. Humans can contract the disease by coming into direct contact with infected animal urine or with contaminated water, soil, or surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-leptospirosis-transmitted">How is Leptospirosis Transmitted?</h3>
<p>The primary mode of transmission for leptospirosis is through contact with water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals. This is particularly common in areas with poor sanitation and high populations of animals that carry the bacteria, such as rodents and livestock. Humans can also be exposed to leptospirosis by handling animals that are infected with the bacteria, such as livestock or pets.
In rare cases, leptospirosis can also be transmitted through broken skin or mucous membranes that come into contact with contaminated water or surfaces. Additionally, leptospirosis can be contracted through ingestion of contaminated water or food. The bacteria can survive for a period of time in warm, stagnant water and mud, making outdoor activities in areas such as rivers, lakes, and flood zones risky for transmission.</p>
<h3 id="symptoms-of-leptospirosis">Symptoms of Leptospirosis</h3>
<p>The symptoms of leptospirosis can range from mild to severe, and they often appear within 2 to 30 days after exposure to the bacteria. In the early stages, symptoms may be nonspecific and resemble those of other viral or bacterial infections. The most common symptoms of leptospirosis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever and chills</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Muscle aches, particularly in the calves and lower back</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Red eyes</li>
<li>Rash
As the disease progresses, leptospirosis can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. These may include:</li>
<li>Liver damage, leading to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>
<li>Kidney failure</li>
<li>Respiratory distress or pneumonia</li>
<li>Bleeding or clotting disorders</li>
<li>Meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord)
If left untreated, leptospirosis can lead to serious complications and, in some cases, can be fatal. It is important to seek medical attention as soon as symptoms appear, particularly if you have been in an area where you may have been exposed to contaminated water or animal urine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="diagnosis-of-leptospirosis">Diagnosis of Leptospirosis</h3>
<p>Diagnosing leptospirosis can be challenging because its symptoms are similar to those of other infectious diseases. A healthcare provider will typically start by taking a detailed medical history and asking about potential exposure to contaminated water or animals. Blood tests, urine tests, and other diagnostic methods are often used to confirm the presence of
<em>Leptospira</em>
bacteria.
In some cases, additional tests such as imaging studies or liver and kidney function tests may be needed to determine the extent of the infection and monitor for complications. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment, as leptospirosis can worsen quickly if not addressed promptly.</p>
<h3 id="treatment-of-leptospirosis">Treatment of Leptospirosis</h3>
<p>Leptospirosis is typically treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or penicillin. These medications can help to reduce the severity of the infection and prevent complications, particularly if administered early in the course of the disease. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary for intravenous antibiotics and supportive care, such as fluids and electrolytes to manage dehydration, liver and kidney function, and respiratory support.
If complications such as kidney failure or liver damage occur, additional treatments such as dialysis or liver transplant may be required. It is important to follow the prescribed treatment regimen and attend follow-up appointments to ensure that the infection has been fully cleared from the body.</p>
<h3 id="prevention-of-leptospirosis">Prevention of Leptospirosis</h3>
<p>Preventing leptospirosis involves reducing the risk of exposure to contaminated water and animal urine. Here are some key prevention measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid swimming or wading in floodwaters or stagnant water, particularly in areas known to have high populations of rats, livestock, or wildlife.</li>
<li>Wear protective clothing, such as gloves and rubber boots, when handling animals, particularly in areas where leptospirosis is common.</li>
<li>Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when working in environments where you may come into contact with contaminated soil, water, or animal urine.</li>
<li>Ensure proper sanitation and waste management to prevent contamination of water sources by animal urine.</li>
<li>If you live in or are traveling to an area with a high risk of leptospirosis, consider vaccination for livestock or pets, and practice good hygiene to reduce exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Leptospirosis is a potentially serious bacterial infection that can lead to a range of symptoms, from mild flu-like illness to life-threatening complications such as liver or kidney failure. It is typically contracted through contact with contaminated water or animal urine. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are essential for managing the disease and preventing long-term health issues.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/types-of-microphones/">Microphone</a> polar patterns refer to the sensitivity of a microphone to sound from different directions. These patterns define how a microphone picks up sound from various angles, and they play a crucial role in determining how and where the microphone should be placed in different environments. Understanding microphone polar patterns is essential for both recording engineers and performers to ensure optimal sound capture. In this guide, we will explore the different types of polar patterns, how they work, and their applications in various audio scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-microphone-polar-patterns">What are Microphone Polar Patterns?</h3>
<p>Microphone polar patterns describe the directionality of a microphonehow it picks up sound from different angles around it. Polar patterns are typically depicted as a graph, with the microphones position at the center. The graph shows the microphones sensitivity to sound from different directions. A microphone with a tight polar pattern will pick up sound from a narrower range of angles, while a microphone with a broader polar pattern will capture sound from a wider range.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-microphone-polar-patterns">Types of Microphone Polar Patterns</h3>
<p>There are several different types of microphone polar patterns, each suited to particular recording or sound capture needs. The most common microphone polar patterns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Omnidirectional:**An omnidirectional microphone picks up sound equally from all directions (360 degrees around the microphone). This pattern is ideal for capturing ambient sound or when you want to record a rooms overall sound, as it doesnt favor any particular direction.</li>
<li>**Cardioid:**A cardioid microphone has a heart-shaped pattern and picks up sound primarily from the front while rejecting sound from the sides and rear. This pattern is commonly used for solo recording or live sound situations where you want to capture sound from the performer and avoid background noise.</li>
<li>**Supercardioid:**A supercardioid microphone is similar to the cardioid pattern but with a more focused front pickup and slightly more sensitivity from the rear. This pattern is useful when you need to isolate a sound source even further while still capturing some room ambiance.</li>
<li>**Hypercardioid:**The hypercardioid pattern is even more directional than the supercardioid, providing a tighter front pickup and further rejecting sound from the sides and rear. This pattern is often used in professional recording or in environments where background noise must be minimized.</li>
<li>**Bidirectional (Figure-8):**A bidirectional microphone, or figure-8 pattern, picks up sound equally from the front and rear while rejecting sound from the sides. This pattern is often used in interviews, where two people sit facing each other, or for capturing sound sources from two opposing directions.</li>
<li>**Shotgun:**Shotgun microphones have an extremely narrow pickup pattern and are designed to capture sound from a specific direction while rejecting all other noise. These microphones are often used in film and television production, where capturing sound from a distance without picking up surrounding noise is essential.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-the-applications-of-microphone-polar-patterns">Understanding the Applications of Microphone Polar Patterns</h3>
<p>Each microphone polar pattern has its ideal use case, depending on the environment and the type of sound you wish to capture. Understanding these applications is essential for choosing the right microphone for your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Omnidirectional:**Best used for capturing ambient sounds, recordings in controlled environments like studios, or capturing multiple sound sources simultaneously, such as a group of people in a conference room.</li>
<li>**Cardioid:**Ideal for solo performances, podcasts, or capturing vocals in a recording studio. Cardioid microphones are often used in live sound settings as well, where feedback rejection and isolation are important.</li>
<li>**Supercardioid and Hypercardioid:**These patterns are useful when you need a more focused pickup from the front and want to avoid noise from the sides and rear. They are commonly used for live sound, interviews, and television broadcasts.</li>
<li>**Bidirectional (Figure-8):**Perfect for recording dialogue in interviews, podcasts, or capturing sound sources from two opposite directions, such as when recording a duet or a conversation between two people.</li>
<li>**Shotgun:**Shotgun microphones are often used in film production, sports events, and television broadcasts, where capturing a specific sound source at a distance is necessary without interference from background noise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="choosing-the-right-microphone-polar-pattern">Choosing the Right Microphone Polar Pattern</h3>
<p>When selecting a microphone, understanding the polar pattern is critical for achieving the desired sound quality. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a microphone:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Environment:**Consider where you will be using the microphone. For example, if youre recording in a studio, interviewing someone, or capturing distant sounds outdoors, the environment will influence your choice of polar pattern.</li>
<li>**Sound Isolation:**If you need to isolate a specific sound source and reject unwanted noise, a more directional microphone (such as cardioid or hypercardioid) will be better suited for the job.</li>
<li>**Multiple Sound Sources:**If you are capturing a group of people or ambient sound, an omnidirectional microphone will be better as it can pick up sound equally from all directions.</li>
<li>**Portability:**If you need a microphone for outdoor or on-the-go recording, shotgun microphones are ideal for capturing distant sound without picking up too much background noise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Microphone polar patterns play a significant role in how sound is captured, making it essential to choose the right one for your specific recording needs. Understanding the different patternsomnidirectional, cardioid, supercardioid, hypercardioid, bidirectional, and shotgunwill help you make informed decisions when selecting microphones for various applications. Whether youre recording in a studio, interviewing someone, or capturing distant sounds on a film set, choosing the correct microphone polar pattern will ensure that you capture the best possible sound for your project.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its common for homeowners to confuse <a href="/posts/mold-cleanup/">mold</a> vs. <a href="/posts/mildew-resistant-paints/">mildew</a> - check below for mold vs. mildew. Although both are fungus, they exhibit certain distinct features that can be used to distinguish them.
Correct identification allows you to embark on accurate treatment measures. Ive featured some important features which you can use to differentiate between mold and mildew.
Although mold and
<a href="https://extension2.missouri.edu/gh5928">mildew</a>
bear numerous similarities, they exhibit notable differences that can distinguish them.</p>
<h2 id="mold-vs-mildew---what-are-the-differences">Mold Vs. Mildew - What Are The Differences?</h2>
<h3 id="1-appearance"><strong>1. Appearance</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mold:</strong>
Molds grow on damp surfaces as colonies of irregularly shaped patches. They can be seen on walls, floors, wallpapers, carpet, and wood, among other surfaces.</p>
<p>Depending on the species, the color of mold ranges from black, brown, green, blue, gray, yellow, or white.
<strong>Mildew:</strong>
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fungicide-powdery-mildew/">Mildew appears as a powdery</a>
(check fungicide killers) and flattened patch, usually yellowish, gray, or white. With time the color turns to brown and eventually black.</p>
<h3 id="2-smell--mold-vs-mildew">2. Smell -�Mold Vs. Mildew</h3>
<p><strong>Mold:</strong>
Molds have a musty and tangy smell that can spread to every corner of your home through the spores.
The smell comes from the mold growth process, which releases microbial compounds into the air.
<strong>Mildew:</strong>
Mildew exhibits a foul and pungent odor that lingers around as long as theres mildew in the house.
This smell results from mildew growth, which produces gases and releases them into the surrounding air.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCq6J-FpziA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCq6J-FpziA</a></p>
<h3 id="3-where-do-they-grow"><strong>3. Where do They Grow?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mold:</strong>
Mold is both an indoor and outdoor fungi. Outside the house, mold grows on moist surfaces such as on soil, dust, walls, water pipes, etc.
Mold gets indoors through open spaces or by attaching itself to your body, pets, or items you bring home.
When mold gets indoors, it thrives in moist surfaces such as condenser ducts, under the sink, upholstery, walls, ceiling, paper, etc. If not treated, mold can disfigure surfaces or lead to structural damage.
<strong>Mildew:</strong>
Mildew grows on damps surfaces, especially in the kitchen, bathroom, basement, and upholstery. Spores from mildew can also attach themselves to plants, whether indoors and outdoors.
Plants are susceptible to mildew, especially during warm and humid conditions. Mildew spreads rapidly and may eventually take over the plant. If not treated, it can damage the plant or kill it completely.</p>
<h3 id="4-effects-on-human-health"><strong>4. Effects on Human Health</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mold:</strong>
Inhaling too many mold spores can lead to several health complications.
Depending on the species, you might get respiratory problems, allergic reactions, asthma attacks, migraines, fatigue, and inflammation, and so on.
Black molds contain mycotoxins, which are associated with long-term health complications.
<strong>Mildew:</strong>
Inhaling mildew spores may result in health complications such as respiratory infections, coughing, headache, etc. However, complications caused by mildew are less serious than those caused by mold.

<h2 id="mold-and-mildew-testing"><strong>Mold and Mildew Testing</strong></h2>
<p>You cannot see mold or mildew until it reaches a point where it visible to your eyes. In that case, you can differentiate between the two types of fungi.
Sometimes, mold and mildew can originate from hidden crevices where it continues to grow and reproduce through spores.
That means the surrounding air will be concentrated with spores, which cannot be seen with naked eyes.
Once in the air, these spores are known to cause allergic symptoms, which can sometimes lead to serious medical conditions.
For this reason, households should be regularly tested for these fungi even if therere no signs of them.
Early discovery enables you to remove the mold or mildew before it spreads to the rest of the house. Below is a guide for testing mold and mildew.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-tests-for-mold-and-mildew"><strong>Types of Tests for Mold and Mildew</strong></h2>
<p>Therere three types of tests you can use to check the presence of mold or mild dew in your house.
Its advisable to use the three methods to get accurate results. They include:</p>
<h3 id="1-air-testing"><strong>1. Air Testing</strong></h3>
<p>This is one of the surest ways of detecting the presence of mold or mildew. In this test, air samples are collected and taken to a lab for inspection.</p>
<ul>
<li>Air testing allows you to detect a mold problem before physically locating it.</li>
<li>Analysis of the results can tell the concentration of spores in the air and the threat it poses to your family.
Air testing can also be done after cleaning to check whether the mold or mildew spores have been reduced to an acceptable level.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-surface-testing"><strong>2. Surface Testing</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes mold and mildew can be confused with dirt that accumulates on surfaces.
In that case, surface testing can be used to differentiate normal dirt from mold growth.
In this test, samples of the suspected mold are taken using tape, a swab, or any other possible method.
These samples can be analyzed using a DIY test kit or taken to a lab. A simple test can be done at home to check whether the suspected substance is dirt or mold.
In this test, a small amount of house bleach is dabbed on the suspected mold growth. If theres any mold growth, the blackened area will lighten up after two or three minutes.</p>
<h3 id="3-culture-test"><strong>3. Culture Test</strong></h3>
<p>The test kits you get online are only meant to detect mold or mildew growth without identifying the species.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, with a culture test, it is possible to know which species of mold or mildew youre dealing with.</li>
<li>A sample of live mold particles is collected from your home and grown in a lab in a culture test.
The aim is to grow the mold into a large colony to facilitate its identification.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-mold-and-mildew"><strong>How to Clean Mold and Mildew</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-mildew">1. Mildew</h3>
<p>Mildew can effectively be cleaned from surfaces using a scrubbing brush and an appropriate cleaning agent.
Thats because it doesnt penetrate surfaces, as in the case of mold. However, mold is more difficult to remove because it tends to stretch its microscopic filaments into surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="2-mold">2. Mold</h3>
<p>Mold removal ought to be done with care to avoid spreading the spores to other house areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thats why its usually recommended to seek professional help when you have a mold problem.</li>
<li>If youre dealing with a small mold or mildew problem, you can clean it yourself.
Before you begin the cleaning process, ensure you wear a protective face mask to dont inhale spores or fungicide fumes.
Also, wear gloves to prevent the effects of fungi and fungicide on your hands. Below is a guide for removing mold from your home.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw4o4a7XZj4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw4o4a7XZj4</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Mold and mildew affect both structures and peoples health. They produce spores that spread rapidly through the air.</p>
<ul>
<li>If left untreated, these fungi eventually get to any corner of the house with moisture and warmth.</li>
<li>A minor mold or mildew growth can effectively be removed using readily available fungicides or disinfectants.
However, a full-blown mold or mildew problem might require an expert to help in removal.</li>

<li>**Apply Primer (if required):**Some non-skid paints require a primer, so check the manufacturers instructions. Apply the primer evenly and let it dry completely before moving on to the paint application.</li>
<li>**Apply the Non-Skid Paint:**Use a brush, roller, or sprayer to apply the non-skid paint. Apply multiple thin coats to ensure an even and consistent finish. Allow each coat to dry before applying the next one.</li>
<li>**Let the Paint Cure:**Once the paint is applied, allow it to cure for the recommended time before using the boat. This ensures the paint has fully set and will provide the best non-skid performance.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tips-for-maintaining-non-skid-paint">Tips for Maintaining Non-Skid Paint</h2>
<p>To ensure that your non-skid paint continues to provide effective traction and durability, follow these maintenance tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Clean Regularly:**Regular cleaning will prevent dirt and debris from accumulating, which can degrade the non-skid surface over time.</li>
<li>**Avoid Harsh Cleaners:**Use mild cleaners to avoid damaging the non-skid texture. Harsh chemicals can wear down the finish.</li>
<li>**Inspect the Surface:**Periodically check the surface for signs of wear or damage. If you notice any significant fading or loss of texture, consider reapplying the non-skid paint.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Non-skid paint is an essential addition to your aluminum boat, ensuring safety and protection from environmental wear. By choosing the right non-skid paint and applying it correctly, you can keep your boat deck safe and in top condition for years to come. Remember to maintain the surface regularly to ensure its long-lasting performance.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transforming a dark room into a bright and inviting space is a common challenge in home decor. The right choice of paint colors can significantly improve the ambiance of any room, making it feel larger, lighter, and more welcoming. If youre struggling with a dark room, consider these paint colors that work wonders in brightening up a space.</p>
<h2 id="best-paint-colors-to-brighten-a-dark-room">Best Paint Colors to Brighten a Dark Room</h2>
<h3 id="1-soft-whites">1. Soft Whites</h3>
<p>One of the most effective ways to brighten a dark room is by painting the walls in soft white shades. White reflects light, making the room feel airy and expansive. Opt for warm whites or off-whites with subtle undertones to avoid a cold or sterile feel. A touch of cream or ivory will add warmth while keeping the space feeling open and fresh.</p>
<h3 id="2-light-gray">2. Light Gray</h3>
<p>If you prefer a neutral shade but want to avoid the starkness of white, light gray is an excellent option. Its a versatile <a href="/posts/what-color-paint-goes-with-beige-tile/">color</a> that reflects light and creates a soft, modern look. Pair light gray with pops of color in the furniture or decor for added vibrancy. For a warmer look, choose a gray with hints of beige or taupe.</p>
<h3 id="3-soft-pastels">3. Soft Pastels</h3>
<p>Pastel colors like pale blue, soft lavender, mint green, and blush pink can help brighten up a dark room without overwhelming it. These hues have a gentle, calming effect and reflect natural light, creating a serene atmosphere. Pastels also pair well with a variety of furniture styles and decor, making them a popular choice for bedrooms and living rooms.</p>
<h3 id="4-pale-yellow">4. Pale Yellow</h3>
<p>Yellow is often associated with warmth and happiness, making it a perfect color to brighten up dark spaces. Pale or buttery yellow shades can mimic the warmth of sunlight, creating a cheerful and inviting atmosphere. Avoid overly bright yellows, as they can overwhelm the room and cause visual fatigue. Opt for soft, muted yellows to maintain a relaxed feel.</p>
<h3 id="5-light-blues-and-aqua">5. Light Blues and Aqua</h3>
<p>Soft blue shades, especially light aqua or seafoam blue, can bring a refreshing and bright feel to a dark room. These colors have a calming, almost ethereal quality that makes the room feel airy and open. Light blues work particularly well in bathrooms, bedrooms, or any room where you want to create a peaceful, relaxed vibe.</p>
<h3 id="6-warm-beige-or-taupe">6. Warm Beige or Taupe</h3>
<p>For a natural, earthy tone that still lightens the room, warm beige or taupe is a great choice. These colors are light enough to brighten up the space, but they also add a cozy, welcoming atmosphere. Beige and taupe are perfect for creating a balanced, neutral backdrop that pairs well with a wide variety of furniture and decor styles.</p>
<h3 id="7-off-white-with-a-hint-of-color">7. Off-White with a Hint of Color</h3>
<p>If you like the look of white but want a bit more depth, consider off-white colors with a hint of a soft pastel, such as pale peach or light lavender. These subtle hues create a gentle, soothing atmosphere and brighten up the room without feeling too harsh or sterile. Its a perfect way to add a touch of color while keeping the room feeling light and airy.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-maximizing-light-in-dark-rooms">Tips for Maximizing Light in Dark Rooms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider using high-gloss or satin finishes, as they reflect more light than matte finishes.</li>
<li>Incorporate mirrors and reflective surfaces into the room to bounce light around and enhance the brightness.</li>
<li>Use sheer or light-colored curtains that allow more natural light to enter the room.</li>
<li>Choose light-colored furniture and decor that complements the wall color and doesnt absorb light.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the lighting in the room; add more light sources such as lamps or overhead lights to brighten up the space further.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By selecting the right <a href="/posts/airless-paint-sprayer-cleaning-solution/">paint</a> colors, you can transform a dark room into a bright, inviting, and energetic space. Soft whites, light grays, pastels, and pale yellows are all excellent choices for brightening up a room and creating a more open feel. In addition to choosing the right paint, consider incorporating mirrors, light-colored furniture, and effective lighting to enhance the brightness of the space. With the right combination of colors and design elements, your dark room can become a beautiful and welcoming environment.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to renovating your kitchen or bathroom, choosing the right finish for your cabinets can be a difficult decision. The two most popular options are painting and staining. Both finishes offer unique advantages, but they also have their downsides. This article will compare painted and stained cabinets to help you make the best decision for your home.</p>
<h2 id="painted-cabinets">Painted Cabinets</h2>
<p>Painted cabinets are a popular choice for homeowners looking to update their kitchen with a fresh, modern look. Painting offers a wide range of colors and finishes, making it easy to match the cabinets with your overall design scheme.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-painted-cabinets">Advantages of Painted Cabinets</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Wide Color Range:**Paint comes in an extensive range of colors, allowing you to choose any shade that complements your kitchen or bathroom decor.</li>
<li>**Uniform Finish:**A painted finish provides a smooth, even coat, hiding any imperfections in the wood grain or surface.</li>
<li>**Easy to Clean:**Painted surfaces tend to be easier to wipe down and keep clean, especially when using a high-gloss or semi-gloss finish.</li>
<li>**Can Create a Modern Look:**If you are aiming for a sleek, contemporary design, painted cabinets can give your kitchen or bathroom a more modern appearance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-of-painted-cabinets">Disadvantages of Painted Cabinets</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Requires Maintenance:**Painted cabinets can chip and scratch more easily than stained cabinets, requiring touch-ups over time.</li>
<li>**Prep Work:**The process of preparing the wood for painting (sanding, priming, etc.) can be time-consuming and may require professional help.</li>
<li>**Longer Dry Time:**Depending on the type of paint used, drying time between coats can extend the project timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stained-cabinets">Stained Cabinets</h2>
<p>Stained cabinets enhance the natural beauty of the wood, highlighting the grain and texture. Staining is a more traditional option, and its especially popular for those looking for a rustic or classic look.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-stained-cabinets">Advantages of Stained Cabinets</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Showcases Wood Grain:**Staining allows the natural beauty and grain of the wood to shine through, giving the cabinets a warm, rich appearance.</li>
<li>**Durability:**Stained cabinets tend to be more durable than painted ones, as the stain soaks into the wood and doesnt easily chip or scratch.</li>
<li>**Fewer Touch-Ups:**Unlike painted cabinets, stained cabinets are less prone to visible damage, meaning they may require fewer touch-ups over time.</li>
<li>**Less Maintenance:**Stained cabinets typically need less maintenance compared to painted ones, making them a better option for high-traffic areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-of-stained-cabinets">Disadvantages of Stained Cabinets</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Limited Color Options:**Unlike paint, stain only comes in a limited range of shades and hues, which may limit your design choices.</li>
<li>**Harder to Change:**If you want to change the color of your cabinets later, its more difficult to do so with stained cabinets. It may require sanding or stripping the wood to achieve a new finish.</li>
<li>**Shows Imperfections:**Staining highlights the natural imperfections in the wood, such as knots and grains, which may not appeal to all homeowners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-one-is-right-for-you">Which One Is Right for You?</h2>
<p>The choice between painted and stained cabinets ultimately depends on your style preferences, maintenance tolerance, and the look you want to achieve in your space. If you love the natural beauty of wood and want a durable, easy-to-maintain finish, stained cabinets might be the better choice. On the other hand, if youre seeking a modern, uniform look with the ability to choose from a variety of colors, painted cabinets might be your ideal option.
Both options have their merits, and the decision should be based on your personal needs, aesthetic preferences, and how much upkeep youre willing to invest in your cabinets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bedbugs are one of the most common household pests, but they are also among the most elusive. They are tiny, reddish-brown insects that feed on the blood of humans and animals. This FAQ page addresses some of the most commonly asked questions about bedbugs and other parasites that could invade your home.</p>
<h3 id="1-what-are-bedbugs">1. What are bedbugs?</h3>
<p>Bedbugs (Cimex lectularius) are small, flat, reddish-brown insects that feed on the blood of humans and animals. They are nocturnal creatures, preferring to hide in cracks and crevices during the day and come out at night to feed. Bedbugs are notorious for their ability to hide and reproduce quickly, making them a difficult pest to control once they infest a home.</p>
<h3 id="2-how-can-i-tell-if-i-have-bedbugs">2. How can I tell if I have bedbugs?</h3>
<p>Signs of a bedbug infestation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red, itchy bites on the skin, especially on exposed areas like the face, neck, and arms.</li>
<li>Small blood stains on your sheets or pillowcases.</li>
<li>Fecal spots on bedding, furniture, or walls, which look like dark spots or stains.</li>
<li>Bedbug shells or exoskeletons that they shed as they grow.</li>
<li>A musty, sweet odor in areas where they are hiding, which comes from their scent glands.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-can-bedbugs-spread-diseases">3. Can bedbugs spread diseases?</h3>
<p>Bedbugs are not known to transmit diseases to humans. While their bites can cause itching, discomfort, and allergic reactions in some individuals, they do not carry or spread diseases like mosquitoes or ticks. However, scratching the bites can lead to secondary bacterial infections if the skin is broken.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-do-bedbugs-spread">4. How do bedbugs spread?</h3>
<p>Bedbugs are great hitchhikers. They spread primarily through the movement of infested furniture, clothing, luggage, and other personal items. You can unknowingly bring bedbugs into your home by staying in infested hotels, using second-hand furniture, or purchasing used clothing from thrift stores.</p>
<h3 id="5-how-can-i-prevent-bedbug-infestations">5. How can I prevent bedbug infestations?</h3>
<p>To prevent bedbug infestations, follow these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examine second-hand furniture, clothing, and other items for signs of bedbugs before bringing them into your home.</li>
<li>When traveling, inspect hotel rooms for signs of bedbugs, and keep your luggage on a luggage rack away from the bed.</li>
<li>Use mattress and box spring encasements designed to trap bedbugs and prevent them from infesting your bedding.</li>
<li>Regularly clean and vacuum your home, especially around bed frames, headboards, and furniture cracks.</li>
<li>If you suspect an infestation, act quickly to prevent it from spreading further.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-how-do-i-get-rid-of-bedbugs">6. How do I get rid of bedbugs?</h3>
<p>Getting rid of bedbugs can be challenging, and often requires professional pest control. However, there are several steps you can take to start the elimination process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash all bedding, clothing, and fabrics in hot water and dry them on the highest heat setting.</li>
<li>Vacuum your home thoroughly, especially around bed frames, furniture, and carpets. Dispose of the vacuum bag immediately.</li>
<li>Use bedbug sprays or insecticides that are labeled for use on bedbugs, but follow the instructions carefully for safety and effectiveness.</li>
<li>Consider using bedbug interceptors under the legs of your bed and furniture to prevent bedbugs from climbing up.</li>
<li>For severe infestations, contact a pest control professional who can use heat treatment, chemical treatment, or fumigation to eliminate the bedbugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-are-there-other-pests-that-look-like-bedbugs">7. Are there other pests that look like bedbugs?</h3>
<p>Yes, several other pests can resemble bedbugs. Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Bat bugs:**These pests are closely related to bedbugs and have a similar appearance. However, bat bugs are typically found in areas where bats roost, such as attics or barns.</li>
<li>**Fleas:**Fleas are also small, reddish-brown insects, but they are typically found on pets and can cause bites that are itchy and swollen.</li>
<li>**Carpet beetles:**Carpet beetles are rounder than bedbugs and have a different feeding behavior, typically eating fabric or wool, rather than blood.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-can-i-get-rid-of-bedbugs-myself-or-do-i-need-professional-help">8. Can I get rid of bedbugs myself, or do I need professional help?</h3>
<p>While there are some DIY methods that may help reduce the number of bedbugs, such as washing fabrics and using heat treatments, bedbugs are notorious for being difficult to eliminate entirely without professional help. If you suspect a bedbug infestation, it is often best to consult with a pest control expert who can evaluate the severity of the problem and recommend effective treatment options.</p>
<h3 id="9-how-much-does-bedbug-treatment-cost">9. How much does bedbug treatment cost?</h3>
<p>The cost of bedbug treatment varies depending on the extent of the infestation, the size of the property, and the methods used. On average, professional bedbug treatments can range from $300 to $1,500, with larger homes or more severe infestations costing more. Be sure to get quotes from multiple pest control companies to find the best deal.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Dealing with bedbugs can be a frustrating and stressful experience, but with the right knowledge and tools, you can successfully eliminate these pests from your home. Prevention is key, so be sure to inspect your home regularly for signs of bedbugs, take steps to avoid introducing them, and act quickly if you suspect an infestation. If necessary, dont hesitate to contact a pest control professional to help you manage the situation.</p>

You can bond with Plumed Basilisks with time though they love having their quiet moments, especially after feeding. �These reptiles have unique personalities that you may not find with other lizards. They are hard to find around but amazing to pet in your home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then threatened, Plumed Basilisk usually run across the water body instead of swimming and hence their nickname Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Plumed Basilisks dont like being handle much and are therefore not recommended for beginner pet owners. They are considered advance lizard of a higher intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="5-crested-geckos">5. Crested Geckos.</h3>
<p>The Crested Geckos (
<em>Correlophus (Rhacodactylus) ciliatus</em>
) are smaller lizards that are characterized by spiny Scales and large eyes that make it look like a small dragon. Though their number is not large, they are very popular due to their cool behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crested Gecko measures 7 to 9 inches when fully grown and can live for 10 to 20 years. These lizards have maintenance cost and thus easier to take care of.</li>
<li>They love running and climbing on the wall (due to their sticky feet) and therefore, you should provide rocks and branches in the cage for them to explore during the night.</li>
<li>Crested Geckos are nocturnal lizards. They love to carry their activities during the night instead of the daylight. Their cage dont necessarily need lighting system.
Crested Geckos are omnivore and will basically feed on insects such as crickets, silkworms and waxworms as well as fruits.</li>
</ul>
<p>These lizards very docile. They often try to jump out when being held at the first time though with time, they would get familiar with the owner.</p>
<p>When stressed or scared, Crested Gecko will drop its tail (defense/protection mechanism) which does not grow back.</p>
<p>Crested Geckos are native to New Caledonia. They inhabit Rain forests canopies are often seen at night jumping from branches.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dragons are mythical serpent like creatures that depict epitome of power according to various communities in the world.</p>
<p>There are various lizards such as Chinese Water Dragons, Bearded Dragons, Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink, Plumed Basilisks, Crested Geckos, Draco Lizard, Green Iguana, Armadillo Lizard and Horned Lizard that resembles dragons. You can keep any as your home pet dragon.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wasps can be a significant nuisance and sometimes pose a danger, especially to those allergic to stings. Preventing and identifying <a href="/posts/baby-wasp/">wasp</a> nests early on can save you a lot of trouble and potential harm. Here&rsquo;s a detailed guide on how to do both effectively.</p>
<h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Seal Entry Points</strong>:- <strong>Check Regularly</strong>: Conduct routine inspections of your home to find and seal potential entry points for wasps. This includes gaps around windows and doors, cracks in walls, and spaces around utility lines.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Caulk and Sealants</strong>: Seal any cracks or holes using high-quality caulk or other appropriate sealants. Ensure window screens and door sweeps are in good repair.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Remove Food Sources</strong>:- <strong>Proper Storage</strong>: Store food in airtight containers. Wasps are particularly attracted to sweet foods, so ensure that these are securely stored.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cleanliness</strong>: Maintain a clean environment by wiping down surfaces and cleaning up spills immediately. Wasps are less likely to linger if there are no food residues.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Properly Store Garbage</strong>:- <strong>Sealed Bins</strong>: Use garbage cans with tight-fitting lids. Wasps are attracted to rotting food and sugary residues found in garbage.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Disposal</strong>: Dispose of trash regularly to avoid<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/baby-wasp/">attracting wasps</a>. Rinse out any recyclable containers that held food or drinks.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Regular Maintenance</strong>:- <strong>Inspections</strong>: Perform regular checks around your home and property for early signs of wasp activity. The earlier you spot potential nests, the easier it is to deal with them.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yard Care</strong>: Keep your yard clean and free of debris where wasps might build nests. Trim bushes and trees regularly.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Plant Wisely</strong>:- <strong>Avoid Attractants</strong>: Avoid planting sweet-smelling flowers and fruit trees near entrances to your home. If you do have these plants, try to keep them away from areas where you spend a lot of time.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repellent Plants</strong>: Consider planting wasp-repellent plants such as eucalyptus, mint, and citronella around your home. These plants can help deter wasps naturally.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Use Wasp Deterrents</strong>:- <strong>Commercial Products</strong>: Use wasp traps and deterrent sprays available in the market. These can be effective in reducing the number of wasps in your vicinity.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>DIY Solutions</strong>: Create homemade wasp traps using sugar water or vinegar traps. These can be placed around your yard to catch and kill wasps.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Visual Inspection</strong>:- <strong>Common Areas</strong>: Look for nests in typical locations such as under eaves, in attics, garages, sheds, or in hollow trees. Wasps prefer sheltered spots that protect them from the elements.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hidden Spots</strong>: Check less obvious places too, like under porch roofs, behind shutters, or in outdoor furniture.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Nest Appearance</strong>:- <strong>Material</strong>: Wasp nests are usually made from chewed wood fibers mixed with saliva, creating a paper-like substance. This gives the nests a distinctive papery texture.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shape and Size</strong>: Nests can vary greatly in shape and size. Some may look like small, open umbrellas, while others may be large and spherical.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Wasps Behavior</strong>:- <strong>Flight Patterns</strong>: Observe the flight patterns of wasps around your home. If you notice wasps frequently flying to and from a specific area, it&rsquo;s likely there is a nest nearby.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggressiveness</strong>: Be cautious if wasps seem particularly aggressive or territorial in certain areas, as this often indicates a nearby nest.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Types of Nests</strong>:- <strong>Paper Wasps</strong>: These nests are typically open and umbrella-shaped, with a single comb of cells visible. They are often found hanging from eaves or branches.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow Jackets</strong>: Yellow jacket nests are usually enclosed and can be found in the ground, wall voids, or attics. These nests can grow quite large.</li>
<li><strong>Hornets</strong>: Hornet nests are typically large, enclosed, and spherical. They are often found in trees, large shrubs, or on structures like sheds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dealing-with-nests">Dealing with Nests</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Early Removal</strong>:- <strong>Small Nests</strong>: If you<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/difference-between-a-bee-and-a-wasps-nest/">catch a nest early</a>, you can often remove it using a stick or a broom. Do this during the early morning or late evening when wasps are less active.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>: Always attempt nest removal during cooler parts of the day, as wasps are less aggressive and slower in lower temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Protective Gear</strong>:- <strong>Wear Protection</strong>: When dealing with larger nests, wear protective clothing to prevent stings. This includes long sleeves, gloves, and a hat with a net.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emergency Plan</strong>: Have an emergency plan in place in case of multiple stings, especially if you or someone in your household is allergic.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Insecticides</strong>:- <strong>Choosing the Right Product</strong>: Use wasp-specific insecticides and follow the manufacturers instructions carefully. There are foaming sprays that can reach nests in high or hard-to-reach places.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: Apply the insecticide during the evening when wasps are in the nest. Ensure you spray the entrance thoroughly to kill wasps as they enter and exit.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Professional Help</strong>:- <strong>When to Call Experts</strong>: For large nests or if you have an allergy to stings, it is best to contact a professional pest control service. Professionals have the experience and equipment to remove nests safely.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety Assurance</strong>: Hiring a professional ensures the job is done safely and effectively, reducing the risk of stings and further infestations.
By following these steps, you can minimize the risk of wasp infestations and handle nests safely and effectively. Regular vigilance and prompt action are key to keeping your home and surroundings wasp-free.</li>

<p>Make sure you have several of these traps in different locations for the best and quick elimination results of mice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use, no complications or special skills are needed.</li>
<li>First, take a though check-up of mice routes and spots they are more active.</li>
<li>Once you take it out of the package, they are ready to set.</li>
<li>Set down the traps along the pathways and location you have identified for mice movements.</li>
<li>Once they step on the traps, they will get stuck.</li>
<li>Afterwards get it and dispose it away far away from your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cheap-and-provides-quick-results">2. Cheap and Provides quick results</h3>
<p>How effective are glue traps for mice? Glue traps are very cheap and readily available; most people can afford to get them from the sellers compared to buying of pesticides to kill them. Note; no trap re-setup and clean up needed.</p>
<p>Once several traps are well placed; you can add some peanut on the trap. The peanut scent will attract the mice.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are fast to monitor pest movements.</li>
<li>Most mice will move near the traps and get stuck due to glue board which holds them tightly.</li>
<li>It will save your time since you wont run all over the place hunting over one mouse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-non-toxic">3. Non-toxic</h3>
<p>Compared to the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-poison-for-mouse/">best mouse poisons</a>
, the glue on the trap surface is not poisonous to pets, human beings and pests trapped too.
The aim of the glue traps is to;</p>
<ul>
<li>To hold the mice once it passes on the surface.</li>
<li>Trapped animals does not die immediately, they suffer only from starvation and dehydration for the days stuck.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-best-for-tight-locations">4. Best for tight locations</h3>
<p>Mice best places are beneath or behind furniture, inside cabinets and closets and enclosed spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take your trap, fold or cut in a way it will fit into tight places.</li>
<li>Place the traps and keep an eye after that to find the stuck mice.</li>
<li>No worries of the mice dying in hidden places and smelling bad since they will remain stuck until you remove them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-easy-to-dispose-the-dead-animals">5. Easy to dispose the dead animals</h3>

<li>Just ensure you put on gloves to prevent yourself from germs of the dead mice.</li>
<li>Wrap them together and throw them away in the garbage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b-the-cons-of-using-glue-traps-for-mice">B) The cons of using glue traps for mice</h2>
<h3 id="1-no-effective-results-in-extremes-temperatures">1. No effective results in extremes temperatures.</h3>
<p>In direct sunlight and extremes temperatures, glue trap wont work well. It will melt out.�So in places with hot temperatures the following will happen;</p>
<ul>
<li>You will have to keep the trap in a flat position flat- this may hinder trapping mice in odd angles places since it will ooze out of the tray.</li>
<li>In direct sunlight, the glue will dry up.</li>
<li>If placed near the flames, hot water heater or gas, they can cause fire because the mouse can drag the trap onto the flames.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-its-a-brutal-act">2. Its a brutal act</h3>
<p>Once a mouse is trapped in a glue trap, the following events will take place;�The mouse suffers from starvation and suffocation for the days its stuck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mostly it may try to flee itself hence getting more injuries to its body parts. Most people consider this to be very inhuman.</li>
<li>The mouse trapped does not die immediately; it suffers for a long period and struggles a lot.</li>
<li>The mouse may panic and die from heart attack.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-pets-and-children-can-get-stuck">3. Pets and children can get stuck</h3>
<p>Sometimes pets and small children can get stuck to the trap causing injuries to them. Once they are trapped, it will take your time and energy trying to remove them unhurt; the following procedure will be needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take some cooking oil.</li>
<li>Pour the oil on the glue trap at the points where the animal is held.</li>
<li>Then massage the animals skin to work the oil into glue. This may take some few minutes to work.</li>
<li>Once its free from the trap, take some soap and water to clean it the oil.</li>
<li>For a child skin, carefully pull out the trap from the skin surface.</li>
<li>Apply some cooking oil on the affected place and dab the glue remains.</li>
<li>Allow the oil to stay for some few minutes. Using a dry cloth, rub the skin to remove the softened glue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-any-other-pet-might-get-stuck-on-the-trap-eg-house-pets">4. Any other pet might get stuck on the trap e.g. House pets</h3>
<p>You need to take the trapped animal and dispose it to your garbage.�A small child might get stuck his hand or leg while in the house accidentally.</p>
<ul>
<li>The trap might have been spoilt by heat or moisture hence not meeting the mission.</li>
<li>The trap might have been dislocated by another pet or something from where you had placed it.</li>
<li>Trapped mice might use their own urine and hair to free themselves from the traps.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-easily-damaged-by-dust-and-moisture">5. Easily damaged by dust and moisture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dust and moisture reduces the efficiency of the trap in these ways;</li>
<li>The dust will cover the glue on the trap board hence the glue will be dry and muddy; it will not be able to hold the animal targeted tightly.</li>
<li>The moisture will make the glue unstuck therefore it cannot hold any animal that comes into contact with it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mice will transmit diseases, contaminate food, and damage clothes and other house items. Do it again if necessary, then wash the skin with some water and soap to remove the oil.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires frequent check ups. This can be so boring and tiresome, but frequent check up are necessary because of the following;</li>
<li>Mice can be trapped anytime at any given spot you had placed the traps.</li>

      <description>Whether your home is surrounded by trees or skyscrapers, raccoons are likely a part of the wildlife population in your area.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether your home is surrounded by trees or skyscrapers, raccoons are likely a part of the wildlife population in your area.</p>
<p>Raccoons are some of the most adaptable pests in the Americas, and they can be found in both urban and rural areas in different climates.</p>
<p>We have compiled some interesting facts about these masked bandits that you should know:</p>
<h2 id="general-raccoon-facts">General Raccoon facts</h2>
<p>Raccoons, also known as Procyon lotor, are round, fuzzy animals with grey fur, bushy tails with 5-7 black rings around them, and a black mask of fur covering their eye area.</p>
<p>They have pointy snouts with black noses and dextrous front paws. Raccoons are about the size of small dogs.</p>
<p>A fully grown raccoon is usually about 23 to 37 inches tall and weighs 4 to 23 pounds. Raccoons may look cute and cuddly from far but they can become quite hostile and aggressive when approached.</p>
<h2 id="raccoon-history">Raccoon History</h2>
<p>Raccoons are natively found across North America, but thanks to humans, they can also be found in Japan and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>The first time raccoons were exported to Europe was in the early 1900s to stock fur farms. But, many of the raccoons found ways to escape and founded new populations in the wild which have been growing ever since. Today, raccoons are considered to be an invasive species in Europe.</p>
<h2 id="raccoon-intelligence-facts">Raccoon Intelligence Facts</h2>
<p>The first time raccoons made it to Japan was in the 1970s and you will never guess why. During that period, Japanese kids were obsessed with the amine cartoon &lsquo;Rascal the Raccoon&rsquo; which led them to demand raccoons of their own.</p>
<p>At one point, the Japanese were importing more than 1500 raccoons every month. Raccoon intelligence - naturally, most of the raccoons found a way to get back in the wild where they established populations.</p>
<p>Even though Japan banned the import and ownership of raccoons, they have spread to all parts of the country.</p>
<h2 id="raccoon-habitat">Raccoon Habitat</h2>
<p>Traditionally, raccoons live in heavily wooded areas with plenty of trees, vegetation, and water. They make dens in hollow trees or abandoned burrows and can travel for long distances in search of food.</p>
<p>Raccoons are highly adaptable, and they can be found in urban and suburban areas living in man-made structures such as sewers, garbage bins, barns, sheds, attics, and basements.</p>
<p>Diet</p>
<p>In urban and suburban areas where fresh vegetation and wildlife are limited, they&rsquo;re more likely to eat human food which they usually look for in trashcans.</p>
<p>Raccoons are omnivorous with an opportunistic diet; they eat almost anything they find. If you have a bird feeder or you feed your pets outside, they&rsquo;ll likely steal that too.</p>
<p>Diseases</p>
<p>Raccoons can spread various diseases to humans or pets by contaminating food or through scratches or bites. Some of these diseases include leptospirosis, roundworm, salmonella, and rabies.</p>
<p>Raccoons are notorious for spreading rabies to pets, so if you see one with excessive foam or drool in their mouth, aggressive and with unusual vocalization, call your local animal control expert immediately.</p>
<p>Other Raccoon facts</p>
<ol>
<li>They have unique hands - raccoons are known for having some of the most dextrous paws in nature.</li>
</ol>
<p>This explains why they are able to open doors, latches, jars, and bottles. It also gives them special climbing skills which they use to access food and shelter more efficiently.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Reproduction - raccoons usually reproduce in late winter. They usually give birth to around 6 babies in April or May.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mothers are extremely protective of their babies during their first year which is one of the main reasons why a raccoon would invade your home for shelter.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Activity - raccoons are nocturnal creatures and they are most active at night. While most animals rely on their sight, smell, or sound to hunt for food, raccoons use their sense of touch to find food.</li>
</ol>
<p>Their front paws have about 4 times more sensory receptors compared to the back paws, which allows them to tell apart various objects without even seeing them.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Their iconic black mask - the black mask around raccoons&rsquo; eyes is not meant just to make them look like cute little bandits.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to researchers, the black masks also help them to see more clearly. The dark mask absorbs incoming light which reduces glare that would obstruct their vision.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Life expectancy - raccoons can survive in the wild for 2-3 years and up to 20 years in captivity.</li>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-backyard-trampolines/">best trampoline for your backyard</a>
is never an easy task. Trampolines come in different shapes, sizes, and features.</p>
<p>Most people, especially first time buyers can get overwhelmed in deciding the kind of trampoline to pick. To make the decision easier, I will discuss everything you need to know about Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline.</p>

<h2 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline--details">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline- Details</h2>
<p>When deciding which trampoline shape you want for your family, its important that you consider the size of your backyard, the ideal trampoline location in the backyard, number of children that would play on the trampoline, and your budget.</p>
<p>Both round and rectangular trampolines are good options worth considering. However, depending on your specific circumstances one might serve you better than the other might.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the next section I will provide all the differences and similarities between the two options. Thus, help you decide which between the two suits you best.</p>
<h2 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline--differences">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline  Differences</h2>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-weight-limitation">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Weight Limitation</h3>
<p>When buying a trampoline, its important that you check its weight limitation. You would want to consider the number of children that would use it. Also, remember that adults might join the little ones during the jumps.</p>
<p>If both adults and children will use the trampoline, a rectangular one will be the best choice. Nonetheless, a small family can buy the round trampoline.
<strong>Heres A Rough Weight Limit Estimate For Round Trampolines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The weight limit for a 14 to 16-foot round trampoline is about 250400 pounds</li>
<li>A 12FT round trampoline has an approximate weight limit of between 250300 pounds</li>
<li>A 8FT to 10FT round trampoline can hold about 200250 pounds
**Rectangular Trampoline- Weight Limitation **</li>
<li>All rectangular trampolines will hold about 300FT-450FT pounds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-safety">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Safety</h3>
<p>The rectangular trampoline has a large jumping area that allows you to choose where you want to land. Thus, Landing at the edges might cause injuries with the springs. On the other hand, in a round trampoline the user will only land at the center of the mat. Thus, chances of injuries reduce.</p>
<p>Youll experience a higher bounce in a rectangular trampoline. Hence, if youre a gymnasts or an athlete the rectangular trampoline would be a great choice. It will allow you perform your flips, twirls, and all the tricks you need to practice safely.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, rectangular trampolines might not be the safest for young children. This option encourages higher jumps and dangerous turns that can cause injuries to the little ones. Nonetheless, with adult supervision, a rectangular trampoline would be a great choice.</p>
<p>However, the round trampoline will not give you a higher bounce compared to the rectangular option. The design of the round trampoline doesnt support a higher jump at the edges like in the rectangular option. Thus, all the jumping takes place at the center in the round trampoline.</p>
<p>The low jumping height and the center jump makes round trampoline a safer option for children. Without getting to the edges, children cant come across springs that might hurt them. The low height jump will not allow dangerous maneuvers.</p>

<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-safety-net-enclosure">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Safety Net Enclosure</h3>
<p>Weather you choose a round or rectangular trampoline, the safety of the jumpers should be a priority. Therefore, both of these options must have a safety net enclosure system.</p>
<p>The net protects the jumpers from falling off the trampoline, thus prevent life threatening injuries.</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-bounce-quality">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Bounce Quality</h3>
<p>Youll agree with me that the bounce quality of a trampoline goes a long way in determining the level of fun and activities a user can do.</p>
<p>Well, between Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline, which gives a better bounce? Ill say a rectangular trampoline gives a better and higher bounce. It has a large surface area that translates to a bigger jumping area.</p>
<p>A jumper can bounce up higher with a lot of ease while on a rectangular trampoline.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a round trampoline delivers a consistent bounce and the jumper remains at the center. Jumps directed towards the edges might not be as powerful compared to the rectangular option. The center jump in round trampolines promotes even weight distribution</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-usage">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Usage</h3>
<p>Most athletes and gymnasts prefer rectangular trampoline for their training. Therefore, if you or your child wants to practice some gymnastics a rectangular option would be a great choice.</p>
<p>A rectangular trampoline delivers higher jumping altitudes and excellent shock absorption.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a round trampoline is ideal for recreational fun at the backyard. Unlike the rectangular options, the round trampolines dont have a higher weight limit. Hence, they are perfect for children and toddlers.</p>
<p>Therefore, think about the usage of your trampoline before doing a purchase. The intended trampoline use will determine the shape you choose.</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-performance">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Performance</h3>
<p>Rectangle trampolines can improve the performance of gymnasts and athletics. The long, spacious, rectangular shape provides a reliable area to perform all the tricks and twirls.</p>
<p>Most professional jumpers have invested in professional-grade rectangular trampolines to enhance their skills. These trampolines can hold over 350lbs and have a huge landing space.</p>
<p>On the other hand, round trampoline have only one landing spot at the center. The weight limit for round trampoline is around 200-300lbs. Hence, they dont meet the exception of most professional athletic training needs. Their bounce is also not as powerful as that of a rectangular trampoline.</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-location">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Location</h3>
<p>Before making a purchase, decide on the ideal trampoline location within your backyard. The available space will play a crucial in deciding between a round trampoline vs. rectangular trampoline.</p>
<p>Round trampolines have a dimension that ranges between 8ft to 15ft while rectangular trampolines can vary from 10ft, 7ft to 10ft.</p>
<p>Both rectangular and circular trampolines may take up more backyard space depending on their sizes. However, Rectangle trampolines may take up more space than round trampolines. The rectangular shaped trampoline will fit perfectly in a corner while round trampoline might need a more centered space to fit the complete round diameter.</p>
<h3 id="rectangular-vs-round-trampoline-price">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Price</h3>
<p>Rectangle trampolines are costly than round trampolines. Rectangle trampolines are expensive to manufacture. They require additional springs, a stronger frame, and a reliable mat that can withstand force from all directions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, round trampolines are strong because of the circular design frame. This design is less costly to manufacture, hence, the lower cost.</p>

<h2 id="caresheet-for-your-red-eyed-crocodile-skink">Caresheet for Your Red Eyed Crocodile Skink</h2>
<h3 id="1-housing">1. Housing</h3>
<p>The Red-eyed croc skinks are mainly found in New Guinea and other locations with cool and moist weather. These creatures will climb onto the low-lying decor and branches but they aren&rsquo;t huge climbers.
Therefore, on space, Red-eyed croc skinks value floor space more compared to the height in their enclosure. So, get an enclosure or tank that is roughly 18&quot; by 18&quot; or 30&quot; by 12&quot;.
For instance, check the �Zilla&rsquo;s 200-long� or the Exo Terra&rsquo;s Small as they&rsquo;ll give the reptile a great housing space. The croc skinks will live best as a male and a female or just singly. Females will be territorial and defensive when places together while males tend to fight.
You should keep the croc skinks in tanks or locations that have high humidity - and you may require to use some moss covering such as the New Zealand sphagnum. These help in holding moisture while also increasing the spaces&rsquo; humidity.
Further, such as an environment with foliage cover that is low lying (plus taller foliage) offers great hiding spots and increases the creatures&rsquo; comfort - check the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6356264/">Welfare Assessment Method</a>
.
Some live-planted enclosures may also work while hiding places such as Exo-terra hanging plants, Exo terra fern, or Exo terra rock hides give suitable places for ducking into.</p>
<h3 id="2-temperament">2. Temperament</h3>
<p>Croc skinks don&rsquo;t like being handled - you&rsquo;ll notice that they&rsquo;ll be quiet and stiff when held in the hands. This shows that they&rsquo;re looking for an opportunity to escape to safety - as they&rsquo;re not happy when held.
But you can handle the Croc skinks, although not regularly, you must give them the right environment - such as holding the reptiles during the daylight hours - this is particularly so if this coincides with the reptiles feeding or eating time.</p>
<h3 id="3temperatures--lighting">3.�Temperatures &amp; Lighting</h3>
<p>The Croc skinks love temperatures that are humid and cool - but they&rsquo;ll also rely on thermoregulation for body-temperature control.
Thus, you&rsquo;ll need to offer a cool and hot side in the reptile&rsquo;s enclosure (for these
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540286/">Ptyodactylus)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>place cool elements on one side and then the heat elements on the opposite side.
Ensure that the warm-side temperature must not be over 82 degrees - you can increase the enclosure temperature using either the Zoo-Med heat pad or Exo terra that can be placed underneath that enclosure.
Make sure that the other parts of the tank or enclosure are maintained at about 72 to 75-degree. When temperatures drop at night (to about 70 degrees), use quality temperature gauges such as the Exo Terras Thermometer.
For lig
hting, utilize the Exo-Terras light (LED-type), as this will assist in illuminating the housing, tank, or enclosure - and they won&rsquo;t add heat - and since these reptiles are nocturnal - they won&rsquo;t require UVB lighting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-feeding">4. Feeding</h3>
<p>The Croc skinks love eating insects - you can give them
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flying-ants-vs-termites/">various feeder bug</a>
types. But the reptiles can also be given pinky mice occasionally.
Further, you can use the Exo-terras dish to feed the Croc skinks with worms - therefore, the worms won&rsquo;t burrow into that su
bstrate prior to getting eaten by Croc skinks.
Ensure to offer the Croc skinks with the required food - this may include providing appropriate calcium with D3. among other calcium supplements.</p>
<h3 id="5-humidity">5. Humidity</h3>
<p>Provide the reptiles with an average-sized water dish having fresh water - but don&rsquo;t get a very deep one; I recommend getting some non-porous bowls (naturalistic) such as the Flukers-rock dish or the Exo-Terra bowls.
Also, ensure daily changing of the water - particularly if the lizard is fond of kick-bedding in the water. Do once-weekly scrubbing of the bowls as this will hinder bacteria build-up.
For these aquatic Croc skinks, you may make the tank or enclosure to be half water and half land. Thes creatures love a 80 to 95% humidity - particularly in the wild.
To achive and mainatin such a high humidity, ypou may need to hoise some plexiglass or towel over a section of the screen - but also mainatin fresh aeration.
You may mist the Croc skinks&rsquo; ensosure a few times daily - to achiecve excelent moisture - but also use a humidty -gauge while using misters such as the Zoo-Med0-fogger or Exo-Terra-monsoon automatic mister.</p>
<h2 id="red-eyed-crocodile-skink-care">Red Eyed Crocodile Skink Care</h2>
<p>There are several elements that make up good red-eyed crocodile skink husbandry. The first one is the enclosure.
The enclosure should be a 10-gallon aquarium or any other tank but of a similar size. A 10-gallon tank can host two skinks but you should ensure the screen type allows maximum ventilation.
Do not put two male lizards together or else they will fight to the death.� These lizards are not tree dwellers but they do have excellent climbing skills so also consider this when choosing an enclosure.
Enclosure accessories are the next element. You can make use of fake plants but just know that this is not positive for humidity. You can just go for natural plants but just ensure that they are herbicide-free.
Foliage and shrubbery will do because they offer protection and volume inside the enclosure. Add some rocks and logs so that the lizards have a place to hide and a place to bask hence promoting thermoregulation and reducing pressure on the animal.
Water is life in the enclosure so ensure that you place it in a shallow dish so that the lizard can walk in and out without drowning. You have to remove the dish if you will be feeding the skinks live crickets.
Crickets will jump inside the dish and drown (Skinks do not eat dead prey). The other element is the temperature. You should always have two thermometers for purpose of having the correct temperature is maintained.
The red-eyed crocodile skink does not like too much heat. If there is a lamp then ensure there is a hedge of protection that stops accidental burns. This should also be done for the basking lights but you can also just raise the lamp from the floor. Temperatures should not go beyond 72 degrees.
Everyone has an opinion about lighting. I have mine too. My skinks are healthy and none of them suffered from metabolic bone disease. I have no UV light, just a compact fluorescent light. The substrate should be appealing and easy to clean. A reptile carpet will do.

<h2 id="how-to-care-for-eggs-and-crocodile-young-ones">How to care for Eggs and Crocodile Young ones</h2>
<p>For the ultimate results in hatching, artificial incubation is recommended. You do this by removing the eggs from where the nest and transfer them, half-buried and slightly ventilated.
The container can be filled with some moist peat moss ( not wet ) but you should be careful not to reposition the egg from its original position. The juveniles must eat every day and their food should be dusted with calcium supplements during every other mealtime.
Water should not be added to the incubation medium unless necessary. An indented egg is dead or dehydrated. Sweating eggs are a common phenomenon but too much of it is a danger signal.
The egg incubation period could last up to 85 days at temperatures of around 73 to 81 degrees. The hatchlings come into the world weighing about 3 to 5 grams and are 6 to 8 centimeters long. They will start searching for food in hours. These wonderful creatures live up to 10 years in captivity.</p>
<h2 id="red-eyed-crocodile-skink-ailments">Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink Ailments</h2>
<p>Very little is known about diseases and parasites that could infect the red-eyed crocodile skink. What is known is that skinks can die suddenly even when healthy.
So you have to check several things when buying one as a pet. Examine it for any parasites. Check to see if it has any wounds or deformities. The eyes should be shiny and bright.
Study their demeanor. These guys are the masters of staying alert. They can play dead, try to run away, or vocalize when handled.
The best step to take is to quarantine the new pet and ensure a fecal exam is done. Deworming comes high on my list. Ensure the skink gets its calcium and vitamin D3.</p>
<h2 id="types-ofred-eyed-crocodile-skink">Types ofRed-Eyed Crocodile skink</h2>
<p>The red-eyed crocodile skink is a type of lizard that hails from the Tribolonotus genus. You will find eight other species in this genus but the red-eyed crocodile skink is the most common.
The scientific name for this lizard is Tribolonotus Gracilis. People started keeping the red-eyed crocodile skink as a pet in the mid-1990s.
They were and are still fascinated by the fact that these lizards are like miniature crocodiles and the only difference is that the skink is so shy. Do not forget why it is called the red-eyed crocodile skink because a red ring encircles its beautiful eyes.
As we had mentioned before, the red-eyed crocodile skink is not the only member of its family. There are eight other types of skink and it is important to know them too.
Out of these eight, only two species can be kept as pets. These are the novaeguineade and Tribolonotus gracilis.
These lizards are commonly found in Irian Jaya, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea.� The other six species that are left to roam the wild are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annectens</li>
<li>Blanchardi</li>
<li>Brongersmai</li>
<li>Pseudoponceleti</li>
<li>Ponceleti</li>
<li>Schmidti

</ul>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-red-eyed-crocodile-skink">Characteristics of Red-Eyed Crocodile skink</h2>
<p>For you to be able to care well for the red-eyed crocodile skink, you will need to know the character it possesses. First and foremost, this skink has stout legs. Its underbelly is as majestic as its eyes, it&rsquo;s cream-colored.
You already know why it is called red-eyed but do you know why the word crocodile is also included? Its scales are curved backward and they have tapered points plus it has four dorsal rows that look like those of a crocodile.
The young ones have the same type of body and skin as that of the adults but their eyes have no reddish/orange scales. The adults have a solid reddish-orange color around their eyes. The red-eyed crocodile lizard can grow up to 10 inches.
They are quiet and shy but are not afraid to vocalize their frustrations when under duress. They will do this when there is a captor around. If this does not work then they will do the old trick of playing dead.
The babies play dead more often than the adults while the entire species will not hesitate to drop their tails when startled.� During mating, both males and females make unique sounds.</p>
<h2 id="red-eyed-crocodile-skink-home">Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink Home</h2>
<p>The T gracilis is a tropical lizard and can withstand high temperatures of 81 degrees and if the temperatures are low then they can be as low as 73 degrees.
These lizards are normally found under the debris of the forest. They dig and create nests. This is usually done near water because these guys cannot go 24 hours without water or else they die.
However, there is a problem of deforestation that has seen their natural habitat destroyed and has led to them creating and adapting to living in coconut plantations. They fit in well with the coconut husks.</p>
<h2 id="red-eyed-crocodile-skink-diet">Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink Diet</h2>
<p>These lizards usually go for grubs, insects, and small worms. You should note that these lizards like their meals alive and fresh plus the food size should be half the size of their head.
The young ones and hatchlings are to eat 2-3 food items once each food item daily while the adults can do with the same portion every other day.
Employ gut loading whereby you feed leafy vegetables to the prey a day or two before feeding it to the skink. This ensures that the prey lives longer.

<h2 id="how-to-breed-your-red-eyed-crocodile-skinks">How to Breed your Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks</h2>
<p>You should note that red-eyed crocodile skinks are violent towards members of their similar sex unless it is a pair and their babies. These can actually live apart in the same enclosure.
Pairs will always be extremely aggressive especially when a baby is on the way.�The red-eyed crocodile skink becomes sexually active from the ages of around 3 and 4 years.
Their throat color turns orange as they approach this age. The males are larger than the females but this is not always the case. Check the underside, male skinks are greyish blue and have raised pores.
The females have two ovaries but only the one on the right functions. The eggs in the left ovary travel from the left side to the right side if they are to stand a chance. The females lay up to six eggs. Each egg is laid and buried. This happens every week for six weeks.
Remember, they are not only shy but secretive. You should condition an adult pair prior to breeding. Let them settle in their new environment. The period of pairing should be from June to September. Feeding is after one day.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Red-Eyed crocodile skink is a wonderful creature that requires gentle hands. They do not bite and no, you can not handle them as a beginner.
They need a good pair of hands but once you keep one, you will love it. There is beauty in their mysterious lifestyle.
I hope this red-eyed crocodile skink care guide has been of great help and now that you are totally informed, your reptile pet-keeping ways are truly reformed.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Removing <a href="/posts/best-concrete-driveway-cleaner/">concrete</a> <a href="/posts/best-penetrating-concrete-sealer/">sealer</a> can be a tough task, especially when you want to restore the original appearance of your concrete surfaces. Muriatic acid is a strong and effective solution for removing concrete sealers, but it must be handled carefully. In this guide, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the process of removing concrete sealer with muriatic acid, ensuring a safe and effective method.</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-removing-concrete-sealer-with-muriatic-acid">Steps for Removing Concrete Sealer with Muriatic Acid</h2>
<h3 id="1-prepare-the-area">1. Prepare the Area</h3>
<p>Before starting, make sure the area is well-ventilated. Open windows and doors if working indoors, or set up fans to direct fumes away from you. Clean the concrete surface by removing any dirt, dust, or debris. This will help the muriatic acid work more effectively and ensure that no dirt interferes with the removal process.</p>
<h3 id="2-dilute-the-muriatic-acid">2. Dilute the Muriatic Acid</h3>
<p>Muriatic acid is highly concentrated, so it must be diluted with water before use. Typically, a 10:1 ratio of water to acid is recommended, but this can vary based on the severity of the sealer and the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. Always add acid to water (not the other way around) to avoid dangerous splashing.</p>
<h3 id="3-apply-the-muriatic-acid-solution">3. Apply the Muriatic Acid Solution</h3>
<p>Once the solution is mixed, apply it to the concrete surface using a plastic sprayer or a mop. Be sure to cover the entire area with a thin, even layer of the solution. Let the acid sit for about 1015 minutes, allowing it to break down the sealer.</p>
<h3 id="4-scrub-the-surface">4. Scrub the Surface</h3>
<p>After the acid has had time to work, use a stiff-bristled brush to scrub the concrete surface. Focus on areas where the sealer is thickest, and use circular motions to help lift the sealer off. If necessary, you can reapply the muriatic acid solution in sections to ensure the sealer is thoroughly removed.</p>
<h3 id="5-rinse-the-area">5. Rinse the Area</h3>
<p>Once the sealer is removed, rinse the concrete surface thoroughly with water. It&rsquo;s important to neutralize any remaining acid to avoid damage to the concrete. You can use a mixture of water and baking soda to neutralize the acid.</p>
<h3 id="6-allow-the-concrete-to-dry">6. Allow the Concrete to Dry</h3>
<p>After rinsing, allow the concrete surface to dry completely before applying any new sealer or coating. This will ensure that the new layer bonds properly to the concrete.</p>
<h3 id="precautions-when-using-muriatic-acid">Precautions When Using Muriatic Acid</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Wear Protective Gear:**Always wear gloves, goggles, and a respirator to protect yourself from fumes and splashes.</li>
<li>**Work in a Well-Ventilated Area:**Muriatic acid fumes can be dangerous, so make sure you&rsquo;re working in an area with plenty of airflow.</li>
<li>**Test a Small Area First:**Always test the muriatic acid solution on a small, inconspicuous area of the concrete before applying it to the entire surface.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using muriatic acid to remove concrete sealer is an effective way to restore your concrete surfaces. By following the proper steps and safety precautions, you can remove the sealer and prepare the concrete for a fresh finish. Remember to always handle muriatic acid with care and work in a well-ventilated area for your safety.</p>

<h3 id="1-long-lasting-finish">1. Long-Lasting Finish</h3>
<p>The urethane formula offers a durable finish that can withstand everyday wear and tear, making it a great option for cabinets that are used frequently. The paint resists chipping, cracking, and fading over time, maintaining the cabinets appearance for years.</p>

<h3 id="3-low-voc-and-low-odor">3. Low VOC and Low Odor</h3>
<p>Emerald Urethane has low levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and minimal odor. This makes it more pleasant to work with, especially in closed spaces like kitchens or bathrooms. The low odor means that you wont have to deal with overwhelming fumes during or after application.</p>
<h3 id="4-quick-drying-and-recoat-time">4. Quick Drying and Recoat Time</h3>
<p>Unlike some other paints that require long drying times, Emerald Urethane dries quickly, allowing you to apply a second coat in as little as 1 to 2 hours. This is a huge advantage for projects that need to be completed in a timely manner.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks-of-using-emerald-urethane">Drawbacks of Using Emerald Urethane</h2>

<ul>
<li>**Benjamin Moore Advance:**Like Emerald Urethane, Benjamin Moore Advance is a popular choice for cabinet painting due to its smooth application and durability. However, Advance has a longer drying time and a stronger odor, which may not be ideal for indoor projects.</li>
<li>**Behr Premium Plus Ultra:**Behrs cabinet paint is more affordable but doesnt provide the same level of durability and smooth finish as Emerald Urethane. It may require more coats for proper coverage.</li>
<li>**Rust-Oleum Cabinet Transformations:**Rust-Oleum offers a popular cabinet transformation kit that includes everything needed for refinishing. While effective, it doesnt have the same sleek finish as Emerald Urethane and can be more labor-intensive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-for-using-sherwin-williams-emerald-urethane-on-cabinets">Tips for Using Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane on Cabinets</h2>
<p>To get the best results when using Emerald Urethane on cabinets, consider these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Properly Prep the Surface:**Clean and sand the cabinets thoroughly before painting. Use a deglosser if needed, especially for glossy or varnished surfaces.</li>
<li>**Apply Thin Coats:**Apply multiple thin coats of paint for the best finish. Avoid thick layers, as this can cause drips and uneven texture.</li>
<li>**Use a High-Quality Brush or Sprayer:**For the smoothest application, use a high-quality brush or sprayer. A foam roller can also work well for larger areas.</li>
<li>**Allow Adequate Drying Time:**Let each coat dry completely before applying the next one. This ensures a solid, durable finish.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<li><strong>Noises</strong>: Scratching or scurrying sounds, especially at night, indicate rodent activity within walls, ceilings, or attics.</li>
<li><strong>Footprints</strong>: In dusty areas, look for rodent tracks or tail marks.</li>

<p>Preventing rodents from entering your home is the most effective way to avoid an infestation. Here are some tips specific to Puyallup:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Seal Entry Points</strong>: Inspect your home for potential entry points, such as gaps around doors, windows, and utility lines. Use steel wool,caulk, or metal sheeting to seal these openings, as rodents can gnaw through less durable materials.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Food Sources</strong>: Keep food in airtight containers and clean up crumbs and spills promptly. Do not leave pet food out overnight.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Clutter</strong>: Rodents thrive in cluttered areas. Keep storage areas organized and dispose of unnecessary items.</li>

<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-ultrasonic-pest-repellers/"><strong>Ultrasonic Repellents</strong></a>: These devices emit high-frequency sounds that are unpleasant to rodents but inaudible to humans and pets.</li>
<li><strong>Cats</strong>: Having a cat can naturally deter rodents from entering your home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chemical-and-mechanical-control-methods">Chemical and Mechanical Control Methods</h2>
<p>When natural methods are insufficient, consider the following control options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traps</strong>: Snap traps, electronic traps, and live traps can be effective for capturing and removing rodents. Place traps along walls and in areas where rodent activity is noticed.</li>
<li><strong>Rodenticides</strong>: Poison baits can be used but should be handled with care, especially in homes with children and pets. Follow all safety instructions and consider professional assistance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-rats-in-puyallup">Dealing with Rats in Puyallup</h2>
<p>Rats can be particularly challenging due to their size and behavior. Here are some additional tips for dealing with rats in Puyallup:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional Inspection</strong>: If you suspect a rat infestation, a professional inspection can identify entry points and nesting sites.</li>
<li><strong>Bait Stations</strong>: Use tamper-resistant bait stations to safely deploy rodenticides in areas where rats are active.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rodent <a href="/posts/rodent-control-in-puyallup/">control</a> is crucial for maintaining a healthy and safe home environment, particularly in Tacoma, WA, where common rodents such as house mice, Norway rats, and roof rats are prevalent.</p>
<p>Here are detailed steps and tips for homeowners in Tacoma to effectively manage rodent issues:</p>
<h3 id="identifying-rodents">Identifying Rodents</h3>
<p>Understanding the specific type of rodent you&rsquo;re dealing with is the first step in effective control. House mice are small, usually gray or brown with large ears and eyes.</p>
<p>Norway rats are larger, with a robust body, blunt nose, and a shorter tail relative to their body length. Roof rats are sleek with a pointed nose, large eyes, and a tail longer than their body.
<strong>Signs of Infestation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Droppings:**Rodent droppings are one of the most obvious signs of an infestation. Mouse droppings are small and pointed, while rat droppings are larger and more capsule-shaped.</li>
<li>**Gnaw Marks:**Rodents need to gnaw to keep their teeth sharp. Look for gnaw marks on food packaging, walls, or other materials.</li>
<li>**Nests:**Rodents build nests from shredded paper, fabric, and other soft materials. Nests are usually hidden in secluded areas.</li>
<li>**Sounds:**Scurrying, squeaking, or scratching noises, particularly at night, can indicate rodent activity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prevention-measures">Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>Preventing rodents from entering your home is critical to avoid infestations. Here are some preventive measures:
<strong>Seal Entry Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect your home thoroughly for any gaps, cracks, or holes, especially around the foundation, walls, and roof. Use materials like steel wool, caulk, or metal mesh to seal these entry points.
<strong>Proper Storage:</strong></li>
<li>Store food in airtight containers to prevent rodents from accessing it. This includes pet food and birdseed.</li>
<li>Keep garbage bins sealed tightly to avoid attracting rodents.
<strong>Maintain Cleanliness:</strong></li>
<li>Regularly clean your home, particularly kitchen areas where food crumbs and spills are common. Ensure floors and countertops are free of food debris.</li>
<li>Reduce clutter in your home and yard to eliminate potential nesting sites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eliminating-rodents">Eliminating Rodents</h3>
<p>If you already have a rodent problem, eliminating them quickly and efficiently is essential:
<strong>Traps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use snap traps, glue traps, or live traps strategically around your home where you suspect rodent activity. Snap traps are effective for killing rodents quickly, while live traps can be used to catch and release them humanely.
<strong>Bait Stations:</strong></li>
<li>Bait stations are useful for controlling larger rodent populations. These<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-rat-poison/">stations</a>contain rodenticides and should be placed in areas inaccessible to children and pets.
<strong>Natural Deterrents:</strong></li>
<li>Substances like peppermint oil used cat litter, or ultrasonic repellents can help deter rodents. However, these methods may not be as effective as traps and bait stations.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring marks a period of increased <a href="/posts/healthy-pets-rodent-control/">rodent</a> activity due to warmer weather and the availability of food and shelter. This season, rodents become more visible and active, which can lead to infestations if preventive measures are not taken.</p>
<h2 id="increased-activity">Increased Activity</h2>
<p>During spring, many rodent species enter their prime breeding season, resulting in a population surge. The abundance of food sources such as plants and insects supports this growth.</p>
<p>Rodents, including mice, rats, and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-yard/">squirrels</a>
, become more active as they search for food and suitable nesting sites.</p>
<h2 id="common-rodents">Common Rodents</h2>
<p>House mice and deer mice are frequently encountered during the spring. These small rodents seek food and shelter in homes, garages, and sheds. Norway rats and roof rats are also common.</p>
<p>Norway rats tend to burrow into the ground, while roof rats prefer to nest in higher locations such as attics and trees. Ground and tree squirrels are more visible as they forage for food and sometimes nest in attics or chimneys.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-infestation">Signs of Infestation</h2>
<p>Identifying a rodent infestation involves looking for specific signs. Droppings are a primary indicator, often found in cabinets,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-pantry-bugs/">pantries</a>
, or along baseboards.</p>
<p>Gnaw marks on wood, wires, or food packaging are also common. Rodents create nests from shredded paper, fabric, or plant material, usually in hidden areas. Additionally, you might hear scratching or scurrying noises in walls, ceilings, or attics, especially at night.</p>
<h2 id="entry-points">Entry Points</h2>
<p>Rodents can enter your home through surprisingly small openings. Common entry points include gaps in walls, doors, windows, and foundations.</p>
<p>Unscreened vents and chimneys offer easy access, as do gaps around pipes and utility lines. Even doors and windows that are not properly sealed can provide entry points for these pests. It&rsquo;s crucial to inspect and seal these potential entry points to prevent rodents from entering your home.</p>
<h2 id="prevention-tips">Prevention Tips</h2>
<p>To prevent rodent infestations, its important to take several proactive measures. Seal all potential entry points using materials like caulk or steel wool to close gaps and holes.</p>
<p>Maintaining cleanliness is essential; keep kitchens and storage areas free of food debris and crumbs. Store food in sealed containers, and ensure pet food is also secured.</p>
<p>Regular yard maintenance can help; trim bushes and trees, keep grass short, and remove any debris that could serve as a hiding spot for rodents. Additionally, use lidded garbage cans and remove trash regularly to deter rodents from foraging near your home.</p>
<h2 id="disease-transmission">Disease Transmission</h2>
<p>Rodents pose significant health risks due to their potential to transmit diseases. Direct contact with rodents or their droppings and urine can spread diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contaminated food and surfaces are another common transmission route, as rodents can leave behind bacteria. Inhaling dust that is contaminated with rodent droppings or urine can also spread diseases.
Some common diseases transmitted by rodents include Hantavirus, Salmonella, Leptospirosis, and Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-infestations">Dealing with Infestations</h2>
<p>If you discover a rodent infestation, there are several methods to address it. Traps are a widely used solution; snap traps, live traps, and glue boards can be effective when placed along walls and in areas with evident rodent activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baits and poisons can also be used, but they must be handled with caution, especially in homes with children or pets. It is crucial to follow all safety instructions when using these products.
For large or persistent infestations, hiring a professional pest control service is advisable to ensure thorough and
effective eradication
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="health-risks">Health Risks</h2>
<p>Rodents are carriers of diseases that can pose serious health risks to humans.</p>
<p>Beyond the diseases they carry, rodent droppings and urine can also trigger allergies and asthma, particularly in sensitive individuals. Managing and preventing rodent infestations is essential to protect the health of your household.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-considerations">Environmental Considerations</h2>
<p>In addition to direct control methods, encouraging natural predators can help manage rodent populations. Birds of prey like owls and natural predators such as snakes can be beneficial.</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing habitats for these predators can help keep rodent numbers in check. Eco-friendly options, such as humane traps and organic repellents, should also be considered as part of an integrated pest management strategy.
Understanding these aspects of rodent behavior in the spring can help you effectively manage and prevent infestations, ensuring a safer and cleaner environment in your home and garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking proactive measures, you can minimize the risks associated with rodent activity and maintain a rodent-free living space.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to preparing metal surfaces for painting, choosing the right <a href="/posts/best-bonding-primer-for-kitchen-cabinets/">primer</a> is crucial for achieving a smooth, long-lasting finish. Two common types of primers are self-etching primer and regular primer.
While both are designed to improve paint adhesion, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. In this article, we will compare self-etching primer vs
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-primer-for-oak-cabinets/">regular primer</a>
to help you determine which one is best for your project.</p>
<h2 id="self-etching-primer-vs-regular-primer-whats-the-difference">Self-Etching Primer vs Regular Primer: Whats the Difference?</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-self-etching-primer">What is Self-Etching Primer?</h3>
<p>Self-etching primer is a specialized type of primer designed specifically for metal surfaces, such as steel or aluminum. It contains acid-based chemicals that &ldquo;etch&rdquo; or roughen the metal surface, providing a better surface for the paint to adhere to.</p>
<p>This type of primer is especially useful for bare metal that may not have a previously painted surface to bond with. Self-etching primers are commonly used in automotive painting and metalworking applications.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-regular-primer">What is Regular Primer?</h3>
<p>Regular primer, also known as standard or universal primer, is a more general-purpose primer that can be used on a variety of surfaces, including wood, drywall, and metal. It is typically oil-based or water-based and helps create a smooth, even surface for paint adhesion.
Regular primer works by sealing porous surfaces and providing a uniform coat to enhance the durability and color of the topcoat. Unlike self-etching primer, it does not contain acids and is not specifically designed for metal surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="key-differences-between-self-etching-primer-and-regular-primer">Key Differences Between Self-Etching Primer and Regular Primer</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Application:**Self-etching primer is designed primarily for metal surfaces, while regular primer is more versatile and can be used on wood, drywall, metal, and other surfaces.</li>
<li>**Adhesion:**Self-etching primer creates a chemical bond with metal, making it ideal for bare metal surfaces. Regular primer works by sealing porous surfaces and promoting better adhesion for paint on various materials.</li>
<li>**Surface Preparation:**Self-etching primer is specifically used when you need to prepare bare metal for painting, especially when the metal is prone to rust. Regular primer is used for a wide range of surface types and is not ideal for bare metal unless a specific metal primer is used.</li>
<li>**Finish:**Self-etching primer provides a smoother finish on metal, while regular primer may require more sanding or surface prep for a smooth, even finish -Galvanized Metal Primer.</li>
<li>**Durability:**Self-etching primer often provides better long-term durability and protection against corrosion, making it ideal for metal surfaces exposed to the elements. Regular primer provides a solid foundation but may not offer the same level of corrosion resistance as self-etching primer on metal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-to-use-self-etching-primer">When to Use Self-Etching Primer</h3>
<p>Self-etching primer is best used in situations where:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are working with bare metal surfaces that need to be prepared for painting.</li>
<li>You need a primer that offers excellent adhesion and corrosion resistance, especially on metals exposed to moisture or outdoor elements.</li>
<li>You are working on automotive, motorcycle, or metalworking projects where you need a durable, long-lasting finish.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-to-use-regular-primer">When to Use Regular Primer</h3>
<p>Regular primer is ideal in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are working with surfaces other than metal, such as wood, drywall, or concrete.</li>
<li>You are applying paint to previously painted or sealed surfaces that do not require the specialized bonding properties of self-etching primer.</li>
<li>You need to create a smooth, uniform surface for painting a variety of materials.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-self-etching-primer">Pros and Cons of Self-Etching Primer</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent adhesion to bare metal surfaces.</li>
<li>Provides corrosion resistance, making it ideal for outdoor or exposed metal surfaces.</li>
<li>Helps create a smoother surface for paint.</li>
<li>Quick-drying and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/should-i-use-water-based-or-silicone-based-primer-in-painting/">easy to apply</a>
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>
<li>Not suitable for non-metal surfaces.</li>
<li>Requires special care when applying to avoid over-etching, which can affect the surface finish.</li>
<li>More expensive than regular primer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-regular-primer">Pros and Cons of Regular Primer</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Versatile and can be used on a variety of surfaces.</li>
<li>Affordable and easy to find at most hardware stores.</li>
<li>Creates a smooth, even surface for paint.
<strong>Cons:</strong></li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flour weevils are common insects that attack cereals and flour. The breeding rate could be adverse if the matter is not corrected in time. Perhaps you have a similar problem; what do you do?
<strong>Well, should I throw out flour with weevils? The direct answer is NO. Lightly weevil-infested flour is actually safe for human consumption. You won&rsquo;t get food poisoning or other stomach upset cases.</strong>
**However, for densely weevil-infested flour, it&rsquo;s advisable to get rid of it completely. Normally, weevils will feed on starch content in the flour, thus rendering it unsafe for consumption. **</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moreover, the flour is prone to poisoning in case of expiration. You will note, upon cooking, that the final flour meal has an unpleasant taste.</strong>
In this regard, it&rsquo;s advisable to consider the degree of weevil invasion and where possible treat the flour using methods highlighted in this article before using.

<h2 id="details-should-i-throw-out-flour-with-weevils">Details: Should I Throw Out Flour With Weevils</h2>
<h3 id="a-lightly-weevil-infested-flour">a. Lightly Weevil Infested Flour</h3>
<p>Lightly infested flour is suitable for human consumption (no need of throwing it out). The presence of weevils should be countable in the storage container or packet - count of 10 to 20 weevils at a glance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, cooked weevils have no historical cases of sickness/infection to humanity.
However, it should dawn on you that, a few weevil infestations are just an onset of the massive population - in a couple of days, the entire container will be full of hatched weevils.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s, therefore, necessary to consume the flour soonest possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-densely-weevil-infested-flour">b. Densely Weevil Infested Flour</h3>
<p>Densely weevil-infested flour should not be used whatsoever. The flour meal has an unpleasant taste upon cooking. Usually, the weevil infestation multiplies rapidly - they end up colonizing the entire flour package.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice tiny brown insects pacing in the container - the movement is fast but haphazard.
Moreover, the quality of flour fineness will deteriorate due to continue starch depravation - as weevils continue to feed on starch in the flour.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsJjAlCr24c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsJjAlCr24c</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-action-to-take">c. Action to Take</h3>
<p>Upon discovery that you have flour weevil infestation, you need to ascertain the degree/extent of the infestation. For light weevil infestation, you may opt to use the flour directly without any problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, storing that particular flour (weevil infested) will only lead to further mess as the weevils breed further.
You need to control weevils immediately. This can be done by either placing the flour in a freezer for over 5 days - low temperature kills the live weevils and their eggs- or heating up the flour gently.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-pantry-bugs/">What Causes Pantry Bugs?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-dangers-of-eating-weevils-infected-flour">d. Dangers of Eating Weevils Infected Flour</h3>
<p>Though weevils are not known to lead to direct food poisoning or any food-related sickness upon consumption (when cooked), their infestation eliminates flour favors and additives in the package.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the weevils deprive flour of its original taste leading to unpleasant meals upon cooking - this is a clear indicator that the flour is stale and unsuitable for human consumption.
Furthermore, weevils infested flour is highly susceptible to external food poisoning agents, and preservatives added are weakened as starch is reduced through feeding, thus causing fastened expiration.
NB: Expired flour is dangerous and should in whatsoever case be disposed of safely. Weevil infestation accelerates the rate of flour expiration - flour may expire earlier than the indicated date.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-tell-flour-has-weevil-infestation">How to Tell Flour has Weevil Infestation</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to tell whether flour has weevils at the beginning until the infestation tends to rise. This is usually because of their size - these insects are tiny, thus at times impossible to see with one&rsquo;s naked eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the weevil&rsquo;s eggs are invisible and camouflage with flour color before hatching takes place.
However, if you are careful enough, you will note that the first mature weevils move about the flour, especially when you stir or turn the flour in the container.</li>
<li>The weevils appear as tiny brown bugs/insects - consider using a hand lens in order to improve overall visibility.
Alternatively, fetch a little flour with a spoon and spread it in over plane mirror - observe if you will notice any weevil move about.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-flour-get-weevil-infestation">How does Flour Get Weevil Infestation?</h2>
<p>Weevils originate from the source point, which is usually either the seller, granary, or millers. When wheat or maize is being milled, the weevil&rsquo;s eggs are rarely affected in whatever way unless treated.</p>
<ul>
<li>These eggs are then transferred to the package, which eventually finds itself into your house, where they hatch into mature weevils finally.
Failure of millers to treat wheat or maize before milling takes place is a key reason for weevil infestation in the flour  this particular cause can only be controlled through freezing as explained further in this article.
Alternatively, your flour may get weevils if stored with infested grains and cereals such as rice.

</ul>
<h2 id="ways-to-prevent-flour-weevil-infestation">Ways to Prevent Flour Weevil Infestation</h2>
<p>The following are the best ways of preventing weevil flour infestation:</p>
<h3 id="1-freeze-flour-before-use">1. Freeze flour before use</h3>
<p>Once purchased, the flour should be stored in a freezer for over 5 days.
The low temperature in the freezer inactivates adult weevils leading to death. Further, the temperature prevents eggs from hatching, thus the entire life cycle of weevils is terminated.</p>
<h3 id="2-proper-flour-storage">2. Proper Flour Storage</h3>
<p>Your flour should be stored in an airtight container - this prevents adult weevils from accessing the flour from outside.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, this method may not prevent weevil infestation from the millers (source).
Alternatively, you can put your flour in a sealed bag. Avoid using polyethylene bags as a storage option whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-weevils-treated-label">3. Weevils Treated Label</h3>
<p>Always go for flour that has weevil treated label or sticker for authorizing body.
This is usually a diamond mark of quality and consumer protection measure, which guarantees you that the flour is treated against weevil infestation from the source (millers).
Therefore, consider the extent of weevils invasion and if possible treat weevil-infested flour using methods discussed in this article before using.</p>
<ul>
<li>Importantly, practice proper flour storage and healthy weevil prevention measures listed above. Related:Pet Safe Roach Killer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, should I throw out flour with weevils, the direct answer is no. Why because lightly weevil infested flour is actually safe for human consumption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you won&rsquo;t experience food poisoning or other cases of stomach upset. Indeed, cooked weevils have no history of causing sickness to humanity.</li>

<li>So the swarmers will leave evidence of wings (small piles) on various surfaces and spiderwebs including on the doors, window sills, and the house foundation.
To
differentiate between termites and ants
; note that the wings of termites have the same size whereas ants&rsquo; wings have different sizes.</li>
<li>The rear pair of wings of an and is smaller</li>
<li>While the front pair of wings of ant is larger
To know that the termites are really swarmers, you&rsquo;ll need to use a magnifying glass and check its colour as it&rsquo;s a common sign.</li>
<li>Carpenter ant swarmers are dark brown, black, or red - comparedCarpenter Ants vs Fire Ants</li>
<li>Swarmers of the dry wood termites will be solid red.</li>
<li>Swarmers of subterranean termites will be solid black.
So you can notice termite swarmers emerge from structures such as the house or even Edwards lying on the window sill or on the floor.
Citing the termite swarmers in the house is enough sign that the structure is infested by termites and will require professional termite control.</li>
<li>I advise scheduling a termite inspection and treatment for the building in question.
Scientists note that termites require a number of years for their colonies to grow large and produce swarmers.
If you see many swarmers coming out of a building, it is a sign that a large termite colony is eating up the structure.
However, killing the termite swarmers only will not solve your termite problem.</li>
<li>After all, the termite&rsquo;s swarmers that leave the building eventually die when they can&rsquo;t get too moist ground to feed and reproduce.
Therefore, killing the termite swarmers will only leave the other termite colony thriving unless you treat them.
NB: Finding a few Formosan termites could be an exception when sighted in a building that is appropriately treated for termites.</li>
<li>This is because the Formosan swarmers will be attracted by light from outside colonies or trees and may enter the house, especially in the swam season.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-finding-mud-shelter-tubes">2. Finding mud shelter tubes.</h3>
<p>If you see mud shelter tubes moving up the house plumbing, support piers, enable foundation walls, and outside foundation walls, then there could be a termite colony around.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, termites can build shelter tubes on the exterior side of a slab to enable them to get into the house under the siding.
For verification purposes;</li>
<li>Break a small section of that mud tube and check if you see any termites.</li>
<li>Also, check the broken tube after a few days to see if the termites have repaired that section.
These two will be enough signs that the termites are actively infesting the building or structures.
But destroying the mud tubes only will not get rid of a termite infestation (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">but fumigation can help</a>
). This is because the termites will go around and know how to enter the building anyway.</li>
<li>So after finding the mud shelter tubes, I advise you get professional exterminators to inspect the building for termites.
But any shelter tubes that are inactive and old (especially from a previous termite infestation gross profit must be scraped off or removed to make subsequent inspections easier.
You may also find the mud shelter tubes (especially for the Formosan termite) at higher locations of the building such as on the fascia boards, soffit, exterior wall, ceilings, and internal walls.
Other possible reasons for the entry of the termites (especially the Formosan termites) include the presence of above-ground moisture or roof leak.
I advise you to drill some pinholes on the mud shelter tubes or the dried mud on the structures for treatment of termites.</li>
<li>If the pinholes are repaired using mud, it will be clear that the termites have repaired them to prevent airflow exposure.

<h3 id="3-sunken-trails-or-areas-under-the-paint">3. Sunken trails or areas under the paint</h3>
<p>The presence of trails or sunken areas on the surfaces, paint, or wallpaper may signify the presence of termites.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sunken trails or areas under the paint could be resulting from the feeding activity of the termites as they cause damage to the cardboards.
However, termites do not eat gypsum but will feed on the cardboard and wood panelling that is covering it.
The mud may be formed into all shapes on the ceiling and walls particularly during late spring.</li>
<li>For example, the &ldquo;swarm castles&rdquo; of the formosan termites may be 1.5 inches tall and roughly 3 in white.
To identify the presence of the formosan termites, break the mud structures and see if their soldiers will come out defending their colony.
Also, check the foam insulation around the house and see if there are any mud tubes that are traveling through or over it.</li>
<li>The termites really easily tunnel through the foam insulation (particularly if it is sprayed on) but will not eat it.
Some of the termite species that will tunnel through spray-on foam insulation include the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">Eastern subterranean termites</a>
and the formosan termites.</li>
<li>Termite damage in your house may get noticed when you&rsquo;re doing your re-modelling, doing home repairs or replacing old wallpapers.
Despite the fact that termites will leave an area shortly after attacking it, you may still see some of these animals that will denote the presence of an active termite infestation.

Termite Bait Stations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-structural-damage-on-the-roof-and-floors">4. Structural damage on the roof and floors.</h3>
<p>If you notice structural damage such as a sagging roof or floor or even a door frame that is broken, you could be sure that they are termites attacking.</p>
<ul>
<li>But also the structural damage could have resulted from factors such as Wood rot.
But if you see excessive dried or live termites on the damaged timber, this could point out that there are termites attacking the structures.
Another sign that will denote the presence of drywood termites is if you find six-sided pallets that are uniformly-sized (small) on the countertop or floor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Termites will wittingly hide themselves in ward and soil especially in crisis and cars that are hidden on the foundation and the structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if there are clear signs of a damaged infestation, then it is clear that their population is very high (since these pests are challenging to detect).
The presence of shelter tubes moving up on the outside of the foundation wall will show the presence of termites.
However, I advise that you get expert
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-inspection-cost/">professional termite inspection</a>
for your structures and the house for effective control.
Also, don&rsquo;t forget to undertake regular or annual termite prevention and control on various structures and the yard.
Cheers!</li>

<h2 id="considerations-in-small-trampoline-for-toddlers"><strong>Considerations in Small Trampoline For Toddlers�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-age-and-size-of-kids"><strong>1. Age and size of kids�</strong></h3>
<p>Before buying Trampoline for Toddlers, please go through the following guide and see what you are required to look out for so that you make the most of your trampoline purchase.
When choosing a trampoline for your kids, their age and size should be the most crucial aspect. Buy one that is suitable for their age. The market for Kids trampolines has several options designed for toddlers.
Normally, trampolines that are smaller are recommended for kids aged 3 years and above, but some come with an age limit of 3-7 years.</p>
<h3 id="2-ease-of-assembly"><strong>2. Ease of Assembly</strong></h3>
<p>Before making your purchase, go through Amazon customer reviews and assess customer&rsquo;s opinions about the assembling process and ease of installation.
Trampolines come in different sizes, and each size has its recommended assembling time. The assembling time might take several hours or a few minutes depending on the size of the trampoline.
However, if the installation process is too complicated for you, you are advised to employ a professional to do it for you.
Other larger outdoor trampoline models come with higher age ranges like 6 years and above; those are not appropriate for toddlers.</p>
<h3 id="3-maximum-weight-capacity-">**3. Maximum Weight Capacity **</h3>
<p>Will, you once in awhile bounce with your kids on the trampoline? Or how many kids will get to play on the trampoline? Ask yourself these questions before making your purchase.
This way, youll buy a trampoline that is ideal for your weights. �Most trampolines have a maximum weight capacity that they can carry.
Most toddler trampolines have a smaller surface size, hence, can accommodate one or two kids. Similarly, large models can carry more pounds, meaning both kids and adults can play on it. Always allow a buffer for the weight limit since children grow very fast.
Always get a trampoline that is above the weight of your kids. For instance, if your two kids weigh 60lbs each, consider choosing a trampoline with a weight capacity of at least 180lbs, instead of 120lbs.</p>
<h3 id="4-sturdiness-and-durability-">**4. Sturdiness and Durability **</h3>
<p>You should buy a product that is built to last and stable enough for you and your kids. It is advisable that you buy a trampoline that will grow with the kids, one that they will use for more years.
For example, look at the legs of the trampoline, are they strong enough? Can they help to keep the structure in place? If you are buying a larger trampoline, then W-shaped legs will be an excellent choice for you, such legs give the trampoline the much-needed stability.
You can also check those models that are secured with t-sockets. T-sockets are known to increase the sturdiness of a trampoline. So, consider checking out those that are fitted with such joints.
Another aspect you may want to focus on is the durability of the trampoline. Always ensure you go for features that will prolong the life of your trampoline.
For instance, buy one that contains a UV-resistant cover or one with a galvanized or coated steel frame. Structures made of steel are ideal. They are usually firm and sturdy and can withstand any weather conditions without getting affected by either rust or fading.</p>
<h3 id="5-space-">**5. Space **</h3>
<p>How much space can you spare in your backyard or apartment? Take measurements of the available space and compare it to what manufacturers have given in their installation guide.
After taking your measurements, reduce them by a few feet say if your backyard or apartment space measures 20 by 20 feet, you can cut that to maybe 14 by 16 and buy a trampoline with those measurements. This way, your kids will have extra space to climb up or down.
You can also consider buying a trampoline that can be folded. Many mini kid trampolines can be folded up. You can consider purchasing the foldable one if you have limited space. You can fold and store them away once kids are through with playing to create more space.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This guide and review have made it easier for you to get that ideal small trampoline for your toddlers. �Any of the reviewed trampolines will make a perfect choice as weve only covered what we believe will give you and your kids satisfaction and value for your money.
Safety has been our primary focus while doing this review, so we only concentrated on those trampolines that we believe offer security at the same time allow kids to explore and have fun.
Its no longer a challenge for you to pick the best trampoline for your kids, you are now equipped with vital information to help make that important investment.�Happy Shopping!!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soil <a href="/posts/subterranean-termites-treatment/">treatment</a> for termites involves using some contact insecticides around your house and yard to create barriers. The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">subterranean termite control</a>
process is divided into pre-construction plus the post-construction treatment.
Soil treatment for termites applies some termite insecticide like
<a href="https://iaspub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=CHEMICALSEARCH:3:::NO:1,3,31,7,12,25:P3_XCHEMICAL_ID:2377">fipronil</a>
or
<a href="https://iaspub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=CHEMICALSEARCH:3:::NO:1,3,31,7,12,25:P3_XCHEMICAL_ID:2571">imidacloprid</a>
on the structures like the house or wall foundations and wood.
However, you may termite-proof wood through pressure-treating using chemical insecticides or spraying. Also, you may place termites baits at appropriate locations in the yard.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Termites Control&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrEcTs2tJI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrEcTs2tJI</a>
However, for Drywood, Dampwood, or Formosan termites, I recommend undertaking
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7440.html">fumigation</a>
or use one of the
approved termite killers
. Below I&rsquo;ve discussed how you can treat the soil for termites.</p>
<h2 id="a-pre-construction-or-pre-treat-termite-treatment">A. Pre-Construction (or Pre-Treat) Termite Treatment</h2>
<p>Termites will cause significant damage to your home
, and sadly this isn&rsquo;t covered in the homeowner&rsquo;s insurance. These damaging insects will hide in furniture and walls until they&rsquo;re mature.
Here&rsquo;s how you should do the pre-construction (or Pre-Treat) termite soil treatment to protect your structure at the initial construction phase.</p>
<h3 id="1-borate-pre-treat-on-exposed-wood"><em>1. Borate Pre-Treat on exposed wood</em></h3>
<p>Pre-treat all the exposed wood studs on your house and nearby structures. Use a wood preservative or insecticide like Boracare as the
termite prevention
ability will last the treated wood&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig a 6 inches (deep) by 6 inches (wide) trench in the soil around the house or structure to be pre-treated for termites.</li>
<li>Next, use the insecticide to soak the soil in the house foundation&rsquo;s hole as directed in the product instructions. But I would recommend using a bucket (5 gallons) as opposed to a sprayer bottle.</li>
<li>Mix up the soil in the termite treatment trench using a suitable shovel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-pre-treat-foundational-walls">2. Pre-Treat Foundational walls</h3>
<p>For this, you&rsquo;ll need to use a termiticide such as Termidor SC to pre-treat the foundation walls at their soil level for termites. But pre-treat the soil before pouring the slab - for new construction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Termidor SC to pre-treat the concrete slabs, and this would work better if you apply the insecticide under the selected concrete slab - this is before pouring.</li>
<li>But for a slab that&rsquo;s already installed - you&rsquo;ll have to inject the chemical termite killer via a drill hole. Therefore, the insecticide will still pre-treat the soil underneath.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuVj457vDFg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuVj457vDFg</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-termi-mesh-barrier-and-sentricon-baiting-">**3. Termi-mesh Barrier and **Sentricon Baiting ****</h3>
<p>The Terms-mesh termite barrier that homeowners can apply on their piping penetrations before pouring the concrete to lay the slab.
Terms-mesh is a closely-knit mesh (made from stainless steel) that lasts for a long time, and hence the termites won&rsquo;t easily penetrate it to eat your house and nearby structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, Termi-mesh is mainly offered as an additionaltermite controlservice instead of a stand-alone offer by the exterminator companies.</li>
<li>Next, install the sentricon baiting around your structure&rsquo;s perimeter. This will be done only after you&rsquo;ve completed all the landscaping. Also, ensure to continually (yearly) monitor the baiting system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b-post-construction-or-post-treat-termite-treatment">B. Post-Construction (or Post-Treat) Termite Treatment</h2>
<p>You may apply the termiticides on the wood or soil after the construction process is complete. The soil treatment insecticides can come in the form of
baits
or liquids.</p>
<h3 id="1wall-foundations-or-pipes">1.�Wall Foundations or Pipes</h3>
<p>The process may also involve rodding or trenching the soil around the wall foundations or pipes and piers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig narrow trenches outside &amp; inside the structure&rsquo;s (chimney or piers) foundation before injecting your termiticides into the soil.</li>
<li>Conduct a termite inspection (both outside and inside areas) on the house and other structures. You may engage a termite inspection company (but consider<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-inspection-cost/">termite inspection cost</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-crawl-spaces">2. Crawl spaces</h3>
<ul>
<li>For crawl spaces, treat the soil with Termidor SC through the dug holes or trenches. For this, you&rsquo;ll also need to dig 6 inches (deep) by 6 inches (wide) trenches around wall footing, foundations, trench, piers. Pour and mix up the insecticides with the soil.</li>
<li>To treat the basements for termites, drill some equally spaced holes on the floor and inject the termiticide insecticide into the underlying soil.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-vertical-barrier">3. Vertical Barrier</h3>
<p>You can establish a vertical termite barrier by applying insecticide in the hole (6 inches deep) via rodding, trenching, and trenching along with the foundation elements like pillars, pilasters, and chimney bases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid applying the insecticide into your drainage system if there is a danger of reaching the foundation drainage, french drains, or drain tile.</li>
<li>If the structure footing is exposed, you&rsquo;ll need to be applied next to (not under) the footing. Also, ensure you termite treat the soil around strictures like all the conduits and sewer pipes.</li>
<li>Caution, concrete slabs may provide other entry points for termites such as plumbing outlets and bath traps - which may render your previous termite treatment ineffective. Therefore, conduct good drilling as this will readily.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4wood-treatment">4.<strong>Wood treatment�</strong></h3>
<p>This requires you to apply the termiticides on your wood, preventing or controlling a termite infestation. Some of the methods for a termite treatment on wood include pressure-treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure-treating the wood and the soil around it makes your structures to be termite andcarpenter antsresistant.</li>
<li>The treatment involves the application of a chemical preservative through the use of high pressure.</li>
<li>Also, wood spraying using an effective termiticide allows the wood to be protected on its surface, but this chemical won&rsquo;t get deep into its pores.
<strong>5. Foundation Termite Treatment�</strong>
Treating the foundation for termites will also involve applying the termiticides on the house or wall foundations and elements.
It helps build a barrier via positioning the termiticides in the brick walls or concrete block - between the walls where you find a space.
Treating and drilling the house foundations enables the termiticides to penetrate the concrete footings that could have crevices and cracks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Soil treatment for termites with different termiticides, including liquid termite to create a termite barrier plus you may use other termite killers and termite baits.
Termiticides have active ingredients such as 7.9% bifenthrin that&rsquo;ll both repel and kill termites - both instantly and have a more prolonged residue effect killing both fleas (
check flea foggers
), ticks, and ants.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms of spider bites (e.g. Sydney funnel-web include pain, swelling, and red skin. On the other hand, mosquito bites mainly result in itchy, pink &amp; raised skin bumps but may trigger severe allergic reactions.</strong>
So, when you know what&rsquo;s in your yard - and control it well - it&rsquo;ll be easy to control the bugs as you enjoy your outdoor sports, picnics, pool parties, and barbecues without those annoying insect bites.

<h2 id="details-spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite-what-bit-me">Details: Spider Bite vs Mosquito Bite; What Bit Me?</h2>
<h3 id="1-different-in-bite-appearance">1. Different in Bite Appearance?</h3>
<p><em>a. Mosquito bite�</em>
Mosquito bites to animals and humans mainly come from their females to get that blood meal - enabling great egg production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using their proboscis (mouthpart), mosquitos pierce your skin and suck blood.</li>
<li>Its saliva causes your skin to itch and bump. For some people, the effect is more strong redness, soreness, and swelling.
The appearance of a mosquito bite include:</li>
<li>Dark spots on the skin resembling some bruises</li>
<li>Further, mosquito bites will result in reddish and puffy bumps that&rsquo;ll appear some minutes following the bite.</li>
<li>They cause reddish-brown, itchy, and hard bumps - which could also be multiple bumps that&rsquo;ll appear within the day after the bite.
Individuals who&rsquo;ll get adverse effects from mosquito bites include kids and adults that have immune system disorders or those who&rsquo;ve not previously been bitten by these bugs.
Further, mosquito bites reactions may have severe reactions including;</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
<li>Hives</li>
<li>Low-grade fever</li>
<li>Wide-area skin redness and swelling
<em>b. Spider Bite�</em>
The charactratics of spider bites from spiders such as the lack of widow spiders include pinprick-like, sharp, and immediate pain.
Also, the bite location will be numb.�Additional symptoms for bites from the black widow spider are;</li>
<li>Itchy skin rash</li>
<li>Excessive sweating</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Stiffness in the back, chest, shoulders, and painful muscle cramps</li>
<li>Vomiting and nausea</li>
<li>Excessive saliva production</li>
<li>Swollen and droopy eyes</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing
However, some of the bites from the spiders won&rsquo;t be immediately noticeable or painful. But the spider bite pain could be faced within 1 hour.
For the brown recluse, the spider bite symptoms will include;</li>
<li>The Bite area will have an itchy skin</li>
<li>Could lead to a skin ulcer and blisters (and later result in scars) - which start with reddish skin or bruises.
Finally, bites by Hobo spiders - and its bite on your skin will include;</li>
<li>Cognitive impairment</li>
<li>Nausea.</li>
<li>Fatigue.</li>
<li>Pus-producing blisters</li>
<li>Swollen and red skin</li>
<li>Hardened bite-area skin</li>
<li>Severe headache that beings shortly after getting bitten - and the headache could remain active for about a week.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-causes-high-risk-illnesses">2. Causes High-Risk** i**llnesses?</h3>
<p><em>a. Mosquito bite�</em>
Mosquito bites will result in pink, red &amp; rounded, plus itchy bumps. But this bite could result in severe illnesses like eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), malaria, West Nile virus, and Zika virus.
Zika virus will, for many humans, result in a flu-like illness. However, newborns from mothers infected with this virus could get microcephaly�birth defects.
The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com">CDC notes</a>
that the West Nile virus was (in 2019) spread over 47 states of the US.</p>
<ul>
<li>The virus symptoms will be evident within 2 - 14 days - these include skin rash, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, body aches, and headaches.
Further, humans that get West Nile that&rsquo;s severe may develop encephalitis, meningitis, and other signs like convulsions, high fever, disorientation, severe headache, and neck stiffness.</li>
<li>But mosquitoes will largely infect humans with malaria - but the malaria cases have malaria transmission in the US.
The malaria flu will result in symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, muscle aches, headache, and fever. However, CDC notes that malaria is treatable &amp; preventable.
Another mosquito species known as
<em>Aedes scapularis is found in Latin and Caribbean America but also in Florida - as noted by the JMEntomology.�</em>
<em>b. Spider Bite�</em>
Spider bites won&rsquo;t largely result in grave problems. However, you could experience pain, swelling, and redness around the area with the spider bite.</li>
<li>But bites from spiders like the hobo spiders, brown recluse, and the black widow may result in more grave effects
Such effects may include muscle cramps that are painful, severe headaches, and trouble breathing - such effects from spider bites could need urgent medical care.
But how serious are these spider bites? Well, bites from most spiders will be harmless. All spiders will have the venom poison but many of them have small fangs that won&rsquo;t easily puncture the skin of a human.
So, which spider species will be venomous to humans? From the over 60 spider species, but only a few of these spiders will be dangerous - these include:</li>
<li>**Hobo spiders -**The brown-colored hobo spiders have a herringbone (V-shaped) of their belly - mainly occupying the Pacific Northwest. You&rsquo;ll find them on woodpiles, window wells, crawl spaces, moist &amp; dark basements - areas where they&rsquo;ll create their funnel-shaped webs.</li>
<li>**Brown recluses - **Also referred to all the violin or fiddle-back spiders, the spiders largely found in the Southern and Midwestern states. You&rsquo;ll largely find them in sheltered and dry places like on leaves, rocks, piles of wood. Also, you can find them in shoes, attics, and dark closets.</li>
<li>**Black widows -**These back window species will mainly occupy the outhouses, fence, woodpiles, and building eaves (overhangs) - and largely occupy the Southern &amp; Western U.S. Their belly has an hourglass shape that is colored red.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-difference-in-treatment-of-spider-and-mosquito-bites">The difference in Treatment of Spider and Mosquito Bites</h2>
<p>After identifying that bite, it&rsquo;s important to use the right technique to treat the various bug bites.
<strong>Treating Spider Bites:�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by quickly locating that spider which bit you. You might need to search those hiding or dark areas - this will help you identify if the bite is toxic.</li>
<li>For toxic spider bites such as from Brown recluse or Black Widow spider, you&rsquo;ll require emergency medical treatment.</li>
<li>Avoid home treatment if their spider at hand is noted to inject toxic through their bites</li>
<li>Thoroughly clean the spider bite, if the spider is identified as being non-toxic, and this will help avoid further infection</li>
<li>In addition, to prevent an additional allergic reaction from that spider bite, I advise you take some antihistamine
<strong>Treating Mosquito Bites:�</strong></li>
<li>Compared to the bites from ticks or spiders, mosquito bites are known to be largely harmless</li>
<li>So, unless there are serious symptoms such as fever or nausea, you won&rsquo;t require to take those drastic measures</li>
<li>To stop the skin itching after the mosquito bite, I recommend you rub some baking soda or salt.</li>
<li>For those with no sensitive skin or even younger kids, you can use calamine lotion</li>
<li>Further, for mosquito bites, you may use some mild treatments such as honey, tea bags, and ice.
In summary, compared to mosquito bites, some of the spider bites will be more toxic and life-threatening.
But with mosquito bites, it&rsquo;s important to take appropriate prevention steps while also controlling the resulting diseases plus easing the biting pain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On spider bite vs mosquito bite, in summary, that unsettling bite bump on your body could be from a mosquito or spider.
Spiders bites that are largely poisonous are the tarantula, hobo spider, black widow, and brown recluse.</p>
<ul>
<li>But mosquitoes will bite even when they&rsquo;re not threatened - mosquitoes aim to suck mosquitoes for reproduction and nutrition.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Safety is the number one consideration when buying trampolines. Most parents are overwhelmed with the many brands, styles, and shapes of trampolines. To make it a bit easier, I will discuss Springfree <a href="/posts/are-trampolines-good-for-obese-people/">Trampoline</a> vs. Regular Trampoline.</p>
<p>I will cover everything you need to know about these two options. So sit tight, read this article to the end, become more informed.</p>

<h2 id="springfree-trampoline-vs-regular-trampoline-details">Springfree Trampoline Vs Regular Trampoline-Details</h2>
<p>Trampolines provide an excellent way for kids and adults to have active and healthy lifestyles. A recent
<a href="https://newsroom.osfhealthcare.org/screen-time-for-kids-how-much-is-too-much/">study</a>
has shown that children spend hours in front of the screen.</p>
<p>Hence, parents need to look for exciting ways to encourage kids to spend more time outdoors.</p>
<p>A lot of screen time is not good for kids. It can cause obesity, impair social skills, Physical strain to the eyes, and sleep deprivation among other issues.</p>
<p>Thus, I will provide detailed information about Springfree Trampoline Vs Regular Trampoline to help you keep your children outdoors for longer.</p>
<p>Lets get started!</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/rectangular-vs-round-trampoline/">Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline</a></p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-springfree-trampoline">What Is A Springfree Trampoline?</h3>
<p>A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfree_Trampoline">Springfree Trampoline</a>
is simply a trampoline without springs. These trampolines dont have springs in their construction, instead they are reinforced with fiberglass poles. Hence, they eliminate areas that can trap the toes or feet or those areas that can cause pinching.</p>
<p>Developed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Alexander_(engineer)">Dr. Keith Vivian Alexander</a>
, springfree trampolines have hidden frames. These frames have 3 layers of rust protection to prevent peeling. The frame is also located beneath the jumping surface. Hence, theres no way a jumper can hit it or fall on it.</p>
<p>Dr. Keith Vivian created safe trampolines by eliminating all areas on a regular trampoline that cause injuries. Thus, he eliminated steel coil springs and the rigid perimeter frame to come with the safest trampolines of our time.</p>
<p>The Springfree Trampolines also feature a SoftEdge mat that provides 30 times more shock absorption than regular pads. This mat also eliminates all the hard edges on the jumping area to make it injury-free for the user</p>
<p>The springfree also comes with an enclosure net that helps to cushion wayward jumpers and protect them from falling to the ground. The structure feature flexible enclosure rods that reinforce the safety net eliminating the need for metal poles</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-regular-trampoline">What Is a Regular Trampoline?</h3>
<p>Regular trampolines commonly known as Spring-based trampolines use springs to reinforce the structure. The springs can pinch or injure the user. Hence, they are not as safe as the springfree trampolines.</p>
<p>However, the Regular Trampoline are more affordable and their spare parts are easily accessible. They also come in different shapes including oval, rectangle, and round. All of these shapes provide a different experience in terms of the bounce.</p>
<p>Regular Trampolines also have exposed frames that make the jumping surface hard. Hence, a jumper may get serious injuries and fractures.</p>
<p>Unlike the SoftEdge mat in springfee trampoline that provides good shock absorption, the pads in regular trampoline do not provide as much shock absorption. Thus, a jumper is likely to get injuries while jumping on a regular trampoline. These pads also have a short life span.</p>

<h2 id="springfree-trampoline-vs-regular---differences">Springfree Trampoline Vs. Regular - Differences</h2>
<h3 id="enclosure-net">Enclosure Net</h3>
<p>Both the Springfree Trampoline and Regular trampoline come with enclosure net. These nets are crucial at enhancing the overall safety of the trampoline user.</p>
<p>These nets prevent unintended trampoline falls that may result in life threatening injuries like broken bones. Both the Springfree Trampoline and Regular trampoline have tightly woven nets.</p>
<p>The only difference is that regular trampoline use steel poles to reinforce the net. However, Springfree felt that the traditional trampoline was not safe enough so they made their enclosure net more flexible. Thus, in springfree youll not find any steel poles.</p>
<h3 id="springs">Springs</h3>
<p>A regular trampoline features steel coil springs while the springree features glass-reinforced rods that are located below the edges of the jumping mat.</p>
<p>Most people agree that springfree trampolines provides smooth, non-jarring bounce thats gentle to the joints and knees of the jumper. On the other hand, some people argue that the regular trampoline gives a better bounce because of the coil springs, which helps in increasing the bounce.</p>
<p>Overall, we can say that both the Springfree Trampoline and Regular trampoline have a comparable bounce.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>When it comes to cost between springfree trampolines vs. regular youll notice a huge price difference between the two. A springfree trampoline will cost more than a regular trampoline. The huge difference in price between this two options is largely because springfree trampoline are durable and have excellent safety features.</p>
<h3 id="frame">Frame</h3>
<p>The frame of the springfree trampoline is located underneath the jumping surface, thus, its invisible. The springfree has been re-engineered to eliminate impact areas that cause common trampoline injuries.</p>
<p>This patented design of the springfree ensures the users safety while jumping.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the frame on the regular or traditional trampoline is visible. To make the frame more durable, most regular trampolines now feature a galvanizing technology that enhances the overall safety of the net pole and the frame.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-springfree-trampolines-safer-than-regular-trampolines">Why Are Springfree Trampolines Safer Than Regular Trampolines**?**</h2>
<p>The design of Springfree Trampoline makes it safer than traditional trampoline. The fact that its springless and cant pinch or injure the user makes it a number one choice for many.</p>
<p>Other than that, the frame on springfree trampoline is underneath the mat and the jumper cant hit it, thus, eliminates chances of injuries.</p>
<p>However, spring-based or the regular trampolines are hazardous to jumpers and they can cause life threatening injuries like fractures on the legs, hands, or joints. A jumper can also get serious head injuries.</p>
<p>Springfree Trampoline are also Safer because of the SoftEdge mat that provides 30 times more shock absorbency than the pads used in regular trampolines.</p>
<p>The pads on traditional trampolines or spring-based trampolines dont offer much protection from injuries. These pads have a short lifespan and they tend to lose their shock-absorbency quickly.</p>
<h2 id="are-springfree-trampolines-better">Are Springfree Trampolines Better?</h2>
<p>Yes! Springfree trampolines are a better choice if youre not disturbed by the high price.</p>
<p>Springfree trampolines have a patented design that eliminates all impact areas that are likely to cause trampoline related injuries.</p>
<p>Other than that, the Springfree Trampoline features flexible composite rods that are located below the mat to prevent injuries. On the other hand, regular trampolines have springs that can injure or pinch the user.</p>
<h2 id="are-springfree-trampolines-worth-the-money">Are Springfree Trampolines Worth The Money?</h2>
<p>I would say yes. Springfree trampolines are worth the money. They deliver a better bounce, have excellent safety features, and they have many positive buyer reviews.</p>
<p>However, springfree trampolines are more expensive than the regular trampolines.� The springfree are double or triple the price of a traditional trampoline.</p>
<p>However, they eliminate the risk of landing on springs or the frame. Therefore, if your budget allows, I will advise you to go for it.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning about springfree trampolines is that their spare parts are expensive. They are also not easily accessible.</p>
<p>Youll appreciate that the manufacturer of springfree provides easy to follow installation instructions. So your structure should be up within a short period.</p>

<h2 id="trampoline-safety-tips">Trampoline Safety Tips</h2>
<h3 id="1-install-the-safety-net">1. Install the Safety Net</h3>
<p>The safety net enclosure plays a big role in keeping the jumper safe.� Trampolines manufacturers usually include these safety nets in the products. Its crucial that you set them up during the installation to prevent common trampoline injuries.</p>
<h3 id="2-ensure-you-have-an-even-ground-level">2. Ensure You Have an Even Ground Level</h3>
<p>Ensure the ground is even when setting up the trampoline. Sloppy or uneven grounds may not be the best places to set up the trampoline. To prevent potential life threatening injuries its good to choose a favorable ground location.</p>
<p>Further, you should set up the trampoline in a place with no fences, trees, or anything that can cause injuries as one jumps.</p>
<h3 id="3-ensure-the-trampoline-is-clear-of-any-objects">3. Ensure the Trampoline Is Clear Of Any Objects</h3>
<p>Its crucial that you always check beneath the trampoline to ensure that no object is underneath. The trampoline should be visible in all directions or from all angles. This allows you to spot anything that could be below or inside the trampoline and remove immediately.</p>
<p>Your children may put things below the trampoline that may cause them harm when jumping. Also encourage your children to avoid going underneath the trampoline.</p>
<h3 id="4-do-regular-inspection">4. Do Regular Inspection</h3>
<p>Regular trampoline inspection will ensure your children are safe always as they jump. Therefore, on a regular basis before they start jumping you should do a thorough inspection. Check for any structural weakness, sharp edges, tears, and anything that looks unusual.</p>
<h3 id="5-adult-supervision">5. Adult Supervision</h3>
<p>Adult supervision is critical at all times as children jump on their trampoline. An adult will immediately notice any issue and take any necessary action. He/she can also advice the jumpers on the best ways to use the trampoline to avoid injuries.</p>
<h3 id="6-encourage-one-jumper-at-a-time">6. Encourage one Jumper at a Time</h3>
<p>Having one-person jump at a time will reduce collision and common injuries. However,� if you can closely supervise the kids you can have multiple of them jumping together. The safety of your kids while jumping is your responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If youre looking for the safest trampoline I recommend you pick the springfree trampoline. Although most regular trampolines have incorporated more safety features, they still dont match up to the springfree.</p>
<p>Springfree trampoline have many safety features like a soft edge mat, glass reinforced rods replace the springs, safety enclosure net, and the frame is beneath the mat. Therefore, expect to play higher for the springfree.</p>
<p>Most springfree owners are happy with their purchase and they are glad they choose the springfree trampoline than the regular trampoline.</p>

.
The insects will chew or gnaw wood and house items like filtration systems, swimming pool liners, insulation, books, and paper. Also, termites can cause emotional strain on homeowners.
In summary: Subterranean termites treatment begins with the wood cure to strengthen the wood and prevent the insects from eating it. Spaying the wood (spot treatment) with the
best termite killers
such as termiticide hinders the termites from chewing your structures.</p>
<h2 id="subterranean-termite-treatment-options---fast-control">Subterranean Termite Treatment Options - Fast Control</h2>
<p>Equally,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-inspection-cost/">termite inspection costs</a>
might be relatively high - also, termite fumigation is equally pricey. So, below I&rsquo;ve discussed the best subterranean termites treatment available for your taking.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="1-apply-liquid-termiticide">1. Apply Liquid Termiticide</h3>
<p>Apply the liquid termiticide underneath and around the wooden or various structures - particularly on portions that termites may attack.
In case you&rsquo;re dealing with new construction, I advise you termite-treat the foundation walls plus the graded soil before pouring your concrete slab. The termite &ldquo;swarmers&rdquo; shed its wings, drop off on the ground and get mates ready to create new colonies.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll have to drill and trench their foundation for the already build structures to treat them with the termiticide. The process creates a barrier between the structure and the termites hiding in the soil.</li>
<li>Further, the termite barrier will also hinder the building&rsquo;s termites from getting back to the soil. Therefore, they will eventually die from dehydration.
Subterranean termite infestations are mainly discovered during spring - they&rsquo;re triggered by rainfall and warm temperatures as they disperse and begin new colonies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-apply-repellent-termiticides">2. Apply Repellent Termiticides</h3>
<p>The pyrethroid termiticide repellents will work just as well as the liquid termiticides to
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef604">repel and kill the termites</a>
attacking your wooden structures. You&rsquo;ll apply it to structures and features, including landscaping, plumbing lines.</p>
<ul>
<li>These repellents with Pyrethroids will quickly poison the termite&rsquo;s nerve but are less toxic to the mammals. The repellents are like Prelude, Demon, Talstar, Cynoff, and Dragnet FT.</li>
<li>The repellent Termiticides will work against the termites that&rsquo;ll work on the termites foraging in areas such as beneath the soil. This also creates a barrier against these foraging and gnawing insects.
Further, pyrethroids are equally cheap to be used as a termite barrier. But the insecticide may sometimes detect the termiticides and hence won&rsquo;t touch the termite barrier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-apply-non-repellent-termiticides">3. Apply Non-Repellent Termiticides</h3>
<p>The non-repellent termiticides will also work against the termites attacking your structures. Luckily, unlike the repellents, termites won&rsquo;t easily detect the presence of the non-repellent termiticides.</p>
<ul>
<li>The termites will easily contact the non-repellent termiticides as they forage in the soil thus are exterminated. Some include Premise by Bayer - with small Imidocloprid doses and kill through contact.</li>
<li>The premise is pricey compared to the pyrethroids. However, Premise can be applied either as spot treatments or also as aerosol or spray form.</li>
<li>Phantom by BASF, made from chlorfenapyr, which is a non-repellent termiticide. The chlorfenapyr will be toxic to the termites when the chemical is broken down through enzymatic action in their immune system.
The chlorfenapyr&rsquo;s metabolites are highly poisonous and will hence stop the termite from generating energy. But the termites won&rsquo;t die instantly and hence will continue transmitting the termiticide back to the nests.
Ask your realtor or the home seller for non-toxic sodium borate and termite barriers. If you are building your own home, you can ask your contractor for professional pre-treatments to be done, so ensure that your home remains free.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-termite-bait-stations">4. Termite Bait Stations</h3>
<p>Termite bait stations
are also the best termite killers. They are drilled into the soil in affected areas or probable entry points of termites. These contain germicidal nematodes that effectively bait subterranean termites.</p>
<ul>
<li>These baits are toxic and lethal parasites in the form of larvae. The termites ingest the nematodes, and once they mature, these parasites will kill their termite host and lay eggs for other termites in the colony to feast on. Eventually, they will spread and acts as a natural defense against termites.</li>
<li>Subterranean termite treatment needs to begin with prevention. Since these species thrive in moist areas and wooden structures that are in contact with the soil, the best way to prevent them from finding their way into your home is to treat the surrounding soil around your house.
Soil treatment involves the injection of short-lived toxins in the surrounding ground surface and foundation of your home. Mostly, these toxins will have a life span of 5 years. You may want to keep track of dates to keep you aware of how long your soil remains in a toxic state.
Fun Fact: Formosan subterranean termite (known as Super Termites) originated from southern China and Taiwan and are highly destructive. These ferocious pests can eat about 13 ounces of wood in a day and can total your home into a useless structure in 3 months. They attack a wide variety of structures that can include trees, buildings, and even boats.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-professional-termite-exterminators">5. Professional Termite Exterminators</h3>
<p>With severe subterranean termite infestations, it is most recommended for you to seek a professional pest control agency&rsquo;s services. Have them diagnose the extent of infestation and damage to your home and discuss the treatment approach.
Make sure you choose one that stands firm on choosing non-toxic and environmentally safe chemical solutions.�Getting on a head start whenever you buy or rent a
home is your best defense
against termites. Of course, whenever you purchase a home, it is always best to buy a home that has been recently built and certified with termite pre-treatments.
Although older homes may not be as stringent with termite pre-treatments upon selling, certain states require a complete and thorough termite inspection with a mandatory order for the owner to shoulder any termite treatments needed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The bad news about subterranean termite infestation is, once a colony has been established in your area, it could be almost futile to eradicate them. They will always keep trying to attack. Your best defense to keep from coming back is to check for vulnerable areas of your home and maintain treatments.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/do-flying-termites-eat-wood/">Termite</a> fumigation is an effective way to eradicate termites from your home or business. This method involves the use of a gaseous pesticide, which is introduced into the affected area to eliminate termites and prevent further damage. In this article, we will discuss what termite fumigation is, how it works, its benefits, and the necessary precautions you need to take.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-termite-fumigation">What is Termite Fumigation?</h2>
<p>Termite fumigation is a professional pest control technique used to eliminate termite infestations. It involves sealing off the affected area and introducing a specially formulated gas, known as fumigant, that penetrates wood, walls, and other materials to kill termites and their eggs. This process can reach deep into inaccessible areas, providing a thorough treatment.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-termite-fumigation-work">How Does Termite Fumigation Work?</h2>
<p>Termite fumigation works by releasing a fumigant, typically a chemical like sulfuryl fluoride, which is capable of killing termites. The fumigant is applied to the infested structure, and the space is sealed to trap the gas inside. The gas penetrates the wood and other materials where termites are hiding, exterminating them upon contact. The fumigation process usually takes about 2 to 3 days, depending on the size of the structure and the severity of the infestation.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-termite-fumigation">Benefits of Termite Fumigation</h2>
<p>Termite fumigation offers several advantages over other termite control methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Comprehensive Treatment:**Fumigation is highly effective in treating large-scale infestations and hard-to-reach areas that other methods may not address.</li>
<li>**Whole-Structure Protection:**Unlike localized treatments, fumigation affects the entire structure, ensuring all termites are exterminated.</li>
<li>**Long-Lasting Results:**Once completed, termite fumigation can provide lasting protection against future infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="precautions-to-take-before-and-after-fumigation">Precautions to Take Before and After Fumigation</h2>
<p>There are several important steps to take before and after termite fumigation to ensure safety:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Prepare the Area:**Before fumigation, you must remove all food items, plants, pets, and any items that could be contaminated by the fumigant. You may also need to arrange for temporary accommodation during the process.</li>
<li>**Follow Professional Guidance:**Always hire a licensed pest control company to perform the fumigation. They will ensure the proper use of fumigants and adherence to safety standards.</li>
<li>**Ventilate the Area:**After fumigation, it is essential to ventilate the space thoroughly to ensure all fumigant has dissipated before re-entering the property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cost-of-termite-fumigation">Cost of Termite Fumigation</h2>
<p>The cost of termite fumigation can vary depending on factors such as the size of the structure, the level of infestation, and the location of the property. On average, fumigation can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500. While the upfront cost may seem high, fumigation provides a long-term solution to termite problems and can prevent extensive damage to your property.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Termite fumigation is a highly effective method for eliminating termite infestations and preventing future damage. It is important to hire a professional pest control company to carry out the fumigation and ensure that all safety precautions are followed. By taking the proper steps before and after the treatment, you can protect your home or business from the destructive effects of termites.</p>

.
Your decision will inevitably involve a few factors you would want to consider before making that phone callthe most critical of choosing a licensed pest control company if applicable in your locale.</p>
<h2 id="why-hire-a-licensed-termite-control-agency">Why Hire A Licensed Termite Control Agency?</h2>
<p>Do not just consider the cost of the termite inspection and control agency; competency is an equally important factor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although licensed companies may cost a lot more, it would benefit you most to know that you hired skilled professionals who have been deemed socially and environmentally responsible with their products and services.</li>
<li>In some cases, if there are no licensing and regulatory entities in your area, you can find out if the company is an enlisted member of reputable organizations for pest management and the like.</li>
<li>Some home insurance companies occasionally cover termite inspections and treatments if the pest control agency is duly licensed. This could be big savings and hassle for you.</li>
<li>Window shop for good deals and dont get too carried away by prices. Study their offers, service guarantees, and preventive and maintenance packages they can tie up with your needs.</li>
<li>You may find their packages a very ideal and worry-free termite treatment deal. Sometimes a pricey package can be worth it in the end.</li>
<li>Dont fret as soon as you find out your home is infested with termites. Take your time to make a sound decision by researching online and reading up on factoids and whatnot before you point that finger on the yellow pages on the fanciest looking pest control advertisement.</li>
<li>And lastly, dont get pressured by sales talk. Many pest control agencies will attempt to lure you into signing a contract with them by making it seem like your house will cave-in in a matter of weeks if you take the time to shop around. This is a very dishonest technique that has worked on a lot of homeowners.
<strong>Note:�</strong>
Be very clear and let them know you are merely window shopping for termite inspection costs for the time being, and let them know you appreciate their time and their effort to help you out but would need more time to make a commitment and a decision.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="factors-to-consider-for-termite-fumigation-cost"><strong>Factors to Consider For Termite Fumigation Cost?</strong></h2>
<p>Despite that you might want the termite problem eliminated immediately, you will need to consider the agencies you hire carefully.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether you are in the market for pre-treatment or total termite damage control, a standard termite inspection will entail a thorough visual inspection in all areas of your home, including hard-to-reach places.</li>
<li>Dont hesitate to ask questions about their extent of service and details of treatment procedures. After inspection, a reputable termite company will provide written details of findings and the total areas of treatment coverage. Make sure you keep this for future reference.</li>
<li>Termite inspection procedures and time frames will vary for each home. Naturally, a bigger home will need more time to assess, but sometimes smaller homes can be more tedious.</li>
<li>As long as you feel your home has been thoroughly inspected according to the written guidelines of your agency, and youre satisfied with it, then you know you made the right choice.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="questions-for-termite-exterminators">Questions for Termite Exterminators</h2>
<h3 id="1-can-you-provide-references">1. Can you provide references?</h3>
<p>Request the prospective companies to provide references for past clients. After receiving the references, make a call to them and inquire about the quality and success of the services offered by the prospective company you are considering.</p>
<h3 id="2-experience-level">2. Experience Level?</h3>
<p>To determine how well the company can undertake the pest control process, you need to know the total years that the firm has worked in offering similar services.
Therefore, you require contacting the EPA and the Better Business Bureau to know if some cases or complaints are filed against the prospective firm.</p>
<h3 id="3-are-companies-and-personnel-licensed">3. Are companies and personnel licensed?</h3>
<p>The prospective must prove that they have at least one licensed and certified termite fumigant applicator. Further, you should verify the licenses of the insecticide applicators by contacting the State Departments of Agriculture.</p>

termite fumigation
and using the
best termite killers
.
<em>In summary, termite prevention starts by reducing the wood-to-soil contract around the structures, remove the cardboard, paper, mulch, plants, wood, or lumber near the structure&rsquo;s foundation. Also, build a 4-inch termite barrier between your house and the mulch.�</em>

<h2 id="4-indoor-termite-prevention-tips">4 Indoor Termite Prevention Tips</h2>
<h3 id="1-seal-windows-and-doors-tightly">1. Seal Windows and Doors Tightly</h3>
<p>Also, close up openings that termites may use in your house (using caulk, grout, and cement), fix leaks in the indoor spaces, open blocked vents, clear shrubs and trees around the structures.
So, seal off the windows and doors to prevent the termites&rsquo; entry form where they&rsquo;d eat up the structure&rsquo;s wooden skeleton. Besides, on rooftops and siding, seal up the crevices and cracks.
Notably, termites are small in size and may even get into the house through spaces under the doors or even via broken glass. Inspect for any possible entry points for the termites.

<h3 id="2-clear-wood-cellulose-debris-and-timber">2. Clear Wood, Cellulose, Debris, and Timber</h3>
<p>Avoid pilling up wood debris or store firewood around the house and conduct appropriate termite inspection (see also the
termite inspection costs
).
So, clear wood, cellulose, debris, and timber that&rsquo;s lying around, under, or in your house or structures. The materials have cellulose that&rsquo;s good food for
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">subterranean termites (treatment)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>and will thus attract the bugs to the indoor spaces.
Wood and other related materials around the house will hide signs of termite attack. Thus, clear all the dead leaves or debris and wood and wooden pieces that may be lying around your structures and property.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-mop-up-plus-repair-leaking-pipes-and-traps">3. Mop Up Plus Repair Leaking Pipes and Traps</h3>
<p>To prevent and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/top-7-natural-termite-control-can-easily/">control termites</a>
in the indoor spaces, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the soil that&rsquo;s near your structure&rsquo;s foundation dry (with good drainage and grading).
So, net, you&rsquo;ll need to repair all the leaking pipes and taps in the indoor spaces. Also, check on the overflow pipes for hot water inside, around, or under the house. This will prevent an attack from the subterranean termites.
Also, mop up any moisture around and inside the house as this could easily rear a colony of termites. Termites love basins of water in the house, and hence you must keep your house dry and adequately aerated.

<h3 id="4-inspect-wooden-floors-and-furniture">4. Inspect Wooden Floors and Furniture</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to inspect the wooden floors and furniture. This will also involve inspecting the wooden structures, wooden beams, and joists since termites hide and feed on the cellulose.
Further, you must inspect and clean up the hardwood floors in your house to ensure the termites won&rsquo;t be hiding or chewing your wooden structures.
Also, block all the open floor vents and openings since poor ventilation may cause a rise in moisture and humidity in your property - this increases the risk of termite infestation.
Clothes may also attract termites into your house, and thus you&rsquo;ll need to remove the clothing piles. Clothes also have cellulose and hence will attract and feed termites.</p>
<h2 id="3-indoor-termite-prevention-tips">3 Indoor Termite Prevention Tips</h2>
<h3 id="1-use-galvanized-post-or-create-2-inch-clearance-for-wooden-fences">1. Use Galvanized post or Create 2-Inch Clearance for Wooden Fences</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll create some 2-Inch Clearance as you set up your wooden fences plus their supporting posts from the soil. Definitely, the wooden timbers lying on the
soil would rear a termite
colony.
Therefore, I would recommend using the galvanized post to elevate the wood from the soil and deny the termites an easy reach to feed on the insects.
Next, repair and bits of the roof that&rsquo;s broken. Further, clear all the woodpiles that may be stacked around your property, including tree trunks, damp or rotten logs.
Ensure you only install the termite-treated fence posts and walls, particularly for the perimeter and garden beds, to prevent termite attacks in the yard.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7IbkX07S24">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7IbkX07S24</a></p>
<h3 id="2-clear-dead-tree-stumps">2. Clear Dead Tree Stumps</h3>
<p>However, ensure that the yard or garden remains clean and neat - including clearing the overgrowth by trimming the grass and
flower bed weeds
.
Next, you&rsquo;ll clean the stumps and dead trees. Termites love the wood cellulose from the stumps and dead trees. Therefore, remove these dead food sources to prevent attacks from termites.
Prevent bushy gardens and climbing plants from growing around your structures and house. Such plants may provide food for the termites plus a ladder for the insects to climb onto wooden parts of your structures.</p>
<h3 id="3-inspect-and-repair-termite-shielding">3. Inspect and Repair Termite Shielding</h3>
<p>Keenly inspect and repair any broken or compromised termite shielding. These would allow you to detect the presence of termites during random inspections easily.
Also, ensure that you uproot any roots that may be tending to break into the house foundation. Avoid planting trees with strong roots that could break the slab and allow termites to gain entry into your house.
Take note of any home addition or alterations as some of these could tamper with already installed termite barriers. Installing some new plumbing, concrete slab, awnings, or gazebo? Well, do a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">termite barrier audit after this process</a>
.
Remove all the timber form-work as this may provide an easy avenue for the termite to attack your house. Finally, don&rsquo; dump air conditioning liquids or hot water near the house foundation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>For the outdoor spaces, termite prevention is an equal tasking job for homeowners. Thus, below I&rsquo;ve outlined the steps you can take to protect the exterior of your house, including the perimeter.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keeping a tarantula is not for the weak-hearted. Only a professional enthusiast or an award-winning entomologist should have a cobalt blue tarantula in their home. Let&rsquo;s start by talking about <a href="/posts/selecting-and-caring-for-a-live-christmas-tree/">caring</a> for your cobalt blue tarantula spider.
<strong>Overview of Cobalt Blue Tarantula:�</strong>
Cobalt blue tarantulas are named after the color of their legs. In comparison, their bodies and carapaces are drab, with a grayish-blue color.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, this blue appears only in high light; otherwise, they appear black or very dark gray.
They have a glittery metallic look reflected off the hairs when you can see the blue. The color of some hairs can even be white or yellow.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Cobalt Blue Tarantula&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="care-guidance-for-a-cobalt-blue-tarantula"><strong>Care Guidance for a Cobalt Blue Tarantula</strong></h2>
<p>They are native to Myanmar but also originate in Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Singapore. They make deep burrows in the ground to live in tropical woods. When it&rsquo;s time to search for food, these tarantulas depart their lairs.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if you want to keep one as a pet, you must recreate their natural environment. It must be warm and humid, with plenty of burrowing substrate.
Cobalt blue tarantulas are medium-sized spiders that grow quickly, molting every four to six months. When spiderlings attain sexual maturity, they reveal their gender. Males develop a blue-gray color, while females remain blue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-feeding-and-diet"><strong>1. Feeding and Diet</strong></h3>
<p>A
<a href="https://www.topflightdubia.com/cobalt-blue-tarantula-care">cobalt blue tarantula</a>
only emerges from its burrow when it&rsquo;s time to eat, and these spiders are formidable predators.
They move fast and seize prey at the burrow&rsquo;s farthest margins. They pull it back to their lair and consume it alive after injecting it with poisonous venom.
<strong>Categories of Food</strong>
Amphibians, insects such as cockroaches and crickets, mice, and other spiders are eaten by cobalt blues. Some people label their eating habits as &ldquo;greedy&rdquo; because they need a lot of energy to keep up with their quick growth.
Whatever they eat must be smaller than their carapace and must be alive and fresh, rather than frozen or dead. Each week, they can consume up to five huge insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not a good idea to feed your tarantula insects such as crickets or<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-cockroaches/">cockroaches</a>from your yard. To guarantee they&rsquo;re clear of worms or parasites, buy them from a pet food shop instead.
However, there isn&rsquo;t much you can do if a bug slips into your spider&rsquo;s enclosure and starts eating it. Just make sure any leftovers are thrown away.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-lifespan-and-health-concerns"><strong>2. Lifespan and Health Concerns</strong></h3>
<p>Female cobalt blue tarantulas can live for 20 to 25 years in captivity. Males have a shorter lifespan than females, ranging from five to ten years. They can live up to 30 or 20 years in the wild, depending on the species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common health problem for these arachnids in captivity is staying hydrated. They frequently become dehydrated. Critical factors for the roach include a moist substrate, water + humidity.
Also, if you don&rsquo;t clean the tank at least once a month, uneaten food might cause bacterial concerns in the substrate. If leftovers are left out for too long, parasites and mites might infect the tarantula.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-nature-of-conduct"><strong>3. Nature of Conduct</strong></h3>
<p>Cobalt blue tarantulas spend most of their time underground in burrows. They will come out at night to eat or build a spider web. They are usually pretty placid, yet they can be highly defensive and &ldquo;touchy&rdquo; in humans&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When threatened, cobalt blue tarantulas are not afraid to attack anyone or anything.
They also have a strong bite that injects a little amount of poison into its victim. Aside from that, they are peaceful, chill, and docile. To keep them occupied, they do not require a lot of exploration space or other sophisticated toys.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-molting-process"><strong>4. Molting Process</strong></h3>
<p>They will cease feeding when they start shedding or molting skin. They will lie down on their backs on the substrate and appear to be dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see something like this, do not be alarmed; it&rsquo;s very normal.
Exoskeleton removal might take anywhere from 15 minutes to many hours. During this time, do not touch or bother the spider because it could lead to their death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-procreation-habits"><strong>5. Procreation Habits</strong></h3>
<p>When a male is ready to reproduce, he makes a little silk sack to deposit his sperm inside.
He then stores this in his pedipalps and seeks out a female to mate with. If she accepts, a perilous and life-threatening mating ritual will be followed by them.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-safeguard-the-cobalt-blue-tarantula"><strong>How to Safeguard the Cobalt Blue Tarantula</strong></h2>
<p>The best way to keep a Cobalt blue tarantula secure is to learn everything there is to know about them before obtaining one as a pet, and there is a lot to learn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn as much as you can about the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-wall-gecko-poisonous-if-eaten/">animal&rsquo;s behavior in the wild</a>and in captivity. Then you will want to make sure your tarantula comes from a trustworthy breeder. Do not get one that has just been caught in the wild.
Then, to ensure that the tarantula&rsquo;s surroundings are to its liking, make sure you have a large enough glass tank with a secure top. Other pets, big or tiny, should be kept away from your tarantula.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-humans-face-a-threat-from-the-cobalt-blue-tarantula"><strong>Do Humans Face a Threat from the Cobalt Blue Tarantula?</strong></h2>
<p>Cobalt blues are naturally defensive; therefore if they feel threatened, they will attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>The good news is that no one has died or been seriously injured as a result of a bite from this spider.�When a cobalt blue tarantula stomps the ground and raises its legs, you know it is preparing to attack.
This is a signal to take a step back. They will also roll their teeth back or extend them forward to show them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-sum-up"><strong>To Sum Up</strong></h2>
<p>This is�the complete guide to caring for a cobalt blue tarantula -�If you want to buy your first tarantula, we encourage you to consider this species after carefully reading the care instructions above. They must eat a specific diet and live in a specific environment to thrive.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ticks may be tiny, but their ability to spread diseases makes them a major health concern. These blood-sucking parasites thrive in grassy, wooded areas, latching onto humans and pets to transmit illnesses that range from mildly irritating to downright deadly.
Whether youre an outdoor enthusiast or just walking your dog, understanding <a href="/posts/how-long-do-ticks-live-on-humans/">tick</a>-borne diseases is crucial for staying safe.�In this comprehensive guide, well explore the most common tick-related illnesses, their symptoms, and practical
steps to protect yourself
. Lets get started and arm you with the knowledge to tackle these creepy crawlies!</p>
<h2 id="why-tick-borne-diseases-matter">Why Tick-Borne Diseases Matter</h2>
<p>Ticks arent just a summertime nuisancetheyre active year-round in many regions, especially where climates are mild. According to the CDC, tick-borne diseases have been on the rise, with over 50,000 cases of Lyme disease alone reported annually in the U.S. But Lyme is just the tip of the iceberg.
From Rocky Mountain spotted fever to tick paralysis, these illnesses can cause serious health issues if not addressed quickly. Awareness is your first line of defense, so lets dive into the specifics of each disease.</p>
<h2 id="1-lyme-disease-the-tick-borne-titan">1. Lyme Disease: The Tick-Borne Titan</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Lyme disease tops the list as the most well-known tick-borne illness. Its caused by the bacterium</dt>
<dt><em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em></dt>
<dt>and spread primarily by the black-legged tick, often called the deer tick due to its preference for deer hosts.</dt>
<dt><strong>Symptoms of Lyme Disease</strong></dt>
<dt>Early signs typically appear within</dt>
<dt><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-ticks-live-on-humans/">3-30 days of a bite</a></dt>
<dd>fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and the hallmark bulls-eye rash (erythema migrans). This rash, which looks like a red ring around a clear center, shows up in about 70-80% of cases. If ignored, Lyme can spread to joints (causing arthritis), the nervous system (leading to facial palsy or memory issues), and even the heart (triggering irregular beats).
<strong>Treatment and Outlook</strong>
Caught early, antibiotics like doxycycline or amoxicillin clear it up within weeks. Delayed treatment, however, might mean longer recovery and chronic symptoms for some.
**Fun Fact **
Lyme disease got its name from Lyme, Connecticut, where it was first identified in the 1970s after a cluster of mysterious arthritis cases in kids.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="2-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever-a-silent-killer">2. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever: A Silent Killer</h2>
<p>Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) isnt confined to the Rockiesits found across the Americas. The culprits? American dog ticks, brown dog ticks, and Rocky Mountain wood ticks carrying
<em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em>
.
**Symptoms to Spot **
Within 2-14 days of a bite, you might notice fever, a spotted rash (starting on wrists and ankles), nausea, vomiting, and muscle pain. That rash can turn into small, bruise-like spots if the disease progresses. Without treatment, RMSF can damage blood vessels, leading to organ failure or death.
**Why Its Urgent **
RMSF can escalate fastsometimes within daysso antibiotics are a must. Doxycycline is the go-to, even for kids.
**Historical Note **
RMSF was first documented in the late 1800s in the Rocky Mountain region, but today, the Southeast U.S. sees more cases.</p>
<h2 id="3-anaplasmosis-the-white-blood-cell-attacker">3. Anaplasmosis: The White Blood Cell Attacker</h2>
<p>Anaplasmosis, caused by
<em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em>
, is another black-legged tick specialty. It targets white blood cells, weakening your immune response.
**What to Expect **
Symptoms hit within 1-2 weeks: fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, and fatigue. Severe cases might involve confusion, low blood counts, or kidney issues.
**Treatment **
Like Lyme, anaplasmosis responds well to doxycycline. Early action prevents complications, especially in older adults.</p>
<h2 id="4-babesiosis-a-red-blood-cell-invader">4. Babesiosis: A Red Blood Cell Invader</h2>
<p>Babesiosis comes from
<em>Babesia</em>
parasites, also carried by black-legged ticks. Its like malarias distant cousin, attacking red blood cells.
**Symptoms **
Look for fever, chills, sweats, fatigue, and body aches. In severe casesespecially for those without a spleen or with weak immunityit can cause hemolytic anemia, jaundice, or organ failure.
**Whos at Risk? **
The elderly and immunocompromised are most vulnerable, but anyone can get it.
**Treatment Tip **
A combo of antiparasitic drugs (like atovaquone) and antibiotics often does the trick.</p>
<h2 id="5-ehrlichiosis-lone-stars-legacy">5. Ehrlichiosis: Lone Stars Legacy</h2>
<p>The lone star tick, identifiable by a white dot on its back, spreads ehrlichiosis via
<em>Ehrlichia</em>
bacteria.
**Symptoms **
Fever, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue start within 1-2 weeks. Untreated, it can lead to respiratory distress, bleeding issues, or organ damage.
**Treatment **
Doxycycline works here toospeed is key to avoiding long-term trouble.</p>
<h2 id="6-tick-paralysis-a-toxin-driven-threat">6. Tick Paralysis: A Toxin-Driven Threat</h2>
<p>Tick paralysis isnt a bacterial or parasitic diseaseits caused by a neurotoxin from ticks like the American dog tick.
**How It Works **
Symptoms begin with leg weakness, moving upward to full-body paralysis over hours or days. If the tick stays attached, it can stop your breathing.
<strong>The Fix�</strong>
Remove the tick with tweezers, and most people recover within hours. No antibiotics neededjust swift action.
<strong>Weird Fact�</strong>
Kids are more prone to tick paralysis, possibly due to their smaller body size.</p>
<h2 id="7-tularemia-beyond-ticks">7. Tularemia: Beyond Ticks</h2>
<p>Tularemia, caused by
<em>Francisella tularensis</em>
,
spreads via dog ticks
, deer ticks, and even contaminated water or animal contact (think rabbits).
**Symptoms **
Fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue are common. It can escalate to pneumonia or skin ulcers depending on how it enters your body.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, I will discuss how to naturally control (compared to other
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-termite-killer/">termite treatments</a>
) and eliminate termites without hiring a professional.
Termites have been reported to cause massive damage to buildings each year.
As a result, expensive rebuilding is done to repair their damage. However, if you suspect a termite infestation, dont panic.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Termite Control&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="7-natural-termite-control">7 Natural Termite Control</h2>
<p>It would help if you took swift action to
control termite
infestation because they can cause significant damage over time. Also, if you dont contain the problem of
termite infestation early
, you can end up incurring thousands, if not millions of dollars in repairs, as well as costly termite pest control.
But First! It is essential for you to correctly identify types of termites and all signs of termite infestation before deciding on the best natural method to get rid of the termite infestation.
<strong>1. Borax Solution for Termites</strong>
Sodium borate also is known as the borax solution, helps to kill
subterranean termites
. Youll need to apply sodium borate powder or sodium borate solution to the targeted region to get better results. A sodium borate solution is a mixture of borax and water.
The borax solution is environmentally friendly and does not affect either humans or pests. You can apply borate solution by spraying or painting it on surfaces of wood of newly built buildings. Application of the borax solution can help avert future termite infestation in your residence.
Heres a kicker!!
Always repeat the application of the borax solution until the entire colony of termites is eliminated. You can also decide to use borate treatments combined with other natural
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-termites/">termite treatment for an effective</a>
outcome.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZFXPLG_Uy0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZFXPLG_Uy0</a>
<strong>2. Parasitic Nematodes for Termites</strong>
Nematodes are worm species that love to feed on termites. If you have a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/home-remedy-for-termites/">termite infestation in your home</a>
or business premises, release Nematodes into a colony, the Nematodes will eat up all the termites causing havoc on your premises.
You can purchase nematodes at local pet stores. You can also purchase it online, as many online stores stock it. Nematodes are safe to use. They are not harmful to humans, pets, or plants. They mainly concentrate on pests and ruin their colony within a short period.
Important Point to Note!! If you are not using the Nematodes immediately, store them in a refrigerator. Also, Use the Nematodes after sunset or early in the morning.
<strong>3. Sunlight exposure</strong>
Sunlight is one of the most inexpensive methods to get rid of termites. Termites prefer darkness, and they die when exposed to light or heat.
For your wooden furniture, such as tables and chairs infested with the termite, sunlight treatment for 2-3 days would be the best termite control technique. The sunlight will kill the termites and avert their spread.
If you cant get your furniture out because of unavoidable circumstances, you can purchase or rent UV lamps, which have an equal effect on the suns rays. Take the UV lamps and shine it towards the termite infestation.
<strong>4. Getting Rid Of Moisture to Kill Termites</strong>
Termites flourish and multiply quickly in areas that have excessive water moisture. Therefore, ensure that all parts of the room and building are kept dry. Also, you need to repair structures that are prone to moisture.
Keeping all wooden items dry will also help you counter termite attacks. Its important for moisture to not get into the wood as such conditions would attract termites.
It is also vital you inspect the building&rsquo;s perimeter to ascertain that there are no water leakages that might affect the foundation and cause termite infestation.
<strong>5. Using Botanical Treatments to Kill Termites</strong>
Some of the most effective
natural botanical treatments used to kill
termites are orange oil and Neem oil.
Orange oil:�Orange oil has an active compound referred to as d-limonene. D-limonene has a potent formulation that enables it to kill termites instantly. Orange
oil treatment is also useful
in eliminating colonies of Dry wood termite.
Neem
oil: N
eem oil is also a top-rated botanical treatment for killing termites. This oil is obtained from the Asian neem tree. When using neem oil to eliminate termites, ensure you apply it in their colonies so that the termites will directly ingest it and die.�Remember!!�If you want a quick result, repeat Neem oil&rsquo;s application several times until the whole colony is killed.
<strong>6. Cardboard Trap to Kill Termites</strong>
The use of cardboard is the most non-toxic and
natural termite killer recipe
. Cardboard traps are considered effective as they have an important compound called cellulose, which attracts female termites.
The cellulose enables the cardboard to offer a woody smell, which in turn attracts the termites. To make the smell even more appealing, you can lightly spray the cardboard with water.
Then, place the moistened cardboard close to the target area. After a short period,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-prevention/">termites will cling on top</a>
of the cardboard. Collect the cardboard and get rid of it through burning.
<strong>7. Use Boric Acid to Kill Termites</strong>
Boric acid is an important natural
home remedy that dehydrates the bugs
and halts their nervous system.
For the best result, you can spray or coat the wood with the acid. You can also lightly dust
boric acid
into wall voids, cracks, crevices, or other places the pests are likely to hide.
Boric acid acts by sticking
on the antennae, legs, and bodies of termites. These pests consume the boric acid during grooming, which is poisonous for them, hence dying instantly.
Important Precaution: Boric acid is toxic if inhaled. For your safety, you should always use gloves and masks while using it. Ensure your children and pets dont come into contact with this acid because of its toxic properties.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-termites">Types of Termites</h2>
<p>Drywood Termites:�If your residence or business is infested with Drywood termites, youll notice wood that is not directly in contact with the ground is eaten up.
Drywood termites are easy to identify since they dont build earthen mud tubes. A sure way to confirm a dry wood termite infestation is by looking out for hard, dry fecal capsules that normally form piles.
Drywood termites attack all kinds of dry wood. Further, they sometimes attack furniture or other wood products, especially in those that would normally not have this kind of termites.
Subterranean Termites:�On the other hand, the subterranean termites live underground and depend on the soil for moisture and colony formation.
Youll identify subterranean termite infestation on your building&rsquo;s external walls when you see tubes made of mud, wood chips, and soft fecal matter directed towards the wood product.
Below are the top termite killer recipes that will guarantee you a termite-free residence within the shortest time possible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that you are informed on the Natural Termite Control Methods You Can Easily Do, youll easily prevent or eliminate termite infestation on your premises.
For effective results, you can combine one method with the other, especially when treating a problematic termite colony. These
natural home</p>
<p>remedies
guarantee maximum safety because they dont contain harmful chemicals.</p>

<h3 id="1-how-severe-is-the-weather-in-your-area"><strong>1. How Severe Is The Weather In Your Area?</strong></h3>
<p>It is important to note that each part of the world experiences a different weather pattern. For example, some places might get heavy snows during winter while others minimal or none.
Other areas may experience heavy rains or storms while others minimal to none.�So its upon you to know the magnitude of snow or weather conditions you usually experience in your area. Hence, get to choose a cover that fits your individual needs.
However, you can decide to be all-round and select a cover that will protect your trampoline against all kinds of weather. Read Also:

Trampoline Covers ensures that your trampoline remains safe from leaves, debris, dirt, or snow that may pile up due to changing weather conditions. If adequately covered, your trampoline can withstand the test of time and weather, and even maintain its original new look.
Before making that ultimate choice of buying the best trampoline cover, there are a few things you need to consider. Hence, weve outlined what you need to consider before purchasing a trampoline.</p>
<h3 id="2-type-of-trampoline-">**2. Type Of Trampoline **</h3>
<p>What type of trampoline is in your backyard? It is good to note that its quite tricky to get covers for square trampolines, oval trampolines, and springless trampolines.
Therefore, if you own any of these trampolines, you might need to modify the already available covers to fit your structure.
For instance, if you own an in-ground trampoline and you need a cover for it; you can buy the usual trampoline cover installed on above-ground trampolines. Just enlarge the holes to enable secure attachment on the hooks of the cover.
For a springless trampoline, you should purchase a cover that is a little larger than your structure to make it easy to attach to the metal frame of your trampoline.
Further, Trampoline covers make it easier to remove snow that may accumulate on top of your trampoline. Heavy snow can be a risk factor for a trampoline as it makes the springs and nets overstretch losing their elasticity, thus making the jumping surface a danger zone.
Trampoline Covers are an essential investment. Choosing one that would adequately protect your trampoline from harsh winter or other severe weather should be your priority.

Trampolines are made in a variety of sizes and shapes like oval, rectangular, or round among other shapes. Their diameters can vary from 7ft to 16 ft.
The bottom line is: Take correct measurements to get the right cover size for your trampoline.�If youre uncertain about the size or diameter of your trampoline, check the manufacturers manual and get the correct dimensions of your structure.

But, with regular snow removal, all this can be avoided. The trampoline covers make routine removal of snow an easier task.�Furthermore, trampoline covers protect your trampoline from harsh weather. So the damage is minimized.</p>

When buying your cover, ensure that the drainage hole is present. The drainage hole prevents water from amassing on the bed. The weight of the water may prompt massive damage to your trampoline.
Another tip to look out for when buying your trampoline cover is the quality of the straps. Quality straps will attach firmly on to the frame of the trampoline giving your whole structure protection.
Most trampoline manufacturers recommend buying a PVC trampoline cover as it offers excellent protection to trampoline all year round. Read Also:

<h3 id="3-the-trampoline-frame-can-remain-in-the-backyard-">**3. The Trampoline Frame Can Remain in the Backyard **</h3>
<p>You may also choose to leave the frame of the trampoline standing outside. But, first, you should remove the pads and bed of the trampoline. If do not have sufficient space to store it, you can use a trampoline cover to minimize damage.
Trampoline pads and bed are likely to get ruined by heavy snow or harsh weather; hence, its good to put them away, but be cautious of rodents. Trampoline frames are made from durable and rust-resistant material, therefore, can withstand harsh weather conditions.
Cleaning will help to remove dirt or any pests and their larvae which might have taken refuge on the trampoline. Also, after cleaning, let the structure dry up thoroughly to prevent it from getting mildew. Read Also:

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When youre not planning on using your trampoline during winter, it is good to disassemble while carefully keeping all the accessories in a dry, cool area.
This habit will protect your trampoline from extreme temperatures and frequent exposure to ice or snow, which can result in cracking of the safety pads.</p>

      <title>True or False Can Rodents Enter Homes Through Toilets</title>

      <description>Rodents are notorious for finding their way into homes through various entry points, but can they really come through toilets?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rodents are notorious for finding their way into homes through various entry points, but can they really come through toilets?</p>
<p>This question might sound like something out of a horror movie, but it&rsquo;s a real concern for many homeowners. Let&rsquo;s explore whether rodents can actually use toilets as a pathway into your home.
<strong>Understanding Rodent Behavior</strong>
To understand how rodents might enter your home through toilets, it&rsquo;s important to know a bit about their behavior.</p>
<p>Rats and mice are adept at squeezing through small openings, with mice being able to fit through holes as small as a dime and rats through holes the size of a quarter. They are also excellent climbers and can navigate through pipes and plumbing systems.
<strong>Sewer Systems and Rodent Entry</strong>
One of the primary concerns with rodents entering homes through toilets involves the sewer system.</p>
<p>In older or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner/">poorly maintained sewer systems</a>
, there can be gaps, cracks, or openings that allow rodents to enter. Rats, especially, are known to swim through sewer lines and can surface in toilets if there is a direct connection.
<strong>How They Can Enter Through Toilets</strong>
While it&rsquo;s not very common, rodents can indeed enter homes through toilets under certain circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sewer Line Connections</strong>: In older homes or in regions where plumbing infrastructure is outdated, there may be direct connections between the sewer line and toilet pipes. Rats, being good swimmers, can enter through the sewer line and swim up into the toilet bowl.</li>
<li><strong>Broken Pipes</strong>: If there are any breaks or cracks in the sewer pipes, rodents can find their way into the system and potentially into your home.</li>
<li><strong>Faulty Seals</strong>: If the seals around the toilet pipes are not properly maintained or installed, they could create an opening large enough for a rodent to enter.
<strong>Preventing Rodents from Entering Through Toilets</strong>
Prevention is key when it comes to keeping rodents out of your home:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspect and Seal</strong>: Regularly inspect your plumbing system and make sure there are no gaps or openings that rodents could exploit. Seal any cracks or holes in the walls, floors, or foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Your Sewer Lines</strong>: Keep your sewer lines and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-use-a-plunger/">plumbing in good repair</a>. Replace old pipes and faulty seals to prevent rodents from entering.</li>
<li><strong>Use Guards</strong>: Consider using a one-way sewer valve or sewer grate to prevent rodents from entering the sewer line.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Your Toilet Lid Closed</strong>: Although this won&rsquo;t prevent rodents from entering through the pipes, keeping the toilet lid closed when not in use can prevent rodents from entering the bowl.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Help</strong>: If you suspect you have a rodent problem, contact a pest control professional who can help identify entry points and eliminate the problem.
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
While rodents can enter homes through toilets, it&rsquo;s not a common occurrence in well-maintained and modern plumbing systems. By regularly inspecting and maintaining your plumbing, you can greatly reduce the chances of rodents using your toilet as a pathway into your home.</li>
<li>If you suspect a rodent problem, it&rsquo;s important to take action quickly to prevent further entry and potential damage.
In conclusion, while the idea of rodents entering through toilets may be unsettling, with proper precautions and maintenance, you can protect your home from these unwanted visitors.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microphones are essential tools for content creators,
musicians
, podcasters, and professionals in broadcasting, live sound, and video production. But with so many types available, how do you choose the right one?</p>
<p>In this
<strong>complete guide</strong>
, well break down the
<strong>5 main types of microphones</strong>
, their pros and cons, and the best uses for eachhelping you make an informed decision for crystal-clear audio.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-microphones-work-an-overview"><strong>How Do Microphones Work? (An Overview)</strong></h2>
<p>Before diving into <a href="/posts/microphone-polar-patterns/">microphone</a> types, its helpful to understand how they capture sound. All microphones convert
<strong>sound waves into electrical signals</strong>
, but they do so in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Dynamic Mics:**Use a moving coil in a magnetic field (durable, great for loud sounds).</li>
<li>**Condenser Mics:**Use a charged diaphragm for high sensitivity (ideal for studio recordings).</li>
<li>**Ribbon Mics:**Use a thin metal ribbon for smooth, vintage sound (best for professional studios).</li>
<li>**Lavalier Mics:**Small clip-on mics for hands-free use (perfect for interviews &amp; videos).</li>
<li>**Shotgun Mics:**Highly directional for focused sound capture (used in film &amp; TV).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using painter&rsquo;s tape to create unique wall designs is a fantastic way to add creativity to any room. With just a few basic materials, you can transform a plain wall into an eye-catching work of art. Here are some innovative wall <a href="/posts/how-to-remove-paint-from-walls/">paint</a> design ideas using tape to inspire your next home makeover.</p>
<h2 id="1-geometric-shapes">1. Geometric Shapes</h2>
<p>Geometric shapes are a modern and trendy way to design your walls using tape. Start by taping off various shapes such as squares, triangles, or diamonds. Use painter&rsquo;s tape to create clean lines and ensure sharp edges. Once taped off, apply contrasting paint colors to each section, and you&rsquo;ll have a bold, contemporary design.</p>
<h2 id="2-stripes">2. Stripes</h2>
<p>Stripes are a timeless design that can make a room feel more spacious and stylish. Whether you opt for vertical, horizontal, or diagonal stripes, painter&rsquo;s tape is your best friend in achieving crisp, straight lines. Try alternating between bold colors and muted tones to create a playful yet sophisticated effect.</p>
<h2 id="3-ombre-effect">3. Ombre Effect</h2>
<p>An ombre <a href="/posts/best-paint-brushes-for-walls/">wall</a> design transitions from one color to another, creating a soft gradient effect. You can achieve this by taping off sections of your wall and blending multiple shades of paint together. The painter&rsquo;s tape will help you create clean boundaries while the paint flows smoothly from light to dark or vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="4-chevron-patterns">4. Chevron Patterns</h2>
<p>The chevron pattern is another trendy design that looks great on walls. To create a chevron pattern, use painter&rsquo;s tape to form a zigzag shape across the wall. This design is perfect for adding visual interest to an otherwise plain wall and works well in both modern and traditional settings.</p>
<h2 id="5-abstract-art">5. Abstract Art</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling particularly artistic, consider using painter&rsquo;s tape to create abstract art on your walls. Tape off random shapes and sections, then fill them in with different paint colors or textures. This design allows for maximum creativity and can add a unique touch to your home.</p>
<h2 id="6-accent-wall">6. Accent Wall</h2>
<p>Create a stunning focal point in any room by using painter&rsquo;s tape to create a design on one accent wall. For example, you can tape off a large rectangle or square and paint it in a bold color, or use multiple strips of tape to create diagonal lines or other patterns that stand out.</p>
<h2 id="7-triangular-design">7. Triangular Design</h2>
<p>Using painter&rsquo;s tape to create a triangular design is a great way to make a bold statement. Tape off a large triangle or several smaller ones and fill them in with different shades of color for a dynamic, modern look. Triangular designs can be placed on any wall to create a striking visual effect.</p>
<h2 id="8-simple-borders">8. Simple Borders</h2>
<p>Sometimes, a simple border around the edge of a room can create a sophisticated look. Use painter&rsquo;s tape to outline the perimeter of a wall or a section of the wall. Once youve taped off the area, paint the border in a contrasting color to make the room feel finished and polished.</p>
<h2 id="9-color-block-wall">9. Color Block Wall</h2>
<p>Color blocking involves painting large sections of the wall in contrasting or complementary colors. Use painter&rsquo;s tape to create clean lines between different color blocks. This design adds depth and dimension to a room and can be customized to fit any color scheme.</p>
<h2 id="10-polka-dots">10. Polka Dots</h2>
<p>For a playful and whimsical touch, try using painter&rsquo;s tape to create a pattern of polka dots on your walls. Simply tape off circles in various sizes and paint inside the sections. Once done, remove the tape to reveal crisp, perfect dots that add a fun and energetic vibe to any room.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-using-painters-tape">Tips for Using Painter&rsquo;s Tape</h2>
<ul>
<li>**Clean the wall:**Make sure the wall surface is clean and dry before applying tape to ensure good adhesion.</li>
<li>**Use quality tape:**Invest in high-quality painter&rsquo;s tape to prevent paint from bleeding under the tape.</li>
<li>**Press down the tape:**Press the tape firmly onto the wall to prevent any paint from seeping under the edges.</li>
<li>**Remove tape carefully:**Remove the tape while the paint is still wet to achieve the sharpest lines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wall paint design ideas with tape are an easy and cost-effective way to create stunning wall art without the need for stencils or advanced painting techniques. Whether you choose geometric shapes, stripes, or abstract art, the possibilities are endless when using painter&rsquo;s tape to design your walls. So, get creative and start transforming your walls into beautiful works of art today!</p>

But today I want to address the small brown insects that are slowly become a menace in our homes.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-small-brown-insects-in-my-kitchen"><strong>What Are Small Brown Insects In My Kitchen?</strong></h3>
<p>The small brown insects in your kitchen could be the
many kinds of pantry bugs
in our houses. There are many bugs that are brown in colour and more likely to be found in our kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of these bugs are harmless but their infestation in our kitchen and particularly in our food is totally unwelcome.</li>
<li>Though most of them cause no damage when consumed, it is highly discouraged since we cannot tell the possible outcome on your health.
I have identified a few of this brownish insects, their life cycle, and other characteristics. This will help you spot the actual insect in your kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-beetle-">**1. Beetle **</h3>
<p>This beetle is very common in our kitchens. Apart from kitchens, they are also found in
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-pantry-bugs-harmful-if-eaten/">food storage areas</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you leave your flour, cereals, spices, vegetables, or even drugs open, dont be surprised to find these beetles enjoying the meal.
They thrive well in temperatures above 23 C reproducing up to 5 times or more per year. However, their reproduction goes down if the temperatures go below 15C.
Keep your flour and packaged food tightly sealed if you really want to keep this pest out of your kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-silverfish-">**2. Silverfish **</h3>
<p>How do you know that brownish insects in your kitchen are silverfish? Well, silverfish has a colour ranging from white to brown-grey and others are bluish-silver in colour.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also identify them by their teardrop shape. And last but not least, you can identify them by their rear 3 long bristles.
Silverfish thrive in dark and also humid areas. Unlike other
pantry bugs, silverfish targets
where there are books and papers.
Due to their love for the humid and moist areas, you are most likely to find them in leaking kitchen sinks and bathrooms among other moist areas.</li>
<li>Toilets are also other areas you can find them as well as wardrobes because of clothes.
Though they dont pose any serious threat to humans, their presence in the kitchen and other home areas is irritating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ticks-">**3. Ticks **</h3>
<p>This is a tiny brown parasite that bugles after sucking blood. You are only likely to find them in your home if you have pets around. This is because they hardly move around unless with the help of a host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other bugs in our homes, ticks are parasites and also harmful. In the event that they suck blood from the host, either humans or pets, they can transmit Lyme disease.
They have 3 life cycles and in each case, they need to suck blood for survival. There are also very many species but in most cases, the adult stage is not so much active as the male dies after mating and the female lays eggs for the next cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-granary-weevil-">**4. Granary weevil **</h3>
<p>This is also another brown insect that you are likely to find in your kitchen. In most cases, this granary weevil is found in food stores and kitchens.
You can also find them in beans, rice, macaroni, and spaghetti, nuts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The egg is laid in the grain where it hatches intolarvae and feeds the inside of the grain. Though most of these weevils are small, their size also highly depends on the grain size.
They are found in almost all parts of the world and their economic significance cannot be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5cockroaches-">5.**Cockroaches **</h3>
<p>These are rather small insects that are reddish-brown in colour. You can also identify them by their oval body that is also flattened.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also have two long antennae and spiny legs.
They are some of the most stubborn pantry bugs in homes. You will literally find them almost in every area in your house, closets, and stores.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-these-bugs-harmful"><strong>Are these bugs harmful?</strong></h2>
<p>It is normal to get scared about the harm that can be caused by these insects. However, it is important to note that most of these bugs are harmless.</p>
<ul>
<li>At some point, you may find yourself eating such bugs without your knowledge. There is no need for getting scared though it should not be entertained.
In the case of ticks, they are parasitic and also harmful because they suck blood and can even cause Lyme disease.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-small-house-brown-bugs"><strong>How do you get rid of small house brown bugs?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-cleaning"><strong>1. Cleaning</strong></h3>
<p>If you have already identified the specific brown insects in your kitchen, the immediate question is how to control them.
Most insects thrive in damp and dirty environments. Keeping your kitchen clean and properly sanitized minimizes the chances of survival for most pests.</p>
<h3 id="2-disposing-of-infected-food-">**2. Disposing of infected food **</h3>
<p>If your feed is infected, one of the best ways of stopping any further multiplication of the pest is through
disposing of the infected feed
.</p>
<h3 id="3-using-traps-">**3. Using traps **</h3>
<p>A UV home trap will be most convenient to use to get rid of the pantry bugs. The insect control KATCHY trap is also very safe for use indoors.
This trap lures the insects through ultraviolet light and though it does not necessarily
kill them it traps
them and also helps reduce their population.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Silverfish</strong>are very tricky bugs to control because of their hideouts and complexity. Despite, the challenges to control it, you can still use insecticides to do it. Of most importance is to watch over kids and pets within your house.
<strong>Ticks</strong>
can be controlled by using acaricides in farms but this cannot be applied in our homes because of its effects and strong smell. Therefore if you have a large infestation of your home, I would recommend contacting a vet officer to deal with the issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-">**Final Thoughts **</h2>
<p>What are small insects in my kitchen? The highest probability is that you are having pantry bugs in your kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>These insects could be beetles, weevils, and silverfish among other bugs that have the same resemblance. A closer look at them and from some description given can tell what they really are.
If indeed these are pantry bugs, you can employ the appropriate control measures given or even others that are favourable to you.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas can be a nightmare for pet owners and homeowners alike. These tiny, blood-sucking insects can cause discomfort to pets and humans, leading to itching, irritation, and even serious health problems. If youre dealing with a <a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">flea</a> infestation, youll want to know what can kill fleas instantly to provide relief. In this article, well discuss effective solutions to eradicate fleas quickly and safely.</p>
<h2 id="1-flea-shampoos-for-pets">1. Flea Shampoos for Pets</h2>
<p>One of the quickest ways to kill fleas on pets is by using a flea shampoo designed for this purpose. These shampoos typically contain ingredients like pyrethrins, permethrin, or insect growth regulators (IGRs) that kill fleas on contact and offer long-lasting protection. Always follow the instructions carefully, as some flea shampoos may not be safe for certain animals, such as cats.</p>
<h2 id="2-flea-sprays">2. Flea Sprays</h2>
<p>Flea sprays are an excellent choice for treating both pets and the environment. Many sprays are formulated with ingredients like permethrin or imidacloprid, which kill fleas instantly. These sprays can be applied directly to your pets fur or used to treat your home and yard. Be sure to read the label for safety precautions, especially if you have young children or other pets in the household.</p>
<h2 id="3-diatomaceous-earth">3. Diatomaceous Earth</h2>
<p>Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural substance that can be used to kill fleas. Its a fine powder made from the fossilized remains of diatoms, which have sharp edges that can puncture the exoskeletons of fleas, causing them to dehydrate and die. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth around your home, paying special attention to areas where fleas are likely to hide, such as pet bedding and carpets. Leave it for a few hours or overnight, then vacuum it up.</p>
<h2 id="4-flea-bombs-or-foggers">4. Flea Bombs or Foggers</h2>
<p>If you have a severe flea infestation, flea bombs or foggers can be highly effective at killing fleas instantly. These products release insecticides into the air, which settle on surfaces and kill fleas. However, flea bombs should be used with caution, as they contain potent chemicals and may require the evacuation of the home during application. Follow all safety guidelines and ensure your pets and family members are out of the house while the bomb is in use.</p>
<h2 id="5-vacuuming-and-steam-cleaning">5. Vacuuming and Steam Cleaning</h2>
<p>Vacuuming your home regularly is one of the most effective ways to get rid of fleas. Vacuuming removes adult fleas, eggs, and larvae from carpets, furniture, and cracks in the floor. For an even more effective approach, use a steam cleaner, which can kill fleas at all stages of their life cycle, including eggs and larvae.

[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-causes-pantry-bugs-what-you-need-to-know">What Causes Pantry Bugs?-What You Need To Know.</h2>
<p>The most common cause of pantry bugs infestation is brought processed foods and dry foods into your house. This dry food could be, grains, cereals, fruits, vegetables, nuts, bran and others in your store.</p>
<ul>
<li>Processed foods like floor, chocolate, spaghetti, macaroni, bread, cookies, cheese, and candies are also possible attraction points.</li>
<li>Their infestation can occur either at the store or in your kitchen and therefore the need to constantly check on the packaging.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-cereal-and-grains-">**1. Cereal and grains **</h3>
<p>As earlier stated, bugs come into our house because they are looking for food. It is hard to find them if there is nothing to eat. Cereals like maize, rice, barley, wheat among others mostly attract weevils and beetles.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, weevils infest open cereals and grains where they lay eggs and continue in their multiplication.</li>
<li>They feed on these cereals where they lay eggs inside the grains where their life cycle starts. Their larvae stage eats and develops in the grain before the metamorphosis into adults.
Idianmeal moth, rice weevil, beetle, lay hundreds of eggs in the infested food making it inconsumable. The damage by these bugs is more of contamination than the food they consume.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-flour-mix-">**2. Flour mix� **</h3>
<p>Flour mix and other processed foods are very susceptible to attack by
floor weevils, wheat bugs, rice bugs and flour
. They are also visible on pasta, cakes, and any other mixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their destruction of flour and other foods leaves web-like traces, larvae and eggs making them inconsumable.</li>
<li>Some other times, you will also notice tiny brown insects on your floor as a sign of their infestation.
Among the many reasons why these bugs attack your flour is also keeping in humid and moist conditions. The other reason is leaving flour and other foods open and exposed to the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-other-processed-foods-">**3. Other processed foods **</h3>
<p>Spaghetti, noodles, biscuits and cookies, pet food, powder milk, processed chicken and fish among others are also subject to attack by these bugs.
If you have any of them in your house, keeping them open and disposed of is an invitation to the bugs.
Another possible invitation for
pantry bugs is dirt
. Though you may doubt this most pantries will thrive where the kitchen is poorly cleaned.</p>
<ul>
<li>That unemptied litter bin can easily attract the bugs and before you know it, your whole kitchen is full of bugs.
There are favourite foods that will draw them from miles away into your kitchen? Lets have a close look at what each of these foods will attract.

<p>There are certain bugs that you are most likely to find in your kitchen as compared to others. Some of these include beetles, Idianmeal moths, rice/grain weevil among others.</p>
<h3 id="1-bean-and-rice-weevils-">**1. Bean and Rice Weevils **</h3>
<p>Though there are very many weevil species, the most notorious pantry bug weevils are bean and rice weevils.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you find Small holes in the beans or rice grain, its already a sign of infestation by these weevils
One similarity with these weevils is that they both attack cereals and lay their eggs inside the grains and cereals.
<strong>But their differences are;</strong>
Rice weevil attacks, corn, rice cereals, wheat, dried fruits, apples, pears while bean weevil commonly attacks beans and peas.
In size, rice weevils are slightly bigger than bean weevils.
Also, rice weevils have a snout while bean weevil doesnt.
Bean weevils have a light brown colour and are oval-shaped while rice weevils are white and slender in shape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-idianmeal-moth"><strong>2. Idianmeal Moth</strong></h3>
<p>This is most probably the most visible pantry bug in our kitchen.� Unlike the weevils, the moths show up in your kitchen when searching for the best site for mating and lay their eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their most destructive stage is the larvae which are easy to find on flour, cereals, rice, nuts, and dried fruits among others.
The larvae leave behind a trail of webbing, poop and dead skin making it hard to consume the infested food. As the larvae mature and turn into moths that can be easily spotted flying around.
Though the food infested by these moths is not harmful, it is also not good for consumption and should be disposed of immediately.

in the kitchen. Most of these methods are more on preventing bug infestation than control
<strong>Check for open food packages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>open food is susceptible to infestation by these bugs. Whether it&rsquo;s deliberate opening or accidental opening. Food packaging should be properly and tightly sealed at all times.
<strong>Cleaning your kitchen-</strong>
most pantry bugs thrive in dirt, moist and humid environments. With proper cleaning and disposal of kitchen garbage, you eliminate their chances of survival in your kitchen.
<strong>First in, first out protocol-</strong>
to avoid packed food going bad in your store or kitchen, use the food bought first before you can embark on the last bought food.</li>
<li>On the same, use the food with closer expiry first as compared to those with a longer expiry date.</li>

smart omnivore
, this dragon either eats fruits, plant or animal products/ supplements.
Maybe you have come across a bearded dragon in the fields, zoo or probably own one and wonders what this reptile eats.
*So, what do Bearded Dragons Eat? Well, these reptiles feed on fruits such as tomatoes, apples, guavas, bananas, berries, figs, watermelons, mangoes, papayas, grapes, kiwi, apricots, pears or plums. *
<em>Bearded Dragons can also feed on vegetables/greens such as cabbages, celery, sweet potatoes, peas, green beans, courgette, butternut squash, okra, bell pepper, clover, turnip green, mustard green, coriander or collard/ kales.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-do-bearded-dragons-eat-7-tips">What Do Bearded Dragons Eat? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>Also, you can feed your bearded dragon with animals like crickets, earthworms, cockroaches, mealworms, waxworms, butter worms, Dubia roaches, silkworms, locust or king worms.</p>
<h3 id="1-fruits-eaten-bybearded-dragons">1. Fruits Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-tomatoes"><strong>a. Tomatoes�</strong></h4>
<p>Tomatoes are ideal meal for your bearded dragon
as they are the main source of vitamin A, which promotes good vision, skin development and protein synthesis.
However, it is dangerous to feed your dragon with excess of these fruits. Tomatoes contain oxalic acid (not easily excreted) which inhibits absorption of calcium needed for bone development.
Importantly, avoid feeding your pet bearded dragon with tomatos leaves, stem or flowers since these parts contain alkaloids such as solanine and tomatine, which negatively affects its health, and alter its physiological processes greatly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSH8c6AZ1k&amp;amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSH8c6AZ1k&amp;amp;t=2s</a></p>
<h4 id="b-apples"><strong>b. Apples�</strong></h4>
<p>Apples for bearded dragons
are an essential fruit as they contain 1% of vitamin A, 5% of Vitamin K and 14% of vitamin C, which enhances good vision and development. When feeding, it is necessary to peel the apples and slice them into sizable pieces that can be chewed and swallowed smoothly without chocking the lizard.
Apples have high-level Calories (95%) and 4g fibers per fruit that will boost your dragons energy and reduce indigestion problems.
Moreover, apples large quantities of magnesium and potassium minerals, which improves development and immune system of your Breaded Dragon.</p>
<h3 id="c-bananas"><strong>c. Bananas�</strong></h3>
<p>Peal your bananas and slice them into small pieces before feeding your bearded dragon if unripe. Most beardies wont eat banana peels unless they are grown under natural care.
You should feed your pet beardie with banana occasionally (maybe once or twice a month). Why because, bananas contain high levels of phosphorous that binds the calcium in the body (inhibits its intake) and thus may end up causing metabolic bone disease (calcium deficiency disease).</p>
<h3 id="d-berries"><strong>d. Berries�</strong></h3>
<p>Berries such as blackberries, raspberries, strawberries or blueberries can be fed to bearded dragon as they add extra water content to the blood stream. In addition, berries contain rich fiber-networks that improves digestion process - just like the
<em>cantaloupe.�</em>
Berries should be fed directly without peeling or mashing. However, wild picked berries should be cleaning thoroughly before feeding or you avoid them since they may contain toxins or harmful pests.
Blackberries are slightly harder and can be split for easier swallowing.�Blueberries should be given occasionally since they contain oxalates that binds calcium leading to metabolic bone disease.
<strong>e. Papaya and watermelon</strong>

feed your bearded dragons with cucumber
.
Though necessary, the excess water content found in these fruits may be dangerous as they may lead to over hydration and runny poo.�Therefore, it is recommended that you supplement these fruits with main meal and use them occasionally (twice per month).
<strong>f. Cherries and plums</strong>
Cherries have high level of potassium necessary for fluid balance regulation and blood pressure reduction. However, excess eating may lead to calcium inhibition and thus cherries should be fed once per week as a supplement to main meal.
Apart from water content addition, plums have fibers that help prevent constipation. It also contain iron, calcium and magnesium minerals necessary for growth and development.
It is necessary to remove the central seeds found in cherry and plum as they may cause impaction to your bearded dragon.
<strong>g. Grapes and mangoes</strong>
Grapes contains a high level of
calcium necessary for bone strengthening
. You will need to slice them into small pieces for easier swallowing.
Grapes also have fair level of oxalate and phosphorous thus should be supplemented with other main meal.�Like grapes, mangoes have fibers that help in digestion of your beardie.
The sugary component in mangoes makes them favorite to beardies. However, these fruits have high level of oxalate that binds and inhibits calcium absorption. They should, therefore, be fed twice or thrice per month and be supplemented with other main feeds.</p>
<h3 id="2-vegetablesgreenseaten-bybearded-dragons">2. Vegetables/Greens�Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-cabbages"><strong>a. Cabbages</strong></h4>
<p>Cabbages are essential meal for your bearded dragon
since they contain high-energy content (113kJ). They also contain strong fibers (prevents constipation), water and vitamin A, C, &amp; K necessary for growth and development.

broccoli for bearded dragons
. Notably, cabbages have high level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (2:1) which prevents occurrence of metabolic bone disease.
Ensure that green or red cabbages are thoroughly washed (to remove harmful chemicals or insects) and sliced into sizable pieces before feeding your bearded dragon.�Minimize use of purple cabbages since they are highly acidic.</p>
<h4 id="b-sweet-potatoes"><strong>b. Sweet potatoes</strong></h4>

You can also supplement your beardies main meal with sweet potatoes vines, which should be chopped well. But
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrots/">bearded dragons can also eat carrots</a>
.
The relative level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (1:1.56) make it inappropriate to use sweet potatoes as daily meal.
Sweet potatoes vines have rich fiber networks that help in preventing constipation.</p>

Silkworms also contain minerals such as magnesium, iron, sodium as well as vitamin B1, B2 and B3 that help boost immunity.</p>
<h4 id="d-mealworm"><strong>d. Mealworm</strong></h4>
<p>The tasty mealworms are known to be the most favorite of bearded dragons meals. They contain high fat level and thus should be used occasionally with other feeds such as fruits and vegetables.
Mealworms should be fed, mostly, to beardies aged 5-6 years.�Though Mealworms contains proteins and calcium, the quantity is quite low as compared to silkworms and earthworms.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chameleons are famous for changing colors. A�coat of many colors is a story about a little girl who had a coat that was not just one <a href="/posts/paint-colors-to-brighten-a-dark-room/">color</a>. She takes it to church with her and everyone admires the colors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a chameleon!�Just like peacocks, a chameleon will change color depending on its mood changes, temperature, or body language.</p>
<p>This is thanks to its three pigments; brown, black, and red.�So, really, what do chameleon colors mean?�Well, the following reasons are the most likely.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Chameleon will change to darker colors such as black when stressed or to neutral colors such as beige or light brown when in a relaxed state. But, if they are happy, they will turn to brighter colors such as green. **</li>
<li>**On the other hand, to show aggression or excitement, chameleons will turn to brighter colors such as orange, red, bright blue, or green. **</li>
<li>**In addition, a chameleon will change color depending on temperature. For example, when it gets cold outside, the chameleon changes their skin pigment to black - this helps them absorb more heat. **
In this article, we will talk (in detail) about the colors of a chameleon. You&rsquo;ll learn what they mean.</li>
</ul>

<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Chameleon Cages&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-normal-chameleon-coloration">What&rsquo;s the Normal Chameleon Coloration?</h2>
<p>Chameleons of different species are either brown or green when they&rsquo;re in their normal (neutral or resting) state, but the hue will depend on the natural habitat of the animal.
*For instance; *</p>
<ul>
<li>Panther chameleons are the only species that&rsquo;ll turn bright red and so others like my favorite chameleon; the Veiled chameleon cannot.</li>
<li>Further, other small brown to black chameleon species will only affect color change on their skin between the ranges of brown to black.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-show-aggression-bright-colors-like-bright-green-or-red">1. Show Aggression: Bright Colors like bright green or red</h3>
<p>Male chameleons quickly change the skin to bright colors to display their aggression as they defend their territory.
They&rsquo;ll display quick and explosive skim-color changes - white, yellow, blue, bright green, or red (all bright colors). It&rsquo;ll also show dark green spots, brown spots &amp; stripes, and yellow stripes.</p>
<p>Chameleons will use these color changes to frighten and warn the opponents attacking their territory while also making them visible in their surroundings such as when among green trees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, the chameleon may show bright colors to assert itself.
However;</li>
<li>When a male chameleon believes that it&rsquo;s weaker than its opponent, it&rsquo;ll mute or dim its colors as a sign of submission or defeat.
During the mating season, male chameleons will be more aggressive to attract mates (females) by showing bright colors.</li>
<li>The chameleon will flatten its body sideways to displays the colors; these are yellow with green stripes and a black lining or red and pale blue stripes with black outline or blotches.
For example, as your veiled chameleon&rsquo;s ages, they&rsquo;ll become highly dominant and aggressive and hence reacting with the aggressive colors - bright colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, you&rsquo;ll find it easy to pick or touch that young veiled chameleon compared to the older one.</p>
<p>Also, like other reptiles, veiled chameleons express themselves through posture and body language.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, when startled or threatened the veiled chameleons may hiss (opening their jaws), raise one foot in the air, swell out their chest, and puff up their throat.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-relaxed-mood-neutral-colors-like-pale-brown-or-light-green">2. Relaxed Mood: Neutral Colors like Pale brown or Light green</h3>
<p>When chameleons are resting, they change colors to reflect their current natural habitat such as pale brown or light green as applicable.</p>
<p>The chameleon will also move to a place that matches their color of relaxation (neutral or muted colors such as beige and light brown) to attain more camouflage, and also hide easily if attacked.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the Veiled chameleon will show they&rsquo;re in their relaxed state by changing to mute brown.
Veiled chameleons are terrestrial chameleons and are larger than the other species in this family.</li>
<li>Being ambush predators, they use their color-changing abilities to catch prey by waiting for them to come close.</li>
<li>They can sit still for hours without moving or making a sound so that when something approaches, it will not be aware of what happened until too late.</li>
<li>The colors of the Veiled chameleon are a mixture of various shades of brown and grey, with some patches in deeper reds or yellows.</li>
<li>These beautiful colors show that they&rsquo;re able to adjust their coloration according to what kind of habitat they live in as well as the time during the year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-attract-mates-vibrant-colors">3. Attract Mates: Vibrant colors</h3>
<p>Male chameleons will display brighter or more vibrant colors during specific times of the year when mating season starts up again, which is a great way to catch the eye of a mate.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is their way of showing off to females what a great mate they would make, and also how well-adapted for living in their environment they are.
Some of the bright colors chameleons show during the mating season include red with yellow, white, blue, or black stripes. Others include red hues around the animal&rsquo;s sides and head.
*On the other hand; *</li>
<li>A female chameleon will reject the courting or mating advances from the male chameleon by displaying a warning color such as a white or brown stripe along the animal&rsquo;s body.
*But; *</li>
<li>The female chameleon show willingness to have sex by displaying golden stripes with green and light blue backgrounds
The intensity of the color may vary according to the species of chameleon. The male panther chameleon shows red and yellow color with light green stripes when the mating season approaches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-display-fear">4. Display Fear:</h3>
<p>When in shock or under attack, chameleons will show what is called fear colors which are usually darker colors like black.</p>
<p>For example, your Veiled chameleons will change to
<a href="https://animals.mom.me/identifying-veiled-chameleons-color-mood-5721.html">dark colors</a>
when it is under attack, or it&rsquo;s shocking or in defense.</p>
<p>The color gets darker when the fear level intensifies. This is to help them blend better into their environment when under attack.</p>
<p>The veiled chameleon may even roll into a small ball-shaped body to offer further protection. The chameleon will not change back to its original color until it ensures that its life is fully secured/safe.</p>
<h3 id="5-during-humidity-or-temperature-change">5. During Humidity or Temperature Change</h3>
<p>Environmental changes like humidity or temperature change can cause the chameleon to change color. This is because of how their cells react in these conditions.</p>
<p>Chameleons are ectothermic reptiles, which means they rely on external heat sources for body temperature regulation and cannot do so themselves by generating metabolic heat from aerobic respiration like mammals would with a respiratory system.</p>
<p>Any fall in temperature will force them to change their skin color into dark/black color which enables them to absorb more heat from the surface (this change assumes the camouflaging advantage  the background color may differ with the skin color).</p>
<p>Chameleons will change to brighter colors such as light blue, bright red, light green or white to help them reflect sun rays from their skin surface. Moreover, the skin becomes lighter on a hotter day.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/SQggDnScsvI">https://youtu.be/SQggDnScsvI</a></p>
<h3 id="6-chameleon-to-chameleon-communication">6. Chameleon to Chameleon Communication:</h3>
<p>Just like humans, Chameleons have ways of social communication. Scientists believe that mostly, chameleons change their color to communicate with other counterparts in the colony.</p>
<p>Research shows that female chameleons will change to light or pale green when in courtship/mating season to signal (keep off signal) other male chameleons that may need to relate with them.</p>
<p>In addition, an expectant chameleon changes to black or dark to alert other chameleons to keep off. Jacksons chameleon and Madagascar chameleon are able to send threat communication to other chameleons by changing suddenly to black, dark, or reddish-brown color.</p>
<h3 id="7-show-excitement-and-stimulation">7. Show Excitement and Stimulation**.**</h3>
<p>Chameleon, just like other animals and human beings gets excited. They express such stimulation and excitement by changing their colors.</p>
<p>When the veiled chameleon is excited (maybe when mating or hunting), it changes to dark green, yellow or brown color.</p>
<p>The stimulation due to attack makes the panther chameleon change its skin to dark red, or dull brown, or black color.</p>
<h3 id="8-prevailing-environmental-conditionweather">8. Prevailing environmental condition/weather</h3>
<p>During rainy seasons, chameleons change their skin into dull or dark colors. You will find a Bright colored chameleon in fair weather (not rainy or sunny).</p>
<p>During sunny weather, chameleons such as panthers and Jacksons change their color to bright yellow, bright green, or white. Cold weather makes the chameleon skin change to dull, dark, or black color.</p>
<p>This enables chameleon to absorb more heat from the surrounding which helps in maintaining their internal temperature at optimum.</p>
<ul>
<li>This change of colors in the various environmental conditions is a special form of adaptation for chameleons (temperature regulation).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-scientific-principles-behind-changing-colors-in-chameleons">What are the Scientific Principles Behind Changing colors in Chameleons?</h2>
<p>Chameleons change their colors due to the function of &ldquo;specialized cells&rdquo; called chromatophores or nanocrystals (small crystals).</p>
<ul>
<li>These are pigment-containing and light-sensitive cells, which expand or contract in response to temperature or mood changes for example.</li>
<li>When these specialized cells in chameleon skin undergo contraction (thanks to the iridophores - the spacing between the nanocrystals), they produce patterns on the surface of animal skin that either reflects or absorbs the surrounding light.
But how&rsquo;s this possible?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, reflecting light is the pivotal aspect that determines the color. An object can be either a red or yellow type of color because it reflects longer wavelengths or shorter wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>To understand a chameleons myriad colors, think of the nanocrystals in the iridophores of its skin as mirrors.</p>
<p>The nanocrystals are spaced far apart (the mirrors are longer) when the chameleon is stressed allowing it to reflect brighter colors with longer wavelengths such as yellow and red.</p>
<ol>
<li>The nanocrystals in a chameleon&rsquo;s skin are spaced out far apart when they&rsquo;re stressed. This makes the light reflecting from those cells brighter and is of longer wavelengths like red or yellow.</li>
<li>When relaxed, the nanocrystals are closer together (shorter mirrors) which causes colors with shorter wavelengths to be reflected. These reflective colors include green and blue.</li>
<li>The color change to black in a chameleons skin is attributed to the upper layering of melanin that it disperses in its tail - no nanocrystals are used here. The dark pigment, when cold and chilling out, means its not facing any threat, but rather wants to display its submissive mood.
This is what enables chameleon to blend with their surroundings and it also helps them in temperature regulation as they change their colors according to the ambient temperatures.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="do-all-chameleons-change-colors">Do all chameleons change colors?</h2>
<p>Chameleons change colors though not all species have the same speed and ability to change colors that we have discussed above.
Chameleon such as veiled, panther, and Madagascar are able to change into multiple colors such as green, yellow, light blue, and red in less than 20seconds.
However, many chameleon species are only able to change from light to dark colors and vice-versa.
The tree-dwelling chameleons are more vulnerable to predators due to their less capability in changing their colors (they also have minimum color-changing options  they can change to green, blue, or dark/black). These chameleons, then, tend to stay in the canopy as their hideouts.
Chameleons found in arid and semi-arid areas have a weak ability to change to various colors due to temperature variations (high temperature affects the color variations in chameleons).
The panther chameleon rarely camouflages with the background even when in danger. The Jacksons Chameleons skin color is highly controlled by a change in temperature and moods than fear of predation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since most chameleons have dominant green color in their skin melanin, the color tends to darken when they are in a green background due to the cell color reflection (a concept that is highly confused with camouflaging).</li>
<li>The Madagascar lizards are well known to match the green background, which makes it difficult for the predator to sport them.
Though camouflaging plays a role in the protection of chameleon against its predator, it accounts for less than 5 percent as to why chameleons skin change color.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chameleons skin colors reflect its moods, comfort/relaxation, environment or weather conditions as well as stress. Though the camouflage concept of the chameleon plays a role in its predator protection, the effect is less significant.
The ability of chameleons to change their colors varies according to the particular species. The color change in the chameleons skin is coordinated by a shift in iridophores orientations.</p>

. If you suspect you are having mites infestation and cant tell what exactly they are, well, this is the right place for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>So, what do dust mites look like? - Dust mites are microscopic creatures and very hard to see with our bare eyes. They commonly feed on dead human and animal skin cells.</strong></li>
<li><strong>From a microscopic view, they are tiny oval-shaped insects. They have 8 legs and they do not have wings. They are greyish-black in color with some stripes and they move from one place to another through crawling.�</strong>
Dust mites cannot be categorized as parasites because they dont sting, or bite and neither do they burrow into the human body.

</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-do-dust-mites-look-like">Details: What Do Dust Mites Look Like?</h2>
<p>Though they are generally harmless to most people, to others they cause allergic reactions like asthma among others.</p>
<ul>
<li>They like hiding under pillows, mattresses, furniture, and carpeted areas.</li>
<li>How do I know I have dust mites? Because of their invisible nature, the best way to tell the infestation of the dust mites is through the symptoms seen.
Such symptoms may include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Running nose</li>
<li>Asthma-in extreme cases</li>
<li>Breathing problems</li>
<li>Stuffy ears</li>
<li>Sneezing</li>
<li>Eczema</li>
<li>Bug bites</li>
<li>Nasal stiffness</li>
<li>Watery and itching eyes
If you have such symptoms, it is already an alarm that something needs to be done.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-are-dust-mites-in-my-room">Why Are Dust Mites In My Room?</h2>
<p>As earlier stated dust mites mostly feed on dead skin. In your room, that is where you are more likely to spend a lot of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you rub your body against the bed and pillow, you leave a lot of dead skin on it which is good food for the mites.
It is in our bedroom and living room that is there is a lot of dead skin and that is why most mites will hang around.

</ul>
<h2 id="do-dust-mites-stay-in-me">Do Dust Mites Stay In Me?</h2>
<p>Most probably not. There is absolutely nothing to scare you about dust mites attaching to you. Dust mites dont have wings and barely move a lot.
Another thing is that they also dont burrow into humans so it will also be hard for them to hang around you all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you leave the dead skin is just where they want to be.
Next time you experience some bites when in your bed, chances are that this is not a dust <a href="/posts/dust-mites/">mite</a> but either a bed bug or a mosquito.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-dust-mites-eating">What Are Dust Mites Eating?</h2>
<p>Dust mites have no interest in living things. Their main source of food is dead skin, dandruff, dead hair, and other dead micro stuff from the human body.
Human beings shed about 10 grams of dead skin a week creating a rightful environment for these mites.</p>
<ul>
<li>But it is the animal pets like dogs and cats that are good carriers of these mites.
Dust mites have a life span of about two months and therefore, these dead body parts serve as enough food for these mites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dust-mites-or-bed-bugs">Dust Mites Or Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>If you have been having itchy bites from your bed, what is the first thing that comes into your mind?
Whereas the bed bugs and the dust mites like to hide in the same place under your bed and beddings, it is bed bugs that bite.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike mites, the bugs are big and visible. The bugs are also parasitic and also suck blood from your body.</li>
<li>The bed bugs will also stay with you wherever you are hiding in clothes as well as the bedding and other dark places within your home.
These signs and symptoms will give you a proper guide on whether you are controlling dust mites or bed bugs in your home.

<h2 id="getting-rid-of-dust-mites">Getting Rid Of Dust Mites</h2>
<p>Now that you know you are treating dust mites, here is are some steps to achieve maximum results.
The first and the most important step to take is to do a thorough cleaning of the bedding and the house at large.</p>
<ul>
<li>These only come after establishing through the symptoms that indeed there is a dust mites infestation.</li>
<li>Like earlier noted it is hard to see them and will only work with the probability of their hideouts.
Secondly, as you wash the bedding, pillowcases let the water be heated to temperatures of not less than 60 F. This temperature will go a long way in killing and eliminating both the mites and their eggs.</li>
<li>Another alternative is replacing the sheets, pillowcases, and mattresses with new ones. This way you can help reduce their population and also infestation.</li>
<li>Thirdly, flipping your mattress regularly helps keep the mites population low and also avoids too much accumulation of the mites in one location.</li>
<li>Dust mites thrive in humid and warm areas, and keeping the room well ventilated minimizes their chances of survival in your room.
Once in a while, you can also do some vacuum cleaning of your room to remove all manner of the dead skin and anything that allows this pest to thrive,</li>
<li>In another scenario, using an electric blanket could also be a good way to minimizing their infestation. Electric blanket creates an atmosphere where this mite cannot thrive.</li>
<li>Lastly, clean your pets and toys. Pests are good carriers of dust mites and keeping them clean at all times keeps off the mites.
As for the toys, keeping them in the freezer temporarily could help kill any mites that could be hiding in that warm fur.

<p>If you are able to establish that indeed you have the dust mites, you can employ the tactics illustrated above.
However, it is almost impossible to tell the extent of their infestation in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dust mites have a very short life span and it is possible that they have multiplied into millions before you can start seeing the signs.</li>
<li>There are various pesticides that a formulated to kill them either by contact or through the systemic mode of action.
I recommend the use of this pesticide to help reduce their population.� These pest control products are available in most stores.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>What do dust mites look like? Well, it is hard to see these mites with your eyes but can also tell about their existence through the symptoms caused on your bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>They dont bite, or sting but can cause allergic reactions like asthma and others.
That said and done, it� is good to regularly clean your room and apply all the necessary measures to keep off this dust mites.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">Flea</a> cocoons are protective casings that fleas create during their pupal stage. The cocoon is an essential part of the flea lifecycle and serves as a safe environment for the flea to develop into an adult. Flea cocoons are not always easy to spot, but understanding what they look like can help you manage flea infestations more effectively.</p>
<h2 id="appearance-of-flea-cocoons">Appearance of Flea Cocoons</h2>
<p>Flea cocoons are typically small, oval, and covered with debris such as dirt, dust, and pet hair. This camouflage helps protect the cocoon from predators and environmental elements. The actual cocoon is usually translucent or pale in color, with a sticky outer layer that allows it to adhere to surrounding surfaces.
The size of a flea cocoon can vary, but they are generally around 0.5 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a pinhead. The cocoon can look like a tiny, silk-like sac that blends in with the surroundings, making it difficult to spot with the naked eye. It often appears as a small, off-white or light brown speck.</p>
<h2 id="lifecycle-of-fleas-and-the-role-of-the-cocoon">Lifecycle of Fleas and the Role of the Cocoon</h2>
<p>Flea larvae hatch from eggs and immediately begin feeding on organic material, such as flea feces, dead skin cells, and hair. Once the larvae are ready to pupate, they spin a protective cocoon around themselves. The cocoon is designed to shelter the flea as it undergoes metamorphosis into an adult flea.
The cocoon also serves another purposeit is highly resistant to environmental conditions, such as heat, cold, and chemicals. This makes it difficult to eliminate flea cocoons using typical household cleaning methods. Fleas can remain dormant in their cocoons for weeks or even months until environmental conditions are favorable for them to emerge.</p>
<h2 id="flea-cocoon-lifespan-and-emergence">Flea Cocoon Lifespan and Emergence</h2>
<p>The length of time a flea remains in its cocoon depends on several factors, including temperature, humidity, and the availability of a host. In optimal conditions, fleas may emerge from their cocoons within a few days to a week. However, if conditions are not ideal, fleas can remain dormant inside their cocoons for much longer, sometimes even several months. This is why flea infestations can reoccur after apparent eradication.
Fleas rely on environmental cues, such as vibrations, heat, and carbon dioxide, to trigger their emergence from the cocoon. These signals indicate the presence of a potential host nearby, prompting the adult flea to hatch and begin seeking out a host for blood feeding.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-deal-with-flea-cocoons">How to Deal with Flea Cocoons</h2>
<p>Dealing with flea cocoons can be challenging, as they are resistant to many forms of treatment. However, there are several steps you can take to manage flea infestations:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Vacuuming:**Regular vacuuming is one of the most effective ways to remove flea cocoons, larvae, and eggs from your home. Be sure to vacuum carpets, upholstery, and areas where pets spend time. Dispose of the vacuum bag immediately after use to prevent re-infestation.</li>
<li>**Flea treatments:**Use flea treatments for your pets, such as topical spot-on treatments or oral medications. These treatments can kill adult fleas and prevent new fleas from hatching.</li>
<li>**Insect growth regulators (IGRs):**IGRs are chemicals that interfere with the flea life cycle, preventing flea larvae from developing into adult fleas. These can be applied to your home to break the flea lifecycle and help reduce the number of cocoons.</li>
<li>**Flea bomb or fogger:**A flea bomb or fogger can be used to treat large areas, especially when flea cocoons are widespread. However, be sure to follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions carefully to avoid exposure to harmful chemicals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Flea cocoons are small, oval-shaped protective cases that are often difficult to see with the naked eye due to their camouflaged appearance. These cocoons play a crucial role in the flea life cycle, providing a safe haven for fleas as they develop into adults. Understanding the characteristics and lifespan of flea cocoons can help you better manage flea infestations and prevent re-infestation in your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Groundhogs are underground rodents that spend most of their lives in underground tunnels. They spend a lot of time burrowing and coming out in the open to look for food.� But what do groundhogs <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> to survive underground?</p>
<ul>
<li>**Groundhogs are omnivorous that&rsquo;ll eat both plants and animals. But in most cases, groundhogs eat vegetables, grass, fruits, alfalfa, clovers, soybeans, dandelion, and apples, and other garden plants. **</li>
<li><strong>Groundhogs tend to be more herbivorous than they are carnivorous though on some rare occasions, you will find them eating insects.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Repellents for Groundhogs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Groundhogs greatest enemy is the human being but their damages in the garden cannot be ignored. Related:

</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-do-groundhogs-eat">Details: What Do Groundhogs Eat?</h2>
<h3 id="1-plants-fruits-and-vegetables"><strong>1. Plants, Fruits and Vegetables</strong></h3>
<p>When we talk about groundhogs feeding on vegetables, plants, and fruits, what are their favorites? These fruits are apples, raspberries, hackberries, mulberries, and other types of berries.
Others are cloves, dandelions, alfalfa, maple leaves among others.
Before we can get to know what groundhogs eat, maybe we can have a brief understanding of what groundhogs really are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Groundhogs are basically rodents that belong to a family of squirrels known as marmots. They are also referred to as woodchucks or whistle pigs because of the whistling sound they make trying to warn the rest of incoming danger.</li>
<li>Groundhogs are found in the eastern and the central part of the United States. They like to live in woodlands and transitional areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cultivated-crops"><strong>2. Cultivated Crops</strong></h3>
<p>Groundhogs can also prove to be disastrous on cultivated crops like lettuce, corn, legumes, soybeans, broccoli, peas, and others
It is mostly these cultivated crops that will capture a farmers interest in eradicating the groundhogs. This is because of the damage they do to the crops and also to the garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>But even so, they spent most of their time underground burrowing and looking for food. Their tunnels can go as deep as 6 ft. under and can stretch up to 25 ft. but with multiple entrances. These burrows are where they call home and even reproduce from these places.
Though groundhogs are omnivorous, they tend to feed more vegetables and fruits, especially from our gardens. They will cause damage as they burrow through the garden leaving all your plants dead and weathering.
Apart from the vegetable, groundhogs will also destroy your carrots and other cultivated crops. For a better understanding of the groundhogs, we can break down their diet into different categories.

<p>It is rare to find groundhogs feeding other animals and pests but when available, they dont hesitate to eat them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some of the delicacies that groundhogs eat. Crickets, snails, bugs, grasshoppers, bird eggs, juvenile birds among smaller animals.
However, the groundhog&rsquo;s diet is also greatly affected by seasons and daily weather. This is because weather directly affects the food that is available for the rodents.</li>

<h3 id="1-spring-and-summer-">**1. Spring and summer **</h3>
<p>These two seasons there is plenty of food and groundhogs have the opportunity to enjoy whatever they want. They feed on their favorite vegetables, fruits, and cultivated crops.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also feed on grasshopper snails and also other insects that are available.
During this season, they feed either in the morning or the evening hour and spend the rest of the daytime hours hiding underground.

<h3 id="2-autumn-">**2. Autumn **</h3>
<p>In this season, things start changing and food start becoming scarce and groundhogs turn to insects and other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to their limited options, they also eat tree backs and leaves and a supplementary.</li>
<li>Additionally, it is this season that the groundhogs get an opportunity to eat lots of protein from the animals and insects too.
This is the reason they start storing food on the burrows as they prepare for the winter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-winter-">**3. Winter **</h3>
<p>This is an inactive stage for the groundhogs and they are not so much involved in food hunts.
They live in the tunnels and feed on the food in the store. In this period they fed less as compared to other seasons to save on energy and food.

<h2 id="how-to-protect-your-garden-from-groundhog">How to Protect Your Garden from Groundhog</h2>
<p>Groundhogs love to live where there is woodland and at the edges of forested areas. They will occasionally come out of the tunnels into our gardens to look for a look. As I said, they like feeding on cultivated crops.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can really be a nuisance on your farm but there is always a way to tame them.</li>
<li>Timely harvesting. If you want to avoid losses and damages done by groundhogs, ensure your crop is harvested on time.</li>
<li>Groundhogs also love eating the legume and cloves when they are natured but timely and proper harvesting will have them lose the most of reaping where they have not planted.
Using peppermint on the crops. Pepper and groundhogs are like water and paraffin, they dont mix. Therefore if you use it on the crop or pour around the border, this will be a nice way of keeping them off. Afterward, you can wash off the pepper, if you are not a fan.
Erecting a wall around your garden. This will help secure their entry into your garden to cause destruction. To be on the safer side, you need at least a wall of 3-4 ft. high where the groundhogs cannot hump.
Using repellents. There are available in most retailers. You can use the electronic pest repellent or a normal groundhog repellent.
Removing logs within your garden will stop attracting them. Like earlier mentioned, they like to live around woody areas and this will serve the same purpose.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>What do groundhogs eat? They are omnivorous but have a high preference for vegetables, fruits and plants as compared to animals, insects and pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of their nature to burrow and live underground, and fear for human beings, they like to come out and feed either in the evening or in the morning.</li>
<li>Their feeding pattern and diet is also greatly affected by weather patterns and will hide food in the tunnels for the winter season.
That said done, they are a great threat to our farming activities and measures should be applied to ensure their damage is controlled.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opossums are omnivores, meaning that they <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> both plants and animals - like humans. But really, what do opossums eat? Opossums need a balanced diet of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to maintain good health.
<em>A natural diet for an opossum would be lots of insects (insects are high in protein), small mammals (high in fat), and the occasional fruit or nut (high in carbs). They need a very high calcium diet (which can be found in plant products).�</em>
<em>In captivity, opossums/ possums eat different foods including vegetables and dog food. But in summary, their diet can be leafy greens (like kale &amp; spinach), grains (like oats &amp; rice), and fruits (like oranges &amp; apples).�</em>

<h2 id="possum-diet-what-do-opossums-eat">Possum diet; What Do Opossums Eat?</h2>
<p>Virginia possum is the most common possum (among the over 60 possum species) as it&rsquo;s a wild scavenger. The opossums will eat during the night and dawn hours - they are nocturnal animals.</p>
<h3 id="1-opossums-eating-mice-roach-and-ants-">**1. Opossums Eating Mice, Roach, and Ants **</h3>
<p>Opossums can be beneficial as they&rsquo;ll feed on those annoying rodents and pests - including mice,
moles
, roach, and ants. The possum menu varies because they&rsquo;ll feed on different parasites!
The opossum is a scavenger - so they&rsquo;ll eat insects (e.g., bees), small reptiles (e.g., snakes) as well as plant material like fruits or leaves from trees. They also will consume bird&rsquo;s eggs if available.</p>
<h3 id="2-do-opossums-eat-plants">2. Do Opossums Eat Plants?</h3>
<p>Opossums will eat plants and nuts - but this is not their primary food source. The animals, despite being an omnivore (eat meat), they are really more herbivores.
They need a lot of calcium in their diet; it&rsquo;s needed to help form bones or teeth, but opossum mothers pass on calcium-rich milk while nursing the babies until weaning around six weeks old.
The animals also consume small amounts of grasses as well as leaves which they&rsquo;ll find near water sources. They also consume plant material like fruits or leaves from trees.
Any insects they happen to come across while foraging is then consumed too as well. The animal&rsquo;s diet changes seasonally, depending on what food sources are available (e.g., more fruit when there are different varieties of it).
**3. Eat Dead Weeds and Plants **
Opossums will also eat dead plants and weedy vegetation - this gives them a high quantity of calcium in their diet to maintain bone density. They&rsquo;ll feed on the plant matter that is decaying - as opposed to the well-nourished plants.
Consumption of animals will result in poor quality meat due to the high levels of uric acid which causes arthritis. Opossums do not produce an enzyme called uricase, so this substance builds up more quickly than other mammals such as dogs.
The same applies if the opossum consumes insects with hard exoskeletons or bones (e.g., bees). These types of foods may cause stomach ulcers and reduce calcium absorption for the animal.</p>
<h3 id="4-opossums-feed-on-carrion-">**4. Opossum&rsquo;s Feed on Carrion **</h3>
<p>Opossums are nocturnal omnivores - they&rsquo;ll feed on a variety of plant and animal matter (including carrion). They&rsquo;ll also eat roadkill and other
*dead animals that you find on the road or in the wild. *
Opossums have an excellent sense of smell and can find food in areas where other animals are unable to. This is because they will eat anything, no matter how rotten it may be - this includes bones, hair, fur, or teeth.
Insects that Opossums Eat: Spiders (dead) Termites Wax worms Beetles Ants Grasshoppers Crickets Fleas Caterpillars Slugs Moths Earthworms Butterflies
The opossum&rsquo;s low-quality meat doesn&rsquo;t affect its ability to digest the insects listed above well as their tough exoskeletons don&rsquo;t seem to
*bother them too much. *</p>
<h3 id="5-what-do-possums-eat-in-the-garden-insects">5. What do possums eat in the Garden; Insects</h3>
<p>What do possums eat from my yard? Opossums feed on a variety of food sources including meaty foods (rodents) such as squirrels or mice to more plant-based fare consisting of berries that grow wild in woodlands or forested areas.
A possum&rsquo;s diet is omnivorous. Possums like eating dead animals as well as vegetables; such as tomatoes and potatoes. They have a variety of food in the garden, including; dead animals, snakes, toads, rodents, garden slugs, and pests.
Insects that opossums generally consume include spiders (dead), termites, wax worms, beetles ants, grasshoppers, crickets, fleas, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, earthworms, butterflies, slugs, frogs, and lizards.
Insects are high in calcium and protein. They will eat any bugs they can find in the garden, like; ants, spiders (dead), slugs, frogs, termites, and beetles.
<strong>6. Do the Eat Snakes</strong>
Do possums eat snakes: Yes! The opossum has some blood protein that makes them safe from the snake&rsquo;s venom- and thus they tend to eat snakes.
The opossums are not bothered by the snake&rsquo;s venom - and so they will consume a rattlesnake, toads and thus save themselves from death by snakebite. The animals will eat snakes&rsquo; just like they do with frogs or slugs.
In fact, scientists are delivering and anti-venom for use on humans - taking advantage of the special feature of the opossums&rsquo; blood. Ty these

<h3 id="7-opossums-will-eat-garbage"><strong>7. Opossums will Eat Garbage</strong></h3>
<p>The animals will go through the trash bin and eat garbage if they are hungry. Despite that the Opossums will hunt down the household pests (free pest control) - it can get messy when they ransack the garbage area.
They are attracted by the garbage smell, and they will drink milk, juice, or soda if it is available. But this can be a problem when the opossums run down the garbage bins and bags to scatter the trash all over your yard as they look for food scrapes.
Opossums love garbage disposals; just like raccoons and they&rsquo;ll do what it takes to get their paws on a tasty meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opossums are opportunistic feeders, meaning they will eat whatever is readily accessible - for example if there&rsquo;s food spilled over the side of a garbage can, an opossum will climb up and fetch it so long as he or she doesn&rsquo;t encounter too much danger in doing so.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;ll scavenge through your trash cans at night looking for any edibles that may have been thrown out from dinner preparations earlier in the day (garbage disposals do not deter them).
Garbage contains various items including pet foods that can be eaten by opossums - but you must also
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">keep the home&rsquo;s drainage system clean</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-opossums-can-eat-fruit-and-vegetables">8. Opossums Can Eat Fruit and Vegetables</h3>
<p>The opossum will also consume fruit, vegetables, nuts, berries, and eggs. Some of the vegetation that they&rsquo;ll eat includes corn kernels, pecans, apples, or beans - but not all possums are vegetarians.
They&rsquo;re omnivores so these animals can be either plant-eating or meat-eating; it is simply a matter of what&rsquo;s available to them. This means an Opossum may go out into your garden looking for tomatoes if you have plants in there&ndash;but then come back inside when he sees some bacon cooking on the stove!
They are attracted to fruit trees because of the availability of food - but there may not be a lot left on the ground once they&rsquo;ve eaten what was within reach.
They eat apples, oranges, grapes, figs, and persimmons as well as blackberries that have fallen from vines into overgrown bushes near their homes.
There have also been reports of opossums eating fruits with high sugar content such as peaches and plums - which can cause diarrhea in other animals who forage at commercial fruit bins (especially pigs).
This scavenging animal has learned to adapt its diet over time as conditions change because their environment changes too.</p>
<h3 id="9-pet-food-can-make-opossum-diet">9. Pet Food can Make Opossum Diet</h3>
<p>Cat or dog food is something Opossums would eat on their own if left to scavenge, but it is also food that can provide them with the nutrition necessary to survive in captivity and will sustain them during rehabilitation when in need of supplemental feeding.
Opossums will eat
<a href="http://agrilifecdn.tamu.edu/txwildlifeservices/files/2016/08/Opossum.pdf"><strong>pet food</strong></a>
in urban areas, particularly when left outside the homes - particularly since there is not much roadkill and wildlife to forage. So, these animals will prowl around your property at night hunting for pet food.</p>
<h3 id="10-what-wont-opossums-eat">10. What Won&rsquo;t opossums Eat?</h3>
<p>Outline the possum menu: Outlining what opossums eat is just as important as what they do not consume! Here are some foods that Opossums Don&rsquo;t or Won&rsquo;t Eat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corn on the cob (they don&rsquo;t have teeth)</li>
<li>Dog feces (it might contain worms if it has been left out in rain)</li>
<li>Human corpses from cemeteries (again because of possible worm infestation). They do however feast on roadkill! What Do Possums Eat Bugs? The possum tends to go through periods of activity at</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question; what do opossums eat - h
ere are some of the meals that opossums eat: - carrion (dead animals) - ectoparasites (animal or plant parasites found on an animal&rsquo;s skin, fur, feathers, scales, etc.) - fruits and vegetables. Opossum diets will vary depending on what is locally available in a given region.</p>

      <description>So, what do roaches smell like?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, what do roaches smell like?
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/pest/roach.html">Roaches</a>
are one of the most annoying pests you can find in your house. However, sometimes you might be anxious about what type of pest is roaming your home at night. Maybe smell can help?
**What is even more annoying about these insects is the smell they cause in a place. The smell is unpleasant, and it poses a health risk to human beings. So, what do roaches smell like? **
<strong>The short answer is; roach smell is a pungent, oily, musty, and nasty odor. The scent can also be defined as healthy and stinky too. Many words can describe the smells, but we can all agree that the smell is terrible to have in your house.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Roach Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-do-roaches-smell-like---infestation-smell">What Do Roaches Smell Like? - Infestation Smell</h2>
<p>These secretions have a long-lasting offensive effect and are what we are calling roach smells. The smell is distinguishable from any other scent.
Roaches mostly
live in dark, moist places
where they stay in groups. You&rsquo;ll find roaches behind refrigerators, cupboards, sinks, and cookers, and you can control them using the
top�roach killers
.
<em>But, what actually causes roaches to smell?�</em>
<strong>1. Oleic acid - The decomposing bodies of dead cockroaches produce this</strong>
. The odor serves the following purposes.
<strong>2. Potential danger�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The smell helps roaches in locating the dangerous places hence avoiding them. The scent emanates from scenes of potential threats. By smelling the odor of the dead bodies, other roaches prevent danger.

</ul>
<h2 id="where-does-this-smell-come-from"><strong>Where does this smell come from?�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-secretions"><strong>1. Secretions</strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever caught a roach and placed it on your hand? Did it have a smell? A single roach usually has no scent. Roaches produce odors when in large numbers.
Some species are notorious for causing smells even with one roach. For example, a single German cockroach can produce a stench strong enough to offend a person.
This stench is produced deliberately by these roaches as part of their daily routines. It is the smell you smell when your place has an infestation. Even after dealing with menace, the smell stays on for a little longer.</p>
<h3 id="2-stench-of-death"><strong>2. Stench of death�</strong></h3>
<p>This is the stench produced by the decomposing bodies of dead cockroaches. Study shows that insects have a stench upon death. This stench is due to Oleic acid, which is produced by dead bodies.
Also, when roaches find a comfortable place for living and breeding, they release a pheromone. Pheromones are communication devices between roaches. They are normal secretions by roaches from their glands.
These pheromones are used to let other cockroaches know of the new habitat. The disgusting smell you notice is actually communication with other roaches.</p>
<h3 id="4-predators-and-sexy-scent"><strong>4. Predators and Sexy Scent</strong></h3>
<p>Male roaches produce odors from their stink glands that help in keeping predators away. This way, they can avoid any impending danger.
During the mating season, female roaches produce smells. Those smells are to attract swarms of male cockroaches for mating.</p>
<h3 id="5-roach-waste"><strong>5. Roach waste</strong></h3>
<p>Due to the nature of roaches nests (dark and wet), their feces quickly accumulate and, in turn, produce a smell. The waste attracts moisture, and you will be subjected to decomposing feces.
So the smell you might be smelling most probably is some roach waste. The above are the reasons why roaches smell in that disgusting, unpleasant odor.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-ofroach-smell">**How to G****et Rid of�**<strong>roach Smell�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="step-1---identify-the-roach-source"><strong>Step 1 - Identify the Roach source�</strong></h3>
<p>It would help if you tried to find where the roaches are living and breeding. This means you will have to move the cupboards, stoves, and sinks, refrigerators to access those places.
Once you identify the smell in your house, you should know that your place has a roach infestation and a
roach bomb
. The scent of roaches poses a significant risk to the people living in that house.
Smells of roaches cause respiratory problems, amongst other illnesses. Here are some ways of getting
rid of roaches
and their pungent smells.</p>
<h3 id="step-2---deny-them-food-and-water"><strong>Step 2 - Deny them food and water.�</strong></h3>
<p>As you already know now, roaches thrive in an environment rich in warmth, moisture, food, and shelter. Ensuring your house is
free from cockroaches
involves the following practices.
Ensure you deprive them of water by ensuring there are no leaks in the house. Also, wipe any spillages immediately. Although roaches can
survive a few days without water
, they shall soon get eliminated after depriving them.</p>
<h3 id="step-3---create-an-unwelcoming-environment"><strong>Step 3 - Create an unwelcoming environment.</strong></h3>
<p>Clean your house thoroughly. Roaches thrive well in filthy environments. By maintaining a clean house you deny them a chance to thrive. Ensure that your kitchen is always clean and that you take your trash out regularly.
Also, ensure that doors to the cupboard and refrigerators are working and in good condition. This prevents small ones from getting inside.
Cover your food. Dishes should be washed soon after meals and not left to stay overnight.�Ensure that there are no food leftovers on your tables, Kitchen counters, and other places.</p>
<h3 id="step-4---repelling-roaches"><strong>Step 4 - Repelling roaches.</strong></h3>
<p>You can repel roaches using- coffee grounds, Cypress and peppermint oils, and bay leaves or even killing them using
boric acid
.
You can also make a homemade insecticide using
baking soda
and sugar. Mix them in equal portions, then sprinkle them in your house. Although this method does not entirely eradicate roaches, it kills the visible ones.
Sugar attracts the roaches then the
baking soda kills
them after they consume it. Ensure that you sweep the mixture and the dead roaches after a few days.
Even though the smell of roaches is unpleasant, there is no need to scream hysterically when you spot one. Once you follow the
tips shared
here, you will be able to get rid of that infestation.</p>
<h3 id="step-5---professional-assistance"><strong>Step 5 - Professional assistance�</strong></h3>
<p>I am pretty sure that you would have resorted to grabbing an insecticide and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/raid-ant-roach-killer-insecticide-spray-review/">spraying the roaches</a>
. This may not be effective. It may kill only the visible ones and spare the hiding ones.
You are advised to seek help from a professional
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flying-ants-vs-termites/">pest control</a>
officer. They usually have the right skills and tools to wipe out the infestation and the smell that comes with it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Roaches thrive in filthy places. Roaches disgorge portions of their
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-roach-poop-look-like/">partially digested food and feces</a>
at intervals.
They also discharge a nauseous secretion from their mouths and glands on their bodies.
Once the menace has been dealt with, ensuring you have removed any leftovers of the roaches from your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What Does a Garden <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">Lizard</a> Eat? A <a href="/posts/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/">garden</a> lizard is a great reptile pet for homeowners. These reptiles� (Calotes Veriscolor ) also known as oriental garden lizards reside in warm areas like Asia.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find these lizards in grass, trees, and bushes. They are always behind the scenes observing their environment quietly.
<em>But the question is, what does a garden lizard feast on?�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>**In summary, garden lizards eat snails, caterpillars, insects, small crickets, and some greens and fruits. They also dont consume much. **<strong>Garden lizards work with small portions at a time</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The oriental garden lizard feeds on insects such as ants, cockroaches, ants, and grasshoppers. They also eat small vertebrates such as rats and also eat other lizards.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-a-garden-lizard-eat">What Does a Garden Lizard Eat?</h2>
<p>The garden lizard has teeth and they are used for gripping the prey. They do not tear the prey when eating, they swallow it whole. The young and inexperienced garden lizards normally choke if the prey is too large for them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Baby Snakes- Surprising but true. The garden lizard can eat newly hatched nonpoisonous snakes and there are those that even consume the snake eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Butterflies  Lizards love to eat these colorful creatures and therefore if your garden has plenty of butterflies you can be assured that the lizards will make them an endangered species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cockroaches Garden lizards eat roaches as though they were light snacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their own eggs- At times when the hunger is too much, the lizard will opt to eat its own eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slugs  They will use their teeth to have a grip then swallow the slug effortlessly since a slug is covered in a mucus-like membrane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small lizards- When they are roaming looking for females, the males will eat up other tiny lizards and do so to assert domination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fruits  Garden lizards love fruits and especially berries. Succulent fruits also provide them with water. They also love bananas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-do-small-garden-lizards-eat"><strong>What Do Small Garden Lizards Eat</strong></h3>
<p>The bigger the lizard, the bigger its prey. Small lizards go for small prey such as flies and crickets and if they want more flesh they will go for spiders, snails, and caterpillars.
<strong>Do Garden Lizards Need Water</strong>
Yes, these lizards need water in order to survive and also maintain a healthy amount of moisture on their skin. Garden lizards cannot live without water but at the same time, you should understand that they cannot thrive in places where there is excessive water. They will drown and die. So water levels or amounts should be moderate.
<strong>Do They Have Teeth</strong>
Garden lizards possess teeth and these teeth are used for gripping their food not tearing it apart. The prey is then swallowed whole once its captured.</p>
<h2 id="do-garden-lizards-eat-vegetables-and-plants"><strong>Do Garden Lizards Eat Vegetables And Plants</strong></h2>
<p>You might be led to think that garden lizards eat only meat but in some instances, they eat greens.
<strong>Do Garden Lizards Eat Flying Termites</strong>
Yes, garden lizards eat flying termites. When the termite flies near the lizard, the lizard simply opens its mouth and swallows the termite. Flying termites love to get a glimpse of light and normally fall down on the ground afterward. This makes it easier for the lizard to just gulp them up.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-lizards-live-naturally">Where do Lizards live naturally?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, garden lizards love warm weather hence the reason for their abundance in such climate areas. Secondly, they dwell in grass and trees. Water is essential for their wellbeing and so they live in places where they can have access to water and not become dehydrated. When the weather becomes cold, they will go missing in action and hide under rocks.
<strong>Are They Poisonous, Do They Bite</strong>
Garden lizards are harmless reptiles. Yes, they are related to other poisonous reptiles but they are venom-free. These lizards do bite but as I said before, there is no poison. In fact, when these little fellows bite you, it looks like a small scratch, and a simple dressing will do. They never attack unless they feel they have to.
<strong>How Do I Make My Garden, Lizard Friendly</strong>
The best thing about having the lizards in your garden is that they will eat up all the insects and larvae plus any mosquitoes that could be irritating you. For the lizards to come or stay, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant native grasses</li>
<li>Do some mulching or leave behind some leaf cover</li>
<li>Plant some berries</li>
<li>Have a shallow bowl of water in the garden</li>
<li>If you have a cat, try as much as possible to keep it indoors lest it scares away the lizards</li>
<li>If you can then make a pond that will also attract insects and frogs. Throw in a ramp or stick so that the lizards can get out in case they jump in.
<strong>What to avoid</strong></li>
<li>Avoid using pesticides or any other chemical solution</li>
<li>Do not rake the leaves</li>
<li>Do not capture lizards from the park. Garden lizards find their own habitat</li>
<li>Do not feed the lizards because they have to learn how to fend for themselves
<strong>Some Things To Note</strong>
A lizard cannot control its body temperature so it will be good if you can turn on the sprinklers during the hot summer holidays. When you notice that their tails are down then something is wrong. The lizard could be stressed or hurt by another animal. Again, keep your cat away from the lizard because the cat will make a snack out of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Garden lizards are creatures that simply love a low profile. They will eat all the bugs and cockroaches and be your constant companion in the garden. And as it is said, you are what you eat, and knowing what a lizard eats is the first step in truly knowing the garden lizard so that you can co-exist with them in a mutual manner.</p>

<p>The queen wasp is specially fed and treated by worker wasps while resting.� It is not assigned any other duties.
**How do you Identify a Queen Wasp? The simple answer to this is that, Queen Wasp is naturally larger than all other female workers and drones (males). **
<strong>This is due to special care given to the queen wasp by the workers. In addition, the Queen Wasp can either be red, brown, metallic blue, yellow or combined stripes of these colors.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-how-to-identify-a-queen-wasp">Details: How to Identify a Queen Wasp</h2>
<p>A Queen Wasp is a mature (adult) female wasp that has been treated specially by worker wasps (female) and is assigned the role of laying eggs and raising a new generation of wasp.</p>
<p>The queen wasp, therefore, mates with drones (male wasps from other nests) for the entire of its life and it is mandated to raise new queens who would in turn raise new colonies elsewhere.</p>
<p>To identify the Queen wasp, you can look for the following features, sign or traits in a given wasp nest:
<strong>1. Shape and size</strong>
Normally, Queen Wasp is larger than any female wasp (worker) or drone (male) in any given wasp nest. The large size is due to special meals fed to the Queen Wasp, which also makes it acquire hormones that boosts its growth.</p>
<p>The shape of the queen wasp is round and elongated. Its chest protrudes slightly as compared to other wasps.�The triangular-shaped head of Queen Wasp and a distinctive waist having a sharp pointed stinger gives it a clear identification.
<em>NB: It is only female wasps (even the queen) that have stingers, which they use for self-defense.</em>
<strong>2. Color</strong>
The Queen Wasp may be yellow, brown, metallic blue or red. Some species of wasp has a queen which has black and white stripped abdomen  these colors are brighter than that of other wasps within the nest.
<strong>3. Winter Appearance</strong>
Most of the worker wasps and drones die before winter due to fall in temperature. The Queen Wasp migrates and hibernates in a new place waiting to lay eggs. This is clear that any wasp you will see during the winter season must be a Queen wasp. You can see them if you visit any wasp nest in your area.
<strong>4.�Movement</strong>
Normally, the Queen wasps do not move about in the colonies of wasps. It remains in a given cell where worker wasps feed it. You will see worker wasps moving back and forth at a given point where they could be feeding the Queen wasp. Moreover, the Queen could be surrounded by new young wasps for mother care.
<strong>5. Security</strong>
The Queen cell is given tight security by the female workers. You will notice, in any wasp nest, that there are wasps that surround a given area and seem not to leave  this could be one of the cells having the queen wasp.</p>

<h2 id="how-big-is-the-queen-wasp">How Big is the Queen Wasp?</h2>
<p>The Queen Wasp is bigger than the rest of the wasps in a given wasp nest -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fake-wasps-nests-work/">including fake wasp nests</a>
. To be precise, most Queen Wasps will measure between 2 to 2.5cm approximate lengths.</p>
<p>This may go up slightly, but not beyond 3.8cm. The worker wasps are slightly smaller in length - it approximately measures 1.2cm to 1.8 cm.</p>
<p>The Lower abdomen of the Queen Wasp is sharp pointed and are longer as compared to other wasps.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-a-wasp-become-queen">How Does a Wasp Become Queen?</h2>
<p>The journey of the wasp to becoming the future queen begins when the mother queen mates with the drones just before winter. Then, the mother queen leaves the wasp nest to new place where it hibernates.</p>
<p>The laid eggs hatch to larvae in wasps nest cells from where they are fed by the queen using its chews.�These larva are expected to mature and become female wasps (workers).</p>
<p>However, the larvae that will become the new queen is specially fed by the mother queen. The research shows that, the new queen larvae contains more proteins that other larva and that it is usually larger.</p>
<p>On reaching maturity, the female wasps in the first generation are assigned job of building the new nests, feeding the next generation larvae and beefing security in the nest.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Female Wasp that is expected to be a new queen is not given much work and is overfed further.</p>
<p>It is believed that, through the help of the mother Queen wasp, the female wasps selects one of their own to be the new queen of that nest. There is no scientific facts accorded to this belief.</p>
<p>Once the new queen achieves full maturity, the mother leaves the nest and goes to die away or it remains in an individual cell until it dies while the newly crowned queen wasp takes over the leadership role.</p>
<p>The New workers works collaboratively and submissively to achieve every assignment given by the new queen even if they were of same age and generation.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-queen-european-wasp-look-like">How does the Queen European Wasp Look Like?</h2>
<p>This species of wasps is slightly small. The workers feeds the queen until it acquire a triangular shape after which its given the leadership mantle. The queen is approximately 2 cm long when fully grown.</p>
<p>The body of Queen European Wasp is bright yellow in color with black triangular stripes that runs to the tip of the abdomen. The wings incompletely cover the queens abdomen.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-kill-a-queen-wasp-in-a-wasp-nest">Should I kill a Queen Wasp in a Wasp Nest?</h2>
<p>If you intend to eliminate a wasp colony, killing the queen is a brilliant option. We know that the queen is mandated with a role of laying eggs and raising new generation for its entire life. Some people use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-wasp-fogger/">wasp foggers</a>
.</p>
<p>However, you will have to know the time at which you intend to kill the queen. As winter approach, the queen wasp leaves its nest after raising a number of generations to maturity.</p>
<p>Queen hibernates in the new place where it lays its eggs and broods. It is the work of queen to feed the first generation of larvae until they mature. In case you kill the queen at this stage, the larvae will dies of hunger thus preventing the wasp nest from spreading.</p>
<p>This brings to an end the entire infestation of wasp. Killing the Queen Wasp when the first generation has matured wont work since any of the worker can be selected and become the next queen wasp.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-where-are-you-likely-to-see-the-queen-wasp">When and where are you likely to see the Queen Wasp?</h2>
<p>Queen Wasps are much protected insects in the Wasp colonies. They rarely move around as compared to workers or drones. It is expected that the Queen Wasp will remain in its cell for its entire life while workers would offer it food and continued security.</p>
<p>However, it may not the case. This is because; change of weather, brooding requirement as well as surveillance may force the Queen Wasp to move out.</p>
<p>You will expect to see Queen Wasp at the end of Spring and beginning of winter. This is the time when the Queen Wasp is looking for a place to hibernate. This movement may not be frequent.</p>
<p>The best time to see the Queen Wasp is at the end of summer and beginning of spring. This is the time the Queen Wasp fly around looking for drone to mate with (Queen Wasp does not mate with drone within its nest  this prevents inbreeding and helps in transfer of gene- hybrid vigor).</p>
<p>You will find the Queen Wasp in gardens, meadows, parks or in woodland. It becomes more vibrant during spring due to the slight fall in temperature that favor mating.</p>
<p>Also, you may slightly see Queen Wasp during end of Autumn and early summer since this is the time it build nest and lay drone eggs, which mature during the summer period. The last egg laid at the end of the summer is usually fertilized purposely to raise a new queen.</p>

<h2 id="are-queen-wasps-be-aggressive">Are Queen Wasps be aggressive?</h2>
<p>Yes! The Queen Wasp and female wasps contain stinger. In case the Queen Wasp detects any danger, it becomes very aggressive. It will command its soldiers (workers) to attach the enemies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Queen Wasp will even come out of comfort zone and join its army in stinging you. The sting from wasp is very painful. Unlike bee sting, Queen Wasp can sting you severally at a single point without dying.</p>
<p>The Queen Wasp can also be aggressive in case you attacks its nest or disturb its growing Baby Wasp. Importantly, the Queen Wasp will sting even when in hibernation.</p>
<p>Hornets and Yellowjackets are the most aggressive species. They even sting your clothes and face protection severally without giving up.</p>
<h2 id="do-hornets-have-queen-wasp">Do Hornets Have Queen Wasp?</h2>
<p>Yes! Hornets, like any other species of wasp, lives communally in wasp nest. They have one Queen Wasp whose role is to lay eggs, train the female workers and breed new generations of wasps.</p>
<p>Hornet Queens build a new nest by chewing wood to form a pulp that forms a papery structure with multiple cells in each chamber.</p>
<h2 id="do-wasps-have-one-queen-in-each-nest">Do Wasps Have One Queen in Each Nest?</h2>
<p>Each Colony of Wasps has only one Queen Wasp at a time. It is not possible to have two Queen Wasps in a given wasp nest. In case two female wasps mature to be queens (which is a rare case) then, one must leave with given number of wasps in that nest and build another wasp nest in a different location.</p>
<p>The only possible allowable time when the colony of wasp may have two queen wasps is when the mother queen wasp is nurturing the new young queen. This does not last for long since the mother queen leaves the nest to die away or passes the responsibilities to new queen and rests in one of the cells in the nest until it dies.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-queen-wasps-build-wasp-nests">How Do Queen Wasps Build Wasp Nests?</h2>
<p>The task of building the first wasp nest is left to Queen Wasp. It can build the nest wasp on the leaves, branches, overhangs, roofs, underground or woods.</p>
<p>Usually, the Queen Wasp uses the wood as raw material. It chews the wood and turns it into wood pulp.</p>
<p>The wasp nest building process begins by Queen Wasp selecting the best place to build it (roof, log, wood, ground or drawer).Using its mouth, The Queen Wasp digs the wood.</p>
<p>Then, it chews the wooden material thus mixing it with its saliva to form a soft paper pulp. It then flies to the site it want to build the nest.</p>
<p>It then, forms hexagonal cells in various chamber. The Queen will enlarge the size of the wasp nest until it suites the number of eggs it intend to lay. At times, the Queen Wasp may build the wasp nest with help of the first generation workers so as to train them.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-queen-wasps-can-as-a-single-wasp-nest-produce">How Many Queen Wasps Can as a Single Wasp Nest Produce?</h2>
<p>The Queen Wasp will lay about 500 to 1500 fertilize eggs that hatch into larvae, pupate and mature to female wasps. Among these adult wasps, one is specially treated to become the queen wasp of the nest.</p>
<p>Then, the mother Queen migrates to establish another colony elsewhere. The new queen left in the old nest will bring up the new wasp generation, then leave to look for mate and create new colonies.</p>
<p>All the Fertilize eggs laid by the Queen Wasp has equal chance of becoming a queen once treated selectively by the Queen Wasp or the Workers.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-queen-wasp-leave-wasp-nest">Why Do Queen Wasp Leave Wasp Nest?</h2>
<p>Normally, Queen Wasp will leave the nest in search of place to hibernate or build a new nest.</p>
<p>Also, the Queen Wasp may leave the nest in search of drones to mate with (it does not mate with drones in the same nest).</p>
<p>The Queen Wasp can hibernate in places such as back of trees, in the ground, under the roof or in the woods.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-queen-wasps-eat">What Do Queen Wasps Eat?</h2>
<p>The Queen Wasp usually feeds on flower nectar, small insects (larvae), aphids, arachnids (mainly spider) or fallen fruits.</p>
<p>The Queen Wasp is mainly fed with proteins by the workers to help it lay fertile eggs and also build its body for future breeding.</p>
<h2 id="can-queen-wasp-live-without-food">Can Queen Wasp Live Without Food?</h2>
<p>During hibernation, Queen Wasp is sustained by the food it ate during the springtime. However, the Queen Wasp is able to store some of the food in its nest where it feed on it intermittently during the hibernation.</p>
<p>Normally, the Queen Wasp can stay without food for 20 to 100 days. It is usually in active dormancy.�Other wasps such as workers and drones can only survive between 11 to 23 days without food.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Queen Wasp is a female wasp that has been treated specially by the workers and assigned the role of breeding wasp generations for its entire lifetime.</p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to notice the Queen Wasp in a given wasp nest, you can identify it by size and color. Queen Wasp is normally larger than other wasps in the wasp nest.</p>
<p>The Queen Wasp rarely move and is surrounded by worker wasp to beef security. It can have red, metallic blue, yellow, black or mixture of these colors too.</p>
<p>However, the colors are brighter as compared to those for drones and workers. Queen Wasp will move out of its nest when searching for mate or place to hibernate and breed.</p>

will fail if you don&rsquo;t accurately know the physical appearance of termites. It might also help to understand the
termites vs. ants
and how to tell them apart.
But don&rsquo;t also confuse them with
fire ants
or
carpenter ants
.�So, have you noticed some
cylindrical, dry, and brown tunnels around the house or yard? Well, these are signs of an ant infestation- maybe dry-wood termites or subterranean termites. But what does a termite look like?
<em>In short, termites are hemimetabolous insects that are 1/4 inch long (for subterranean) to 1/2 inch long for (dry woods and damp woods), have a pair of wings (both of equal length), straight antennae and soft body, thick waist, and short legs.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Termite Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-termite-look-like-termite-identification">What Does A Termite Look Like? Termite Identification</h2>
<p><em>Despite that swarming termites are mainly darker while worker termites look lighter - termites&rsquo; color will be anything from white to light brown. But western dry-wood termite will have reddish-brown heads while western subterranean come with yellowish heads.�</em></p>
<h2 id="a-termite"><strong>a. Termite&rsquo;s Color�</strong></h2>
<p>The termite&rsquo;s
life cycle and the colony
have three castes - (1) reproductives, (2) soldiers, and (3) workers. Every caste has unique features that enable them to perform their colony roles effectively -

Being hemimetabolous, all termites, including their nymphs, will be involved in social activities, are assigned roles. However, pheromones affect which soldier termites grow into reproductives or workers.</p>

<h2 id="1-reproductive-or-the-termite"><strong>1. Reproductive (or the Termite <strong><strong>Alates</strong></strong>)�</strong></h2>
<p>Reproductive or Alates have compound eyes with sclerotized cuticle, which makes their eyes look relatively brown.
But reproductives exist as alates, de-alates, king &amp; queen, and the neotenic. In their development phases, have wing stumps, wings, and wing buds.</p>
<h3 id="a-alates"><strong>a. Alates:�</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alate">Alates</a></dt>
<dt>are the winged and young termite swarmers - both male and female. The alates are the</dt>
<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite">reproductives</a></dt>
<dt>that&rsquo;ll leave their nest to start other colonies. It may take about four years for a termite colony to produce new swarmers.</dt>
<dt><em>Appearances</em></dt>
<dd>Both females and males have a body size of about 1/4 - 1/2 inch and have grey and pale brown wings. Drywood Alates will have 3+ veins on their wings while the subterranean termite has just two such veins.
During this time, roughly 100-1000 termite alates will larvae their colony, go mate, and colonize other locations. The developing termites will mate and finally settle on favorable locations such as rotting tree stumps where they&rsquo;ll raise their colony.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="b-de-alates"><strong>b. De-alates:�</strong></h3>
<p>De-alates refers to the alate termites after they shed or lose their wings following their mating expedition or flight. They
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-have-wings/">lose their wings</a>
from rubbing after they&rsquo;ve finished mating.
Both female and male alates will lose their wings following their swarming expedition and landingthe
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">process called deciduous - where the termites</a>
will drop off their wings when they finish flying.
In this process, the termite&rsquo;s suture tends to de-alates (drops off), leaving behind a permanent scale. Then, the male termites start searching for a female partner while seeking a location to colonize.
To start with, just a limited number of eggs will be laid and reared by the female termite de-alate.
With time, there will be an increase in workers that&rsquo;ll assist the queen intending the colony&rsquo;s brood. Within 3-5 years, the colony will be too large for practical survival.</p>
<h3 id="c-king--queen"><strong>c. King &amp; Queen:�</strong></h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted above, the alates will lose their wings immediately. They settle down in their new colony 0- becoming what we&rsquo;ve called the de-alate. However, the de-alates swarmers quickly now change into new termites called king &amp; queen.
Next, the queen will reproduce to generate the three forms of termite casts we&rsquo;ve named termite workers, termite soldiers, and the termite reproductive.
Surprisingly, the termite queen can lay about 1,000 eggs each day. Also, the queen can live for up to fifty years. However, the queen will increase the number of eggs it lays to avoid overworking the alates.</p>
<h3 id="d-neotenics"><strong>d. Neotenics:�</strong></h3>
<p>Next are the �Neotenic reproductives that are termites with juvenile features allowing them to easily replace the queen &amp; king (the termite&rsquo;s colony&rsquo;s primary reproductives).
The Neotenics will have wings having an equal length (2 pairs), and the wings will be almost equal to the body of the termite. However, these Neotenic swarmers have straight antennae, a straight abdomen, and two body segments.</p>
<h2 id="2-soldier-termites"><strong>2. Soldier Termites�</strong></h2>
<dl>
<dt>Soldier termites will work hard to offer protection to the whole termite colony against enemies or intruders. Just like the other two termite castes, soldiers are effective in their working in the colony.</dt>
<dt><em>Appearance</em></dt>
<dd>The soldiers have a big head with a unique shape. Further, to safeguard their colony, the soldiers have mandible that is protruding in nature. Further, the soldiers are white, light brown, or pale red with an elongated body on color.
The soldier termites are infertile and thus will solely work to defend their colony - being guardians and fighters. They&rsquo;ll employ their large mandibles and
<a href="https://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/152nd/fink.html">armored heads to fight their enemies</a>
.
Besides, soldiers provide early warnings whenever the colony&rsquo;s security, such as the walls, is compromised. In such cases, the termites will create phalanx to block off possible intruders.
<em>Appearance:�</em></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Look like worker termites - creamy or white body.</li>
<li>Their head is enlarged and can be yellow, red, orange, or brown.</li>
<li>Soldiers have mandibles that are long to offer adequate security and defense against intruders and enemies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-subterranean-workertermites">**3. ****Subterranean Worker�**<strong>Termites�</strong></h2>
<p>Subterranean termites will protect themselves and reach their food using &ldquo;mud tubes&rdquo; - special kinds of tunnels. You&rsquo;ll find workers in secluded places or underground locations.
Workers&rsquo; times have scissor-like jaws that&rsquo;ll easily gnaw wood throughout the day. Equally, worker times feed on substances that have cellulose.
With their saw-toothed jaws, workers termites are highly destructive - they&rsquo;ll shear any wood.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> <a href="/posts/what-does-raccoon-poop-look-like/">poop</a> look like?�Reptiles such as salamanders lizards and geckos love to hang around the house. You will find their poop on any surface including your bed, sofa set, and wardrobe among other places.
Certainly, these fecal droppings can create a disgusting mess in the house - particularly after a
heavy meal
. Sometimes, it difficult to differentiate lizard poop from that of rodents and birds.
<em>So, how does lizard poop look like? Lizard poop appears as black droppings with a white substance on one end. The white matter shows the presence of uric acid and its excreted together with the solid waste.�</em>
<em>This is because lizards use one opening (cloaca) to excrete solid waste and urine. The size of the droppings vary according to the size and species of the lizard. Related: What Does Leopard Gecko Eat?</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-does-lizard-poop-look-like">What Does Lizard Poop Look Like??</h2>
<h3 id="1-size">1. Size</h3>
<p>If you suspect you have lizards in the house check for black pellet-like droppings about  inch long and 1/8 inch wide. Attached on one end of the poop is the urine crystal which is usually white in color. Thats because lizards poop and pee from the same opening (cloaca).</p>
<h3 id="2-shape">2. Shape</h3>
<p>The droppings might be tapered or rounded at the ends and their size varies with the species and size of lizards. Normally, wild lizards have bigger droppings compared to urban lizards.</p>
<h3 id="3-color">3. Color</h3>
<p>Lizard poop can be easily be confused with poop from snakes, birds or rodents. Similar to lizards these pests, poop and pee through the same opening. Thus, their droppings contain solid matter and solid uric acid. However, the white cap in birds and snake poop covers a larger portion and tend to be more liquid.

<h3 id="where-do-lizards-poop"><strong>Where Do Lizards Poop?</strong></h3>
<p>According to a
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/08/lizards-poop-biggest-rocks-around">research</a>
done at the university of Antwerp, lizards exhibit some similarity in their choice of toilet. In the controlled experiment, 90 lizards were each placed in an enclosure with different sizes of rocks. Surprisingly, 80% of the lizards pooped on the largest rock.
It has been previously indicated that wall lizards communicate with their fecal droppings. Male lizards mark their territories with feces so that other males can keep off. So, defecating on the biggest rock suggested an attempt to make their signals as conspicuous as possible.
Another explanation for this is that lizards spend most of their time on large rocks, to have a good view of possible predators. The research doesnt however conclude on the possible motivation for the observed behavior. But it suggests that lizards leave their poop in conspicuous areas as a sign of communication.</p>
<h3 id="is-lizard-poop-toxic"><strong>Is Lizard Poop Toxic?</strong></h3>
<p>Lizard feces are toxic because they spread zoonotic diseases such as salmonella. They contain certain disease-causing bacteria which can get into your body through ingestion, inhaling or open skin.
With proper hygiene its possible to reduce the risk and prevent infections from lizard droppings. If you have pet lizards, wash your hands with water and soap any time you handle them. Their cages should also be kept clean and free from fecal droppings. Use gloves every time youre cleaning your pets cage.
If you have kids in your home, its not advisable to keep lizards or other reptiles as pets. Thats because you cannot completely restrain kids interaction with the pets.
Other diseases that can be transmitted from lizards to humans include Leptospirosis, botulism and Campylobacteriosis.</p>
<h3 id="lizard-poop-versus-snake-poop"><strong>Lizard Poop versus Snake Poop</strong></h3>
<p><em>Lizard Poop:</em>
The diet of lizards is composed of small insects and arachnid. A few species include plants in their diet. They excrete small pellet-like feces the size of rodent feces.
The size of the droppings depend on the species and size of the lizard. The droppings have a small white portion which is fairly dry compared to those of snake poop.
<em>Snake poop:</em>
Unlike lizard poop, snake poop is quite lose and has no defined shape. The white portion on the end of the poop is more liquid and relatively larger than that in lizard poop.
A snake feeds by swallowing their prey whole. So their poop contains the indigestible remains such as bones, teeth, hooves, hair and scales.

Scoop out the droppings with a scrapper or pick the droppings with a piece of cloth and dispose them in the trash bin or compost.
Stains left on fabrics and bedding by lizard poop can be cleaned using the following procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a precaution, handle poop stains with a pair of protective gloves.</li>
<li>Soak the garments for at least five hours with a stain remover of your choice. There good stain removers in the market which can also help remove the poop odor.</li>
<li>Using the recommended water temperature for the fabric and an appropriate detergent, wash the garment until the stain disappears.</li>
<li>Use a bleaching agent where necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-remove-lizard-poop-stain-from-carpet"><strong>How to Remove Lizard Poop Stain from Carpet</strong></h3>
<p>To clean your carpet, you can either use commercial enzyme-based stain cleaners or prepare a DIY solution using vinegar and lukewarm water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Soak the carpet by spraying it with the solution. Do not over-soak you carpet. A little of the solution is just enough.</li>
<li>Scrub thoroughly with soft brush to loosen the stain. Rub with a dry towel to absorb excess water and remove the stain.</li>
<li>Leave the carpet to dry naturally or use a drier for faster drying.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-remove-lizard-poop-stains-from-wooden-surfaces"><strong>How to Remove Lizard Poop Stains From Wooden Surfaces</strong></h3>
<p>First scoop out the droppings with a scrapper and dispose the stuff in the trash bin. Fresh poop is easier to remove than old poop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drape the stained area with paper towels to absorb the stain completely.</li>
<li>Now cover the stain with baking soda and allow to settle until morning. This will remove excess moisture and eradicate the stench in the stain.</li>
<li>Clean the area with a wet cloth or vacuum cleaner.</li>
<li>If the stain doesnt disappear completely, clean the area with a cloth that has been soaked in white vinegar.</li>
<li>Stains from old poop require a more effective cleaning agent such as hydrogen peroxide.</li>
<li>Saturate the stain with undiluted hydrogen peroxide. For better results, soak a clean towel with hydrogen peroxide and place it on the stain. Leave it until morning.</li>
<li>Clean the surface with a wet towel until it is dry.</li>
<li>Some stains may discolor you wooden surfaces completely. In this case wood sanding may be necessary. Alternatively you can apply a stain similar to the color of your wooden surface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion**�**</h2>
<p>Lizards can cause discomfort especially when they are in large numbers. Their fecal droppings are potential avenues for diseases such as salmonella.
The situation gets worse if you have other pests like rodents, birds among others. However, its possible to differentiate the types of pests in your house using their fecal droppings.
This makes it easier to trace them and use the correct pest eradication remedy. If youre having trouble identifying the type of pest in your house, its the right time you contacted your local pest exterminator.</p>

      <description>Raccoons are nocturnal, thus it&amp;#39;s difficult to spot them easily during the day. But,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raccoons are nocturnal, thus it&rsquo;s difficult to spot them easily during the day. But,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/parasites/baylisascaris/resources/raccoonlatrines.pdf">raccoon poops and urine</a>
smell are key indicators in case of invasion.
**So, what does raccoon <a href="/posts/what-does-lizard-poop-look-like/">poop</a> look like? Well, raccoon poop is brown in color (dark to light brown) and appears like an elongated pinky finger on the ground. **</p>
<ul>
<li>**The poop&rsquo;s size is about 3 to 6 inches long. Raccoon droppings can be piled in a cluster form or slightly scattered within the area. **
<strong>Raccoon poop (fresh) has a strong odor that can be detected from a couple of feet away. Raccoon poop is very contagious as it houses roundworms and bacteria that transmit diseases such as hantavirus and histoplasmosis.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-what-does-raccoon-poop-look-like">Details: What Does Raccoon Poop Look Like?</h2>
<h3 id="1-color">1. Color</h3>
<p>Raccoon poop is usually brown in color (this may vary from light to dark brown, depending on the climatic conditions).</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the poop color is slightly altered by the type of food which the raccoon had eaten previously.
At times, you will notice a black spot on the raccoon droppings or darker brown outer part than the interior. Nevertheless, the poop should never be black or yellow whatsoever.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-smell">2. Smell</h3>
<p>Unlike cat or rat poop, fresh raccoon droppings release a strong unpleasant smell, which can spread over 100 meters away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, the scent increases with freshness and fades as the poop dries out.
You will also note the smell of urine (for fresh raccoon poop) though this may not be as sharp as that of fresh droppings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-shapesize">3. Shape/Size</h3>
<p>Raccoon poop is tubular/cylindrical in shape (like a solid pipe). It appears like an elongated pinky finger on the ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>The diameter size of the rod-like poop ranges between a half to one inch depending on the age of the raccoon (baby or adult raccoon).
Raccoon poop length ranges between 3 to 6 inches - this measurement may change slightly depending on the raccoon age as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-quantity">4. Quantity</h3>
<p>The weight of raccoon poop is a variable, which is estimated between a quarter to one kilogram.</p>
<ul>
<li>The baby raccoon droppings could weigh as low as 5 grams, while the adult raccoon poop could measure far beyond one kilogram.
The variation in the number of raccoon droppings is determined by the availability of food, the health condition of the raccoon (sick raccoon droppings are less in weight), or gender (female raccoon poop weighs more than that of male counterpart).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-distribution">5. Distribution</h3>
<p>Unlike other wild animals like squirrels, raccoon poop is piled/clustered in a specific area within its habitat.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are areas designated by raccoons for excretion purposes only and are treated as latrines where all other members of that raccoon family are expected to release bowels.
Further, raccoon poop breaks at a given length (about 3 to 6 inches) during excretion - it&rsquo;s not a continuous one like in the case of the opossum.</li>
<li>Indeed, you will find that the poop is piled up on top of each broken part.
Nevertheless, in arid areas, raccoon droppings may break/disintegrate (due to heat) and spread out though this may not go beyond a hundred-meter radius.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-locationplace">6. Location/place</h3>
<p>Often, you will find raccoon poop hidden in tall grass, shrubs, untrimmed bushes, lawns, tall flower beds, garbage bins, underground holes in open fields, riversides, or even ponds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The choice of &ldquo;raccoon latrine&rdquo; depends on the climatic condition of the area and the availability of food sources.
NB: When identifying raccoon poop, always have personal protective gears on for your safety.

<h2 id="which-risks-are-caused-by-raccoon-poop">Which Risks are Caused by Raccoon Poop?</h2>
<p>Raccoon poop is associated with various risks as highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-houses-leptospirosis">1. Houses Leptospirosis</h3>
<p>Leptospirosis is a common bacteria found in raccoon urine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon contact with cut body parts or wounds, the bacteria penetrate the body and cause a fatal kidney infection.
In extreme cases, Leptospirosis causes meningitis, which leads to lethal body somatic cells failure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-causes-giardiasis">2. Causes Giardiasis</h3>
<p>Giardiasis is a severe intestinal infection, which is caused by direct contact with raccoon droppings.
Upon detection, Giardiasis should be treated instantly in order to avoid traces of microorganisms that denature specialized body cells.</p>
<h3 id="3-bear-roundworms">3. Bear Roundworms</h3>
<p>Baylisascaris procyonis (round worms) are borne in raccoon poop and transmitted through direct contact with fecal matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ascariasis is easily transferred through their eggs (inhale), which later find their way to various body organs (intestine).
Usually, roundworms affect eyes, brains, or lungs and cause major damages to the vital organ system leading to death eventually.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-carry-salmonella">4. Carry Salmonella</h3>
<p>Salmonella is a bacteria borne in raccoon droppings, which causes salmonellosis disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you touch raccoon poop, the salmonella bacteria get into your body through wounds or any other openings.
Normally, salmonellosis affects the food ingestion process, which may lead to seizure if not attended to in time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-raccoon-poop">How to Clean Raccoon Poop</h2>
<p>Raccoon poop cleaning/removal process is critical and should be undertaken professionally as highlighted below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always wear protective gear (gloves, respirator, safety shoes, overall, and head cover) before you begin the raccoon fecal removal process.</li>
<li>Carefully, use a shovel or an inverted plastic bag when scooping.</li>
<li>Seal the poop bag tight before transporting it to the disposal area</li>
<li>Bury the droppings in a deep hole and cover the top with a sufficient amount of soil</li>
<li>Treat the scooped area with raccoon poop disinfectant chemical - twice of thrice</li>
<li>Wash shovels and gloves (used in the scooping process) thoroughly - to prevent any infection.</li>
<li>For indoor cases, clean the surface with soapy detergents</li>
<li>Clean all protective gears in high-temperature soapy detergents - helps kill any salmonella bacteria in the attire.</li>
<li>Finally, take a warm bath after the entire process

      <description>So,�what is a</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So,�what is a
[<a href="/posts/best-dynamic-microphone-for-podcasting/">dynamic</a> <a href="/posts/best-dynamic-microphone-for-streaming/">microphone</a>](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-dynamic-microphone/">https://pestpolicy.com/best-dynamic-microphone/</a>)
? First, it&rsquo;s important to note that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/types-of-microphones/">microphones</a>
work on the electromagnetic principle through a diaphragm that&rsquo;s affixed to the wire coil.
For the mic microphones, their sound waves will hit the diaphragm (metallic) that&rsquo;s attached to the wire coil. The diaphragm will vibrate making the magnet(the metallic coil) to create a magnetic field.
The coil&rsquo;s motion in this magnetic field helps create an electrical signal that matches the sound which is picked - this is a theory referred to as
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8c7pbk/revision/4">electromagnetic induction</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-dynamic-microphone">What is a Dynamic Microphone?</h2>
<p>The movement of the mic&rsquo;s diaphragm helps create the current. Further, as the speed of the motion increases or decreases, so will the current vary.
[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;440&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Dynamic Microphone[/caption]
Dynamic microphones are considered velocity-sensitive. These mics are considered the all-around particularly for
recoding studios equipments
and around keyboard workstations.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcllHUHyXbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcllHUHyXbc</a></p>
<h2 id="how-does-dynamic-microphone-work">How Does Dynamic Microphone Work?</h2>
<p>Also, these dynamic mics will give you well-rounded and mellow sounds. These ones have a unidirectional (cardioid) response pattern.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcllHUHyXbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcllHUHyXbc</a>
The microphone filter with the cardioid pattern will filter the wind and noise coming from the backside and thus isolate or preserve the audio source during studio recording.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-vs-condenser-microphone">Dynamic vs Condenser Microphone</h2>
<p>First, lest&rsquo;s discuss a transducer - this will help us understand the differences between dynamic vs condenser mics. So, a transducer is described as is the component inside the microphone that&rsquo;ll make an electrical signal from the acoustic sound waves it picks up.</p>
<h3 id="1dynamic-microphones">1.�Dynamic Microphones</h3>
<p>Dynamic microphones will combine both a magnet and its voice call to create a mini but effective electrical generator. Thus, when sound waves numb onto the mic&rsquo;s plastic diaphragm, it&rsquo;ll vibrate and make the voice coil wire to also vibrate.
The vibrating coil will generate an electrical signal since its surround by a powerful magnetic field. The dynamic mics will thus look more rugged compared to the condenser mics because the former has fewer electrical circuitry.
Therefore, the dynamic mics will comfortably handle harsh conditions including accidental dropping, extreme weather, and high volume. Further, dynamic mics
or as Lavier Mics
are generally cheaper compared to the condensers.
Therefore, how the mic&rsquo;s transducer operates will affect if the device will be considered to be a dynamic or condenser mic.
<strong>Usage?�</strong>
Dynamic mics will be great for the instruments having a low-to-mid frequency such as electric guitar amps and
headphones
.
Further, these mics have a higher tolerance for different loud instruments (high SPLs) making it great for the horn and drums sections.
Dynamic mics are truly warm compared to condenser mics - and are thus excellent for recoding spoken word - check these�microphones for vocals.
However, dynamic mics won&rsquo;t be very sensitive like the condenser mics - and thus you&rsquo;ll need to be closer or even produce a louder sound.
Thus for stage performance recoding horns and drums, the dynamic mic will give you a warmer sound.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y01N_L1VA4I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y01N_L1VA4I</a></p>
<h3 id="2condenser-microphones">2.�Condenser Microphones</h3>
<p>Condenser mics
, on the other hand, will have an electrically charged diaphragm as opposed to mechanical one in dynamic mics. Sound waves arriving into the mic will vibrate the metal-coated plastic and will be changed into electrical signals.
Therefore, condenser mics by design will be more fragile compared to the dynamic mics. Thus, they&rsquo;ll be poor in handling harsh conditions like extreme either, or loud sound.
The condenser mics will require power for its complex circuitry to work effectively - you&rsquo;ll thus require to provide it from phantom power or batteries - you&rsquo;ll notice that most audio interfaces use this kind of phantom power.
The condenser mic will have a complex electric circuit and hence it&rsquo;ll be more expensive. Also, the mics will be more precise and sensitive recording very quality and natural sounds compared to the dynamic mics.
<strong>Usage?�</strong>
On the other hand, condenser mics will function optimally with recording instruments with high-frequency. These are instruments that do not tool loud like live piano, cymbals, and acoustic guitar.
These instruments have a smaller diaphragm and thus work best at high frequencies. Such frequencies will produce lower energy and thus the diaphragm vibrates lesser.
Therefore, condenser microphones will have superior frequency response and some wider dynamic range - thus will pick up softer sounds better.
Further, the condenser mic diaphragms will be more fragile and hence may get damaged faster in recording too high of a Sound Pressure Level (SPL).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dynamic mics have numerous applications since they give you great sound but equally rugged to allow easy road traveling.
So, there you have it on the &ldquo;what is a dynamic microphone?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve also compared dynamic vs condenser microphones.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post will answer the question &ldquo;What is a Hobo Spider?&rdquo; and give you 9 other interesting facts about these unique creatures!</p>
<p>Hobo spiders (Tegenaria agrestis) are aggressive
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/house-spiders/">house spiders</a>
; they like damp and dark areas like in brick crevices, basement, garage, behind furniture, under radiators, or between boxes.
**What Do **
**Hobo Spiders **
<strong>Look Like? - A summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Characteristics:**The eight-eyed Hobo spider does not have a typical eye arrangement for this species. A close look at the spider shows that its ALEs and AMEs are almost joined.</li>
<li>**Color:**Hobo spiders come in different shades of brown, so it&rsquo;s important to learn the distinguishing features but they&rsquo;ll look anything like the brown recluse spider and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/wolf-spiders/">wolf spiders</a>.</li>
<li>**Males:**The males of the species are typically shorter than 11 mm, with swollen appendages. The appendages are actually their reproductive organs.</li>
<li>**Females: **The female hobos have a length ranging from 11 mm - 14 mm. Their abdomens are larger than that of their male hobo spiders.
So, let&rsquo;s get into the details!
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spider Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-hobo-spider-are-they-serious">What Is A Hobo Spider? Are they Serious?</h2>
<p>**So, how can you tell a hobo spider? **
To tell if a spider is a hobo spider, look at its front body. The front body will be brown (with darker-brown markings) and it has brown legs and yellow abdomen markings.
<strong>Do They Bite?</strong>
They usually do not bite humans, contrary to popular belief. But if they feel threatened, or are provoked, they might.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hobo spiders will bite if they perceive a threat to their young ones or egg sacs - they&rsquo;ll be highly protective in this case.</li>
<li>Most people don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;re encroaching on the hobo spider, which typically hangs out in hidden and dark areas.</li>
<li>For the most part, they&rsquo;re harmless and just make webs but you need to know what they look like.
**Are They Dangerous? **
A previous study of the hobo spider venom reported that Hobo spiders are a medical threat and that they&rsquo;re cause necrotic lesions.</li>
<li>However, current research shows that hobo spiders<a href="https://www.usu.edu/today/story/hobo-spider-bite-may-not-be-so-dangerous">aren&rsquo;t medically threatening</a>
**Other Bug Problems **
The hobo spider, though an expert predator in its own right, is also preyed upon by other animals. These bugs include:</li>
<li>Centipedes</li>
<li>Birds</li>
<li>Bees,Mud-dauber wasps, and hornets</li>
<li>Spiders such as the wolf spider</li>
<li>Rodents and furry animals likesquirrelsor chipmunks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hobo-spider-ecology-habitat-and-distribution">Hobo Spider Ecology, Habitat, and Distribution</h2>
<p><strong>Where are hobo spiders found?</strong>
The spiders in the Agelenidae Family, including the Hobo spiders, spin entangled silk webs that serve as their prey traps, detection devices, and nests.</p>
<p>It is often seen on fence posts and tree branches as the sunset with its web being used to capture small insects flying overhead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally when found in buildings, it will be found seeking shelter under boxes or other debris.
**Their Webs? **
Hobo spiders will weave webs that are funnel-shaped with sticky silk that sticks to small insects flying by them while they are hunting for prey on their webs - they use them also as mating grounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&rsquo;ll create the webs in a tangle of vegetation or at the edge of trees and usually have more than one attachment point to the ground, such as stones or branches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Females stay within their web as males wander in search of mates.
<strong>What Do They Eat?</strong>
The primary food source of Hobo spiders is insects and arachnids, on which they feed until the animal dies. They are also known to prey upon other spiders and arthropods.</li>
<li>Once their prey touches the web triggers (detection devices), there are vibrations on the silken line that&rsquo;ll alert the Hobo.
Though the Hobo Spider bite is not often lethal, some of the symptoms such as necrosis are similar to what you get with bites from the brown recluse.
<strong>Geographic Range</strong>
They&rsquo;re largely Native to Europe but you&rsquo;ll mainly find Hobo Spiders in parts of;</li>
<li>Asia</li>
<li>Europe</li>
<li>The Pacific Northwest US</li>
<li>Montana</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>Utah</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>Wyoming</li>
<li>Oregon, and</li>
<li>Washington.
**Reproduction **
The male Hobo Spider (Tegenaria agrestis) mate with their receptive female counterparts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The male Hobos die or move on soon after the mating process.</p>
<p>So, the female spider is the one who does all of the work to produce new offspring.</p>
<ul>
<li>She lays a single egg sac, and then she guards it against predators until her babies hatch.</li>
<li>The young spiders will wait for their mother on top of or next to her web as she goes out hunting for food; after she returns with prey in tow, they will climb onto her back and feed while riding home again to protect themselves from potential danger along the way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-a-hobo-spider-poisonous">Is a hobo spider poisonous?</h2>
<p>No, the Hobo Spider is not venomous and does not pose any threat to humans or animals -
according to the CDC
.</p>
<p>Recent
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7488.html">studies</a>
show that the venom of the hobo spider does not create significant skin reactions in animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, some people are allergic to their bite and can develop symptoms such as local swelling, itching around the area bitten by the spider, headache, nausea, or vomiting, and general malaise.
If you experience these symptoms after being bit please seek medical attention immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hobos spiders do have an &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; reputation, but they are not venomous creatures. They will typically feed off smaller insects like flies and arachnids.</p>
<p>Notable spiders that have dangerous venom in the US are like the brown recluse or the black widow.</p>
<p>Hobo spiders are not known to be aggressive; instead, they show a tendency to flee and hide when disturbed.</p>
<p>The hobo spider is also not known to be found in areas where humans live, but they are often spotted on the sides of buildings or other places such as a barn.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-kill-a-hobo-spider">Should I kill a Hobo Spider?</h2>
<p>If you can avoid it&rsquo;s best not to kill hobo spiders, since having some spiders around helps keep down pests such as cockroaches; however, there are exceptions to this rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, were born with a natural fear of spiders, as evidenced by the physical response we have every time we see or touch one.
Therefore, sometimes we may have to kill these hobo spiders as a last resort if they are infesting our home and cannot be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hobo spider is not known to be poisonous; however, it can bite humans which may cause some discomfort but usually, no permanent damage will occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should kill hobos by using an aerosol product for killing insects such as bug spray and undertakethorough spider vacuuming.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-you-do-if-you-find-a-hobo-spider">What Do You Do If You Find A Hobo Spider?</h2>
<p>If you find a hobo spider, please contact an exterminator for
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-much-do-spider-exterminators-cost/">spider inspection and control</a>
as they have venomous fangs.</p>
<p>The spider exterminator may employ these steps to get rid of a hobo spider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum to get rid of those spiderwebs. Also, change your vacuum filter regularly; ideally, monthly.</li>
<li>Prevent wandering spiders from entering homes byinstalling sticky trapsin dark, damp places like basements and closets.</li>
<li>Use suitable insecticide powders, sprays, and dust (carefully following label instructions) on crevices, doorways, windows, and baseboards
Spray window screens, door thresholds, and garage doors with the insecticide.
<strong>If you find a hobo spider outdoors</strong>
where it is not dark or damp:</li>

**brown recluse and the **
black widow that&rsquo;s fatal to pets and humans.</p>
<p>If your pet or child is bitten by a hobo spider and shows signs of illness, contact the vet immediately for treatment advice.</p>
<p>Since hobos will typically stay in dark corners like sheds, basements, etc., you&rsquo;ll need to sweep them out with a broom into an outdoor area where they can&rsquo;t get back inside and then vacuum up their webs.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there&rsquo;s no access point outside that allows them to re-enter, use sticky traps as well because these spiders also live on walls.
The signs of a bite from such spiders on the cat or dog may include agitation, tremors, diarrhea, muscle rigidity, vomiting, cramping, and muscle pain.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An airless <a href="/posts/airless-paint-sprayer-cleaning-solution/">paint</a> <a href="/posts/best-paint-sprayer-for-ceiling/">sprayer</a> is a device used for spraying paint without the need for compressed air. It works by using a high-pressure pump to push the paint through a small nozzle, allowing it to be sprayed evenly onto surfaces. Airless sprayers are commonly used for large painting projects, such as homes, fences, and commercial spaces, due to their efficiency and ability to cover large areas quickly.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-an-airless-paint-sprayer-work">How Does an Airless Paint Sprayer Work?</h2>
<p>Airless paint sprayers use a motorized pump to force paint through a hose and out of the nozzle at high pressure. Unlike traditional spray guns, which rely on compressed air to atomize the paint, airless sprayers create a fine mist of paint by forcing it through a small opening under high pressure. This results in an even and smooth coat of paint with minimal overspray.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-using-an-airless-paint-sprayer">Advantages of Using an Airless Paint Sprayer</h2>
<ul>
<li>**Faster Application:**Airless sprayers are much faster than traditional paint brushes or rollers, making them ideal for large projects. The high pressure and wide spray pattern allow you to cover more surface area in less time.</li>
<li>**Even Coverage:**The consistent pressure helps achieve a smooth, even finish on walls and surfaces. This is especially helpful when working with textured surfaces or when trying to avoid brush marks.</li>
<li>**Reduced Overspray:**Airless sprayers tend to produce less overspray than traditional sprayers, meaning there is less waste and less mess to clean up.</li>
<li>**Versatility:**Airless sprayers can be used with a wide range of paints, stains, and coatings, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applications-of-airless-paint-sprayers">Applications of Airless Paint Sprayers</h2>
<p>Airless sprayers are versatile tools that can be used in a variety of applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Residential Painting:**Whether you&rsquo;re painting the interior or exterior of your home, an airless paint sprayer can help you achieve a professional-quality finish quickly and efficiently.</li>
<li>**Commercial Projects:**Airless sprayers are commonly used for commercial painting projects, such as painting buildings, warehouses, and fences.</li>
<li>**Furniture Refinishing:**Airless sprayers can also be used for refinishing furniture, providing a smooth and even coat of paint on surfaces such as tables, chairs, and cabinets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-airless-paint-sprayers">Types of Airless Paint Sprayers</h2>
<p>There are several types of airless paint sprayers available on the market, each designed for different types of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Standard Airless Sprayers:**These are the most common type of airless sprayers, ideal for medium to large painting projects. They are typically used by homeowners and professionals alike.</li>
<li>**Professional Airless Sprayers:**These are high-performance models designed for heavy-duty use in commercial settings. They offer greater power, precision, and durability.</li>
<li>**HVLP Sprayers:**High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP) sprayers are a variation of airless sprayers that use a lower pressure system. They are typically used for finer applications, such as detailed work or spray painting small surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Airless paint sprayers are an excellent tool for anyone looking to achieve a smooth, professional-quality paint job quickly and efficiently. Whether you&rsquo;re painting a large surface, refinishing furniture, or tackling a commercial project, an airless sprayer can save you time and effort. When choosing an airless sprayer, consider the type of project you&rsquo;ll be working on, the size of the area to be painted, and the type of paint you plan to use to ensure the best results.</p>

      <description>This question of what kills spiders instantly is very tricky. Why</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This question of what kills spiders instantly is very tricky. Why
kill the spiders
when a large number are harmless? Some eat mosquitoes and other bugs in our homes and play an important role in the ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>**So, what kills spiders instantly? Well, use essential oils, vinegar, diatomaceous earth, ammonia, bleach **<strong>among others. You can also use pest control products that kill fast though on the other hand, their safety levels are questionable.�</strong>
That notwithstanding, spiders in our houses-whether venomous or not make our houses look untidy. Related:
[Compare <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">Spider</a> Bite to Mosquito Bite](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/</a>)

[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spiders Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kills-spiders-instantly---a-safer-and-quicker-remedy">What Kills Spiders Instantly? -� A Safer and Quicker Remedy</h2>
<p>Though most spiders are harmless in our homes, some are a serious threat within the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the US some spiders like the black widow and brown recluse are very common and may force you to take immediate action against all spiders in your house.
As a homeowner, when killing those harmful spiders, always take note of the ways that are also safe and maybe the natural ways of doing it. Essential oils, vinegar, cider, ammonia, diatomaceous earth can be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth"><strong>1. Diatomaceous Earth</strong></h3>
<p>This is a white powder that is very common for use in our households to control
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-antennae/">common bugs and pests</a>
. The good thing about this powder is that it is safe for home use even when there are children and pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>This powder works by dehydrating spiders causing them to die. It absorbs the soils, waters, and fats from the spiders causing their death.</li>
<li>After contact with DE, it will not take more than 24 hours before the spider dies.� This powder also remains active
Also, the DE remains active as long as you are able to keep it intact and also dry within your house.
When applying a tablespoon of DE mixed in a bottle will effectively do the work of killing those venomous spiders and other bugs hiding within and outside your house.</li>
<li>Spray the target areas being careful not to inhale the dust because it is harmful.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ToC2kQm5Bk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ToC2kQm5Bk</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-vinegar"><strong>2. Vinegar</strong></h3>
<p>This is still another useful product within your house that you can use to control or kill spiders. Vinegar has acetic acid which plays a vital role in chasing spiders from our houses.</p>
<ul>
<li>It chases spiders by producing a strong odor that keeps them off.</li>
<li>Vinegar is very common in most homes and also safe to use where there are pets and children.
Before you can use vinegar in control against spiders, mix it with water in a ratio of 1:1 and then spray it around the infested area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ammonia-mixed-with-water-">**3. Ammonia Mixed With Water� **</h3>
<p>Ammonia is a good agent for use against spiders. It works by producing a staunch smell that rebels against them. However, it cannot be used alone and should be mixed with water in the ratio of 1:1.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have achieved this, you can then proceed to spray it around the affected areas to chase away the spiders.
Ammonia has also been used as one of the active ingredients to manufacture Windex which is used to kill spiders both outdoors and indoors.

<h3 id="4-citrus-">**4. Citrus **</h3>
<p>Citrus is as good as vinegar. You can use it to keep spiders out of your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use citrus in many forms. You can opt to mix it with water and spray it around your house to keep off the spiders.
You can spray it on their entry point on windows, crevices, and others hiding areas for the spiders. You can also use citrus to clean around your house. The strong smell from the citrus repels away the bugs and also spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-mint-">**5. Mint **</h3>
<p>Mint is among the essential oils that you can use to repel the spiders from your homes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When using this essential oil, it is good to mix it with water before you can spray it all-around your house and any other place you intend.
If what you have are the flesh peppermint leaves, try smashing the leaves in order for them to produce the smell. You can place them at strategic points within your house to repel all the bugs and spiders.

<h3 id="6-borax-">**6. Borax **</h3>
<p>Though borax is not used to kill spiders, it serves a very good purpose in keeping the spiders away from your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>As for borax, it kills the bugs and other insects within our homes that spiders feed on.
This leaves the spider with nothing to eat and with no choice but to relocate where there is food.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-vacuum-cleaning-and-dusting-">**7. Vacuum cleaning and dusting **</h3>
<p>Though this does not involve the use of chemicals and substances, dusting helps keep your house off spiders. Spiders love dusty areas where they can establish cobwebs to trap their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>With proper and regular dusting, spiders will not be able to thrive in such an environment.
Alternatively, vacuum cleaning is also a good option for dusting your home and keeping off spiders and also other insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-cedar-">**8. Cedar **</h3>
<p>This is also another essential oil that you can use to eliminate spiders and other bugs from your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like most other essential oils, mixing cedar with water makes it easy to spray around the infested areas and eliminate the spiders.
Dont allow spiders to scare you when all you can do is use cedar. Related:

</ul>
<h3 id="9-neat-housekeeping-">**9. Neat Housekeeping **</h3>
<p>Poor housekeeping is also a good recipe to attract spiders into your house.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you leave your house unattended for days, you are likely to find spiders and cobwebs all over.
To avoid all this keep your house neat as with regular cleaning, dusting and properly arranging your clothes in the wardrobe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p>Other than what kills spiders instantly, you can consider repelling them away from your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is despite some being venomous but a big number of spiders are also harmless and sometimes helpful by preying on dangerous insects in our homes like mosquitoes.</li>
<li>Even so, allowing spiders into our house makes it look weird and sometimes untidy.
Instead of killing them, you can repel them to the natural environment
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-spider-traps/">or trap them</a>
because they are an important part of other parts of the ecosystem. As discussed, use the trick of natural and safe ways of repelling spiders away from your home without harming them.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Painting concrete surfaces can be a great way to enhance their appearance and increase their longevity. However, not all paints are suitable for concrete. In this guide, we&rsquo;ll discuss the types of <a href="/posts/what-kind-of-paint-to-use-on-bathroom-cabinets/">paint</a> that can be used on concrete and the factors you should consider when choosing the right one for your project.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-paint-for-concrete">Types of Paint for Concrete</h2>
<h3 id="1-epoxy-paint">1. Epoxy Paint</h3>
<p>Epoxy paint is one of the most durable options for concrete surfaces. It is often used on floors, garage floors, and other high-traffic areas. Epoxy paint forms a tough, protective layer that resists stains, chemicals, and moisture. It&rsquo;s ideal for concrete that is subjected to heavy use, such as driveways and basements.</p>
<h3 id="2-acrylic-paint">2. Acrylic Paint</h3>
<p>Acrylic paint is a popular choice for concrete surfaces that require flexibility. It&rsquo;s water-based, easy to apply, and provides a long-lasting finish. Acrylic paint is resistant to fading and cracking, making it an excellent option for outdoor concrete surfaces like patios, walkways, and walls.</p>
<h3 id="3-concrete-stain">3. Concrete Stain</h3>
<p>While not technically paint, concrete stains are an excellent option for giving concrete surfaces a more natural, vibrant look. Stains penetrate the surface and enhance the color and texture of the concrete. They are often used to add a decorative touch to floors, driveways, and walls. However, stains don&rsquo;t offer the same level of protection as paint, so they may need to be sealed afterward.</p>
<h3 id="4-urethane-paint">4. Urethane Paint</h3>
<p>Urethane paint is highly durable and resistant to chemicals, moisture, and abrasions. It is often used for commercial concrete floors and high-traffic areas. Urethane provides a high-gloss finish that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. It&rsquo;s also a great option for concrete that will be exposed to heavy foot traffic or machinery.</p>
<h3 id="factors-to-consider-when-choosing-paint-for-concrete">Factors to Consider When Choosing Paint for Concrete</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Surface Condition:**Ensure the concrete surface is clean, dry, and free of contaminants before applying paint. Any dirt or oil can interfere with adhesion.</li>
<li>**Environment:**Consider the location of the concrete surface. Will it be exposed to heavy foot traffic, chemicals, or moisture? Choose a paint that offers the right level of protection for the environment.</li>
<li>**Durability:**Think about how long the paint will need to last. For high-traffic areas, choose a more durable option like epoxy or urethane paint.</li>
<li>**Appearance:**Different types of paint provide different finishes. Choose one that will complement the style and appearance of the area where it will be applied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>When choosing paint for concrete, it&rsquo;s important to consider the surface, environment, and level of durability required. Epoxy and urethane paints are excellent choices for high-traffic areas, while acrylic paints and concrete stains are great for decorative purposes. No matter what you choose, make sure to follow the proper preparation and application methods to ensure the best results.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to painting bathroom cabinets, you need a <a href="/posts/what-kind-of-paint-can-be-used-on-concrete/">paint</a> that can withstand humidity, moisture, and regular use. The right type of paint will not only make your cabinets look great but will also protect them from damage. Here are some of the best options for painting your bathroom cabinets:</p>
<h2 id="best-paint-types-for-bathroom-cabinets">Best Paint Types for Bathroom Cabinets</h2>
<ul>
<li>**Oil-Based Paint:**Oil-based paint is a durable option that can provide a smooth and long-lasting finish. Its resistant to moisture and humidity, making it perfect for bathroom cabinets. However, it has a longer drying time and has a strong odor, so proper ventilation is essential.</li>
<li>**Latex Paint:**Latex paint is water-based and dries faster than oil-based paints. It is a great choice for bathroom cabinets, especially if youre looking for a low-odor option. Latex paint also provides good coverage and is easy to clean up with water.</li>
<li>**Chalk Paint:**If you want a rustic or shabby-chic look for your bathroom cabinets, chalk paint is a great option. It doesnt require much prep work and can adhere to most surfaces. However, it is not as durable as oil-based or latex paints, so youll need to seal it with a protective topcoat to increase its longevity.</li>
<li>**Enamel Paint:**Enamel paint is known for its hard, glossy finish. Its resistant to moisture and can be used in high-traffic areas like the bathroom. Enamel paint is available in both oil-based and water-based formulas and offers excellent durability and ease of cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="factors-to-consider-when-choosing-paint-for-bathroom-cabinets">Factors to Consider When Choosing Paint for Bathroom Cabinets</h2>
<p>When selecting paint for your bathroom cabinets, keep the following factors in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Durability:**Choose a paint that can handle the moisture, humidity, and frequent use in the bathroom. Oil-based and enamel paints are typically more durable than latex and chalk paints.</li>
<li>**Finish:**The finish of your paint will affect the final look of your cabinets. Glossy and semi-gloss finishes are ideal for bathrooms, as they are easier to clean and can handle moisture better than matte finishes.</li>
<li>**Color:**Choose a color that complements the rest of your bathroom decor. Light colors like white, cream, and soft gray can brighten the space, while darker colors like navy or black can create a more dramatic look.</li>
<li>**Ease of Application:**If youre planning to do the painting yourself, consider the ease of application. Latex paint is typically easier to work with, especially for beginners, as it dries quickly and has a low odor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation-tips-before-painting-your-bathroom-cabinets">Preparation Tips Before Painting Your Bathroom Cabinets</h2>
<p>Proper preparation is key to achieving a smooth and long-lasting finish on your bathroom cabinets:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Clean the Surface:**Remove any dirt, grime, or grease from the cabinets. Use a mild soap solution or a degreaser to clean the surface thoroughly.</li>
<li>**Sand the Surface:**Lightly sand the cabinets to remove any old paint or varnish. Sanding will also help the new paint adhere better to the surface.</li>
<li>**Prime the Cabinets:**Applying a primer will help create a smooth surface for the paint and improve adhesion, especially if youre using a light-colored paint over dark cabinets.</li>
<li>**Protect Surrounding Areas:**Use painters tape and plastic sheeting to protect walls, countertops, and floors from any paint splatters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application-tips-for-a-professional-finish">Application Tips for a Professional Finish</h2>
<p>Follow these tips to ensure your painted cabinets look like they were done by a professional:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Use a High-Quality Brush or Roller:**A high-quality brush or foam roller will help you achieve an even, smooth finish. For a flawless result, use a brush for detailed areas and a roller for large surfaces.</li>
<li>**Apply Thin Coats:**Apply multiple thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat. This will prevent drips and give a smoother finish. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next one.</li>
<li>**Seal the Cabinets:**After painting, apply a protective clear coat to seal the paint and add extra durability. Polyurethane or a clear acrylic topcoat works well to protect the paint from moisture and wear.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Choosing the right paint for your bathroom cabinets is essential for achieving a beautiful and durable finish. Consider your preferences and the specific conditions in your bathroom when selecting the paint type, and be sure to follow proper preparation and application techniques for the best results. With the right materials and techniques, you can transform your bathroom cabinets and give them a fresh new look.</p>

<em>So, feed the bearded dragons with fruits (tomatoes, mangoes, bananas or grapes, etc.), vegetables (cabbages, broccoli, greens, pepper, sweet potato, or cucumber, etc.), insects (king-worms, meal-worms, crickets, etc.), or substrates for bearded dragons.�</em>
Thus, its evident
<a href="https://cvm.ncsu.edu/documents/caring-for-your-bearded-dragon/">bearded dragons</a>
will feed on various foods, including fruits, vegetables, insects, and equally the commercially available substrates.

will mainly feed on animals, including mice, rats, worms, roaches (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-killer-for-apartments/">check roach killers</a>

But they&rsquo;ll also eat some fruit and vegetables. They related -

<li>Locusts</li>
<li>Dubai roaches</li>
<li>Silkworms
However, only adult Bearded Dragons because of their exterior skin that&rsquo;s hard. Therefore, don&rsquo;t give the baby bearded dragons such as insect meat.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-include-extra-supplements-and-proteins">2. Include Extra Supplements and Proteins</h3>
<p>Besides the fruits and vegetables, I suggest you get some extra supplements (substrates) plus some proteins to spice up the bearded dragon&rsquo;s diet.
The diet can include feeding them a dragon with 2-3 meals daily plus some additional supplements and an extra meal or insect - these provide the critical proteins. Avoid lowing insects, including Lightning bugs, since they&rsquo;re toxic to your dragons.
I recommend you feed your dragon with just the gut-loaded insects, which points out that they&rsquo;ll provide a high level of nutrients.
Further, offer some Dubai
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">baby roaches</a>
, earthworms, crickets besides spraying some calcium powder on the pet&rsquo;s food. You may add some meal-worms, wax-worms, and butter-worms for extra fat.

<h3 id="1-strawberries">1. Strawberries?</h3>
<p>Strawberries are a favorite food for bearded dragons, but you must wash and cut them into small pieces before giving them to your beadier.
But, can bearded dragons eat strawberry seeds? Well, bearded dragons will eat the strawberry seeds since they&rsquo;re located outside the fruit - particularly on the achenes ovaries.
Strawberry seeds will provide the beardies with great nutrients but don&rsquo;t feed them excessively to your pet as it&rsquo;ll lead to stomach problems.

<p>Bearded dragons will eat bananas (phosphorus)- however - only be 1-2 times every 30 days. Excessive feeding with bananas may lead to sicknesses like Metabolic Bone disease due to calcium deficiency.
Bananas will contain the following nutrients Calcium (5 mg), Phosphorus (22 mg), Magnesium (27 mg), and Iron (0.3 mg) that&rsquo;ll be helpful to your Bearded dragons if fed in moderation.</p>

<h2 id="what-vegetables-can-bearded-dragons-eat">What Vegetables Can Bearded Dragons Eat?</h2>
<p>The baby of bearded dragons won&rsquo;t feed on most of the vegetables out there. Mainly, baby beardies eat 20% vegetables + fruits and 80% insects.
Please don&rsquo;t feed the pet with pale vegetables such as celery or iceberg lettuce because they have limited nutrients.
Adult bearded dragons eat 80% vegetables + fruits and 20% insects - a total reverse of what the baby beardies eat. Bearded dragons eat many vegetables, including turnip greens, mustard, and collards.</p>

Don&rsquo;t feed the Bearded dragons with spinach - simply because these leafy vegetables will significantly bind their calcium, and thus the pet won&rsquo;t absorb them easily.

      <description>You don&amp;#39;t want raccoons digging up your yard or tearing apart your house or garbage can, but you also don&amp;#39;t like the idea of killing them.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don&rsquo;t want raccoons digging up your yard or tearing apart your house or garbage can, but you also don&rsquo;t like the idea of killing them.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of repellents that claim they will<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-raccoons/">keep away raccoons</a>, but what smells do Raccoons hate? What do animals respond to most strongly?
**Answer: In brief, raccoons hate irritating smells like those from Epsom salt, peppermint oil, garlic, onion, and hot pepper. **
**Also, real or synthetic scents of predator urine will repel raccoons. **
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Raccoons Repellents&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-problems-will-raccoons-bring-to-your-property">What Problems Will Raccoons Bring to Your Property?</h2>
<p>Raccoons are hardy and adaptable mammals that thrive around homes where they have great access to shelter and food - they&rsquo;ll also transmit diseases like
<a href="https://www.addl.purdue.edu/newsletters/1997/fall/%5Braccoon%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-raccoons/).shtml">Leptospirosis</a>
.</p>
<p>The sense of smell is the most important sense that raccoons have. Also, their hands are small, but they&rsquo;re strong enough to rummage your garbage bins.</p>
<p>So, if you dont get rid of the raccoons quickly, a couple more problems arise:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Female raccoons may enter your house, attic, or chimney to give birth</strong>(fast reproduction), and they will leave feces in every nook.</li>
<li>**They will leave feces on the floors **of your house, attic, yard, or swimming pool - these are smells and problems we&rsquo;d want to avoid - just as we dowith geese.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;ll rummage the garbage cans to find food, and they&rsquo;ll also tear down garden shrubs for berries, birdseed, and pet food -<strong>leaving a huge mess</strong></li>
<li><strong>Raccoons will prey on your pets</strong>such as chickens, fish, as well as your birds and ducks.
Other problems that you may be experiencing with raccoons include loud barking and howling in the evening hours, invading your home for food, and leaving fecal droppings on the ground or your structures.
*With that said: *
*Some scents are documented to be great as turning off raccoons from different spaces such as your home. *</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>*But these *<em>scents and smells may not be reliable over the long term since they need to be applied regularly and remain at a strong level in the area where it is desired that raccoons do not go.</em>
**If the raccoon problem has gotten out of hand, and your property, humans, and pets - you can **
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/pest-control-near-me/"><strong>check for pest exterminators near you</strong></a>

<h2 id="what-smells-do-raccoons-hate---the-7-scents-that-repel-raccoons">What Smells Do Raccoons Hate - The 7 Scents That Repel Raccoons</h2>
<h3 id="scent-1-sprinkle-hot-pepper">Scent 1: Sprinkle Hot Pepper</h3>
<p>Raccoons rely on their sense of smell to find food. One of the most common scents that are used as a repellant for raccoons is hot peppers.</p>
<p>Although they don&rsquo;t actually have to be fresh - many people will dry and grind their own peppers at home, which you can then sprinkle around your garden or other areas that would deter these animals from coming in contact with them.</p>
<p>In addition, a lot of these are mixed with other scents such as garlic or red pepper flakes in order to make the smell even stronger and more effective.</p>
<p>But if this sounds like too much work, there are also products available on sites such as Amazon, which helps make it easy enough to buy what you need without having to prepare it on your own.</p>
<p>I recommend the Cayenne Pepper Powder that has 90,000 heat units to repel the raccoons.</p>
<ul>
<li>I bought this to get rid of raccoons, opossums, and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-gopher-traps/">gophers</a>that were getting into my yard. It worked in repelling the raccoons and it is safe.
The only downside is that hot pepper irritates the raccoons&rsquo; and such animals&rsquo; sense of smell, but the scent will diminish after a while.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying hot pepper in the places where raccoons are most likely to find food will keep them away for a few days - so you must re-apply the hot pepper.</p>
<h3 id="scent-2-use-pepper--onion">Scent 2: Use Pepper + Onion</h3>
<p>You can make your own mixture by combining pepper and onion. It is important to use fresh ingredients, as old spices will not be potent enough for the raccoons to notice it.</p>
<p>Hot peppers are often an effective repellent for raccoons, but perhaps theyre not tough enough to keep those pesky intruders out of your yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>To make sure youre really making the most of their scent-based deterrents, combine onion and hot peppers in a 50:50 ratio. Simmer them together over boiling water and sprinkle around.
This mixture of ingredients makes for a nasty concoction that will anger raccoons&rsquo; sense of smell while releasing an awful odor that may ward them off.</li>
<li>But it also requires a re-application a minimum of twice a week as the pepper-onion smell will fade within days.
So, the pepper + onion smell will repel the raccoons and other pests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scent-3-peppermint-oil">Scent 3: Peppermint Oil</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an affordable option to keep raccoons out of your garden this is our favorite spray made with peppermint essential oil that smells like Christmas!</p>
<p>The peppermint essential oil is unique because it has a natural repellent property besides being used in different industries.</p>
<p>The peppermint essential oil has a strong scent that is repellent to raccoons and other pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>It also comes in an all-natural liquid form, which can be diluted with water for use as a spray or mixed into another medium such as cooking oils to create your own homemade pest deterrent!
I recommend you purchase Rodent Sheriff Peppermint as it&rsquo;ll repel raccoons and other bugs such as roaches and mice. You can spray it on trash cans, sheds, attics, kitchens, basements, and Garages.</li>
<li>I got my package on Saturday and just finished spraying down my car. Rats ate along the side of it, so I wanted to keep them away before they could do more damage.</li>
<li>Stink stuff like this was supposed to work but it never has before. Well, guess what? This time around, rats never bothered me!</li>
<li>I sprayed a lot of Rodent Sheriff Peppermint because there must have been quite a few rodents living in that old car, but not anymore!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scent-4-use-epsom-salt">Scent 4: Use Epsom Salt</h3>
<p>Epsom salt is a useful solution for creating an environment that raccoons will choose to avoid - besides being a great fertilizer for yards and gardens.</p>
<p>Sprinkle the Epsom salt over a surface where raccoons frequently come to forage.</p>
<p>Epsom salts are inexpensive and can be purchased at most grocery stores or pharmacies.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is often used as an ingredient in fertilizer and bath salts, so if you would like more information about how much Epsom salt to use or other methods on how best to apply this solution check your local resources!
Here&rsquo;s the secret to keeping raccoons out of your garden: scatter the Epsom salts around and they will stop raccoons in their tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent these critters from sniffing out rubbish bins and food left outside in your yard, sprinkle Epsom salt around the edges so they will have to find their next meal elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="scent-5-eviction-fluid">Scent 5: Eviction Fluid</h3>
<p>To evict a female raccoon,
<a href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/icwdm_wdmconfproc/173/">scientists discovered</a>
that the smell of male urine, or what we call Eviction Fluid (EF), is the solution.</p>
<p>Eliminating nursing raccoons from an area can be difficult if they have found a good spot to raise their young ones and establish their territory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EF gives off a strong scent and lasts for weeks after application on hard surfaces like concrete, asphalt, wood, plastic decking, etc., so female raccoons will not return once displaced with this product!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eviction fluid is a human safe, humane and effective way to repel Raccoons from your property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once applied it will create a noxious odor for raccoons which they find intolerable so as soon as they detect this smell, theyll be gone!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply that Eviction fluid in the attic and chimney as these are the areas that the nursing raccoon will hide their babies. Thus, the female raccoon will escape the strong &ldquo;male raccoon&rdquo; scent.</p>
<h3 id="scent-6-use-predator-urine">Scent 6: Use Predator Urine</h3>
<p>Raccoons have a great sense of smell and can detect prey from far away.</p>
<p>Predator urine is designed to mimic the natural &ldquo;scents&rdquo; found in nature such as fox, coyote, or wolf urine.</p>
<p>These scents are built into their DNA that they find attractive because it signals an area where food might be obtained nearby.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best news about using predator urine for your garden - you don&rsquo;t need to put up with pesky raccoons!
One of the most popular ways to keep raccoons away is by using a scent that smells like another predator who has already claimed this area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raccoons have a notoriously bad habit of getting comfortable in peoples yards. Once they realize youve arrived and their natural predators are no longer around, theyll stick around as long as theres food to eat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the urine of predators to frighten raccoons in your home into another location.
Predator animals mark their territory by urinating around the area to stake a claim. The best solution is to deter them with a little bit of predator pee such as PredatorPee Combo.</li>
<li>I live in an area with many raccoons cats, and they often roam freely. Although these furry friends never intentionally come into my yard, their fur on the back patio everywhere is very difficult to clean up.
Finding that cats were littering my yard with their urine was a nightmare, but thanks to PredatorPee Combo, you can take back your territory.</li>
<li>One of the reasons why it does work is that Predator Urine contains the appropriate amount of hormones and pheromones in order for raccoons to be repelled.
Raccoons have been on my property for the better part of a year. I can&rsquo;t do much about them because they live in my yard.</li>
<li>But what I wanted was to keep them out of my yard and away from the furniture by my patio. After trying other solutions to no avail, there&rsquo;s finally one that works: PredatorPee Combo.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on the question &ldquo;what smells do Raccoons hate?&rdquo; the answer has been found.</p>
<p>Here are a few smells that Raccoons hate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>citronella, Hot Pepper, Onions, lavender, predator urine, peppermint essential oils, and Eviction fluid.

raccoon&rsquo;s <a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74116.html">sound</a>
?
**Well, the question at hand is, what sound does a raccoon make? Raccoons produce sounds like **
**churring/purring, barking, chattering, hissing, and growling. **
<strong>Raccoons may squeal, screech (like a whistle), snarl, or scream as well. Snorting and whimpering sounds are associated with adult raccoons, while baby raccoons make mewing, cry, and whine.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-what-sound-does-a-raccoon-make">Details: What Sound Does a Raccoon Make</h2>
<p>These raccoon sounds are made mainly when communicating with each other, searching for shelter &amp; food, defending the baby raccoon, or fighting over a family colony.</p>
<h3 id="1-churringpurring">1. Churring/Purring</h3>
<p>Churring/purring is exclusive sound made by the baby raccoons in their den.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult female raccoon licks, holds, or nibbles young ones as a sign of care - in return, the cub reciprocate by purring.
The baby raccoons will continue to purr as long as the mother is touching them. For adult raccoons, they purr as a sign of happiness or affection to each other.
If you pay keen attention, you will identify raccoon sounds easily since raccoons make sounds as they move along, unlike other wild animals. Importantly, raccoons are more active at night than day time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-barking">2. Barking</h3>
<p>Barking is a vocalization sound made by raccoons when suffering or when stressed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raccoon stresses are caused by situation such as hunger and continuous attacks in their colony.
Further, raccoon barks when stuck (in a wall or hole) or in such a case where they cant find their baby raccoons.

</ul>
<h3 id="3-chittering">3. Chittering</h3>
<p>Chittering is a sound made by raccoons in context such as; when female calls the baby cubs, when communicating to other raccoons, or when baby raccoons come to meet their mother.
In addition, raccoon chitters when searching for food, in case they want to move about, or when they are playing happily in their resting place.
Since raccoons are very vocal during breeding times, you will hear chittering sound when they are mating or when calling their mate partners.</p>
<h3 id="4-hissing--growling">4. Hissing &amp; Growling</h3>
<p>Hissing and growling sound is made by raccoons only when they feel threatened, cornered, or trapped - it&rsquo;s usually a way of scaring the enemy.</p>
<ul>
<li>When hissing, raccoons tends to show their crawls and teeth as way of displaying their braveness.</li>
<li>Female mother raccoon can also growl or hiss when protecting her cubs/babies.
NB: Don&rsquo;t try to catch growling raccoon as it may attack you dangerously in revenge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-squealingscreamingscreechingsnarling">5. Squealing/Screaming/Screeching/Snarling</h3>
<p>Screeching, screaming, snarling, and squealing are violent sound made by raccoons when fighting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raccoon screeching sound is sharp and can often be confused with owl sound or cat fighting sound.
Furthermore, raccoons can squeal and scream when in pain or distress.

</ul>
<h3 id="6-mewingcryingwhining">6. Mewing/Crying/Whining</h3>
<p>Mewing is common sound produced by baby raccoons in search for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, the cubs may cry when scared as well.
Whining sound is made by both baby and adult raccoons in as soothing mode or when they notice a new raccoon family encroaching into their territory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-sound-is-made-by-raccoon-movement">Which Sound is Made by Raccoon Movement?</h2>
<p>Raccoon movement may make either of the sound highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-dragging">1. Dragging</h3>
<p>Heavyweight raccoons (10-15 pounds) move slowly as they drag their feet along, especially on the rooftops.
The extra weight causes drag sound impacts on the floor or fixtures when a raccoon makes slight movement. Moreover, you will notice similar sound on the wall or inside a chimney as well.
In case you hear heavy thumping or loud sounds (footprint sound), especially in the beginning of the year when breeding is pronounced, it could be raccoons mating or looking for breeding ground in your home - most raccoon babies are born in summer (January to March).
However, such heavy mating sounds are usually accompanied by vocalizations and chittering.</p>
<h3 id="2-rustling">2. Rustling</h3>
<p>Rustling is a common sound made by raccoon when searching for food in garbage pits or bins while using their feet or mouthpart- raccoons push waste in the bins (using front feet/mouth) in order to get clearer view of available meal within, thus making rustling sound more audible in the process.
In addition, raccoons make rustling sound when tearing up wooden structures or brushing up their bodies against beams/walls in your attic.
When raccoon access book store (especially one with nylon papers), they make louder rustling sound.</p>
<h3 id="3-scratching">3. Scratching</h3>
<p>Scratch is a sharp sound made by raccoons with their craws when climbing walls, rooftops, chimney, or sliding on furniture.
Usually, the grip of the raccoon foot fails to hold onto the surface gently thus engaging the craws (to prevent fall), which cause scratching sound in the process.
Be keen when you detect similar sound in your cabinet, wardrobe, wall unit, or granary - that&rsquo;s a sign of raccoon invasion.
NB: Engage professional if you are new to raccoons in order to avoid any danger that may arise.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-raccoons-make-sounds">Why Do Raccoons Make Sounds?</h2>
<p>Usually, raccoons may make sound due to some of the reasons stated below:</p>
<h3 id="1-in-case-of-danger">1. In case of Danger</h3>
<p>When raccoons detect danger in the vicinity, they make deep loud scaring sound.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sound is meant to scare any oncoming enemy or mark their territory.
At times, raccoon may scream when
attacked while alone due to excess fear
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-when-communicating">2. When Communicating</h3>
<p>Raccoons make soft rhythmical sound when communicating with each other. It could be asking for food, or planning to team for battle, as well as organizing for their mating season.
You will notice intermittent sound pattern in the midst of darkness, when you pay keen attention - these are in most cases raccoons communication signals.</p>
<h3 id="3-when-fighting">3. When Fighting</h3>
<p>During war or battle, adult raccoon screech as a defensive mechanism or way of expressing pain.
On the other hand, baby raccoon will cry in case the battle breaks up in their family territory to alert other raccoons in the neighborhood.</p>
<h3 id="4-when-hungry---in-search-of-food">4. When Hungry - in search of food</h3>
<p>Raccoon snarl, squeals, or cry, especially baby raccoon, when hungry.</p>
<ul>
<li>The hunger sound is pronounced with extent to which the raccoon has stayed without food.
Though most adult raccoons are able to contend hunger sound on their own, baby raccoons will keep crying or squealing the whole night - perhaps hopping for a savior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-scare-other-raccoons">5. Scare other Raccoons</h3>
<p>Since raccoon live in family colonies, each raccoon family wants to protect its territory from other raccoon family in all manner.
In this case, they make scaring sound any time they detect invasion from other raccoon family in their habitation.</p>
<h3 id="6-when-stressed-or-suffering">6. When Stressed or Suffering</h3>
<p>When Stressed up or suffering, raccoons tend to bark more and in a continuous way.
Raccoon stresses could result from lack of food, continuous attack by enemies, or when they can&rsquo;t find their babies.</p>
<h3 id="7-when-playing">7. When Playing</h3>
<p>Playing is common with raccoon, especially after meals - they run after each other on the
rooftops or open fields
.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will hear quick sound steps or rolling sound at night when raccoons are playing.
For baby raccoons, the playing sound is accompanied by other vocalizations and screaming or chittering.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-alternative-ways-of-detecting-raccoons">What are Alternative Ways of Detecting Raccoons?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to consider alternative ways (apart from raccoon sounds) of detecting sounds highlighted below in order to attain full certainty.</p>
<h3 id="1-using-poop-or-droppings">1. Using Poop or Droppings</h3>
<p>Raccoon poop or droppings are usually elongated cylindrical solid substances that are piled up in one area (not scattered). The size of each fecal matter is about 3 to 6 inches long.
Raccoon droppings are pinky brown in color that rangers from light to dark brown. Moreover, fresh raccoon poop has strong unpleasant smell which can be detected a couple of feet away.
Usually, the fresh raccoon droppings are accompanied by urine (wet ground), which has slight smell. It&rsquo;s easier to locate raccoon poop since they have specific area in which they excrete - treat such places as &ldquo;family latrine&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2-using-tracks---footprint-and-handprints">2. Using Tracks - Footprint and Handprints</h3>
<p>Raccoon tracks are found on surfaces along areas they use while searching food or breeding grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such surfaces could be soft sand, muddy ground, wet items, floors, or rooftops.
Usually, the raccoon footprints and handprints are left on surfaces along their path - you will notice paw marks, especially the fresh laid prints.
Also, you can identify raccoons by scratch marks on the wall surface, chimney interior, or roof surface - though such marks may be similar to that of cat, the depth is extra, while the width is extended.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-nocturnal-behavior-pattern">3. Nocturnal Behavior Pattern</h3>
<p>Unlike most wild animals, raccoons are more active at night than daytime.
You will find raccoon feeding at night or searching for food at such times. Further, raccoons mate in dark and nurse their babies similar times.
In case you notice such continuous activities at night in your home, there is high possibilities of having raccoon invasion.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary on the question, what sound does a raccoon make; the sounds made could either be churring/purring, barking, chittering, hissing, or growling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, raccoons may snarl, squeal, screech (like whistle), or scream as well. Whimpering and Snorting sounds are commonly made by adult raccoons, while baby raccoons whine, mew, or cry instead.
Usually, the raccoon sounds are meant for communication with each other, searching for shelter &amp; food, defending the babies from attacks, or invasive fight over family colony.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed bugs are notorious for being resilient pests that can infest your home without you even noticing. One of the most effective ways to eliminate them is by using <a href="/posts/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/">temperature</a> to your advantage. Bed bugs cant survive extreme temperatures, and applying either heat or cold is an effective strategy to eradicate them.</p>
<h2 id="how-heat-can-kill-bed-bugs">How Heat Can <a href="/posts/does-the-dryer-kill-fleas/">Kill</a> Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>Bed bugs are sensitive to heat, and exposing them to temperatures above 113F (45C) for several minutes can kill them at all life stages, from eggs to adults. The heat needs to be sustained for at least 90 minutes to be effective, so using heat treatment methods like steam cleaning or using a heat chamber can be highly beneficial. However, it is important to monitor the temperature carefully, as exceeding 120F (49C) can damage your furniture and belongings.</p>
<h2 id="cold-temperatures-for-bed-bug-control">Cold Temperatures for Bed Bug Control</h2>
<p>Cold temperatures are another effective way to kill bed bugs. Freezing bed bugs at temperatures below 0F (-18C) for several days will also kill them. Placing smaller items like bedding or clothing in the freezer for several days can be an effective method to eliminate these pests. However, freezing is generally less effective for larger items, such as furniture or mattresses, where heat treatments tend to be more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="why-temperature-based-methods-work">Why Temperature-Based Methods Work</h2>
<p>Both heat and cold disrupt the physiological processes of bed bugs. When exposed to high heat, their proteins and enzymes begin to break down, and they are unable to survive. On the other hand, freezing temperatures can cause ice crystals to form in their bodies, leading to cellular damage and death. By understanding these principles, you can use temperature-based methods to help eliminate bed bugs from your home.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-using-temperature-to-kill-bed-bugs">Tips for Using Temperature to Kill Bed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>**Use a professional heat treatment:**If you have a large infestation, hiring a professional pest control service that offers heat treatment may be necessary. They can apply the heat uniformly and safely to kill bed bugs.</li>
<li>**Monitor temperature levels:**Ensure that the temperature remains consistent for the required time when using heat treatments. Inadequate exposure time can lead to ineffective results.</li>
<li>**Seal items before freezing:**If freezing items to kill bed bugs, make sure to place them in sealed plastic bags to prevent reinfestation from other sources.</li>
<li>**Combine methods:**A combination of heat, cold, and chemical treatments may be required for severe infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Temperature treatments are an effective way to kill bed bugs and prevent future infestations. Whether you choose heat or cold, it is essential to understand how to apply these methods correctly. For severe cases, seeking professional pest control services is highly recommended to ensure thorough and lasting elimination of bed bugs from your home.</p>

Knowing their most active time or season presents an excellent opportunity to prevent bites or diseases they come with. So, when do mosquitoes come out?
<em>Well, mosquitoes will come out either during the day or night, depending on the species. However, they often avoid the scorching midday sunlight to prevent dehydration. Besides, they remain active in the warmer months and hibernate during winter.�</em>
But its possible to have mosquitoes in indoor
<a href="http://vectorbio.rutgers.edu/outreach/habitat.php">spaces during the winter season</a>
because its warmer inside there. Thus it would help if you were prepared with mosquito repellents during winter to keep off those that come indoors to escape low temperatures out there.

.�The time of the day that mosquitoes come out to varies from one species to another.
Out of the 176 recognized mosquito species in the U.S, only two are regarded as the most common. These include Culex Pipiens (common house mosquito) and the Aedes Aegypti (Asian tiger).
The Aedes usually come out during the day. They tend to be active from the morning up to late afternoon when they aggressively
bite humans like fleas
to get a blood meal.
They can infect humans with yellow fever, Zika virus, chikungunya, and dengue fever.
Culex pipiens start biting in the evening and may remain active a couple of hours during the night. When Culex mosquitoes are infected with the West Nile virus, they can transmit it to humans through bites.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">The Anopheles mosquitoes usually bite</a>
throughout the better part of the night, including dusk and dawn. They are known to cause malaria in humans. Read Also:

<h2 id="are-mosquitoes-active-throughout-the-year"><strong>Are Mosquitoes Active Throughout The Year?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, you might have heard or come across some literature about mosquito season. These are times of the year when youre likely to experience maximum mosquito presence or bites. But does it have to do with the seasons?
Its something to do with the temperature levels and not the season. Since mosquitoes are cold-blooded creatures, their activity is affected by the temperature in their surroundings. Naturally, their action tends to be at the highest during the warm summer season.
Mosquitoes begin to become active above 10C, often reaching full activity when temperatures reach 26C and above.
Thus you expect higher chances of bites and infections from mosquitoes during such conditions.�However, as temperatures escalate, mosquitoes go into hiding to escape dehydration.
Winter seasons are worst for mosquitoes. When temperatures fall below 10C, they result in hibernation, and a period often referred to as diapause. During this period, youre less likely to experience mosquito bites.

<h2 id="why-are-mosquitoes-active-at-certain-times"><strong>Why Are Mosquitoes Active at Certain Times?</strong></h2>
<p>Naturally, mosquitoes are regarded as crepuscular because of their heightened activity at dusk and dawn. They prefer these hours because wind travels at slow speed, and theres the presence of UV and polarized light.
Besides, there is increased humidity at these hours, which favors the functioning of their odor and thermal receptors. This enables them to locate their prey with ease. Read Also:

<strong>Schedule Your Travel to Off-Season:</strong>
Some places like the equatorial regions are notorious for mosquito infestations, leading to illnesses. The best time to travel to these places is during the winter season when mosquitoes are less active.
To be on the safe side, its advisable to get vaccinated against mosquito-related illnesses, especially if youre traveling to high-risk areas.
<strong>Continuous Maintenance:</strong>
Its not enough to put up measures in readiness for the mosquito season. Regular assessment of risk factors can help you seal the loopholes that may put you at risk of mosquito infestation.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-for-mosquito-season"><strong>How to Prepare for Mosquito Season</strong></h2>
<p>Mosquitoes will disappear during winter and resurface once the cold season is over. Not only is the warm weather favorable to mosquitoes, but its also accompanied by rains that favor their breeding.
But how do you enjoy the favorable warm weather with mosquitoes in their most current mood?
Well, below are few
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-prevention/">tips to help you prepare your home against termites</a>
and for the dreaded mosquito season.
<strong>Get Ready for The Mosquito Season:</strong>
Mosquitoes wreak havoc immediately as temperatures begin to get above 10 degrees. You should expect mosquitoes are starting spring all through to early fall.
So, it would help if you considered arming yourself with mosquito repellents and mosquito traps.
The repellents expel as many mosquitoes as possible while the traps capture those that manage to come by.
<strong>Get Rid of Stagnant Water:</strong>
Standing water provides the most conducive environment for mosquitoes to breed. So, identifying and draining standing water around your house goes a long way to minimize mosquito breeding.
With the onset of rainfall, its also essential to identify and remove items that may collect water in your backyard or lawn. Old tires, garbage cans, open ditches, clogged gutters, and tarps are potential areas for standing water.
Also, repair any leaking taps in your backyard as these could lead to stagnant water. Read Also:

.
<strong>Clear Bushes, maw Grass, and Trim the Fence:</strong>
Overgrown vegetation provides hiding areas for mosquitoes to escape the heat during the day. Therefore, the plant should be kept to minimal levels to make it unattractive for mosquitoes to hide.
<strong>Erect Mosquito Screens:</strong>
Putting up mosquito screens on your windows and doors early minimizes mosquitoes&rsquo; chances of getting indoors. You can erect the displays shortly before the temperature starts soaring up.
<strong>Beware of Peak Times:</strong>
Mosquitoes tend to be active in the morning, evenings, and afternoons.
If you must go out during these times, then you should consider having extra protection in the form of repellents, head nets, and so on. These could be helpful, especially when youre in the garden or during a hike.

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The winter season brings a lot of relief from mosquito bites and illnesses. That because mosquitoes tend to hibernate from the cold weather.
But once the winter is over, you need to get prepared to protect yourself and your family from the resurgence of mosquitoes.�Armed with the above knowledge and tips, you dont have to abandon your routines for fear of mosquitoes.
However, more considerable precautions are necessary when outdoors. Besides clearing hiding and breeding areas, you can use repellents and wear long-sleeved
clothes to prevent bites

From the
<a href="https://www.livescience.com/22122-types-of-spiders.html">over 40,000 spiders species</a>
, like argiopes or garden orb weavers only survive for a single season - they&rsquo;ll die over winter but will leave their eggs in sacs ready to hatch. But tarantula or fishing <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> live longer.</p>
<p><strong>Spiders hibernate under attics, cellars, piles of leaves, rocks (rock piles), sheds, garages, underground burrows, or trees. So, do spiders hibernate?�</strong>
Well,
<a href="https://cc.zdtc.app/v1/otc/05YcxvrJv7bM0tkN3uaIbHd?veneer=dynamic&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.burkemuseum.org%2Fblog%2Fmyth-spiders-come-indoors-fall">just 5% of spiders spicies</a>
hibernate to indoor spaces such as your home during <a href="/posts/10-winter-landscaping-ideas-to-spruce-up-your-outdoor-space/">winter</a>. Most spiders won&rsquo;t try getting into your house during winter - it was just a spider myth. Spiders are cold blooded and thus may die or fail to reproduce when they get into your warm house.</p>
<h2 id="details-where-do-spiders-go-in-the-winter">Details: Where Do Spiders Go in the Winter?</h2>
<p>Through natural instincts, the spiders will move to better sheltered areas during winter. These include rock piles, bark cracks on trees or under leaf litter. During winter, the favorable conditions in these areas plus their antifreeze keep the fleas alive.
In addition. spiders like the tarantula will lay their eggs during spring and thus will safely cross the harsh winter as babies in their protective cocoons.
Further, some of the baby spiders, after hatching, will hide in the egg sacs that are webbed for use by the whole spider community over the winter period.
However, the spiders that&rsquo;ll be hiding under rock piles and leaf litter� won&rsquo;t be sleeping (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-sleep/">spiders don&rsquo;t sleep</a>
) but may be moving around searching for food.</p>
<h3 id="1-outdoor-spiders">1 Outdoor Spiders</h3>
<p>Sutdoor spiders� will live very comfortably in your outdoor spaces but won&rsquo;t easily survive the conditions in the indoors. E.g. North American spider can&rsquo;t survive the winter in the indoor shelters.</p>
<p>As &ldquo;cold-blooded&rdquo; insects, spiders won&rsquo;t be attracted to conditions of warmth in the indoor spaces. Thus, spider&rsquo;s won;t get cold or shiver from the winter - they become come dormant and less active.
The outdoor spiders will hibernate into indoor spaces but won&rsquo;t reproduce or they&rsquo;ll even die.
Further, spiders come with &ldquo;antifreeze&rdquo; in their bodies - particularly those from temperate areas. Therefore, antifreeze prevents the spider&rsquo;s body from freezing at temperatures above about -5 C.</p>
<h3 id="2-indoor-or-house-spiders">2. Indoor or House spiders</h3>
<p>The indoor or house spiders are few in terms of species but they&rsquo;ll conditioned to live in the indoor conditions - i.e. limited water supply, bad food supply, and constant climate.
Historically, some species of the house spiders (mainly found in Europe) are known to have always lived in the indoor spaces. The spiders have moved worldwide and some are conditioned to live in the outdoor spaces such as in North America.
These house spiders will occupy your house through
<a href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-all-spiders-make-webs">eggs sacs</a>
that comes with building materials or old furniture. They&rsquo;ll mainly live in the house and only emerge during
<a href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-late-summer-has-most-spiders">the last summer</a>
(which is around September &amp; August).
The baby and female spiders will hibernate in the neglected spaces, behind appliances or furniture, storage rooms, and crawlspaces. Notably, just a small percentage of the house spiders will ever more outdoors.</p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-survive-winter">How Spider&rsquo;s Survive Winter</h2>
<h3 id="1-antifreeze">1. &ldquo;Antifreeze&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Spiders living in the colder regions have an�&ldquo;antifreeze&rdquo; - and adaptation that helps prevent their body from freezing during the cold or winter season.
If the temperatures begin to fall, then the spider&rsquo;s body accumulates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol">glycol compounds</a>
(this acts like the antifreeze) in the blood. The antifreeze will work just like the engine antifreeze.
The glycol enables the tissues in the spider to stay
<a href="https://arthropodecology.com/2016/01/05/frozen-spiders/">unfrozen withvery low temperatures</a>
. However, this method is a short term remedy used by the spiders during winter.
Thus, the spider hibernates to the favorable areas such as neglected spaces, behind appliances or furniture, storage rooms, soil or snow layer and crawlspaces - the
<a href="https://northernwoodlands.org/outside_story/article/subnivean-shelter-snow">subnivean zone</a>
.
The favorable zone will insulate spiders against harsh winter conditions like cold but allow them to run around searching food. But, during the spring, the spiders will eventually stop generating the antifreeze as the air and temperature clears.</p>
<h3 id="2-nests">2. Nests</h3>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, spiders eggs will die from the low and freezing temperatures - and thus they&rsquo;ll do the best to ensure the eggs will survive through winter.
Most of the spiders will produce eggs (after mating)
<a href="https://www.wpr.org/what-happens-spiders-winter">during early fall</a>
. Therefore, the spiders will search favorable places to lay and hide their eggs as the temperatures fall.
These include secluded, dark or hidden areas such as burrows, downspouts, chimneys. This allows the spider eggs to rain alive and warm through winter waiting for spring to hatch.
Further, the spiders create webs that look like webs - creating a safe haven for the eggs. The spiders also create a web wall that&rsquo;ll overall the bare cracks or corners.
After winter or when the temperatures and conditions become better, the baby spiders will gnaw away the spider webs to jump off to the environment.</p>
<h3 id="3-house">3. House</h3>
<p>Definitely some spiders may look onto your house as a safe place to hide away from the harsh and freezing winter climate. Just like
bed bugs
, the spiders will sneak into your home for safety.
Spiders search for humid and warm conditions during winter where they can create their safety webs. Therefore, your home offers the favorable conditions.
The bugs will climb onto roof shingles, siding, walls, windows and get into your home. Also, dark pantries, closets, basements, and attics will be suitable locations for the spiders to hide in your house.
Considering a food sources, spiders will also search for a location that&rsquo;ll enable them to hunt for their prey. Therefore, spiders can prey on other pests that&rsquo;re bugging you during winter.</p>
<h3 id="4-insulation">4. Insulation</h3>
<p>Spiders are equally intelligent bugs that&rsquo;ll create insulation against the freezing winter conditions - they&rsquo;ll
<a href="http://www.actforlibraries.org/spiders-in-winter/">build a warm pod</a>
waiting for warmer months.
The spiders will build the pods on secluded and enclosed places where they&rsquo;ll build web covering the openings to make something looking like their egg nests.
The pod&rsquo;s web will prevent the cold air for hitting the spiders and their eggs for them to survive winter conditions. However, other spiders create the pads under snow or the soil for additional insulation.</p>
<p>Spiders will also insulate their bodies and eggs by building on building sidings and roof corners. However, the bugs will break off from the webs when its warmer to hunt for food.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/best-mole-traps/">Mole</a> traps are notably inexpensive ways to control moles both in the UK and the United States. However, the use of mole traps is not lawful universally - apart from the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-mole-traps/">live trapping for moles</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>In some parts of the United States and Europe, you&rsquo;ll need a trapping or hunting <a href="/posts/best-fly-trap/">trap</a> to trap moles legally - you&rsquo;d need to check with the wildlife authorities in your area for details.
<strong>Moles are generally unclassified (you can kill or trap them in your property if they harm domestic animals, crops, or plants) but the use of� snap trap or body-gripping mole traps is illegal in areas such as Washington, D.C. since they will kill or injure the moles - thanks to a law passed in 2000.�</strong>
Moles survive thanks to human activity (feeding mainly on garbage) since they&rsquo;re non-commensal species - it doesn&rsquo;t harm humans in urban areas. However, the mole traps that have the design considered as
body-gripping are not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-why-are-mole-traps-illegal">Details: Why are Mole Traps Illegal?</h2>
<p>Killing or injuring these non-commensal mole species s illegal - especially using
snap trap or body-gripping mole traps
. However, where live trapping of the moles is not practical, most people use techniques that only drive the animals to their neighbor&rsquo;s backyards and property.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Wildlife and Fish Departments are very strict with anyone executing mole trapping - and highly regulates how mole removal companies operate and undertake their activities.
The mole-trapping ban was passed in 2000 and it prohibits the use of body-gripping traps for control of moles. Unline mousetraps, mole traps are included in the ban because the regulators argued that these devices could main the wildlife or lead to the accidental killing of pets.</li>
<li>The state government hunts down and prosecutes the companies and individuals that underate illegal control of moles using thesnap trap design of the devices - they take up the companys&rsquo; items including their business papers.
The wildlife department has notably even fined and prosecuted those companies and individuals who are notorious for illegal mole trapping - for example, in 2017, one homeowner was fined $700 for the failure of registering their mole trapper in King County.</li>
<li>This anti-trapping ban was misunderstood by many homeowners since they did not consider that it included a ban on the trapping of moles without the appropriate authorization from your local government.
The spearing type and scissor-type mole traps are banned for use since they fall under the body-gripping design of traps that could harm or kill the wild animals.</li>
<li>The scissor mole traps are created with &ldquo;U&rdquo;-shaped jaws and those will generally kill the animal when triggered or tripped - it&rsquo;s positioned in a tunnel for more effectiveness.
The wildlife department suggests using other mole control techniques including poison, noisemakers, or ignoring the moles since they&rsquo;re non-commensal animals.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOn-qBRUDpU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOn-qBRUDpU</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-mole-traps-are-legal">Which Mole traps are Legal?</h2>
<p>Moles are considered unclassified - and thus homeowners are allowed to kill the wildlife when they&rsquo;re causing harm to your property or damaging crops and harming the domestic animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, there are mole traps that are legal to use - these include the live-trapping traps such as the suitcase-type or cage traps as these do not fall under the body-grasping design.
How would you know that you have gophers or moles - an excellent sign for gopher presence including holes and openings.</li>
<li>If the holes have fresh and fluffy dirt will point to the presence of moles and gophers continuing with their digging activity.
For example, in North Carolina, you must get a depredation permit that&rsquo;ll allow you to undertake legal control of the moles in the backyard or garden.</li>
<li>But will it be legal to kill voles? Well, moles and voles�have different feeding habits; this means that methods used to treat voles won&rsquo;t harm moles.� However, treating for grabs may also help control moles.
North Carolina has three key mole species; star-nosed�mole, hairy-tailed�mole, and the eastern�mole - these will dig tunnels but won&rsquo;t dig up plant bulbs and roots.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-mole-traps">Alternatives to Mole Traps?</h2>
<h3 id="1-smoke-bombs">1. Smoke Bombs</h3>
<p>Smoke bombs will work effectively for controlling wildlife including
ground squirrels, skunks, rats, woodchucks, moles, and gophers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The smoke bombs will suffocate the moles while they&rsquo;re in their tunnel. However, we won&rsquo;t know how effective different smoke bombs will work
However, some cities may prohibit the use of smoke bombs for control of moles since the smoke could also drift to the neighbors homes - which may be offensive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-poison-baits">2. Poison Baits</h3>
<p>Poison baits are equally an appropriate mole-control technique - some of the most popular will have warfarin which is a blood-thinner and this will make the moles bleed to their death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Warfarin will equally kill other animals such as songbirds, chickens, pet and feral hogs, dogs, mice, cats, and rats� - but may also poison humans.
The zinc phosphide baits should be used to control moles - but must only be in the hands of licensed mole-control experts.</li>
<li>However, criminal or civil liability may befall you if any of the baits intended for killing moles land is picked and consumed by children or pets - and if especially they suffer injury, death, or illness.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-flooding">3. Flooding</h3>
<p>Because moles usually create comprehensive tunnels, flooding these tunnels can be a great way to exterminate the wildlife.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the moles could end up digging deeper into the tunnel to avoid the floods and you may be forced to get other techniques.
Luckily, flooding the moles is a legal of controlling moles as it will not directly cause physical injury to the animal but will kill it humanely.</li>
<li>However, practically flooding may only work to irritate the moles and thus they may be forced to move off your property - this natural technique for mole control is cheap and may be used more regularly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the anti-trapping law passed in 2000 bans trapping moles in some states such as Washington DC - especially with methods using the snap�trap or body-gripping design traps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternative mole control methods that are legal include using drowning, drugs, gas, ferrets, and shooting.</li>
<li>Generally, moles are considered unclassified and thus homeowners are allowed to trap this wildlife especially if they&rsquo;re damaging your property, or harming your domestic animals or crops.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Waking up at the midnight hour for nature&rsquo;s call or a midnight craving and finding a big roach challenging your way with even bigger tentacles, could send chills down the spine!</p>
<p>Is this your every night story? Did you know that having roaches at home could pose a serious threat to your health? You need to get rid of them in no time. But! Why Do Cockroaches <a href="/posts/where-do-fleas-come-from/">Come</a> Out At Night?</p>
<p>If you are a bug hater and wonder why these night creepers are always awake to make you feel jelly in the knees, this article is where you fit right in.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-behind-the-night-creepers">The Story Behind the Night Creepers:</h2>
<p>While there is a wide variety of roaches, the majority of them are nocturnal. Science says that cockroaches have a circadian rhythm like all living creatures (organisms) on earth.</p>
<p>This rhythm is a sleep-wake cycle that keeps alternating between pause/activity periods of these nasty bugs and governing their conduct of different organisms.</p>
<p>In short, this rhythm is solely responsible for the night activity cycle of these insects.�In this activity cycle, cockroaches hunt for food and water in a low light environment and stay mostly inactive during the day.</p>
<p>Their immobility during the daylight hour is either to stay safe from predators or nature&rsquo;s extremities.</p>
<p>This means when the bedtime is approaching and the light goes off, a big welcome sign flag to your enemies.</p>
<p>And now they will cascade in bulk from under the kitchen shelves, store room cabinets, washroom holes, and the smallest crack and the crevices.�Stay SAFE!</p>
<h2 id="do-roaches-sleep-during-the-day">Do Roaches Sleep During the Day?</h2>
<p>Plenty of research has been conducted on the activity cycle of roaches and a few of them to find out whether they sleep during the day or not! And each one points to the aforementioned circadian rhythm responsible for a sustained bout of inactivity in these bugs.</p>
<p>In other words, studies indicate that cockroaches too have a resting session like other creatures on this planet.</p>
<p>Here, Professor Irene Tobler-Borbely best sums up the activity of the roaches inthree clear stages: locomotion, limb or antenna movement (no locomotion), and a period of immobility. And this period of hiatus is the same a human&rsquo;s &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; period.</p>
<p>So, if you are not finding traces of these little monsters during the daylight, probably they are taking a siesta&hellip; * LOL! *</p>
<h2 id="why-do-cockroaches-hate-light">Why Do Cockroaches Hate Light?</h2>
<p>A few studies indicate that cockroaches have a zero aversion to light. But, why do these annoying species run away from the lights then?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably because these tiny, wild beasts have evolved through all these years only to learn that flickering light is an indication of the arrival of their human predators!</p>
<p>A number of encounters have possibly taught them that human intervention means a mass killing. And so, whenever there is the light, they seem to scurry for their hideouts. Simple as that!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, a former body of research also emphasized the impact of artificial illumination on the roaches. It suggests that the artificial lighting, even with the lowest intensity could tamper with the circadian rhythms of these insects and obstructs their activity at night.</p>
<p>So, even a dim light in the kitchen area could reduce their appearance. Mind it!</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-they-scout-for-at-the-nights">So What Do They Scout For At the Nights?</h2>
<p>So, coming back to the question again, &ldquo;Why Do Cockroaches Come Out At Night&rdquo;, you should possibly look for an answer inside your house, more precisely the kitchen and the pantry.</p>
<p>Roaches are always out on forage for food and water during the darkest hours when you are crawling into the comfort of your bed.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-large-number-of-these-bugs-at-home">Have a large number of these bugs at home?</h2>
<p>You will surely discover hundreds of thousands of them wobbling and running for shelter when you suddenly turn on the lights after 4 hours of darkness interval.</p>
<p>And the reason is nothing but the leftover in the cooking and the dining space.�After the sundown, cockroaches are prone to emerge in a big group and hunt for foods.</p>
<p>In fact, roaches can feed on virtually anything, including the tiniest food scraps that you might have left uncleaned from the last supper.</p>
<p>It can be anything from the organic materials, soiled clothes, bookbinding to trash bin rubbishes, crumbs on the floor, sludges between the gas burner or pet bowl remains, no matter, fresh or rotten!</p>
<p>The best way to keep cockroaches at the bay is keeping these areas forever clean and free of every single residue.</p>
<p>Once you do that, you will soon find these roaches scavenging during the day.</p>
<p>And that means you have already managed a critical infestation of these seedy bugs and they are threatened with the scarcity of food. This is why they are forced to hunt foods when are they are not supposed to.</p>

The heavy snows will build on the trampolines mat, making the springs overstretch. However, you can protect your trampoline by clearing the snow off using either a broom or a shovel on a continuous basis.
On the other hand, if you reside in those regions that dont experience heavy snow, its unlikely that your trampoline will get ruined. The bottom line is the regular maintenance of the structure.
Winter is just an ordinary period, and it shouldnt prevent you and your kids from having fun. I know winter can be icy, but hey, jumping will warm you up, just try it! Read Also:

<h2 id="should-you-disassemble-your-trampoline-during-winter-">**Should You Disassemble Your Trampoline During Winter? **</h2>
<p>Most trampoline owners ponder this question a lot. To answer it directly, I would say it depends. But, if you have enough storage space, you can always take them down and store to reassemble later.
It depends on the level of snow you usually experience in your area, the manufacturers opinion about the ability of the structure to survive in winter, and your personal preference. Read Also:

.
However, it is important to note that most trampolines are made of durable, rust-resistant materials, and therefore, there is no need of dissembling them during winter.
If you have decided to disassemble, you dont have to remove the entire structure. Only detach the springs, the soft frame, the safety netting, and the jumping mat. Read Also:

Leave all the poles that secure the safety netting as well as the frame metal that connects the mat and the springs standing outside.</p>

<h2 id="winterizing-trampoline-important-tips">Winterizing Trampoline Important Tips</h2>
<p>If you intend to use your trampoline during winter, there are a few things you need to be doing to keep your structure in excellent condition.�First, you need to use a broom or soft brush to get rid of leaves, debris, and snow.
As we know, snow is quite heavy, and if left on top of the trampoline it can easily overstretch the springs and mat, causing unintended injuries when one jumps on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Do not use a shovel to take off snow or debris on your trampoline; it can destroy the mat of your structure. Read Also:

.
Manufactures Guide - Another thing you need to do, is to go through the manufacturer&rsquo;s guide and confirm weather, your trampoline can remain outside during the winter period.
As weve discussed, most trampoline frames are made using rust-resistant materials. However, some are not, and leaving them outside will make them get damaged.
Also, some mats can withstand harsh weather conditions better compared to others.�Just go through the manual and get informed about your trampoline.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-trampoline-anchors/">Anchoring</a>
Your Trampoline is another thing that you must seriously consider if you reside in those areas that experience extreme weather conditions.
Ensure that your structure is well-rooted and protected from the weather. You may even decide to keep your trampoline away if the winter months are too harsh in your area.
If you are storing your trampoline during winter, keep it in a dry, cool place.�If you dont have enough space for storing the trampoline, and you dont want it being used during winter, you need to buy a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/trampoline-covers-for-winter/">trampoline weather cover</a>
, to ensure topmost protection to your structure.
A trampoline that is appropriately covered can stay standing in your backyard throughout the winter period. Further, it is protected from severe weather conditions, dirt, or even debris.
If you are unable to purchase the trampoline cover, you can detach the springs and mat and keep them in your storeroom during winter.�You can leave the frame standing outside. Most trampoline frames can withstand harsh weather conditions as they are made using the rust-resistant material.
If you decide to disassemble your structure, please ensure you keep the springs and the mat in a cool place, away from rodent infestation. Read Also:

.
Also, make sure you properly oil your springs before you reassemble them back on the frame. Clearing all debris and snow on a constant basis is crucial for the durability of the trampoline and safety of jumpers!
If you are planning to use your trampoline during winter (which we highly recommend) weve highlighted some of the actions or steps you need take to secure your trampoline.
The sad thing is that this damage usually is not detected early, and once an individual jumps on it, they fall through the mat on to the ground causing severe injuries to the person. Read Also:

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The key to having a fun and safe jump during winter or any other time is to ensure you do regular maintenance. Note that, not all trampolines can withstand harsh weather. So its up to you to make the right decision for your investment.
You should not be overwhelmed, go through this guide, and learn how to winterize your trampoline correctly. Always remember, Heavy snow can do significant damage to the trampolines mat. If its left for an extended period, it freezes and damages the jumping surface.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike the
Black Widow Spiders
, the Wolf Spiders are big hunting spiders that will not require webs to affectively trap their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the United States, youll find 2 main species of the Wolf Spiders (Lycosidae spp); H. aspersa and the Hogna carolinensis.
The Lycosidae family (where the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> belongs) are arachnids that have athletic, hairy, and have a large body size.
The Lycos bit means &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; due to the wolf-like hunting habits but the spiders are solitary animals and thus they hunt alone and not in packs.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6M_84t3oa4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6M_84t3oa4</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wolf-spider-appearance">Wolf Spider Appearance</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about your traditional spider then the wolf spiders won&rsquo;t match that body and behavior archetype.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, wolf spiders will not spin webs but instead hunt down their prey just like wolves.</li>
<li>The Lycosidae (meaning wolf in Greek) may have some similarities with the tarantulas but they are smaller and come from a different family.
Wolf spiders have brown to Gray (and hairy) bodies that have varied lines or markings.</li>
<li>The male spiders are about 19 mm (3/4&quot;) in length while their female counterparts are 23 to 24 mm (3/8&quot; - 1&quot;).
The male carolinensis measure about 18 - 20 millimeters while the females have a length of 22 - 35 millimeters.
The male Tigrosa aspersa measure about 16 - 18 millimeters while the females measure about 18 - 25 millimeters.
The darker color of the wolf spiders helps them camouflage and hide from their predators and approach their prey unnoticed.
The Hogna ingens (desertas wolf spiders) are documented who has the longest body with their legs spanning about 12 cm.
The wolf spiders have eyes that are arranged into three rows.</li>
<li>The eyes in the first row are small-sized (4), those in the second row are larger (2), and finally, the eyes in the bathroom are medium-sized (2).
A unique feature of the eyes in the wolf spiders is that the eyes in their central row are considerably larger.
Next, you should check if the end of the spider&rsquo;s legs 3 claws (tarsal claws).</li>
<li>The tarsal may be described as the last segment in the legs of an insect.
The wolf spiders are in the infra-order Araneomorphae ( &ldquo;true spiders&rdquo;) and the members in this group have pincer-like fangs that have a side-by-side orientation.</li>
<li>The side-by-side oriented fang will help you differentiate the wolf spiders from the small tarantula.</li>
<li>The latter (the small tarantula) are classified in the infraorder Mygalomorphae that come with fangs that are vertically-oriented.
On comparing the brown recluse with the wolf spiders; the wolf spiders have shorter legs and they lack the marking behind-the-head (violin-shaped) which is characteristic in the brown recluse.

The wolf spiders also have hairs that cover their abdomen -
<a href="https://www.uky.edu/Ag/CritterFiles/casefile/spiders/wolf/wolf.htm">Kentucky Entomology</a>
.</li>
<li>This feature may make you confuse them with the tarantula but the wolf spiders are smaller in body size.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wolf-spider-behavior">Wolf Spider Behavior</h2>
<p>As noted above the wolf spiders are hunting arachnids (theyre great sprinters) and so they won&rsquo;t lay webs to catch their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is where the wolf spiders derived their name from because they will hunt down their prey.
Where can you find the wolf spiders? The habitat of the wolf spiders includes the rainforests, alpine meadows, wetlands, coastal forests, inland shrublands, deserts, and dry or Woodlands.</li>
<li>But some species of wolf spiders may occupy suburban gardens, riverbank beds, mountains herbal fields, and coastal sand dunes.
The
<a href="https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=847731">ITIS</a>
reports that the wolf spiders (Lycosidae) have about 2400 species that are classified into 123+ genera.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wolf-spider-habitat">Wolf Spider Habitat</h2>
<p>Examine whether the spider under consideration will retreat to some burrow. The burrows may be found on outbuildings, around the house, and windows or doors.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will identify the spider as a wolf spider if it tends to move into a crevice or burrow as opposed to a web.
But the trap doors and the tarantulas also tend to move into burrows but they are relatively larger in size compared to the wolf spiders.
Another characteristic feature of the wolf spiders is that they will be comfortable on the ground spying on their prey and they will rarely climb onto tall objects.
As noted earlier the wolf spiders will have some white sack (containing eggs) on the back of the abdomen during the summer and spring seasons.</li>
<li>Also, the female wolf spiders tend to carry they are spiderlings on their backs.
Wolf spiders hunt their prey (including caterpillars and crickets) during the night (thanks to having a great night vision) and day.</li>
<li>But the shining of their eyes during the night makes them also be detected easily.
Finally, the wolf spiders are classified as very fast - an adaptation that helps them catch their prey very fast.
The main habitats of the wolf spiders are low vegetation, gravel, stream edges but may sometimes climb on trees although you will mainly find them on the ground.
Wolf spiders can enter your house through breezeways, crawl spaces, and basements.
Females with large bodies can eat small reptiles and amphibians but wolf spiders generally eat other spiders, crickets, and ground-dwelling insects.
Wolf spiders utilize their vibrations sensitivity, fast movement, excellent camouflage, and keen eyesight to avoid predators such as hunting wasps, birds, and lizards.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-dangerous-are-the-wolf-spiders">How Dangerous Are The Wolf Spiders</h2>
<p>Wolf spiders will only bite humans when mishandled or if they feel threatened.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arachnids will only socialize during the mating season and thus they will walk as lone wolves.
Wolf spiders are venomous but are not classified as poisonous to humans - as reported by
<a href="http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/wolf-spiders">Penn State College</a>
.
This means that the venom produced by The wolf spiders will paralyze the small and crawling insects but won&rsquo;t be toxic people.</li>
<li>In comparison, the wolf spider bite is classified (on pain level and the danger posed) just under a bee sting.
The wolf spider bite will cause redness and pain in most humans but these side effects will go off gradually.
So if you have noticed a spider that is moving fast in the house, most likely it is a wolf spider since the brown recluse spiders don&rsquo;t come out in the open regularly.
When ready to mate, the female wolf spiders will drop scent markings that will help the males locate them.</li>
<li>The males will wave their pedipalps (the sensory appendages around the mouths) and legs to signal their courtship intentions to the females.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So what should I do when I see a wolf spider? You can evade the wolf spider bites by avoiding picking or touching (or even squishing) them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squishing the female wolf spiders may also damage the eggs sacs on their backs and thus may drop hundreds of them and spiderlings in your house - you canuse spider bombs to contol them.
Wolf spiders are mainly walking on the ground and will rarely climb on tall objects or structures.</li>
