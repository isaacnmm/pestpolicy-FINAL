  <div class="post-content"><p>Mosquito repellent plugins <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> the most reliable way of keeping mosquitoes at bay.</p>
<p>But are they safe for us? I have done a comprehensive research on this topic and have some important facts to share with you!
<strong>Are mosquito repellent plugins safe? When wrongly applied, mosquito repellent plugins can result to the following; they could cause respiratory disorders to babies, allergic reactions, and can cause a condition called hypospadias for babies and pregnant women.�</strong>
Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="details-are-plug-in-mosquito-repellents-safe">Details: Are Plug In Mosquito Repellents Safe?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#details-are-plug-in-mosquito-repellents-safe">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ultrasonic mosquito repellants�devices use high frequency sound waves to keep away mosquitoes.
But does this really work? Research shows that ultrasonic mosquito repellants are not as effective as they are purported to be. They are only 57% effective and I wouldn&rsquo;t advice you get them, instead use chemical mosquito plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mosquito repellent plugins work by slowly releasing an insecticide when plugged into a socket and switched on. The plugins use tablets or liquids which is converted to vapor when exposed to heat.</li>
<li>Other than mosquitoes, these devices are very effective in killing insects such as horseflies, wasps and bees.�The devices have active ingredients like allethrin, DEETA, permethrin and natural oils.</li>
<li>Always carefully read the instructions on the packets before using the device. One thing ,don&rsquo;t use it when the air-conditioning is on, it could violently spread the chemicals that could be toxic for asthmatic and allergic people.

<h2 id="what-is-a-mosquito-repellant-plugin"><strong>What is a Mosquito Repellant Plugin?�</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-a-mosquito-repellant-plugin">¶</a></h2>
<p>A plug-in mosquito repellent is a device that works by releasing an insecticide gradually once it is plugged into a socket.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-plugins">They can use either liquid chemicals or tablets, the liquid converts into vapour once exposed to heat. There are various ingredients used in these plugin devices namely DEET, permethrin and natural oils.
<strong>Types of Plugins�</strong></h2>
<p><em>Chemical Plugin</em>
; They contain prallethrin chemical that kills mosquitoes. The chemical poses little danger to you and therefore safe.</p>
<p>-
<em>Ultrasonic Plugin</em></p>
<ul>
<li>They produce high-frequency sound that repels mosquitoes and other insects.</li>
</ul>
<p>How safe are these plug-in mosquito repellents? When you carefully follow the instructions on the packets before use, the repellants are safe. In contrast, they can be quite harmful when there is skin contact.</p>
<h2 id="effects-ofmosquito-repellant-plugin">**Effects of�**<strong>Mosquito Repellant Plugin</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#effects-ofmosquito-repellant-plugin">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="i-on-pregnant-women"><em>i) On pregnant women</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#i-on-pregnant-women">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the repellant chemical directly comes in contact with the skin, some of it gets absorbed into the blood system which chances of reaching the fetus. Despite the fact that it might not cause birth abnormalities, it could cause a significant threat to the mother&rsquo;s health especially if she is allergic.</p>
<p>For the mothers who got in contact with plugin repellents during the first three months of their pregnancy, their male babies could have a condition called Hypospadias (difficulty opening penis or its foreskin)</p>
<h3 id="ii-on-babies"><em>ii) On babies�</em><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ii-on-babies">¶</a></h3>
<p>Plugin Mosquito repellents emit chemical fumes that could cause various respiratory disorders like asthma to your baby. It is advisable to use mosquito repellants when your baby is over 2 months. Below is how you can use the plugin repellents safely when you have a baby below 2 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the plugin repellant starts working, make sure baby is sit or sleep in a different room.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t keep the baby in a room with the plugin repellent all night.</li>
<li>Dress your baby in full sleeved clothes to prevent their skin from being exposed.</li>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly after handling the repellents before touching your baby.</li>
<li>Babyies are crawlers and if you have plugged the repellent in a low level socket, they may attract them. The risk is these plugin repellants heat up quickly and might pause a burning hazard to your baby if he or she touches it.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Drill holes in at the bottom of garbage recycling containers. Holes on the sides will allow significant water to accumulate at the bottom of the containers creating a breeding environment for mosquitoes.</li>
<li>Keep gutters unclogged and clean. Always ensure your downspouts are draining properly without leaving clogs in the drainage area.</li>
<li>Keep swimming pools clean and chlorinated. Even when not in use, keep the pools chlorinated .</li>
<li>Ornamental and fish ponds should regularly be aerated to ensure water keeps moving ,this discourages mosquitoes from laying eggs. You can alternatively restock the fish pond with mosquito-eating fish.</li>
</ol>
