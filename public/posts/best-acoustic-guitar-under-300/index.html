<p>Top-name companies that manufacture expensive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_guitar">acoustic guitars</a>

Summary: For a $300 budget, I recommend Yamaha FG800 or the Breedlove Discovery Concert as your Best Acoustic Guitars Under $300. These 2 models boast of excellent playability, exceptional build quality, and great musical tone.</p>
<h2 id="reviews-top-9-best-acoustic-guitar-under-300-in-2025">Reviews: Top 9 Best Acoustic Guitar Under 300 in 2025<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#reviews-top-9-best-acoustic-guitar-under-300-in-2025">¶</a></h2>

<p>Yamaha is widely known when it comes to making quality guitars and the FG800 is no exception. The FG800 has proven that the best acoustic guitar can be obtained without spending a lot.</p>
<p>The FG has made it easier for many musicians (especially those on a budget) to inexpensively advance their careers because of its affordability. This guitar offers excellent musical tone, enhanced playability, and its design is on top making it number one pick for most guitarists.
What I love most about this amazing instrument is that its built using state of the art acoustic analysis technology to give you a much louder and powerful sound. The 800 series has received a massive improvement to offer better projection.
Youll appreciate the standard neck of this Yamaha FG800 as its comfortable and smooth. The instrument features a solid Sitka spruce at the top, while its back and sides are made using Nato/Okume (eastern mahogany).
The new scalloped bracing body makes this guitar stand. Its headstock is made using sealed die-cast chrome which does an excellent job when playing the guitar.
These guitars are ideal for beginners, intermediate-level guitarists, or even advanced players.�Related:

<p>Another Acoustic Guitar that falls under the $300 mark is the Breedlove Discovery Concert. This guitar gives excellent sound, looks attractive, and its inexpensive.</p>
<p>Youll appreciate the pinless bridge design that makes it unnecessary to drill holes on top of this instrument. Breedlove recommends fewer holes to allow sound waves to easily move inside the guitar consistently without losing energy.
I love the fact that this acoustic guitar delivers balanced tones making it an exceptional guitar for entry-class making it ideal for playing fingerstyle and in strumming mode.
Both seasoned and beginner guitarists applaud its sunburst or natural finish. It features attractive wood grain and black binding to give it a modern design of a concert style guitar.
This acoustic guitar is easy to play and is perfect for beginners who crave clarity, sustain, or balance while playing. Related:
