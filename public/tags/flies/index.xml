      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best <a href="/posts/best-electric-riding-lawn-mowers/">electric</a> fly swatter, you can consider factors like power output, durability, ease of use, and safety features. These elements ensure that you not only eliminate flying insects effectively but also enjoy convenience and reliability in your pest control efforts.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-power-output">1. Power Output</h3>
<p>Some products, like the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0859Q3DQ2/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Zap It! Bug Zapper</strong></a>
, feature a high-voltage output of up to 4,000 volts. A higher voltage ensures more efficient insect killing with one swift swat, reducing the need for multiple attempts. On the other hand, some swatters, like the
<strong>Black Flag Handheld Zapper</strong>
, have a lower voltage but still provide consistent results for smaller insects.</p>
<p>A high-voltage swatter can kill bigger insects instantly, while a lower voltage swatter might require more effort for larger bugs but can still be effective for common household pests like
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef621">Fruit Flies</a>
and mosquitoes. Be sure to choose a device with the appropriate voltage for your specific needs.</p>
<h3 id="2-durability-and-build-quality">2. Durability and Build Quality</h3>
<p>Some products, such as the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F3N8A4Q/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Elucto Electric Fly Swatter</strong></a>
, are built with reinforced frames and robust mesh grids, ensuring that they last longer and withstand frequent use. Durability is critical because a flimsy swatter can break or bend easily, compromising its efficiency.</p>
<p>Electric fly swatters constructed from durable materials provide more value in the long run, as they can handle heavy use without significant wear and tear. A sturdy build, especially in products like the
<strong>Sourcing4U Executioner Fly Killer</strong>
, gives users peace of mind when dealing with tougher insects or daily pest control.</p>
<h3 id="3-ease-of-use">3. Ease of Use</h3>
<p>Some electric swatters, such as the
<strong>Beastron Bug Zapper</strong>
, feature ergonomic handles that make them easy to grip and maneuver. A lightweight and well-designed handle is key, especially for those who may need to use the swatter for extended periods. With an ergonomic handle, controlling the device becomes more comfortable and less tiring.</p>
<p>On the other hand, complex designs that require multiple buttons or additional setup steps can hinder usability. For example, while some multi-function devices offer more features, they may not be as straightforward to use as simpler models like the
<strong>Zap It! Bug Zapper</strong>
, which activates instantly with just a press of a button.</p>
<h3 id="4-safety-features">4. Safety Features</h3>
<p>Safety is paramount, especially when using high-voltage devices. Products like the
<strong>Black Flag Handheld Zapper</strong>
have a triple-layer safety mesh that prevents accidental contact with the electrified grid. This protective mesh ensures that users, particularly children, are safeguarded against accidental shocks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, automatic shut-off features can be found in some swatters, providing an added layer of protection. Safety features should not be overlooked, as they significantly enhance the user experience, especially in households with children or pets.</p>
<h3 id="5-battery-life-and-charging-options">5. Battery Life and Charging Options</h3>
<p>Some swatters, such as the
<strong>Zap It! Bug Zapper</strong>
, come equipped with a rechargeable battery, allowing for multiple uses before needing a charge. Rechargeable options tend to be more eco-friendly and convenient for those who don&rsquo;t want to constantly purchase disposable batteries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the
<strong>Black Flag Handheld Zapper</strong>
operates with replaceable AA batteries, which might be ideal for users who prefer quick replacements instead of waiting for a device to recharge. Battery life is important as it directly impacts how long you can use the swatter before needing to recharge or replace batteries.</p>
<h2 id="top-5-recommendations---best-electric-fly-swatter">Top 5 Recommendations - <a href="/posts/best-electric-tiller-for-clay-soil/">Best</a> Electric Fly Swatter</h2>

apple cider and vinegar
after running out of the FlyFix liquid bait.
It is sweet-smelling and will attract the flies, just like the liquid that initially comes with the trap.

<h2 id="get-rid-of-fruit-flies-with-a-homemade-fruit-fly-trap">Get Rid of Fruit Flies With a Homemade Fruit Fly Trap</h2>
<h3 id="1-vinegar-trap-apple-cider-vinegar-or-white-vinegar">1. Vinegar Trap (apple cider vinegar or white vinegar)</h3>
<p>Vinegar trap is my best homemade Trap that will trap over 70% of fruit flies in your house or compound.
You will need to have the following requirements: vinegar (either apple cider or white vinegar), a glass jar or bottle with a narrow entrance (20 cm to 30 cm depth), a piece of cellophane, or polythene paper, and a rubber band.
Once these are in place, carry out the following procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pour 10 to 30 ml of vinegar in either glass or bottle gently.</li>
<li>Tilt the container slightly and shake to ensure some vinegar sticks on the wall.</li>
<li>Close/seal the glass or bottle (for the container, it&rsquo;s not necessary to seal always) with cellophane or polythene paper. Then tighten with the rubber band.</li>
<li>Using a sharp narrow device, make a few tiny holes on the cellophane or polythene paper.</li>
<li>Place the vinegar trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
You will require to make two or three vinegar traps in case the swam of the fruit flies is large.</li>
<li>This Trap&rsquo;s principle is that vinegar emits an attractive scent that lures the fruit flies into the bottle or glass).</li>
<li>Once the fruit flies enter the container (through the tiny holes), they cannot come out (they get trapped inside).
Apple cider vinegar is more potent than white vinegar due to nectary spices added to it. You will require to empty the Trap after every 2 to 3 days. Check these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fly-trap/">commercial fly traps</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-old-wine-or-beer-bottle-trap">2. Old wine or beer bottle Trap</h3>
<p>A bottle of old wine or beer can be used as a fruit fly trap since the old fermented wine or beer releases a scent that attracts the fruit flies.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will require to leave your wine/beer bottle after use for 1 to 7 days (to allow wine/beer leftovers to ferment).</li>
<li>Then, seal the bottle with cellophane or nylon/polythene paper.</li>
<li>Poke few beautiful holes on the paper with a tiny sharp object.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
The fruit flies attracted by the fermented scent will be trapped inside the bottle. You can even leave the bottle without sealing (though this may not catch 100% of the fruit flies that get in  some may manage to escape).
Alternatively, you can ferment wine or beer (leave 10ml of wine/beer in an open jar for five days).</li>
<li>Pour it into a bottle (Trap) and shake well to ensure it sticks on the wall before setting the Trap in the area manifested with fruit flies.</li>
<li>You will need to empty the wine trap daily by rinsing the trapped fruit flies.
Avoid
placing the Trap in the living
room since it may pull some fruit flies around (even if it&rsquo;s in the corridor or kitchen, the scent is strong enough to attract fruit flies).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fruitsfruits-peel-jar-trap">3. Fruits/fruits peel jar Trap</h3>
<p>Fruit jar fruit fly trap is made up of many fruit types cut and put together in a jar. To make one at home, you will need to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut into small pieces of various fruits such as mangoes, oranges, sugarcane, pawpaw, avocado, watermelon, etc. Place them in a basin or glass jar.</li>
<li>Seal the basin/jar with cellophane or polythene/cling paper colorless (this enables the fruit flies and owner to view inside).</li>
<li>Poke the seal with a tiny sharp object to create a path for fruit flies to get in and also fermenting scent to leave the jar/basic.</li>
<li>Place the inappropriate Trap place near fruit flies infestation (kitchen, compound/field).
When ripe fruits begin to rot, they release a sharp scent that can attract fruit flies over 20 feet away.
They will enter the jar and get trapped there. Therefore, you will not need to put too many pieces in a given jar for economic purposes.
Alternatively, you can place the peels from fruits such as mangoes, bananas, pawpaw, avocadoes, or potatoes in a jar, seal, and poke tiny holes.
These peels begin fermenting in a day and emitting a scent that attracts fruit flies in the vicinity. After a substantial amount of fruit flies are trapped, it is necessary to empty the Trap and fill it with fresh fruits/peels.

</ul>
<h3 id="4-dish-soap-trap">4. Dish soap Trap</h3>
<p>You can use
dish soap
to clean utensils, kitchen, sinks, and showers to make a homemade fruit fly trap. The fragrance and diethanolamine chemicals act as attractants of fruit flies into the Trap.
To make a homemade dish soap fruit fly trap, you will need to follow the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect/fetch available dish soap and place it in a glass jar/container (diameter of 20  30 cm and a depth of 30  40 cm).</li>
<li>Add some little water to dilute it slightly (ensure you form a sticky and viscous substance that will help stick the fruit flies).</li>
<li>Seal the glass jar with colorless polythene or cellophane and poke tiny holes on it.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near a fruit fly&rsquo;s manifested areas.
The working principle in this Trap is using a sticking mechanism. Once the attracted fruit flies land/step on the sticky, viscous dish soap, they will get stuck/trapped and die there.
Normally, the Trap may take 3 to 7 days to trap a substantial number of fruit fries. The attractant smell will intensify as days go by due to the fermentation process.
It is not advisable to hold long trapped fruit flies as they may decompose, thus messing with the Trap. You will, therefore, require to empty the Trap after every 5 to 8 days of use.
In such a case, you can scoop the top layer of the dish soap and top up the remainder with a fresh one, or else you replace the entire decoy (dish soap).
Alternatively, you can spice your dish soap trap with some vinegar or ripe fruits to boost the bait&rsquo;s attraction strength. This is usually in a cold area where low temperatures highly inhibit scent diffusion.

</ul>
<h3 id="5-banana-jar-trap">5. Banana jar Trap</h3>
<p>Banana jar trap is one of its own kind, an independent fruit fly trap that doesn&rsquo;t require any spicing attractant (apple cider or fragrance) for quality performance.
A ripen banana emits a sharp scent that pulls fruit flies over 20 to 30 feet away. Carry out the following to create your homemade banana trap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peel the well-ripen bananas (1 to 3 pieces) and cut them into small sizes (about 2inches).</li>
<li>Put the banana slices into a clear glass jar or container (at least 15 cm deep).</li>
<li>Seal the jar with colorless polythene paper or cellophane.</li>
<li>Poke tiny holes on the seal to allow the fruit flies in and expel the banana scent into the vicinity.</li>
<li>Place your banana trap near a fruit flies infested area.
The attracted fruit flies will get in and get trapped (they won&rsquo;t be able to fly out). This Trap can also be used in the living room without interfering with the comfort of the occupants.
Empty the Trap after every 2 to 3 days of use. This Trap may be uneconomical if you spend more bananas (stick to a minimum of one or two per Trap).
Alternatively, you can slice the banana peels and repeat the same procedure above.
However, the peels may take slightly longer to rot and release an attractant smell. When banana peels decompose, they may emit an unpleasant odor and leave a dirty spell in your jar (though they are useful too).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-red-wine-trick-trap">6. Red wine trick Trap</h3>
<p>Red wine is known to emit an attractant smell that pulls fruit flies from the packaged/crate. Therefore, you can make a red wine trick fruit fly trap by carrying out the following step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle little red wine on the red wine bottle (closed/not used).</li>
<li>Place the bottle in a colorless glass jar (about 30 to 50 cm deep).</li>
<li>Seal the container with colorless polythene paper or cellophane and poke the tiny holes on the seal.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pour any red wine at the bottom of the jar or container.</li>
<li>Place your Red wine trick trap near fruit flies infested area or living room.
Once the fruit flies are attracted to the glass jar or container, they tend to cling to the red wine bottle as they try to get into the feast on the sweet scent (trick).
The smell released by red wine is strong enough to attract fruit flies over 40 feet away.
Once a large number of Fruit flies have accumulated on the red wine bottle wall, seal the glass jar once more (to close the holes) to suffocate the trapped fruit flies for 1 to 4 hours.</li>
<li>Then, empty the jar by rubbing off the dead fruit flies stuck on the red wine bottle&rsquo;s wall.</li>
<li>The advantage of this fruit fly trap is that you can re-use the red wine bottle before drinking the content (red wine).
It can also be used in the living room without disturbance to occupants (the fruit flies always flew in and get trapped  no external movement).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-paper-cone--oldrotten-fruits-trap">7. Paper cone &amp; old/rotten fruits Trap</h3>
<p>To make a paper cone &amp; old/rotten fruits Trap, you will need a white/purple/pink pain-writing pad, a Glass jar (60 cm depth and 20 cm diameter), and old or rotten fruits. Carry the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the old fruits (could be rotting avocado, oranges, pineapples, grapes, mangoes, or pawpaw) in a colorless glass jar.</li>
<li>Make a cone (with a narrow opening at one of its ends) using plain paper and place it on a glass jar/container.</li>
<li>Place the Trap near the fruit flies&rsquo; infestation.
This trap work by preventing fruit flies from getting out once they flew in. The colorless glass jar (help in observation) and rotting/fermenting smell pulls fruit flies into the Trap through the entrance (cone opening).</li>
<li>The cone&rsquo;s conical shape prevents the fruit flies from flying back once in (hence trapping them).</li>
<li>This Trap is not suitable for the living room.
Though it can be used in the kitchen, it&rsquo;s supposed to be kept in an enclosed place (the rotting old fruits smell is not pleasant). The Trap
is best suited for outdoors
and near decomposing materials, near the bins or flowerbeds.
Empty the Trap after every two to 4 days to reduce the adverse effect of rotting fruits on the surroundings.

</ul>
<h3 id="8-heated-milk-sugar--pepper-trap">8. Heated Milk/ Sugar &amp; Pepper Trap</h3>
<p>In this kind of Trap, you will require to have milk (powder or liquid form), black/red peppers (around five pieces), sugar (a quarter kilogram), and a glass jar or basin (depth 30cm and 50cm diameter - approximate).
Follow this procedure to come up with a trap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 80ml of milk (add water if you are using milk powder) with sugar and heat for 3 to 7 minutes while stirring until the entire sugar dissolves.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into the glass jar and shake to allow it to stick to the container&rsquo;s sidewall.</li>
<li>Grind the pepper, sprinkle in the mixture and stir for a few seconds.</li>
<li>Make sure the milk foams form a sticky top layer.</li>
<li>Set the Trap near the fruit flies infected area. In case the infestation is massive, make two or three of these traps.
The sugar acts as a spice, which, when mixed with milk, will emit an attractive scent that pulls the fruit flies into the Trap. The milk has a sticky substance that traps and drowns fruit flies on landing/stepping. The pepper will emit a spicy scent that poisons the surface of the milk-making fruit flies to fall faster. This Trap should not be kept near the kids (pepper emission will make one shed tears).
You will need to empty the Trap after 4 to 6 days by pouring the entire mixture. Though expensive, heated milk/sugar &amp; pepper trap can kill many fruit flies (it may eradicate the whole colony of fruit flies with a subsequent number of times).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Natural horse fly repellents are made from naturally grown plants or animals. Further,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fly-spray-for-horses/">processing the repellents</a>
undergo must not downgrade the natural form of its ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, the natural horse fly repellent needs to be safe for plants &amp; animals (at least the non-targeted ones) and human beings.
How do you keep horseflies away naturally? Can you use DEET on horses? Diethyltoluamide (DEET) is a highly effective ingredient in insect repellents. Notably, it was first created by the United States Army in World War II.</li>
<li>The ingredient can kill ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes. Further, DEET has a yellow die that could stain your clothes.</li>
<li>At high concentration levels (or with highly sensitive skins), DEET could be toxic to animals and people. Icaridin is an odorless and colorless chemical formula.
This ingredient is an excellent DEET-alternative since it&rsquo;s less harmful. However, its great to control horse <a href="/posts/how-long-do-fruit-flies-live/">flies</a> and other insects such as gnats and mosquitos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="will-apple-cider-vinegar-repel-horse-flies">Will Apple cider vinegar Repel Horse Flies?</h3>
<p>When you need to treat any number of horses, youll need to utilize an aerosol fly spray since it will be easier to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, YES, apple cider vinegar will repel horse flies - but it must be apple cider vinegar must be natural (unpasteurized).
You&rsquo;ll need to spray the apple cider vinegar on the horse&rsquo;s hair coat - externally to effectively kill the horse flies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-essential-oils-that-repel-horse-flies">Any Essential Oils That Repel Horse Flies?</h2>
<p>To repel horse flies, I recommend using a combination of these essential oils: Cedarwood, Lemon Grass, Tea Tree, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Lavender, and Citronella.</p>
<ul>
<li>The natural repellents include natural grape seed oil, rosemaryessential oil, natural lemon eucalyptus, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, avocado oil, and Aloe Vera juice.</li>
<li>Finally, natural products need to be environmental-friendly and bio-degradable, sustainable to the environment and human beings.
However, you can use other products like fly masks, boots, and fly sheets to protect your equine friend.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-the-best-fly-spray-for-horses">Choosing the Best Fly Spray for Horses</h2>
<h3 id="1active-ingredients">1.Active Ingredients</h3>
<p>The active ingredients (synthetic or natural) affect the horse spray&rsquo;s repellent and killing power. However, not all are suitable for foals and lactating mares.
Here&rsquo;re the most used actives: permethrin, pyrethrins, picaridin, cypermethrin, tetramethrin, and resmethrin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pyrethrins - A natural active ingredient extracted from one of the chrysanthemum species. Pyrethrins provide<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-ground-bees/">fast knockdown - it&rsquo;ll kill</a>the horse flies quickly. Piperonyl Butoxide plus pyrethrin will give a quick knockdown by damaging the central nervous system of the horsefly.</li>
<li><em>Pyrethrins</em>: - These are derivatives of the pyrethrum (the popular chrysanthemum) plant. However, these pyrethrins are highly poisonous, which means that theyll readily penetrate the fly&rsquo;s skin or shell and other comparable insects.</li>
<li>Further, the pyrethrin insecticides will immediately move to the flys nervous system to immobilize them. However, this will not kill the insect as they have some enzymatic action thatll detoxify the pyrethrins and enable the flies to recover.</li>
<li>Therefore, the spray formulas contain synergists that work to slow the enzymatic functioning. Thus, the pyrethrin would have adequate time to paralyze the horse fly. But with moisture, Oxygen, and sunlight, the pyrethrin ingredient will erode easily and hence wont harm plants and animals  but youll need to take top precautions with fish.</li>
<li>Synergists - But Pyrethrins must be mixed with additional synergists to prevent being broken down by sunlight. Synergists offer long-lasting protection and boost the killing power of the insecticide. But you can try one of these homemade fly sprays for horses (essential oil-based).</li>
<li>Permethrin (a Pyrethroid)  The synthetically created permethrin is comparable to the natural pyrethrin. It stimulates the nervous system of the horse fly and has neurotoxin and synergists that take down the insects. Permethrin is highly stable and will protect your horse longer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-oil-based-or-water-based-spray">2. Oil-Based or Water-Based Spray?</h3>
<p>Oil-based or water-based spray? Well, both have their unique pros and cons. But first, the water-based sprays don&rsquo;t attract dust or dirt and won&rsquo;t irritate your horse&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>But for the water-based sprays, you must use synergists to prevent break down from sweat, rain, and sunlight.
However, the oil-based spray (marked as having Petroleum Distillate) offers quicker knockdown (through insect suffocation) and sticks better on the horse&rsquo;s hair coat.
The downside is that the oil-based brands will attract dust or dirt and may irritate or burn the sensitive horse skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-special-horses-conditions">3. Special Horses Conditions</h3>
<p>Consider if your horse has conditions like sensitive skin, open wounds, or another health issue that might be worsened by using the horse fly spray.</p>
<ul>
<li>For minor issues, you might need to be extra careful when applying the insecticide.</li>
<li>However, any adverse reactions from spraying must be reported to your veterinarian.
But you&rsquo;ll be safer if you first test the horse fly spray on a spray section of your horse to check its effectiveness and the presence of any adverse reactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-number-of-horses-and-residue-effect">4. Number of Horses and Residue Effect</h3>
<p>Depending on the number of horses youll be treated, you must consider the type of formula to use or maximum effectiveness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Horseflies are not active at night. Thus, horses can comfortably graze<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef511">during the night since the horse flies will be least active</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Youll need to consider the number of days that the repellent or fly killer will be effective on your horse - horse flies are mainly active from May to September.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, UltraShield EX Equine Spray will repel horse flies for seven days.</li>

<p>Do fruit flies bother you by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fruit-flies-come-from/">flying all over in your house and compound</a>
that you wonder when they will die?
<strong>Fruit flies live for approximately 40 to 50 earth days. During this time, the female fruit flies are able to mate with males severally and lay thousands of eggs that hatch into new ones.�</strong>
In fact, the fruit flies do not just hatch into flies directly; they undergo different stages in their life cycle to achieve fully development.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-long-do-fruit-flies-live-">**Details: How long do Fruit flies live? **</h2>
<p>Fruit flies live for approximately 40 to 50 earth days. To achieve full maturity, they undergo various stages (metamorphosis). The duration in each development stage may vary from place to place due varying factors, which affects their growth.</p>
<p>The life cycle of a fruit fly begins from reproduction where the female lays eggs which develop into larva then pupa and finally adult.</p>
<p>The adult fruit fly is a very small insect and sometime you may not see it with naked eye unless they are in huge number. Many of them come together and create a swam that engulf rotting/fermenting foodstuff leading to spoilage.</p>
<p>The continuous reproduction of fruit flies within as short period give them a great advantage of rapid multiplication in a given area. Though they die, their birth rate is higher than death rate.</p>
<p>You will also realize that fruit flies follow foodstuff, without which they leave. You may keep off foodstuff that attract fruit flies if you desire to get rid of them entirely. Importantly, you must keep a close look into my other articles to learn more of ways to get rid of fruit flies.</p>
<p>I will now elaborate in depth each stage in the life cycle of a fruit fly in various subheading below.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-life-cycle-of-fruit-flies"><strong>What is a life cycle of Fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>The life of fruit fly is classified in various stages that are interlinked continuously. These stages together form its life cycle. �Each stage consists of a number of developments, which make it different from the next or other stages.</p>
<p>You will see that larvae and pupa are two different organisms though they are sub stage of an adult fruit fly. It is, therefore, important to learn these development stages as they may help you, in case you want to get rid of these fruit flies, to efficiently destroy them at any point of wish.</p>
<p>The Life cycle of fruit fly is classified into four stages i.e. egg, larvae, pupa and adult. The female fruit fly after mating lays eggs which hatches into larvae. This develop into pupa stage and later matures to an adult fruit fly.</p>
<p>Lets discuss each stage:</p>
<h3 id="stage-1--reproduction-process"><strong>Stage 1  Reproduction Process.</strong></h3>
<p>Once the female mates with male fruit fly, the fruit fly looks for a better place to lay eggs. This could be on your rotting/fermenting foodstuff, damp rag or mop, fruit skin, dustbin or even drainage system.</p>
<p>Before female fruit fly lays the eggs, the fruit fly must ensure that the temperature is high enough. The temperature of around 77 degree Fahrenheit suit her best. This can be lower however; it should not go below 22 degree, which may kill the fruit flys hatched babies. Fruit flies for reproduction purposes select humid environment.</p>
<p>Once that is done, about 24 hours after mating, the female fruit fries lays between 200 to 500 eggs at ago. This answers you why their survival rate is so high.</p>
<p>Each egg is able to hatch after 24 to 30 hours. By 8 to 13 days, you will be having adult fruit flies buzzing around in your place. No wonder you may keep complaining how quick these flies mature.</p>
<p>Once the eggs hatch, they proceed to the next stage called larvae stage.</p>
<h3 id="stage-2--larvae"><strong>Stage 2  Larvae�</strong></h3>
<p>This is stage is the most pronounce stage of fruit flies. Basically, a larvae is a worm-like organism that does not have legs. It is very active when it comes to movement and feeding so as to secure enough energy for the next stage.</p>
<p>Larva are seen mostly as they mess the fruits and other rotting foodstuff a lot. Though small in sizes, their impact is highly seen. They are highly attracted by the fermenting parts of the fruits or rotting substances.</p>
<p>These larvae feeds on yeast organism &amp; fungi in the rotting/ fermenting foodstuff and turns it into a messy semi-liquid substance that emits irritating smell.</p>
<p>In fact, they provides further acceleration of bacteria, which affects the foodstuff to a point of no use.�After about four days, the larvae moves to a dark place where matures and change into pupa, which is the next stage.
<strong>Stage 3  Pupa�</strong>
The pupa Stage is termed as an inactive stage by observation. This is because the pupa is actually an immobile organism.</p>
<p>During this stage, the legless larvae develop six legs, eyes and wings using the energy that was stored during the larvae stage.</p>
<p>The skins begins to darken as it continues to develop. The three body parts i.e. head, thorax and abdomen become distinct and at this point, the puparium is about to break.</p>
<p>This development takes about four days. Then the pupa breaks the skin and a light colored-young adult emerges. This now proceeds to the next stage.
<strong>Stage 4  Adult�</strong>
The development stage of young adult fruit fly to a fully adult is a self-developing process that takes two to three days.</p>
<p>The young adult emerges as light in color fly. However, its color darkens with time. This young Fruit fly feeds on the available rotting foodstuff so as to acquire the full adulthood.</p>
<p>During this time, the wings and legs are strengthened so as to help it in flying and landing. In addition, abdomen develops further such that spiracles for breathing are able to function properly.</p>
<p>The adult stage development time may vary from place to place due to environment. It is worth noting that you will expect to see female adult fruit fly being ready for mating and lay eggs after two days of its pupa stage.</p>
<p>This means that they quickly get into reproduction as soon as they are released as young adults.</p>
<p>NB: This process, from reproduction to full adulthood of fruit flies, is known as metamorphosis and we said it takes between eight to thirteen days, which may vary from place to place due climatic factor among other things.</p>
<h2 id="which-affects-the-lifespan-of-fruit-flies"><strong>Which affects the Lifespan of Fruit flies?</strong></h2>
<p>Survival of fruit flies is affected by various factors that may vary from place to place depending on the point of consideration. These factors may either favor their existence or cause their death. Some of these factors include:</p>
<h3 id="1-ambient-temperature">1. Ambient temperature</h3>
<p>Most fruit flies thrives very well is ambient temperature of a given environment. Research shows that the optimal temperature of about 78 degree Fahrenheit is suitable for best survival of these fruit flies.</p>
<p>They can also survive in low temperatures however; this should not go below 20 degree Fahrenheit as this may result to their dead or affect their reproduction activities.</p>
<p>We know that ambient temperature also accelerates the rotting/fermenting process as well as multiplication of these fruit flies; it is important then that you take precaution so as to prevent food rooting or any environment that may result to the same.
<strong>2. Ability to breed frequently�</strong>
It is to the advantage of fruit flies that they are able to breed and multiply at a very short time. Within eight to thirteen days from time the eggs were laid, the fully developed fruit fly is able to bring to existence the new generation of its own.</p>
<p>These flies are also very active sexually. The fact that after laying they are able to regain their sexual activeness after a short time, this gives them a super chance to bring more and more babies into life.
<strong>3. They have different food alternatives.</strong>
We know that the fruit flies are attracted by any rotting or fermenting foodstuff. This could be in any place e.g. within the house or outside.</p>
<p>Once fruit flies have depleted one food source, they quickly shift to another within the locality. Just think of youself expelling them from your house when you have the garbage at your compound unkempt or some damply rags or mops outside; definitely you will find some there after some times.</p>
<p>It is very important to ensure that you clean all possible sites that may, in any away, attract these fruit flies into their vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="can-fruit-flies-die-on-their-own"><strong>Can fruit flies die on their own?�</strong></h2>
<p>This is a nice concern. Definitely, fruit flies will die after forty to fifty days of survival. However, it may not seem like they really are dying if the source of food still exists.</p>
<p>You will agree with me that the more you feed them, the more they will stay since their reproduction rate is more that their death rate.</p>
<p>Just in case you want them to die on their own, kindly allow them to deplete the current food source and eventually once it is completely eaten away by them, they will either die of starvation or look for another food source around or kilometers away.</p>
<p>I am only worried if you will dread to face such infestation of fruit flies by giving them a chance to die slowly!</p>
<h2 id="do-fruit-flies-cause-sickness"><strong>Do fruit flies cause sickness?�</strong></h2>
<p>Sickness is something you always try to avoid. The fact that fruit flies are irritating is termed as a special kind of sickness as where they are you can stay at peace.</p>
<p>Moreover, these flies lands and touch over other contaminated substances before feeding on your food thus bringing disease-causing germs to it.</p>
<p>The larvae stage of fruit flies mostly prefer feeding on fermenting/rotting food. They accelerates the action of bacteria as well as food poisoning. If such food is eaten, it may cause illness, stomach upset or other types of sicknesses.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-destroy-fruit-flies-breeding-ground"><strong>How do I destroy fruit flies breeding ground?�</strong></h2>
<p>It is necessary know that the most destructive stages of a fruit fly is larvae and adult stage. These stages plays a great role in destroying your foodstuff.�In case you desire to destroy their breeding ground, just try and do away with these two stages.</p>
<p>For the case of larvae stage, it is difficult to handle them independently as they continuously change to next stage in a few days. Therefore, it is important to deal with egg stage and adult stage.</p>
<p>You can do this by maintaining very low temperature that ensures that these eggs never hatch do larvae within the room thus killing the generation.</p>
<p>This means that you will have to do that for about fifty days so that the living fruit flies die of temperature changes.</p>
<p>If you need to get rid of the living fruit flies, it is important to use efficiently the existing methods that are used to get rid of fruit flies such as the use of Yellow flytrap, vinegar or wine trap etc.</p>
<p>Chemicals can be used to kill both the fruit flies and their laid egg however; most of these chemicals cause environmental pollution.</p>
<p>I may therefore not recommend their use unless you find that the problem for fruit flies has escalated and other methods are not yielding results.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-prevent-fruit-flies-in-my-home"><strong>How do I prevent fruit flies in my home?�</strong></h2>
<p>This is just easy. You will require to keep off any substance that attract fruit flies into your house of place. This can be made by ensuring that you do not store any rotting foodstuff or ensuring those products with fruit flies attracting smell has securely stored.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is very important for you. Ensure that you empty garbage bin, clean all spilled food, store mops and rags when dry, flush sinks and toilet as well as drains with proper cleaning fluids or clean your kitchen and dishes immediately after use to keep off smell.</p>
<p>These, if you put them into practice, will help you a lot in preventing presence of fruit flies in your house or compound.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>Your concern on life of fruit flies is valid. Fruit flies lives for about 40 to 50 earth days. The lifecycle of a fruit fly is classified into four stages: egg, larvae, pupa and adult.�Fruit flies lives may be affected by various factors such as temperature humidity as well as source of food nutrients.</p>
<p>It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that you keep your house or compound free from these irritating fruit flies by ensuring that you are able to observe proper sanitation requirement as I have advised in this articles. A fruit fly free home is a nice place to live. What do you think about it?</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-%5Bdrain%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/)-flies-in-the-basement/">drains</a>
are both a health hazard and a nuisance.
The moist conditions including the organic matter in the septic tank allow the drain flies to reproduce fast. But fear not, I&rsquo;ll delve into ways you can use to get rid of drain flies in your septic tank.
Drain flies have a length of about 1/4 inch - they&rsquo;ll love the organic matter in the septic tanks,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/">bathrooms</a>
, sewage systems,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-basement/">basement</a>
, and near drains.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-septic-tank">Details: How to Get Rid Of Drain Flies in Septic Tank</h2>
<p>First, I&rsquo;ll need you to understand the cause of these drain flies. These bugs thrive and reproduce fast in the septic tank due to the moist conditions.
Drain flies will inhabit stagnant water, pipes, and drains. So, it&rsquo;s critical to solve the plumbing issues and septic tank moisture problems.
Check for moth-like, tiny bugs that will be near your septic tank and drains. The pests are brown, gray, or black - but there may also be maggots and larvae.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-an-inspection-and-remove-any-breeding-sites">Step 1: Conduct an Inspection and Remove any Breeding Sites</h3>
<p>First, I recommend you eliminate or remove those drain fly breeding locations. This location will have some decaying sewage and food, and other organic matter- which greatly encourages the breeding of the drain flies.
So, I recommend the process of cleaning the septic tank and drains around it - this will help eliminate the organic matter that would attract and host the bugs.
One method you may use will be cleaning these locations using
drain cleaners such as Bio-Clean
, Green Gobbler, or the Drano Max - these will help you flush out the organic matter that tends to build up in the septic tank and drains.
Besides cleaning the drains and the septic tank, you&rsquo;ll need to eliminate other different locations where the drain flies to breed. Some of these probable areas include fixing those plumbing leaks, and dirty or clogged gutters.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, inspect your spaces (drains, showers,toilets, gutters, or around sinks) using a flashlight to check signs of drain flies. Further, I recommend inspecting the outdoor sewage or drain systems.
Once you&rsquo;ve pinpointed the flies&rsquo; breeding sites, you&rsquo;ll require to fix the plumbing leaks, clean those gutters or drain out the standing water.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-use-drain-fly-traps">Step 2: Use Drain Fly Traps</h3>
<p>After removing those drain fly breeding locations, next,
you&rsquo;ll want to use fly traps
to get hold of any remaining bugs. Some of the approved drain flies include the pheromone traps or the sticky traps.
The pheromone traps employ some scented lure to attract the bugs. These trap&rsquo;s pheromones are created to be like the natural pheromones created naturally by flies - and which they otherwise use in their communication.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pheromones tend to attract the flies and hence they&rsquo;ll get near the trap and they&rsquo;ll get stuck on the sticky traps.
Sticky fly traps employ some sticky substance that&rsquo;ll trap the pests. The sticky substance used in this tool is the trapping item. You&rsquo;ll need to position the sticky drain fly in the right locations where the drain flies tend to land and breed most.</li>
<li>So, I recommend you place these traps near drains, toilets, and sinks - you&rsquo;ll position them near breeding sites, ceilings, and walls.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-apply-insecticide">Step 3: Apply Insecticide</h3>
<p>For a massive drain fly infestation in your septic tank, I recommend you use some insecticide. You may use either foams, dust, or sprays. But for each, adhere to the product description and follow the safety directions such as eyeglasses and ensure the spaces are adequately ventilated.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an effective technique if the other DIY drain fly control methods fail to control the bugs fully. You may have pellets, foggers, or sprays.
I suggested you get advice from a
professional exterminator or pest control technician</li>
<li>those that are near your residence or home.
Further, once you&rsquo;ve applied the insecticide, you&rsquo;ll require to sanitize or clean the spaces to remove the drain flies that are dead and also the residual chemicals.
You may use foam insecticides to treat locations that prove hard-to-reach like inside cracks, and pipes. The insecticide will expand to fill the deep gaps and thus they&rsquo;ll suffocate the bugs.</li>
<li>The dust-form insecticide for drain flies will work by coating the object surfaces while also the chemicals kill the gnats that come into contact with it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-seal-the-drains">Step 4: Seal the Drains</h3>
<p>Also, make sure that you keep great hygiene of your septic tank and the drains. This will hinder more of the drain flies from returning.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require to clean the septic tank and the drains - this will help to get rid of the organic matter - which would otherwise host the drain flies. In addition, cleaning the drain may also require you to employ bacterial treatments.
You must seal the septic tank and the drain to prevent their re-entry and breeding further. You may use a drain cover or plug for this.</li>
<li>Drain plus or covers may be of various sizes and materials including silicone, metal, or plastic - you can get them in the local home improvement shop or hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-hire-drain-fly-exterminators">Step 5: Hire Drain Fly Exterminators</h3>
<p>Finally, if all the techniques outlined above have not helped to remove those drain flies from your septic tank, you&rsquo;ll need to hire a drain fly exterminator.</p>
<ul>
<li>The technician will come with advanced equipment and also expertise that&rsquo;s targeted to specific pests including drin flies.</li>
<li>Such equipment will assist in the clear identification of the drain fly source and also in the efficient control of the infestation.
For the exterminator, you&rsquo;ll prefer, to get one that is experienced in tackling drain flies and also well reputable from client reviews. So, I prefer you enquire for review from family and friends, especially with the local exterminators they&rsquo;ve used.
Get the exterminator to inspect your septic tank, drains, and home in general for drain flies. This will assist in determining the level of infestation and hence knowing the treatment plan to employ -
could be fumigation
or insecticides.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drain flies in drains and septic tanks can be a nuisance. These locations provide an excellent location for breeding - due to the organic matter and water - you can use exterminators, seal drains, apply insecticides, clean the breeding sites, and use drain fly traps.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re tired of the nuisance brought by the tiny nuzzling insects (drain <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-septic-tank/">flies</a> also known as sewer flies) in your basement drains in your residence, it&rsquo;s time we go rid of them!
The basement has many attractants (moist areas and organic material like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-%5Bdrain%5D(/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/)-cleaners-work/">sewage</a>
) to these bugs including clogged drains, leaky pipes, and standing water where they&rsquo;ll lay eggs and multiply quickly.
Below, I&rsquo;ve explored some safe and effective methods on how you can remove drain flies in the basement -including ways to prevent any possible infestations.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-the-drain-flies-in-my-basement">Why Are The Drain Flies in My Basement?</h2>
<p>First, how and why did the drain flies get into your basement? Well, as noted earlier, drains flies are attracted to organic material and damp or moist environments. Therefore, your basement may have these conditions and thus promoting the development of these bugs.
A key reason for this is leakage of water in the basement - this may be from some leaking pipes. Also, clogged drains and standing water - will offer moisture and organic material for the drain flies and
gnats to thrive</p>
<ul>
<li>lay eggs, and reproduce.
However, drain flies can also arise from materials that came from outside the basement. Some of these conditions may include the bugs hiking onto pets, or clothing. So, it&rsquo;s important to fix the source of the drain flies and their nutritional source.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-method-of-removing-drain-flies-from-the-basement">7 Method of Removing Drain Flies from The Basement</h2>
<h3 id="1-clean-the-basement-drains">1. Clean The Basement Drains</h3>
<p>First, cleaning the basement drains will help remove the organic matter that builds up - and which acts as a good ground for bugs laying eggs. You may employ DIY or commercial methods and products to clean these drains.
a.
<strong>DIY Drain Cleaning</strong>
The DIY technique I recommend to clean the basement drains is using vinegar plus baking soda - luckily these products are effective but also safe to use around pets and humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply, pour the ingredients into the drains in equal measures - 1 cup of each - vinegar &amp; baking soda.</li>
<li>The chemical will produce bubbles and fizzle as it eats away the organic matter in the drains - so allow it to work its magic for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Finally, once the vinegar and baking soda works its magic, flush it down using hot water.
However, you must repeat the drain-cleaning process regularly - this will hinder the build-up of organic matter. I also recommend the use of drain covers as they&rsquo;ll help hinder the build-up of debris.
b.
<strong>Commercial Drain Cleaning</strong>
You can also use
commercial drain cleaners
to clean the basement drains and this will ultimately assist you to remove the drain flies. The chemicals in the cleaners will dissolve the debris and gunk (breaking it into small particles) that&rsquo;s clogged inside pipes.</li>
<li>But it&rsquo;s important to get a drain cleaner that won&rsquo;t harm your pipes - for example, check if the chemical is appropriate for pipes made of clay, metal, or PVC.</li>
<li>Notably, using a damaging drain cleaner (depending on the pipe type) will harm the pipes and lead to leakages.
Further, ensure to adhere to the manufacturers cleaner usage instructions for safety and effectiveness in cleaning the basement drains. For example, ensure to put on protective equipment such as eyewear and gloves.
Enzymatic drain cleaners would be excellent such as Bio-clean Drain Septic will be safe and not hard on the pipes - besides being eco-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-remove-standing-water">2. Remove Standing Water</h2>
<p>Having standing water in the basement will work to attract and breed drain flies. So, I recommend that you drain all the water including the small water puddles that may have collected in a corner after a cleaning exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you should remove water and clean the faucets and fix any pipe leakages in the house basement. To achieve this, you can use a dry or wet vacuum, mop the floor, or dehumidifier.
Also, examine the basement for any water seepage signs and this will require that you also seal any gaps or cracks. For example, you may also install a French drain system or a sump pump as this will assist you in removing the accumulation of water.
Besides, you can also eliminate the basement dampness and water by removing humidity and enhancing air circulation. Simply install some ventilation system, use fans, and open any available windows for better air circulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-use-sticky-drain-fly-traps">3. Use Sticky Drain Fly Traps</h2>
<p>Next, you can use drain fly traps in the basement to remove those bugs. You can use light traps or sticky traps. Light traps will use UV light to attract the bugs while the sticky substance in sticky traps will get hold and kill the bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fly traps will operate to deuce the drain fly population by catching them. Simple, you&rsquo;ll require to place the drain fly traps near those debasement drains or areas that have moisture.
Fly traps will effectively trap the fly larvae and the adults - however, using this technique is a short-term remedy for the bugs.
You should use this method in combination with other techniques such use of drain cleaners and regular removal of standing water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-use-fly-insecticides">4. Use Fly Insecticides</h2>
<p>Another option would be using insecticides to remove drain flies from the basement. The market has a number of effective insecticides that you can use on these bugs. However, their effectiveness will depend on correct usage and following the product label instructions.
Below are the guidelines and instructions you must follow while using the drain fly insecticides inside the basement area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put on some eye protection, a mask and gloves - and any other recommended protective clothing.</li>
<li>Ensure that the insecticide had ingredients that target drain flies specifically.
Also, considering that the insecticides are chemical based - you&rsquo;ll need to consider critical safety precautions when fighting the drain fly infestation.</li>
<li>So that you or your pet don&rsquo;t intake harmful pesticide fumes, you&rsquo;ll need to properly ventilate the basement.</li>
<li>Check the product instruction for the time to allow before going back to the basement after treating the area using the pesticides.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require to apply the insecticide directly on the moist areas including the drains.
To fully eliminate the drain flies, you&rsquo;ll require to repeat the bu-treatment process regularly or as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, drain flies have proven a nuisance especially when they invade your basement or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-drain-flies-in-the-bathroom/">bathroom</a>
, mainly because these areas have moisture, dampness, and organic matter - conditions that promote the fast breeding of these bugs.
I hope the above DIY and commercially acquired products will help your get rid of the drain flies in your residential or commercial building basement.</p>

<h3 id="1clean-the-bathroom-drains">1.�Clean the Bathroom Drains</h3>
<p>To remove the drain flies from the bathroom, begin by cleaning all the spills and the drains. I recommend using a suitable
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner/">drain cleaner</a>
such as Chemical Drain or Bio-Enzymatic Drain to help destroy the organic matter in your drains.
However, incorporating a brush will also assist in removing the debris in the bathroom drains. This process will also help in removing any soap or food debris inside the drains.</p>

<li>I recommend you repeat the drain cleaning process severally to reduce the drain flies plus themold and mildew- you may also use dehumidifiers to get rid of moisture.
But it&rsquo;s critical to ensure that the chemical components of the drains are cleaner are safe for your pets and humans in the space. Ensure to adhere to the drain cleaner usage instructions - which may include also wearing eye protection and gloves.
Here&rsquo;s the process to properly use the drain cleaner and get rid of the drain files from the bathrooms and moist areas such as bathrooms.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>First, remove the food waste and moisture (plus liquids) inside the drains - as these will be an attractant to the drain flies.</li>
<li>Cover the bathroom drains using some cloth or towel to avoid the splash of your drain cleaner as the chemicals would corrode the skin or eyes.</li>
<li>Finally, pour the drain cleaner into the bathroom drains and allow it to work on the organic matter for roughly 30 minutes before pouring hot water down.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-pour-boiling-water-down-the-drain">2. Pour Boiling Water Down the Drain</h3>
<p>Next, pour some boiling water into the bathroom drains (ceramic or metallic drains only) to help kill those drain fly larvae - this will be more effective if done about 30 minutes after pouring drains cleaners into the drains.
The water at high temperatures will kill those fly larvae but it&rsquo;ll also flush out the organic matter and other debris from the bathroom drains - these could otherwise attract other drain flies.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, be cautious that you must pour the hot water slowly into the drains to avoid splashing it onto your skin or eyes.
However, this technique of pouring hot water must only be applied to ceramic or metallic drains. This is because the hot water will damage your PVC or plastic pipes.</li>
<li>Hot water is an effective technique against drain flies but will also hinder the emergence of other drainage issues - especially blockages and clogs. This is because the water will dissolve the hair, grease, and soap.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3use-baking-soda--vinegar">3.�Use Baking Soda &amp; Vinegar</h3>
<p>Next, you may use baking soda &amp; vinegar (a combination) to remove drain flies from your bathroom. Baking soda and vinegar will combine to form a chemical compound that&rsquo;ll break down all the organic matter in the drain.</p>
<ol>
<li>The steps to use these ingredients will require you to combine - a 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup of baking soda &amp; vinegar respectively.</li>
<li>Pour this mixture down the bathroom drains - you&rsquo;ll notice bubbles and fizzling. Cover the drain using a rag or plug - this will help trap the chemical reaction inside the drain.</li>
<li>Allow the chemicals to sit in the drain for about 15 minutes before pouring hot water to flush down the drain flies - the chemical reaction will also break down the buildup and debris inside the drains.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll require to repeat the drain treatment process using baking soda and vinegar for a few days to fully get rid of the drain flies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-address-moisture-issues-and-leaks">4. Address Moisture Issues and Leaks</h3>
<p>Drain flies love moisture (or they&rsquo;re attracted to moisture) and thus it&rsquo;ll be advisable to address the moisture issues and leaks you have in your bathroom. This will include addressing the leakage issues under the bathtub or sink - and thus removing any standing water.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin with an inspection of the under areas of the bathtub and sink - check for any moisture or leakage as this may attract the drain flies.</li>
<li>Any leakages or moisture that is noticed in these areas must be eliminated immediately as it would as breading grown for drain flies or the liquid may damage different household structures.</li>
<li>Besides, I also recommend that you dry the mats and wet towels that are in the bathroom once you&rsquo;re done using them or clear them from the bathroom (if the items are wet). Don&rsquo;t leave wet fabrics and items on the bathroom floor or even piled in a corner or a basin - drain flies may breed fast in these conditions.
In addition to not leaving wet items around the bathroom, you&rsquo;ll require to drain any standing water in that space - this may be in the shower, bathtub, and sink.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to address the moisture problems such as fixing any leaking pipes - this will hinder the build-up of moisture that would ultimately attract drain flies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-use-bleach-to-remove-drain-flies-in-your-bathroom">5. Use Bleach to Remove Drain Flies in your Bathroom</h3>
<p>You may also clean the bathroom drain using bleach - it&rsquo;ll disinfect and remove the organisms and bacteria that tend to attract the drain flies.
These are the steps I recommend you use to effectively remove the drain flies from your bathroom using bleach.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, measure out a single cup of bleach and pour it into the bathroom or shower drain - ensure it does not pour onto the edges.</li>
<li>Let the bleach mixture sit inside the shower drains for about 20 minutes - this will be enough time for the chemical to get inside the pipes killing the organisms and bacteria.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to use hot to flush out the bleach, debris, and organic matter that&rsquo;s stuck inside those shower drains.
Finally, inspect if the shower drains still have drain flies - if these pests are still present., I suggest you repeat the application process by trying any of the above methods.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, sewer flies, gnats or drain flies can be a nuisance when they attack your kitchens and bathrooms.
Luckily, you can begin by getting rid of any standing water, unlocking the drains, and using chemicals such as black, drain cleaners, vinegar, and baking soda.
Cheers!</p>

      <description>Fruit flies</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fruit flies
are tiny flying bugs that&rsquo;s attracted to rotting and over ripened fruits such as grapes, plums, strawberries, mangoes, and watermelon.</p>
<p>Each female will lay 500 eggs in summer and they&rsquo;ll develop to adults within 8 - 10 days.
Fruit flies come
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fruit-flies-come-from/">thrive in warmer temperatures</a>
with rotten fruits and vegetables laying their eggs in wall cracks,
home kitchen, or in cafeterias, hotels, and restaurants. So, how to get <a href="/posts/homemade-fruit-fly-trap/">rid</a> of fruit flies?</p>
<h2 id="1-toss-fruits-and-wipe-them-out">1. Toss Fruits and Wipe Them out</h2>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to too or dispose off the rotting or overripe vegetables and fruits that may be in your house or kitchen. Notably, fruit flies will hatch and then proceed into your foods.</p>
<p>Next, dip the vegetables and fruits that are not yet infested in some soapy water (or apple cider vinegar). Next, wash or use a clean towel to wipe all the produce. Finally, rinse the fruits with clean water and dry them.</p>
<p>This will clean off all the fruit fly eggs that could be lying on the surfaces of the produce. However, put the produce in a sealed contained or the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Wipe out all the possible breeding grounds for fruit flies. These areas include the cabinet surfaces or kitchen tops. In addition, you, must wipe out the bottom and inner sides of the trash cans to remove food residue and spills.</p>
<p>Remember to use trash bags but also dispose them off daily. However, any bag that&rsquo;s not full will need to be covered - at least if you won&rsquo;t be tossing it off.
Finally, clean up the moist drain as it may have fermenting waste - your may use one of the
best drain cleaners
. It&rsquo;ll easily unclog the drains with organic and fermented mater - including those of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<h2 id="2-apple-cider-vinegar--dawn-dish-soap">2. Apple Cider Vinegar + Dawn Dish Soap</h2>
<p>Apple cider vinegar�is the magical best fruit fly trap. But why do fruit flies love v
inegar? Well, vinegar is
<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vinegar/">fully fermented organic matter</a>
(with excellent scent). Fruit flies love broken-down natural ingredients and its acidity.

The bugs will jump into a jar containing Apple cider vinegar and drown in it as they try to drink it with its mouth-parts - acting like a Kryptonite. The requirements to make the vinegar fruit fly traps are just a
<a href="http://www.academia.edu/27434106/How_to_Get_Rid_Of_Fruit_Flies_with_a_Homemade_Fruit_Fly_Trap">plastic wrap and a jar or glass</a>
.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pour a portion of your Apple cider vinegar into a glass. Cover the glass with vinegar using a plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Now, use a pin or toothpick to poke some 2-4 small holes on the plastic wrap. This will allow the smell of your white vinegar to emerge.</li>
<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to poke a bigger hole at the center of your plastic cover - this is where the fruit flies will gain entry into the glass.</li>
<li>Now, leave the glass with Apple cider vinegar around the area having a fruit fly infestation. To ensure that the fleas won&rsquo;t escape the glass having white vinegar - add 3-10 drops of<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/dawn-dish-soap-for-fleas/">dawn dish soap for fleas</a>that&rsquo;ll act like glue on the insects.</li>
<li>The fruit flies will be stuck in the vinegar jar as they can&rsquo;t move out - they&rsquo;ll finally die.</li>
<li>Repeat the Apple cider vinegar treatment daily until the fruit fly infestation ceases.
<em>Alternatively�</em></li>
<li>Pour boiling water or boiling Apple cider vinegar in the infested drains. This will quickly repel the fruit flies from your yard and home.</li>
<li>The boiling liquids will flush out the fruit flies from the hidden and moist places such as toilets, garbage disposals, sink drains, and shower drains.
<em>Why Vinegar + Soap Works:�</em>
Fruit flies will be attached to the Apple cider vinegar due to its great scent. Therefore, the flies will try to land of the vinegar. But the soap will have broken the vinegar&rsquo;s surface tension making the fruit flies to sink and drown.
Luckily,
Apple cider vinegar is e
nvironmentally-friendly, cheap and won&rsquo;t generate harsh fumes. But liquid dish soap isn&rsquo;t&rsquo; safe for human consumption and thus must be kept far from kids.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3beer-or-old-wine-trap">3.*Beer *or Old Wine Trap</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/better-smelling-beer-thanks-fruit-flies">New scientific research</a>
show fruit flies have a unique relationship with yeast that&rsquo;s is beer or old wine. Yeast secretes some sweet scent that&rsquo;ll attract the fruit flies.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply pour half a glass of fresh or old beer into some mason jar that&rsquo;s covered with a lid. Place the bottle of glass with the beer at the area where you saw the fruit flies.</li>
<li>Hammer some holes on the lid of the metal lid covering the bottle, glass or jar. The fruit flies will enter the container, feast on the bear and ultimately drown.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to drop a little bear on top of the glass cover - this will lure the fruit flies into your stale beverage. The bugs will be trapped by the bottle&rsquo;s narrow neck - it acts as a natural barrier as they can&rsquo;t jump out.
<em>Why�Beer (Alcohol) works:�</em>
Similar to the case with vinegar, the smell of beer or wine attracts fruit flies. However, you can also some some drops of the dish soap that&rsquo;ll consequently act like glue.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4-liquid-soap--water--light">4. Liquid Soap + Water + Light</h2>
<p>Our next fruit fly trap will be using water plus liquid soap. For this trap, you&rsquo;ll simply mix the liquid soap and the water in a bowl.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix soap + water in the bowl until is creates a foamy and bubbly bath.</li>
<li>Next, position the bowl with the foamy water under some bright light such as stove lights or other lamps.</li>
<li>The light from your source will create a reflection that&rsquo;ll attract the fruit flies. However, the dish soap will make the flies to drown as it&rsquo;ll have broken the surface tension of the water.
<em>Alternatively:�</em>
Use an old fruit, vinegar plus a paper cone. Thus, simply position a large piece of overly rip fruit and some little vinegar in glass or a jar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, roll down some paper cone into your jar - ensure that it sticks. Place the narrow end of the paper cone at the bottom of the jar.</p>
<p>Thus, the odor of the smelling fruit in the mixture will attack the fruit flies. However, the fruit flies won&rsquo;t easily climb up the paper cone and thus they&rsquo;ll be trapped in the jar.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>How to prevent a fruit fly infestation.�The surest way of preventing a fruit fly infestation is by avoiding to attract them at all. Therefore, the main considerations would be maintaining a clean dining area and kitchen.</p>
<p>Wash Fruits and Vegetables.�As noted earlier, fruit flies will also pitch camp on dirty, overripe or rotting produce - fruits and vegetables. Thus, to prevent an infestation, you&rsquo;ll need to thoroughly wash and dry the produce.</p>
<p>Wash your eggplants, broccoli, apples, or melons etc once you get them from your store. The washing process will remove the eggs and adults of these fruit flies.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-fruit-flies-live/">how long they live</a>
?</p>
<p>In this article, I will be answering this question in depth.</p>
<p>Summary:
<strong>Fruit fries come from bush hideouts through the windows, doors and even ventilation; fruit trees and flower in the compound or neighborhood; they can come as a result of weather changes in the area; they could have been on your food when you were bringing it home or it could even be possible that some of your food you bought had fruit flies eggs inside it without notice.</strong>
However, it is important to note that these fruit flies may come because something has attracted them into the vicinity. Their movement is mainly triggered by specific attractants - though there could be other means as highlighted above that may have resulted them to being in your household.</p>
<h2 id="what-attracts-fruit-flies"><strong>What attracts fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>Fruit fries are very small insects commonly found in tropical areas with humid climatic condition.�Mostly, fruit fries are attracted into your house by ripen fruits or vegetables.</p>
<p>Fruits like tomatoes, melons, grapes or other perishables in the farm attracts these flies. Rotting potatoes, bananas, onions, cabbages and other unrefrigerated products bought from groceries in your house attracts many of these fruit flies.</p>
<p>They can also be attracted to decomposing waste, empty bottles, cleaning rags or mops that are within the compound or farm. The key thing here is the fermenting smell. These flies have very high sense of smell thus; they can detect these scents when they are kilometers away.</p>
<p>Yeast leads to fermentation process and helps a lot in making these fruit flies get attracted to foodstuff. Alcoholic drinks tend to attract the fruit flies due to the fermentation scent in them especially the locally made brews. It is therefore important for you keep note of proper storage of these fruit flies attracting products so as to minimize the effects associated with them.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-fruit-flies-enter-your-house-from-outsidehideouts"><strong>How do fruit flies enter your house from outside/hideouts?�</strong></h2>
<p>You may wonder to find that even after closing all your doors, windows and keeping everything spotless clean, you still find fruit flies in your house. This is not magic! Fruit flies are very small. They can penetrate through the tinniest space left at the door or window from outside and find its way to the rotting/fermenting items in the house.</p>
<p>This is a major blow to individuals as its almost impossible to seal completely your house so as to prevent their entrance. In fact, you need ventilation for aeration in the house, which offers them a quick route into the kitchen, bathroom or toilet.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-fruit-flies-come-from-fruit-trees-and-flowers"><strong>How do fruit flies come from fruit trees and flowers?�</strong></h2>
<p>We now know very well that fruit flies are highly attracted by fermenting substances and through use of sense of smell, they can locate the rotting foodstuff. Fruits like grapes, mangoes or oranges highly produce these scents when they are ripening. You will find that more of these flies brood in these environments.</p>
<p>The flowers from various plants also hold breeding grounds for these fruit flies. This is attributed by nectar produced by these particular flowers. In case your compound or yard has these flowers, expect some fruit flies within.</p>
<p>Once the attractants are depleted from the vicinity, these fruit flies looks for any available option around which could be: in your house, nearby hotel or even damping site- just by use of smell.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-weather-change-favors-existence-of-fruit-flies"><strong>How does weather change favors existence of fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p>Fruit flies tend to thrive very well during summer than in winter. This is attributed by the fact that temperature accelerate rotting/fermentation activity, which in turn releases a scent that attracts the fruit flies. Moreover, warm temperature favors breeding of these fruit flies in a given environment.</p>
<p>Fruit flies also work best during dusk or dawn. They like dim light environment more as compared to the bright light areas. This does not mean that you wont find them in bright-lit regions. No! Only that dim light is more favorable for Fruit flies.</p>
<p>During winter. You may experience less fruit flies as compared to summer. This wont overlook the fact that you will see some of them in your household! However, the number will drastically fall. This tells you why some people rarely experience fruit flies problems in their locality.</p>
<h2 id="in-which-way-do-fruit-flies-get-into-the-food-that-is-brought-home"><strong>In which way do fruit flies get into the food that is brought home?�</strong></h2>
<p>Often, you find yourself doing shopping of various fruits and vegetables. In case you buy them in a grocery where there were fruit flies invasion, chances are that your items will have some of these flies. You may ask how?</p>
<p>These fruit flies are very small. They may have laid eggs beneath the fruits or other vegetables and you may end up transporting them home where they hatch into fruit flies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of them may hide inside some vegetables like cabbages or kales only to go hatch and multiply in your house. It is very important for you to keep note of health matter of groceries that you frequently buy your fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>At times, you may even have bought flowers or drinks like wine that attracts these fruit fries. This may attract some of fruit flies to these items without your notice and they end up into your homestead where the further bred.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-fruit-flies-breedreproduce"><strong>Where do fruit flies breed/reproduce?�</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we know fruit flies are mainly found in hotels, homes or supermarkets where foodstuff are allowed to ferment or rot, lets elaborate their breeding process. Fruit flies lay eggs near the surface of the rotting/fermenting food, organic material or beneath the fruit skin.</p>
<p>Each fruit fly lay about 500 eggs, which takes 24-48 hours to hatch. This should tell you that within a week, you would expect thousands of these flies in the house if not taken care of.</p>
<p>These flies can also breed in any moist place. It could be drain, garbage disposal, wet rag or mop. The larvae is able to feed on the surface or fermenting/rooting product (fruit/vegetables) thus accelerating the process further.</p>
<p>These flies end up destroying the whole fruit or vegetable making them unsafe for human consumption.�This may really be pathetic. Therefore, you will need to take care of them before they get more nuisance.</p>
<h2 id="do-fruit-flies-cause-any-problemsharmful"><strong>Do fruit flies cause any problems/harmful?�</strong></h2>
<p>You will agree with me that there is nothing as much irritating as swam of fruit flies in your kitchen, living room or compound. It becomes even more disgusting to walk into a supermarket or restaurant and a swam of them flew over foodstuff. This will not auger well.</p>
<p>These flies causes discomfort to human where they even engulf a person when you try to chase them away. Worse of it all is that the more you chase them, the more they keep coming back. It is such a tedious work that many find themselves giving up on them or disposing the whole food items. �They actually cause waste of food material.</p>
<p>Fruit flies accelerate the rotting of the food substances. Fruits like ripe bananas rots faster in their presence since the larvae feeds on the surface exposing the inner part, which is most nutritious for human consumption.</p>
<p>Contamination caused on food by fruit flies lead to food poisoning. In addition, they introduce bacteria and other disease causing organisms that may be harmful to human beings.</p>
<p>Importantly, you do not need to dispose you fruits or other vegetables just because they have been attached by fruit flies- just cut off the affected part since these flies do not dig deep while feeding.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-fruit-flies"><strong>How do you get rid of fruit flies?�</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwM0TA5N61U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwM0TA5N61U</a></p>
<p>There various ways/methods of getting rid of fruit flies you can use in case they are giving you real problem. I have discussed each of them below.</p>
<h3 id="method-1-attracting-them-using-rotten-fruit"><strong>Method 1: Attracting them using rotten fruit.</strong></h3>
<p>Since fruit flies like rotten fruits due to fermentation smell, which attracts them. You can place several of them in a proper place inside a container where the flies can easily smell. Then cover with a polythene paper or plastic casing with few holes. These flies will fly in and are trapped inside.</p>
<h3 id="method-2-using-a-flytrap-that-stick"><strong>Method 2: Using a flytrap that stick.</strong></h3>
<p>You can buy a flytrap that stick from the market. This fly traps are smeared with sticky substances which when fruit fly touch it, it cannot escape. You will need to place several of these traps in various places like toilet, bathroom or kitchen where these fruit flies can get trapped.</p>
<p>A good example of this trap is yellow flytrap. These traps will not only trap fruit flies but also get lead of moths and even houseflies.</p>
<h3 id="method-3-using-a-candle-trap"><strong>Method 3: Using a candle trap.</strong></h3>
<p>In this method, you will require a candle and a tray of water. Place the candle inside the tray with water. Take the tray where there is fruit flies. Switch off lights in the room or compound so that the candle remain as the only source of light.</p>
<p>This trap focuses on two destructive ways. One, once the flies get close to the candle, they are burnt to death by the flame. The second one is where fruit flies try to avoid the candle and get lured by water reflection. Once they get in, they cannot get out.</p>
<h3 id="method-4-using-a-vinegar-or-wine-trap"><strong>Method 4: Using a vinegar or wine trap.</strong></h3>
