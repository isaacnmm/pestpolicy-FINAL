<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-shark-vacuum-for-pet-hair"><strong>How to Choose the Best Shark Vacuum for Pet Hair</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-choose-the-best-shark-vacuum-for-pet-hair">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although shark is a leader in manufacturing vacuum cleaners, their certain features you should look for before buying a vacuum for pet hair. Here are the most important considerations.
<strong>1. Performance</strong>
The performance of your vacuum cleaner determines how efficiently it can pick up and suck debris from various surfaces.
Thus, your device of choice should be able to pick pet hair and other debris and suck them into the canister without leaving any spills.
Typically, a device with 99.9 % suction ability will ensure that your floor or carpet is free from debris.
Also, consider the performance of the device on different surfaces. While some devices are useful on hard floors, they may not perform very well on carpets.
So, it is advisable to go for tools that work effectively on both carpets and hard floors.
<strong>2. Attachments</strong>
Pet hair can be scattered anywhere in the house apart from the floor and carpet. You find pet hair on your couches, bedding, and other furniture.
So, you need a versatile device with attachments that allow you to vacuum various areas of your house. For example, consider
bed bug steamers
.
Most market devices come with various brush attachments that enable users to remove pet hair for upholstery, baseboards, and other tight spaces.
Depending on your preferences, you can choose the one that fits the settings in your home.
<strong>Allergen Filters</strong>
Whenever you are vacuuming, pet hair and other microscopic particles get raised into the air.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, the suction should be powerful enough to collect as many of these particles as possible.</li>
<li>Also, the device should be equipped with HEPA filters to trap these particles.
This protects the user from possible allergic reactions to these particles. The advantage of HEPA filters is that they can be washed and reused.
<strong>Cord Length</strong>
The length of the power cord determines how far you can go on with your cleaning job before changing the power plug.</li>
<li>Its a hassle having to stop and change the plug.</li>
<li>Therefore, its advisable to go for long power cords to give you convenience and less hassle when vacuuming your house.
Most of the sharks devices have cords stretching up to 30 feet. This is quite convenient for vacuuming a house with several rooms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having gone through this review and guide, I hope youre now equipped with adequate information regarding pet hair vacuum cleaners.
Getting one of these devices will keep your house free from pet fur and eliminate instances of allergies or respiratory complications.</p>
