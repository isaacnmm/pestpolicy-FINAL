<ul>
<li>Youll get all these in your local market or online. However, not all of them will perform as they promise.
So, before choosing your ideal dishwasher detergent, here are a few important things to consider.
<strong>Powder</strong>
Perhaps, powder detergents are some of the oldest cleaning products in the market.</li>
<li>Theyre available in both small and bulk. Getting the bulk package will give you cost-effective cleaning.</li>
<li>The main setback with powder detergents is their tendency to absorb moisture.
Therefore, youll have to store them in watertight containers so that they retain their cleaning properties.
<strong>Gels</strong>
Gel detergents are cheaper and have the ability to dissolve easily, especially in hot water in your dishwasher.</li>
<li>They dissolve even at low temperatures and will not have harsh effects on your hands.
Theyre, however, not as effective as either powders or tablets.
<strong>Tablets</strong>
Also known as tabs, pics, or packets, these dishwasher detergents are premeasured for use as single-dose pieces. This gives you convenience when putting the detergent in your dishwasher.
The single-dose tabs contain a multi-action formulation that pre-treats, degreases, bleaches, and rinses your utensils.</li>
<li>They are effective in lifting and removing the mess from utensils.
However, their cost-per-load is higher than that of powders or gels. They also tend to disintegrate when handled with wet hands.
<strong>Composition</strong>
Some ingredients used in the manufacture of dishwashing detergents negatively affect your utensils and affect your skin.
Avoid products that contain chemicals such as phosphate.
<strong>No Residue</strong>
Residues left on utensils after dishwashing requires you to rerun the machine or clean them manually.</li>
<li>This is not only time-taking but also consumes more water and energy.
If your dishwasher has a drying cycle, your utensils will have to get wet once more.
<strong>Packaging</strong>
Go for packaging that gives you an easy time when putting or pouring the detergent into your dishwasher.</li>
<li>Tablet detergents provide the quickest way to add to your dishwasher.
Some like the Finish Quantum Max Powerball is unwrapped and pre-measured. That means you only have to throw the tablet into the dishwasher.
Most of the powder products come in plastic bags, which are cheaper and environmentally friendly. Thus, youll have to pour them into a convenient and reusable container.
Some gel detergents come with a dispenser to enable precise measuring.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have been getting unsatisfactory results with your dishwashing, its time you tried a new dishwasher detergent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting an effective brand will get your utensils clean in the least time, money, and with less hustle.
Whether you prefer a tablet, gel, or powder detergent, the brands I have reviewed will work perfectly with your dishwasher.</li>
