<h3 id="1-roach-killer">1. Roach Killer</h3>
<p>If used correctly, boric acid is
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">good for killingcockroaches</a>
. Incorrect usage will make the
boric acid reduce its roach-killing potency.
You can mic the
boric acid (powder - 2 tablespoons
) with
1 cup of water and sugar (2 cups) to kill roaches. Sugar acts as an attractant for while boric acid poisons the bugs.
Roches will infest your office, restaurants, and homes - to most people these bugs are repulsive and unsightly but will also cause major health risks (in indoor spaces) to pets and people.
Roaches will carry germs on their leg spines while crawling on various decaying materials - they may contaminate human food with these causing salmonella and E. coli.
Further, roaches&rsquo; skin sheddings, saliva, and droppings have allergens that may cause asthma and allergic reactions, particularly in kids.
But roaches will die when they crawl over areas treated (sprayed) with boric acid due to poisoning. They&rsquo;ll absorb the poison through the exoskeleton, antennae, and legs.
Luckily, boric acid will also kill other bugs that disturb humans including wood borers, beetles,
silverfish
,
termites
, fleas, and also ants.</p>

effective, and powerful to use as a household cleaner and pesticide. It has a limited risk to humans or pets - for large doses.
For cleaning toilet bowls or

, you&rsquo;ll need to simply pour the boric acid on the surfaces and let it work for roughly 1/2 an hour.</p>
<h3 id="3-treats-yeast-infections"><strong>3. Treats Yeast Infections�</strong></h3>
<p>Boric acid is also an effective solution for treating yeast infections, especially yeast infections. Medics recommend it (as female suppositories) for the prevention of Candida fungi.
The
capsule (female BA capsules) is inserted into the female and it&rsquo;ll be effective for 6 - 12 months - apply for 7 days t 2 weeks depending on the infection intensity.
Boric acid suppositories for the female are reported by CDC to be more effective than oral azole in treating the systems of candida -

<h3 id="4-acne-treatment---boracic-water">4. Acne Treatment - Boracic Water</h3>
<p>Boric acid can be used as an antiseptic that&rsquo;ll effectively disinfection your chapped or irritated skin, and minor burns - but it&rsquo;s also a great acne treatment as its antibacterial.

causes acute poisoning.</p>
