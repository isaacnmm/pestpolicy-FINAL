<h3 id="1-belt-speed-and-belt-grit">1. Belt speed and Belt grit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-belt-speed-and-belt-grit">¶</a></h3>
<p>The variable speed control feature is one of the most important features if you are looking to work on that deck in the shortest time possible. Whereas low end models lack this feature, you might want to go for a model that allows you to deal with a variety of belt grits giving you more control over the sanding process.
You need a unit with a powerful motor to power it through to overcome the resistance caused by the sanding belt when it makes contact with the decking board. If the engine is incapable of overcoming the resistance, the belt might stall, skip, or slip. If the motor is too powerful for the sander, the belt may wear down rapidly. The recommended sander should have a grit belt range of 80 to 220 grit belts.</p>
<h3 id="2-durability-andmotor">2. Durability and��Motor<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-durability-andmotor">¶</a></h3>
<p>You might want to go for a model whose housing and other critical components are made out of sturdy materials. In particular, the idler wheel, tracking nob, and driver should be highly durable. If youre going for a benchtop model, ensure it has a solid base to attenuate the shock generated during use.
The ideal handheld belt sander motor output should range from 6A to 10A. You might want to go for a model that gives you more output for a relatively low price.</p>
<h3 id="3-dust-extraction-and-price">3. Dust extraction and Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-dust-extraction-and-price">¶</a></h3>
<p>The sanding process generates a lot of dust residue. The go-to choice should feature a dust collecting bag or a port for connecting to an external vacuum cleaner. Also, it is imperative to ensure there is compatibility between the ports shape and size with the household vacuum cleaner.
The budgetary consideration is an essential factor when choosing between the various products available in the market. Depending on how much you are willing to spend, you might want to go for a model that offers you the variable speed feature.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2>
<p>When picking a belt sander, ensure it is suited for the specific tasks you intend to use it for. Other important considerations include the period of use and versatility. Our featured list contains the top models in the market, which are guaranteed to meet all your deck sanding needs.
Based on the above review, the WEN 6502T 4.3-Amp 4 by 36 disc sander with cast iron base stands out as the go-to choice given its numerous features. This belt sander gives you power and versatility in addition to a quiet performance and ease of use capabilities for efficient sanding.</p>
