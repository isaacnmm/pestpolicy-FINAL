<h3 id="b-surface-preparation--old-peeling-paint-removal">b. Surface Preparation  old peeling paint removal</h3>
<p>Before fixing peeling paint,
surface preparation
is paramount in order to achieve a high stickiness paint layer and eliminating unnecessary drains.
The surface preparation process may be broken into two major steps:
<em>1. Sanding</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wear protective gear ( gloves, facemask, respirator, overall,boots, and eye goggles) for personal safety</li>
<li>Using a broom, sweep the drywall to remove the dust or surface debris completely. Alternatively, you can pass a vacuum cleaner over the drywall gently in order to suck dust particles</li>
<li>Using a paint scraper, scratch old peeling paint entirely. You can thin the paint before scraping where necessary</li>
<li>Usesandpaper (220 grit or medium grit)to sand the surface gently  helps remove remnants of peeling paint from the surface and eliminate surface unevenness</li>
<li>For finer sanding process, consider using a sander, which matches the type of primary drywall material</li>
<li>Use a blower to clean dust and dislodged material from the drywall surface
<em>2. Polishing</em></li>
<li>Plug a polishing machine (soft grade) to the power supply and run it over the sand surface in order to achieve a smooth final finish.</li>
<li>When polishing, run the machine back forth as per the orientation of the drywall surface. For wood and laminated drywall, pass the polishing machine along the direction of the grains to avoid further surface damage</li>
<li>Blow or sweep dust from the surface and scan to see if there is any paint remains on the surface</li>
<li>Using a wet piece of cloth, mop and rinse the drywall to dryness</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-repairseal-the-dents-and-damaged-section">c. Repair/Seal the Dents and damaged section</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using patching material, seal/repair dents and damaged sections. Fill the holes and porous sections too</li>
<li>Smoothen the filled area with a putty knife and clean excess material</li>
<li>Leave the surface to dry sufficiently</li>
<li>Sand and polish the sealed points, and mop before leaving the drywall to dry naturally ready for the next step
When carrying out a surface repair, select the patching compound that matched the particular primary material of the drywall.
Otherwise, the adhesive contact may be low, leading to peeling or flaking with time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="d-primer-and-paint-selection">d. Primer and Paint Selection</h3>
<p>When selecting the primer, consider the type of drywall material. Its advisable to purchase universal primer (works for almost all surfaces).
Moreover, your selected primer should match with the final paint finish  oil-based paint should be primed using oil-based primer and vice versa.
Choose a primer and paint thats fast-drying peel resistant, more comfortable to prepare and resistant to mould/mildew. The paint should either be used indoors or outdoors as per the location of the drywall.
Remember, the quantity of paint purchased is a function of the surface area under paint application.</p>
<h3 id="e-prime-the-surface">e. Prime the Surface</h3>
<p>Add primer into an empty bucket and thin where necessary  you need to follow manufacturers instructions when thinning. Alternative, carry out a drip test  a well-thinned primer should load on a paintbrush without forming many drains</p>
<ul>
<li>Dipthe paintbrushinto the primer and apply over the drywall  back and forth  until the entire surface is coated</li>
<li>Leave the prime coat to dry as per the time given by the manufacturer before applying the next coat if need be</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="f-actual-paint-application">f. Actual Paint Application</h3>
<p>Pour finish paint into an empty bucket and thin accordingly  as directed by the manufacturer</p>
<ul>
<li>Dip a paintbrush into the paint solvent and apply over the primed drywall. Alternatively, use a roller, especially for a flat, wide drywall surface.</li>
<li>Using a paintbrush (while on a ladder), cut corners and eliminate runs and streaks that may from when using roller before they dry out</li>
<li>Leave the surface to dry before applying a second coat where necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="g-final-finish">g. Final Finish</h3>
<p>To attain a smooth final finish, a soft bristle paintbrush should be used when terminating edges and lining paint finish coat.
Covering the painted surface (for oil-based paint) or sprinkling some water on the surface should be done to keep off the dust from settling due to electrostatic charges attraction.
Importantly, never polish or sand drywall after painting (when correcting runs/drains) as this act may destroy the impressive outlook impression.�See Also:

<h2 id="what-causes-paint-to-peel-on-drywall">What Causes Paint to Peel on Drywall?</h2>
<p>The following are some of the factors/conditions that cause the paint to peel on drywall:</p>
<h3 id="1-age">1. Age</h3>
<p>Upon application, the paint begins to age with time. The chemical structural formula is highly affected by extreme weather conditions, which weaken the molecular bonds.
Further, the paint begins to disintegrate (breaks) and loses adhesive ability over the primary surface material, thus leading to flaking or peeling.
On the other hand, applying old paint (expired paint) on the drywall leads to peeling, chipping, or scuffing due to low stickiness ability.</p>
<h3 id="2-excess-heat">2. Excess Heat</h3>
<p>Presence of high heat or direct sun radiations weakens the paint adhesive bond leading to peeling or flaking.
In addition, the UV-rays damage the paint chemical formulation, thus accelerating the ageing process  reduces paint coat service life.
Excess heat in enclosed drywall (interior) leads to continuous underneath accumulation (settles between the drywall and paint layer) leading to peeling action.
Interior drywall should have sufficient air conditioning system. See Also:

.</p>
<h3 id="3-humidity">3. Humidity</h3>
<p>High humidity level over the paint layer initiates peeling by allowing continuous moisture accumulation beneath the painted wall, thus weakening the stickiness ability.
Continuous wetness over the paint layer leads to weakening of paint molecules and reduction stickiness action over the drywall.
NB: Interior drywalls with high humidity content should be fitted with a dehumidifier to boost paint service life.</p>
<h3 id="4-poor-surface-preparation">4. Poor Surface Preparation</h3>
<p>Primer or paint that is insufficiently prepared causes peeling to occur on drywall with time.
This occurrence may result due to low paint stickiness action or incomplete activation of active ingredients within the solvent upon paint application.
A highly viscous paint (under diluted) sticks fairly over the drywall  it ends up peeling after a couple of days.
Moreover, thin paint forms too many drains on the surface when painting, which leads to peeling or chipping occurrence.
NB: Always follow the manufacturers instructions during paint preparation or subcontract a painting professional to help you.</p>
<h3 id="5-too-many-paint-layers">5. Too many Paint Layers</h3>
<p>Applying too many paint layers creates internal stress at the bottom coat, thus leading to the onset of peeling action.
Usually, the surface strain on each paint layer is concentrated to the bottom paint coat (one holding on the drywall), which eventually loses the adhesive strength with time.
Furthermore, coating old peeling painting without surface preparation will only stay a few days before the entire paint layers peel again.
Its, therefore advisable that you consider applying a minimum paint layer (one or two) in order to avoid chipping, peeling, or scuffing problems.

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-paint-peeling-on-drywall">How to Prevent Paint Peeling On DryWall</h2>
<p>To enjoy longer service life upon paint application, you need to maintain your drywall properly and consider using these preventive measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean your drywall often with a moist piece of cloth to remove dust and surface debris  they cause paint coat weakness and initiate chipping and peeling action.</li>
<li>Never apply too many coats on the drywall or coat old paint before surface preparation.</li>
<li>High humid areas should be fitted with a dehumidifier in order to boost the drywalls service life.</li>
<li>Wet (painted) drywall should be mopped and rinsed effectively to prevent paint coat damage.</li>
<li>For the exterior drywall painting process, consider coating the finish layer with a UV-ray protective lamina.</li>
<li>Correct drains and runs formed when painted before they dry out and avoid scratching dried paint.</li>
<li>Do not wet drywalls painted with water-based paint  water thins the paint layer, thus leading to section peeling or chipping?</li>
<li>Aerosol chemicals shouldnt be sprayed over drywall coated with oil-based paint  lead to chemical reaction and surface disintegration.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="precautions-for-fixing-peeling-paint-on-drywall">Precautions for Fixing Peeling Paint on Drywall</h2>
<p>When fixing peeling paint on drywall, its advisable to follow the following precautions and safety measures in order to prevent injuries and other related health hazards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always put on protective attire  facemask, respirator, overall, gloves, boots, and goggles.</li>
<li>When sanding the drywall, avoid over pressing as it may damage the primary surface material.</li>
<li>Primer selected should always match the finish paint to be used  oil-based primer should be used with oil-based paint and vice versa.</li>
<li>Follow manufacturers instructions during paint preparation or contract a pint professional.</li>
<li>Never smell paint or primer directly (with your nose)  the paint has components that may choke you when inhaled.</li>
<li>Always carry out a drop test experiment before you begin to paint drywall (to ascertain stickiness level).</li>
<li>In case you get contact with thinner, primer, or paint, wash the section with water and soap immediately.</li>
<li>Clean the floor or working area after painting the drywall and dispose of waste material in a dustbin or a garbage pit.</li>
<li>Store paint and primer that remain, away from kids/pets to prevent intoxication if swallowed.</li>
<li>Avoid using old paint when fixing peeling paint. Always check the expiry date of a particular paint before breaking the seal.

<h3 id="c-paint-selection-and-preparation">c. Paint Selection and Preparation</h3>
<p>Paint selection entails proper considerations of the type of paint that match the deck surface texture and color.
Whether you want to use
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BW8J2JO/?tag=p-policy-20">latex paint</a>
or acrylic paint, the intended stay-period before repainting should always click in your mind first as this determines the number of layers to apply and paint type to purchase.
Some deck surfaces may require a primer or prepping to improve stickiness strength, while others can be painted directly. Moreover, most latex paints need a primer before the actual application to improve surface contact and protect primary material.
Usually, when selecting paint for your deck surface, consider factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cure time</li>
<li>Cost of the paint</li>
<li>Availability in the market</li>
<li>Ease to remove</li>
<li>Durability</li>
<li>Colors available
Paint preparation requires strict adherence to the manufacturers instruction. Latex paint needs little or no dilution, while
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAO2J31/?tag=p-policy-20">acrylic paint</a>
requires thinning to achieve the best paint concentration before application.
Besides, you should carry out a drop test before the actual painting to ascertain the performance of a given paint concentration on a deck surface. Otherwise, you may end up wasting paint by over-dilution or high solvent concentration, which may not stick nicely on the surface.
NB: Always stick to one particular
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BW8J2JO/?tag=p-policy-20">type of pain</a>
t for the next deck restoration to improve your deck service life and attain unmatched surface finish  frequent change of paint affects the primary material and deck microstructure with time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-surface-preparation">d. Surface Preparation</h3>
<p>Wrong surface preparation is one of the main reasons why paint peels. In this regard, you will need to follow the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Surface cleaning.**You will need to wipe the deck surface with a paintbrush or cloth to remove the dust layer in this process. You may sometimes opt to spray water (best for acrylic painted surfaced) on the surface to quicken the dust removal process. However, this method is not the best for latex paint since it affects prepping or stripping action.</li>
<li>**Paint striper application.**Apply paint stripper to soften thick paint layer bonds for easier scraping. Paint stripers may increase overall cost but help quicken the work at the end.</li>
<li><strong>Scrapping Process</strong>. Gently, scrap off the cured painted surface to remove old paint and surface debris. Use a paintbrush to wipe off dislodged paint peels and collect them nicely in a dustbin. Scrapping is meant to clean off the paint layer and leave a naked primary surface.</li>
<li><strong>Deck Filling and Sanding</strong>. Fill holes and cavities with high-quality putty or body filler or<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BW8JEU6/?tag=p-policy-20">sealer</a>to eliminated ruggedness. Nowsand the peeling areas. Prime the surface before sanding the filled section.</li>
<li>Use sandpaper when sanding your deck to remove old paint traces and attain a clean primary surface.
<strong>Polishing</strong>
. Polish the surface with fine-grit sandpaper to eliminate any roughness that may be created during the sanding process. Also, polishing improves the stickiness ability of the paint on the deck surface. Remember to clean off dust after polishing  it affects paint stickiness during application.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="e-final-paint-application">e. Final Paint Application</h3>
<p>When carrying out the final paint application process, consider the procedure given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dip the paintbrush or roller in the paint and soak it sufficiently. But aportable paint sprayerwill make the painting task easier and faster.</li>
<li>Apply gently over the deck surface to and fro  start with vertical painting motion and finish with the horizontal application. Paint sprayer works best to deliver the best surface finish</li>
<li>Let the first coat dry before applying another paint layer  the drying time may vary according to the manufacturers recommendation. However, 2 to 4 hour time is suitable for latex paint</li>
<li>Blow air over the painted surface to accelerate the quenching process  you can leave it to cure naturally</li>
<li>Sprinkle water over the deck (for acrylic paint) to remove and keep off dirt particles that make stick due to electrostatic attraction</li>
<li>Leave the painted surface to cure - some people also considerswing stain staining as an alternative.
It may take 1 to 7 days for the painted surface to achieve strong surface coating. Do not sand the painted surface (distorts the fine surface finish or affect the primary surface material).
Notably: The best paint selection always leads to a perfect and durable
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DKCK9B8/?tag=p-policy-20">coat finish</a>
when proper painting procedures are followed.

</ul>
<h2 id="what-makes-paint-to-peel">What Makes Paint to Peel?</h2>
<p>It is never guaranteed that your newly painted deck would maintain the current state forever. Peeling action is one of the significant challenges that affect painted surfaces. If you have faced such a problem, the following are possible reasons why peeling occurs on the deck surface.</p>
<h3 id="1-paint-quality">1. Paint quality</h3>
<p>Low-quality paint peels faster due to the inability to maintain original stickiness with time. You can tell the best quality paint through a drop test over a given surface  high-quality paint sticks faster and cures in a shorter time. Low-quality paint is difficult to apply and takes a longer time to dry/stick.
Consider close observation on surfaces painted using those particular types during paint selection and get more testimonies from previous buyers before placing your order. In case its new paint in the current market, let the manufacturer bear the quality guarantee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See Also:
Chemical Paint Remover for Wood</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="2-moisture-content">2. Moisture content</h3>
<p>Moisture content kills the paint stickiness by weakening the paint molecular bonds in contact with the primary surface. Usually, the decks base structure gets weaker due to wetness and detaches the paint chemical formulation, thus breaking the paint-deck surface bond.
Latex paint is mostly affected by moisture as compared to acrylic paints. �Consider painting your deck with acrylic paint to reduce peeling action and improve its surface life for a humid environment.</p>
<h3 id="3-presence-of-dirt">3. Presence of dirt</h3>
<p>Dirt/dust weakens paint surface bonds and accelerates breaching or defacing off paint color. Moreover, debris settled on the surface destroys the uniform paint molecular bonds leading to chipping that eventually peels off.
You will need to dust or wash your deck often to remove dirt that may have settled on the surface with time. Remember, latex painted deck shouldnt be washed; instead, you should blow air over the surface or wipe to remove dust/dirt.</p>
<h3 id="4-poor-surface-preparation">4. Poor Surface Preparation</h3>
<p>Incomplete removal of debris or polished dust during the surface preparation process accelerates peeling due to surface bond weakness.
Fine dust is dangerous to paint chemical formula as they settle within the intermolecular spaces weakening the overall stickiness ability. Ensure the deck surface is spotlessly
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-clean-a-deck-before-staining/">clean before paint application</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="5-application-method">5. Application method</h3>
<p>The method selected when painting your deck matters a lot in that the paint quality finish may fail to be achieved, leading to quick peeling off after a short period.
Spray painting gives the strongest surface paint layer, while the paintbrush offers a weak option. A roller is a better painting alternative as it maintains a more refined paint finish without drains as compared to a paintbrush.
NB: Application method is the least cause of paint peeling. It would help if you always focus on other factors listed above.</p>
