<h2 id="consideration-for-buying-dump-carts"><strong>Consideration for Buying Dump Carts</strong></h2>
<p>Dump carts go come in various designs, materials, and sizes. When choosing the best dump cart, you might be lost for choice because of the offers in the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to make your hauling activities a lot easier and enjoyable, you need a high-quality and efficient dump cart.
Therere a number of factors to consider when searching for the best dump cart for your garden or lawn. These include:</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-material-used-">**1. Material Used **</h3>
<p>The demand and popularity of dump carts have triggered manufacturers to come up with innovative designs for the modern gardener.</p>
<ul>
<li>They come in different sizes, designs, and qualities. Of course, what you get will depend on the amount of money youre willing to spend.
Cheaper dump carts are made with low-quality materials. But if you dont know how to tell the difference, you may settle for poor quality.
Low-quality dump carts may not take you for more than two years. So, if you are not working on a tight budget, go to the high-quality dump cart.
Below are the different types of dump carts, depending on the material used.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="i-plastic-dump-carts-">**(i) Plastic Dump Carts� **</h4>
<p><strong>Poly Tub Dump Cart</strong>
The poly tub type of cart is the most popular among homeowners. They are molded from high-quality plastics such as polypropylene or polyethylene.</p>
<ul>
<li>This makes them durable and less prone to cracks or deformities.</li>
<li>The poly tub is water-proof, allowing you to haul manure and other messy loads without spilling them on your compound.
Poly material is also resistant to corrosion and is quite easy to clean.
They are ideal for carrying both light and heavy loads.
<strong>Plastic Tub Dump Cart</strong>
Plastic tub carts resemble poly tub carts in design and appearance. The only difference is that the plastic material used in its construction is of lower quality than polypropylene or polyethylene.</li>
<li>The plastic material tends to distort and wear out easily. It can also be affected by UV degradation.
Thus, its not the ideal dump cart in hauling heavy loads. Its less expensive and easy to clean.
<strong>Structural Form dump cart</strong>
This type of dump cart features a low-density polymer bed on a steel frame.</li>
<li>The polymer material makes it tough and durable. Thus, it will be free from scratches and stains.
They come with reinforced slots or pockets on the sides for inserting extensions. This allows you to carry bulky loads that need more space.
Due to the high-quality materials, this dump cart will cost you $250 or more.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ii-metal-dump-carts-">**(ii) Metal Dump Carts **</h4>
<p><strong>Steel Tub Dump Cart</strong>
Another type of dump cart is one whose frame and tub are entirely made of steel.
They are sturdy and more durable than both poly and plastic tub carts. With this type of cart, you will be able to carry heavy loads such as gravel, ballast, etc.
A notable feature in this type of dump cart is the removable tailgate. This allows you to unload stuff conveniently without having to use a shovel.
The only setback is their susceptibility to rust since most of them are not built with stainless steel. Also, theyre not very easy to clean.
Theyre relatively expensive than the poly tub carts and will cost $150 - $500. But this is a worthy investment owing to their robustness and durability.</p>
<h3 id="2-load"><strong>2. Load</strong></h3>
<p>Whether youre buying a dump cart in a particular need or for general use, your equipment should withstand loads.</p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum load will depend on the strength of the frame. So, you might opt for heavy-duty carts, which can haul larger loads, or light-duty implements to help you transport small loads.</li>
<li>Typically heavy-duty dump carts can haul about 1500 pounds. But, if all you want is to carry manure and waste material from your landscaping activities, you can get a smaller one.
However, I would recommend you to go for a multipurpose dump cart because it can handle both small and heavy loads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-capacity"><strong>3. Capacity</strong></h3>
<p>Capacity is measured in cubic feet. Unlike the load capability, capacity will depend on the size, shape, and design of the tub /bucket.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your choice of dump cart depends on the type of materials you want to haul.</li>
<li>For instance, bulky materials such as hay require large-capacity rather than higher load capacity.
Generally, the available dump carts will carry ten cubic feet to 22 cubic feet. Those with provisions for extensions allow you to carry more volume.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-towingpulling-vehicle"><strong>4. Towing/Pulling Vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>Dump carts can be towed by a number of vehicles, including lawn tractors, ATVs, UTVs, garden mowers, among others.
Normally, lightweight dump carts are meant to be towed by small vehicles such as lawnmowers.
Therefore, its essential to choose your dump cart depending on the type of vehicle you want to use for towing. Most of the available dump carts will be compatible with most of your vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="5-mobility"><strong>5. Mobility</strong></h3>
<p>Another important feature to consider is the maneuverability of the dump carts on surfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is greatly determined by the wheels. Large tires make it possible to ride over rugged surfaces without getting stuck.
Well-treaded wheels are ideal for all surfaces, including wet and muddy tracks.
Pneumatic tires are the most preferred because of their ability to absorb shocks. Also, wider tires will provide good stability compared to thinner tires.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-features-to-consider"><strong>Other Features to consider</strong></h3>
<p>Some dump carts come with additional features that give them an edge over others in the market.
Of great importance is the ease of dumping from load from the tub. For this, various brands have different mechanisms for lifting the tub to dump the load. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>*Hydraulic lift:*Its the most preferred lifting mechanism due to its effectiveness. It gives you an easy and effortless way of dumping loads from your cart.</li>
<li><em>Electric lift</em>: It is not very common. It utilizes electricity to help people remove heavy loads from the dump cart.</li>
<li>*Swivel:*A swivel is a configuration of the dump cart, which allows you to rotate the tub to dump the load in a convenient area.</li>
<li>*Manual Lift:*With this type of dump cart, you lift the tub manually using the handle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The best dump carts for lawn tractors will make your lawn maintenance and gardening activities easier and enjoyable. They come in various sizes, designs, and qualities.</p>
<ul>
<li>The suitability of a dump cart will entirely depend on the type and amount of load you want to haul.
Whether you want a heavy or light-duty dump cart, go for the quality. This will get your job done quickly and with less hustle.</li>
