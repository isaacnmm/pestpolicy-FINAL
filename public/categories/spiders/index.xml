      <description>The Gasteracantha (a.k.a</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gasteracantha (a.k.a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_orb-weaver">spiny spiders, spiny orb-weavers, or spiny-backed orb-weavers</a>
) <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> in the orb-weaver genus of spiders. The spiders have unique spikes on their backs.</p>
<p>The female Gasteracantha have brightly-colored spines on their shell-like, hardened, and broad abdomens. However, are spiny orb-weaver spiders poisonous?
<strong>The simple answer is, NO, Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders are not poisonous. While these Gasteracantha spiny spiders can bite, they aren&rsquo;t aggressive or poisonous spider species and they won&rsquo;t trigger any grave symptoms on humans.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="detailed-are-spiny-orb-weaver-spiders-poisonous">Detailed: Are Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders Poisonous?</h2>
<p>Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders measure about 1/4&quot; - 1/2&quot;, have 8 legs and are yellow, orange, black, or white in color with red markings. If you notice the colorful spiders and some large spun webs, then it may be a sure sign that your yard has been infested by spiny orb-weaver.
The spiny orb-weaver will mainly make their nests on shrubs, citrus trees, or around the sides of your house. In addition, these insects will mainly be active from October to January where they&rsquo;ll produce oval egg sacs under man-made structures and tree leaves too - interestingly they do this next to the webs by their females counterparts.
Each eggs sack of this Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders will hold roughly 100 - 300 eggs, and thus its presence will definitely signify a massive infestation in your yard. Sadly, the eggs will hatch within 2 weeks and hence you must control the bugs before the begin their hatching and reproduction.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-identify-the-spiny-orb-weaver">How to identify the Spiny Orb-Weaver</h2>
<p>The bug&rsquo;s body color is the surest way to distinguish between the spiny-back species - particularly in this case the orb-weaver spiders.
The male orb-weaver spiders are largely smaller compared to their female counterparts - their body length ranges from 2 - 3 millimeters but slightly longer in body width. On the other hand the female orb-weaver spiders measure 5 - 9 millimeters in body length and their body width is 10 - 13 millimeters.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_orb-weaver">Wikipedia</a>
[/caption]
The spiny spiders, just like name mentions, have 6 spines or projections protruding from the rear of their abdomen. You&rsquo;ll find bright color on the dosaum or top of the spiny spiders&rsquo; abdomen - these will be red spines plus black spots on the white background.
However, some of the spiny spiders, may be yellow but have black spikes. But other may also be completely black in color. The male bugs will have 4-5 small humps while their females come with large spines sitting on their back of their body.</p>
<h2 id="special-behaviors-by-the-spiny-orb-weaver">Special Behaviors by the Spiny Orb-Weaver</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.insectidentification.org/insect-description.asp?identification=Spined-Micrathena-Spider">Micrathena</a>
and
<a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/beneficial/g_cancriformis.htm">Gasteracantha</a>
genus are the most prevalent among these spiders - particularly considering their body patterns, shape and colors. The Gasteracantha cancriformis males are tinier while the female adults are about half an inch.
With their spine-like spines, crab-shaped and compact bodies makes these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders look very distinctive. Geographically, the color of the female Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders is different because the black-spot abdomens could be yellow or white.
Further, the spines or projections might be black or red. Further, their male counterparts may have abdomens that are gray, small spines, and white spots.�However, these spiders look like they&rsquo;re dwarfed by their circular and spreading snares. So, simply spot any spider webs at your eye-level and above particularly on shrubs, trees, and buildings.
One unique characteristic of the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders is that you&rsquo;ll note some silk tufts around the house - especially around its foundation lines. The silk turfs act to protect the spider&rsquo;s eggs and babies from humans, other animals and birds. However, the silk tufts may also attract some prey or even caution lizards.
Generally, the female Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders in the Araneidae family are considered web builders. Further, the females will mainly work to rebuild and repair the spider webs - they&rsquo;ll do this in a single location if they won&rsquo;t be disturbed. The remaining time, the females will sit waiting for any predator from which they&rsquo;ll such the animal&rsquo;s bodily fluids.</p>
<h2 id="habitat-and-food-spiny-orb-weaver-spiders-live">Habitat and Food: Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders live?</h2>
<dl>
<dt><em>Habitat</em></dt>
<dd>You&rsquo;l mainly find these bugs in southern states particularly Florida or southern California but they&rsquo;ll also inhabit different regions in the world.
As noted earlier, you&rsquo;ll mainly find these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders in residential places plus citrus groves, around houses, shrubs and trees near your house. You&rsquo;ll notice them from their color and the webs they create plus you might notice their eggs sacs.
<em>Food</em></dd>
<dd>On diet, the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders mainly feed on small insects that they&rsquo;ll capture using their intricately made webs.� Specifically, the bugs will feed on small insects such as flies, mosquitoes, beetles, and moths. The spiders will bite and paralyze the insects as they feed on their ovals.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="controllingspiny-orb-weaver-spiders">Controlling�Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders</h2>
<p>Since the spiders mainly feed on insects, it makes sense to reduce the amount of light that&rsquo;s particularly outside your house - this will keep the spiders away plus also discourage their small insects from coming near your yard and house too.
Therefore, I suggest you change the exterior lights and install &lsquo;bug lights&rsquo; that are particularity yellow in color as this will reduce the amount of light and hence the number of small insects that&rsquo;ll be flying near your yard or house in the evenings and at night.</p>
<p>Further, ensure that you clean and clear all the webs that are around the house as this will discourage the spiders from creating their webs. You might require to undertake more aggressive bugs control measure if you&rsquo;re having a massive Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders� infestation - this may include finding the eggs sacs and bug webs.
For this, I would recommend using de-webbing substances - particularly those that are organic as these will help prevent the spider webs from easily attaching on the house or bushes around the yard or lawn. This ensure that the spiders won&rsquo;t get a habitat from where they&rsquo;d hatch a re-infestation in your residence.
However, on the extreme case of infestation by the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders, simply hire the services of a professional exterminator to control the bugs. Such services might be costly but its definitely worth it as it immidietly takes the burden off your shoulders.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, are Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders Poisonous? Well, as I&rsquo;ve outlined above, these spiders can bite humans but they aren&rsquo;t aggressive or poisonous. However, the spiders will only bite when they&rsquo;re provoked as these are generally beneficial bugs in your farm or yard.
Definitely, the bites from these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders won&rsquo;t be poisonous as won&rsquo;t also cause any grave or dangerous symptoms on you body.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/how-venemous-is-a-black-spider-with-white-dots/">Black</a> widow spiders come in 5 species and they are mainly found in the northern and southern (in the United States) and they inhabit areas like the grasslands, deserts, and forests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fun Question: is it true that the female Latrodectus (female black widow spiders) will kill and feed on their mates?
The Latrodectus genus has a number of arachnids. But they are females who have a special and unique body outlook plus they are reported to feed on their mates.</li>
<li>Black widow spiders are considered to be beneficial insects because they feed on many insects.

Spider Bite vs Mosquito Bite?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-black-widow-spiders">Details: Black Widow Spiders</h2>
<p>But are there bites from black widow spiders dangerous?
In North America, these bites are classified as highly venomous but rarely fatal to people - despite that they may cause uncomfortable and serious symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are bitten by the black widow spiders, you may experience symptoms such as skin redness, swelling, burning, or even severe pain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-physical-appearance-of-the-black-widow-spiders">1. Physical Appearance of the Black Widow Spiders</h3>
<p>The female and male black widow spiders, just like with most insects, have different physical appearances and looks.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, female black spiders have a unique black (and shiny) body.</li>
<li>Its rounded abdomen has an hour-glass-shaped (red) marking on its underside.</li>
<li>But the hourglass marking on these female black widows may be orange-yellow.
The spider&rsquo;s hourglass shape has triangles that are red in color.</li>
<li>You may find some females that have a single triangle on the hourglass but also its color may be orange or yellow.
Male black spiders measure about 6.5 mm in body length while their female counterparts measure about 13 mm.
When it comes to spider venom the black widow spider is described as highly venomous.</li>
<li>In comparison to the venom from rattlesnakes, the black spiders are 13 + times more venomous.
Despite that, the black spiders will only bite humans when irritated or disturbed these insects are very poisonous.</li>
<li>The bites and their venom will be very hazardous to the sick, very old, and the very young.
The b from black spiders is painful (to be like a pinprick) and the pain will spread fast to various body parts - lasting 4 between 7 to 11.5 hours.
The symptoms of a black spider bite will include diaphragm paralysis, muscle aches, hypertension, challenges breathing, abdominal pain, back pain, profuse sweating, and nausea.</li>
<li>You can minimize the negative health impact and pain caused by black widow spiders by using an anti-venom.
Annually about 2,500 humans report having been bitten by black widows and getting relief from antivenoms.</li>
<li>The black widow venom is only recommended for people who are pregnant, those with high blood pressure, or humans with troubled breathing.
The Black widow bites anti-venom first came up in the 1930s and horses are the main animals used in the research.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W42xShK0h8o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W42xShK0h8o</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-where-can-you-find-the-black-widows">2. Where Can You Find The Black Widows?</h3>
<p>The black widows or the Latrodectus spiders will occupy temperate areas including those in South America, Africa, Australia, Asia, South Europe, and North America.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Black widows have been mainly occupying the grasslands deserts and forests which are largely in the West and South areas in the United States.
The black widows win spin webs outside of inside buildings, especially in the corners and areas near homes occupied by humans.</li>
<li>Black riddles will hide in woodpiles and crevices plus other secluded areas that have darkness.
In the house, these spiders will hide areas such as cluttered places, closets, basements, dark corners, and garages.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3items--foods-eaten-by-the-black-widows">3.�Items / Foods Eaten By the Black Widows.</h3>
<p>Just like with other spiders the Black widows will mainly feed on various arthropods such as scorpions, cockroaches, beetles, grasshoppers, and ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the Black widow may trap flies using their webs and eat them.
Also, these spiders will feed on various insects and spiders that are trapped in their webs.
Experts note that the rumor about sexual cannibalism is untrue since the females of the black widows don&rsquo;t eat the mates.</li>
<li>The black widow species that will feed on the mates mainly occupies the Southern hemisphere.
But the newborns of the black widows are known to eat their siblings that are freshly hatched.
Besides eating arachnids climbing and flying insects, the spiders will also feed on small vertebrates like lizards and snakes.
After the prey is tangled into the web of the black widows, a spider will inject venom into it and was paralyze the animal.</li>
<li>Next, the spider will release its digestive enzymes on the animal&rsquo;s body before carrying it off for their meal
As noted above, the black widows will release their digestive system externally onto their prey.
The digestion process in the spiders will take place outside their bodies.</li>
<li>The digestive enzymes will liquefier and soften the prey&rsquo;s body before a spider takes it in.
But how long will the Black widows survive with food to take?</li>
<li>When the black widow like I just made us will only leave for a few months without taking food.</li>
<li>However, some species of the Black widow are documented to live up to a year without food.

</ul>
<h2 id="species-of-the-black-widow">Species of the Black Widow</h2>
<p>The Latrodectus genius (that includes the black widows) has 31 species with the black widows being five species among them.</p>
<ul>
<li>North America is home to three species referred to as the black widows; Latrodectus mactans ( the southern species), Latrodectus variolus (the northern species), and the Latrodectus hesperus (the western species).
Scientific evidence shows that a black widow is classified in the Theridiidae family (the comb-footed spiders).</li>
<li>This is because these spiders have some short and stiff hairs and the last parts of their rear legs and these parts look like comb teeth.</li>
<li>The spiders use these comb-like hairs for draping silk as the arachnid wraps it.
The Latrodectus genus also has brown widows and red windows.
In all the black widow species just the female ones have dangerous bites. Despite being known as and come arachnids the Latrodectus will defend themselves aggressively but may finally unleash their venomous bites.</li>
<li>The 32 species of these arachnids have occupied all the continents worldwide except in Antarctica.

</ul>
<h2 id="reproduction-in-the-black-widows">Reproduction in the Black Widows</h2>
<p>Except when mating during late spring, the Black widows are largely solitary arachnids - this information comes from the National geographic.
The Black widows have a unique mating process, which was anything as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The male black widow will spin silk as they prepare for mating.</li>
<li>Next, they will soak the silk with their sperms and wrap it around deer park appendages (around their head area)</li>
<li>Finally, they will begin searching for a receptive female black widow and then insert their sperm-soaked palps into the female reproductive hole.
A female black spider will make egg sacs (papery ones) and this will have eggs in hundreds, and they will hatch within one month.
The newly hatched spiders will be pale yellow or whitish but will become darker as they molt to the next stage.
The female black spiders will achieve their maturity in about 3 months and we&rsquo;ll leave for 6 months.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the male black windows will mature in 2 and a half months and will leave for about 3.5 months.
But, as reported by
<a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Latrodectus_mactans/">Animal Diversity</a>
, the Black widows known as the latrodectus mactans can survive for up to 4 years while caged all up to 3 years well in the wild.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">Removing the Brown Recluse Spiders</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bites of the black widows are considered venomous but will really cause death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the female black widows are known to contain venom but will only release it when they are cornered and their life is threatened.
The bite of a black widow will feel like a pinprick but its alpha-latrotoxin venom will overwhelm your nerve cells very fast causing intense pain and swelling.</li>
<li>The side effects of bites where the black widows will include diaphragm paralysis, back and abdomen pain, excessive sweating, and nausea.
You can use an anti-venom against the black widow bite and this will assist in minimizing the damage caused to your body.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably there are thousand ways you can kill you can kill a <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-antennae/">spider</a> in your yard or house.</p>
<p>But definitely, most of us know crushing it with a blunt object - the Hulk smash&quot; technique. But,
<strong>can you drown a spider?�</strong>
<strong>The simple answer is, No, you cannot drown a spider - as stated by Real Science - but they&rsquo;ll die if submerged in sewer. Spiders have a very low oxygen intake due to their low metabolic rate and thus drowning may take 1-3 hours.�</strong>
<strong>But water spider or diving-bell spider can live fully under water. Spider breathe through book lungs or web gills and remain under water for over 24 hours.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-can-you-drown-a-spider-flush-water-death">Details: Can You Drown a Spider? Flush Water Death?</h2>
<p>Just like human beings, spiders also drink water and this is why you might find them around water sources such as shower or bath stalls. Also, can the spider drawn in the ocean if its swept by any random sunbather.
Spiders spending time around the shower or bath stalls may end up being flashed down the drain when you&rsquo;re bathing.�So, if you&rsquo;re wondering if spiders can actually drown when you flash them them down the drain - relax we get into the details. Can they crawl or climb back fighting for its life.

[/caption]
The truth is: According to the
<a href="http://www.americanarachnology.org/">American Arachnological Society</a>
, any spider that&rsquo;s flushed will only drown within 1-3 hours since they have low oxygen intake dude to their low metabolic rate.
Some spider species sick as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_bell_spider">diving bell spider</a>
won&rsquo;t drown easily anyway because �they&rsquo;ll create underwater webs which allow gaseous exchange.�The webs enable the spider to rise above the water surface once daily -� prevents it from being
washed away the drain
.
Therefore, when trying to kill the spiders you should know that
some spiders aren&rsquo;t even venomous
but will prey on household pests such as mosquitoes. For example, some spiders

<h2 id="alternative-ways-to-control-spiders">Alternative Ways to Control Spiders</h2>
<p>Spiders are crawly, creepy arachnids that have 8 legs that tend terrify kids and adults equally. This is particularly so when one finds themselves attached when in an empty apartment.
You might see some black and white spots on the floor - which will mean you&rsquo;ll have to kill the spiders with any way possible. So, below are some of the methods you can use to kill the arachnids.
However, researchers caution against
<a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/779681/Scientists-spiders-eat-tonnes-insects-bugs-creepy-crawlies">squashing spiders - they keep a natural ecosystem</a>
. So, to deal with the arachnids in your boat, house or yard, you&rsquo;ll need to counter the spiders intelligently.</p>
<h3 id="1-use-lady-bugs">1. Use Lady Bugs</h3>
<p>You definitely won&rsquo;t like the ladybugs running around the floor spaces. So, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the ladybugs around the garden walls to keep the spiders and other small insects.
Further, the ladybugs will prey and eat the insects that&rsquo;ll attract the spiders - which means that that spiders will have limited food sources available around the house and thus they&rsquo;ll relocate.
Thus putting the ladybugs around your house won&rsquo;t kill the spiders but will keep them off your house&rsquo;s perimeter. It&rsquo;ll equally work excellently when there many flowers and bushes that are near the windowsills or house foundation.

<h3 id="2-use-a-spider-spray-natural">2. Use a Spider Spray (Natural)</h3>
<p>Next up is using a natural spray for the spiders. You&rsquo;ll need to make the spray using natural ingredients and then spray it around the home&rsquo;s damp areas or bathroom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply, pour a single cup of the natural apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>Pour 1 cup of pepper</li>
<li>Pour 1 teaspoon of oil</li>
<li>Pour 1 teaspoon of dish soap (the liquid type)</li>
<li>Mix everything in one spray bottle and spray once, and respray after 3-5 days.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to spray the insecticide on the outer side of your house along the doors, windowsills, and windows to prevent the spiders from entering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-peppermint-oil"><strong>3. Peppermint Oil</strong></h3>
<p>Peppermint oil is hated by many pests including spiders and
bed bugs
. Notably, the oil has a very harsh smell - particularly for small arachnids and insects like
<a href="https://www.tipsbulletin.com/how-to-keep-yellow-jackets-away/">yellow jackets</a>
and wasps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a plastic bottle and pour some water (for dilution) with the peppermint oil so that it won&rsquo;t irritate your pets and the human skin.</li>
<li>Next, take the bottle and spray around the house, yard, and perimeter to repel the spiders.</li>
<li>Alternatively, soak some cotton balls in the peppermint oil-water mixture and position them in places you think spiders might be using to get into your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-de-clutter-your-spaces">4. De-clutter your Spaces</h3>
<p>Definitely, spiders - like insects too - like clutter and they&rsquo;ll camp behind dirty furniture and big boxes. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the home free from clutter and ensure its always clean.
Remember to dust and clean up the walls once each week while also putting away the packages and boxes. This will discourage the spiders from creating their web around - but also clean up any other cobwebs you see around.
Further, clean up your house&rsquo;s exteriors and slash up the bushes and vegetation that&rsquo;s on the house perimeter. This will remove any possible hiding places and make the space spider-free.</p>
<h3 id="5-citrus-peels">5. Citrus Peels</h3>
<p>Citrus, comparable mint leaves, contain acetic acid which insects and spiders loathe. Spiders hate citrus just like grapefruits, oranges, and lemons.
I would say that you can purchase citrus oils scents or simply save on some leftover peels after you&rsquo;ve eaten the fruit. These will repel the spiders away from your house and yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the citrus peels and rub them on bookshelves, baseboards, window sills, and doorways.</li>
<li>For the essential citrus oil, simply some water with the oil in the bottle ready for spraying around your house and perimeter.</li>
<li>However, for the citrus peels always replace these one in 1-2 days to ensure that the citrus smell is always active to repel the spiders from your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-spray-cedar-oil">7. Spray Cedar Oil</h3>
<p>Just like Citrus, spiders hate the cedar wood smell and will move so far from near it. So, simply lay down cedar mulch near your house and its perimeter to repel the spiders.
However, always get high quality cedar wood or cedar oil to ensure that the harsh smell won&rsquo;t die down so fast before it fully repels the spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>For cedar essential oil, simply mix the oil with some water and finally spray the mixture on your house&rsquo;s exterior and perimeter.</li>
<li>Also, you may position natural cedar in the house to repel the spiders. Luckily, its a natural solution that won&rsquo;t be toxic or harm pets and humans.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-use-tobacco">8. Use Tobacco</h3>
<p>Tobacco is hated by many insects and arachnids like spiders too. Luckily, tobaccos is readily available in most places and its equally cheap compared to
commercial spider fogger
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply get a tobacco leaf in your local store or shops and spread them on routes where you suspects spider use to get into the house.</li>
<li>Alternatively, crash the leaves and soak them in some water inn a spray bottle. Finally, spray the tobacco-water mixture around the house and perimeter.</li>
<li>Finally, you may create some tobacco balls. For this metods, you&rsquo;ll need to mix water, flour and tobacco leaves to create spider-repellent balls.</li>
<li>Caution - for homes with pets and kids, only using tobacco spray and leaves might be hazardous to these your sensitive animals and loved ones respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-use-borax">9. Use Borax</h3>
<p>Finally, borax is the last alternative repellent your can use against spiders. Definitely,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/borax-for-ants-outside/">borax is popularly used in repelling ants</a>
but it&rsquo;ll also be effective against spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the borax powder and sprinkle it on the routes and areas you suspect will be used by spiders or where they may make their webs.</li>
<li>In addition, you can sprinkle the powder along the doors, or between the storm windows and window.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve tackled the question - &ldquo;can you drown a spider?&rdquo; The response is that its impossible to easily drown spiders since they have low oxygen intake and equally low metabolic rate. This means that some spiders may even survive under water for 1-3 hours.
Equally surprising is that some spiders like water spider or diving-bell spider will use their book lungs or web gills for respiration�when they&rsquo;re under water. Therefore, these spider will�survive for longer (over 24 hours) without coming to the water surface.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders are fascinating creatures, often mistaken for insects due to their small size and presence in many of the same environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, their anatomy differs significantly, leading to some common misconceptions, particularly around whether spiders have antennae.
This article explores whether spiders have
<em><strong>antennae</strong></em>
, their unique sensory systems, and how they differ from other arthropods, particularly insects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-have-antennae">Do Spiders Have Antennae?</h2>
<p>The short answer is
<strong>no, spiders do not have antennae</strong>
. While spiders and insects are both arthropods, they belong to different classes: spiders are arachnids, and insects are classified as
<a href="http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/">hexapods</a>
. One key difference between these two groups is their body structure, including their sensory organs.</p>
<p>Antennae are absent in spiders. Instead, they have other sensory systems that help them navigate their environment and detect prey. These features work differently from insect antennae but serve similar functions.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-antennae-what-are-they">Understanding Antennae: What Are They?</h2>
<p>Antennae are sensory organs found in many arthropods, including insects and crustaceans. They play a crucial role in detecting chemical signals, vibrations, and environmental stimuli such as temperature and humidity. Insects rely on their antennae to navigate their surroundings, find food, communicate, and detect potential mates.</p>
<p>Antennae are typically long, segmented appendages located on the heads of insects. They come in various shapes and sizes depending on the species and serve functions like smelling, sensing air currents, or detecting vibrations. Given their importance to insect life, its natural to wonder if spiders share this feature.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-sensory-system-the-role-of-pedipalps-and-hair-like-structures">Spiders Sensory System: The Role of Pedipalps and Hair-like Structures</h2>
<p>Instead of antennae, spiders have evolved other sensory adaptations that help them perceive their surroundings and hunt effectively.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pedipalps</strong>: Located near a <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s mouth, pedipalps are small, leg-like appendages that play a significant role in sensing, manipulating prey, and in mating for males. Though not as long or prominent as insect <a href="/posts/do-fleas-have-antennae/">antennae</a>, pedipalps are highly sensitive and help spiders detect chemical signals, such as those from potential prey.</li>
<li><strong>Sensory Hairs (Setae)</strong>: Spiders are covered in tiny hairs called<em>setae</em>, which are highly sensitive to touch, air currents, and vibrations. These hairs allow spiders to detect even slight movements in their environment, helping them sense prey caught in their webs or an approaching predator.</li>
<li><strong>Trichobothria</strong>: Spiders have long, specialized hairs called trichobothria, which are exceptionally sensitive to vibrations in the air. These hairs help spiders detect the movement of nearby prey or predators, allowing them to react even when the source is not in direct contact.</li>
<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: While insects rely heavily on their antennae for sensory input, spiders often use their eyes to a greater degree. Most spiders have eight eyes, though the number and arrangement can vary by species. Some spiders, like jumping spiders, have excellent vision, which they use to hunt and ambush prey.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="differences-between-spiders-and-insects">Differences Between Spiders and Insects</h2>
<p>Though spiders and insects are both arthropods, there are significant anatomical and behavioral differences between them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Body Structure</strong>: Insects have three body segments (head, thorax, abdomen) and six legs, while spiders have two segments (<a href="https://bijlmakers.com/spiders/spider-bodyparts/#cephalothorax">cephalothorax</a>and abdomen) and eight legs.</li>
<li><strong>Sensory Organs</strong>: Insects have antennae that serve as primary sensory organs. Spiders lack antennae and instead use pedipalps, sensory hairs, and their keen eyesight for sensory input.</li>
<li><strong>Breathing Systems</strong>: Spiders breathe through structures called book lungs, while insects use a network of tubes called tracheae to transport oxygen.</li>
<li><strong>Life Cycle</strong>: Insects typically undergo metamorphosis, transitioning through stages such as egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Spiders do not undergo such transformations; they hatch as miniature versions of adults and grow through molting.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-spiders-navigate-without-antennae">How Spiders Navigate Without Antennae</h2>
<p>Despite lacking antennae, spiders are highly adept at navigating their environments. They rely on their pedipalps, sensory hairs, and excellent vision to hunt and detect threats. Web-building spiders, for instance, use vibrations in their webs to sense when prey has been caught.</p>
<p>For non-web-building spiders, like wolf spiders or jumping spiders, trichobothria and setae provide detailed information about their surroundings. These sensory adaptations allow them to hunt effectively, ambushing prey or avoiding predators.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, spiders do not have antennae like insects do. Instead, they rely on other sensory organs, such as pedipalps, sensory hairs, and eyes, to interact with their environment.</p>
<p>These adaptations allow spiders to hunt, detect threats, and navigate effectively without the need for antennae. Though spiders and insects share some similarities as arthropods, their anatomy and sensory systems differ significantly, making spiders unique and highly skilled predators in their ecosystems.</p>

      <title>Do Spiders Have Bones</title>

      <description>Your regular spiders are small-bodied insects. So, its not out of the ordinary to imagine how small their bones would be, if they have any at all.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your regular spiders are small-bodied insects. So, its not out of the ordinary to imagine how small their bones would be, if they have any at all.</p>
<p>In fact some bigger creatures like lobsters, crab, snails, worms and shrimps have no bones.
<em>So, do spiders have bones?</em>
<strong>Well, spiders don&rsquo;t have bones - and like other arthropods. However, they have an �endoskeleton plus an exoskeleton (external skeleton) that provides primary support for the arachnid&rsquo;s muscles. Its exoskeleton has cuticles plus joints on their surfaces to enable easy movement.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-bones-exoskeleton">Details: Do Spiders Have Bones?? Exoskeleton?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s cuticle is composed of 4 layers (like other arthropods) unlike insects that have 3 cuticle layers. However, the cuticles are all made off chitin fibers plus protein.
But, don&rsquo;t be mistaken, the spider still has a small internal skeleton - that&rsquo;s has, however, no bones in it.�The spider&rsquo;s endoskeleton has collagen and a couple of plates which won&rsquo;t articulate like bones do for the skeleton in vertebrates.
Compared to humans and other animal species -these ones have an endoskeleton that acts like a support structure that&rsquo;s created from bones.
The endoskeleton offers support to its organs like
lungs
,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-brains/">brain</a>
,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-hearts/">heart</a>
and maintain the animals size and shape.</p>
<h2 id="exoskeletons-offer-spiders-body-support">Exoskeletons offer Spiders Body Support</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, spiders have an exoskeleton as compared to having an internal skeleton created from bones. So, what&rsquo;s these exoskeletons and what makes it up?
The arthropod&rsquo;s exoskeleton is made from chitin- which covers its body outer surface to offer support, protection, and structure. Thus, the exoskeleton will be shed (through molting) as the spider grows and develops. So, below is a�tarantula shedding her exoskelton:�</p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-benefit-from-theexoskeletons">How Spiders Benefit from the�Exoskeletons</h2>
<p>Compared to endoskeletons, exoskeletons will provide more protection because it covers the whole spider&rsquo;s body while the bones would only be located internally.
Also, exoskeletons enable the spider&rsquo;s muscles to achieve more leverage for movement, lifting, or picking objects - this is better than in the animals with endoskeletons.
Therefore, the exoskeletons will give the spider more power and straight than other animals of the same size but having an endoskeletons.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-ears/">Do Spiders Have Ears?</a></p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-move">How Spiders Move</h2>
<p>The segments of the exoskeleton in the arthropod are joined using joints to allow it to move up and down. Therefore, the muscles that are attached to the exoskeleton tend to contract allowing the spider to move its legs inward.
However, the spider lacks muscles that would otherwise extend its legs back (outward) to their default position. Therefore, the creature use its blood and other bodily fluids to push the legs outward.
Whenever the spider loses excessive bodily fluid, it&rsquo;ll lack the required pressure (
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/hydraulic.htm">hydraulic)</a>
for moving its legs outwards. You&rsquo;ll notice the spider lying on its back and its legs in a curled up position.</p>
<h2 id="howspiders-molt">**How�****Spiders **<strong>Molt�</strong></h2>
<p>Spiders will move from one point to another through muscle contraction - these will be attached to the exoskeleton on the outer part of the arthropod.
The spider&rsquo;s exoskeleton is composed of different cuticle layers - that are made from chitin (polysaccharide) and
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/cell3.htm">proteins</a>
. This allows the cuticle structure to be layered like a
<a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question154.htm">plywood</a>
grain.
Therefore, the cuticle structure is very strong for protection while also preventing the spider from losing fluids excessively and drying out. This would in turn prevent effective movement in the arthropod.
But the cuticle won&rsquo;t grow like the human tissue or bones (endoskeleton) and thus it must be shed off as the spider continues to develop and grow. But spider molting mainly happen when the spider is in its younger years - but other may molt all its life.</p>
<ol>
<li>When time is ready, the spider&rsquo;s body (directed by its hormones) will absorb a part of its cuticle layer (particularly the lower layer) in its exoskeleton.</li>
<li>In addition, the spider&rsquo;s body will also start generating a new cuticle layer to create another exoskeleton. So, the emerging exoskeleton will be folded slightly to allow it to expand when the spider sheds off the old exoskeleton.</li>
<li>The spider will inject a molting fluid at the areas separating the new and old exoskeleton. The fluid allows easy separation of the two exoskeletons by create a gap between them.</li>
<li>Next, the spider bust out to shed its old exoskeleton. To achive this, the animals tend to raise the heart rate and thus pumping more blood (hemolymph) into its cephalothorax from their abdomen.</li>
<li>Therfeore the hemolymph&rsquo;s pressure forced the older exoskeleton to crack while the spider continues to flex their muscle to make its old exoskeleton to molt.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Invertebrates and vertebrates follow the Hallers Rule when considering the body size and brain comparison. For example, the ant&rsquo;s brain makes up 15% of its body mass. But, the difference is considerably bigger in spiders -m as outline din this
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467803911000727"><em>Arthropod Structure &amp; Development study</em></a>
.
Spiders are tiny arachnids that seem to be very intelligent for their small sized-body in web-weaving (some being even below 1 millimeter in body length). You can control them using
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-spider-spray-for-indoors/">spider sprays</a>
of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-spiders/">spider foggers</a>
.
<strong>But, do spiders have brains? Well, technically, spiders have no brains in the manner anatomy defines &ldquo;brains&rdquo;. However, the arachnids have neural/ nerve cell clusters filling up many spaces in the spider&rsquo;s cephalothorax. Notably, the&quot;brains&quot; of some spiders like Jumping spiders tend to extend down in their legs.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-brains">Details: Do Spiders Have Brains??</h2>
<p>It would require a big brain for the small spiders to have such magnificent web-weaving prowess and weave webs that are even bigger than the arachnids.
A recent
<a href="http://www.stri.si.edu/english/scientific_staff/staff_scientist/scientist.php?id=10">spider brain study</a>
by Bill Eberhard analyzed 9 species of spiders across 6 web-weaving groups. The outcomes of the study was that the spider&rsquo;s body was inversely proportional to its brain size. Thus, smaller spiders have relatively larger brains.</p>
<p>In addition, for various spiders, their central nervous system occupied about 80% of their body spaces - it may also fill up the arachnid&rsquo;s legs as shown below. Check
<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110603-spiders-spare-legs-webs-science-animals/">how spiders evolved its spare legs</a>
.</p>
<p>Further, the body of the spider, like
*Leucauge mariana, *
filled with its brain continue to grow and develop up to when it becomes an adult.
You&rsquo;ll notice that some of the immature and tiny spiders tend to have a bulging and deformed body due to having an excess spider brain.
However, the adult spiders won&rsquo;t have a bulge. This is because its brain cell will still remain relatively small. The brain cell will have nucleus containing all the genes of the spider - which occupy space.
Further, the axons and nerve fiber diameters can&rsquo;t be reduced - even for the young spiders, since if they&rsquo;re overly thin it&rsquo;ll affect the flow of ions carrying nerve signals. Therefore, additional space would be given to the spider&rsquo;s nervous system.</p>
<h2 id="too-much-spider-brain-for-a-small-body">Too Much Spider Brain for a Small Body?</h2>
<p>Definitely, you won&rsquo;t consider that the spider&rsquo;s brain tends to take up too much body space at the disadvantage of other of its organs. This aspect is yet to be examined scientifically.
However, by examining the spiders physically, you&rsquo;d notice that the animals are definitely making a trade off to have a big brain spread even all over its legs.
A example of this is the Phidippus clarus spider that has been seen to have its digestive system (particularly of the adult jumping spider) is positioned in the animal&rsquo;s cephalothorax (the body and head cavity).
However, for the baby Phidippus clarus, the cephalothorax is fully filled with the brain and thus the young one now tends to have its digestive system being less developed.

<h2 id="how-heavy-is-the-spiders-brain">How Heavy is the Spider&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brain&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>The Hallers rule states that as an animal&rsquo;s body size reduces, the more its proportion of its body taken by its body increases. For example, 2-3% of the human&rsquo;s body mass is composed of the brain.
Further, scientifically, the tiny animal brains take up 15% of the creatures biomass - however, some spiders tend to be much smaller comparatively.
However, brain cells also need high amounts of energy. Thus, the spiders will be converting most of the food they take up into brain power.
From a Costa Rica and Panama study on the spider&rsquo;s brain extension, researchers resolved that the Nephila clavipes had a weight that&rsquo;s a 400,000 multiple of� the small spiders.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-large-spider-brains-help-in-spinning-webs">How Do Large Spider Brains Help In Spinning Webs?</h2>
<p>Its a key presumption that spiders require a large brain to create to super complicated webs. This is relatively true to some extend but not for all the spider species.
For example, the kleptoparasitic spiders have eveolved and are unable to spin their webs and so they steal such webs from other spiders. However, these kleptoparasitic spiders do not have a smaller brain compared to other spiders.
On the other hand, the researcher noted that the spiders require to be smart to become stealthy and sneaky - and thus this shows why the kleptoparasitic and other stealing spiders have a big brain too just like the web-weaving spiders.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For along time, scientific evidence considered that spiders are dominated by touch and sight. But the characteristics of these arachnids can be both terrifying and impressive.</p>
<p>**So, do spiders have ears? Spiders don&rsquo;t have ears or eardrums but jumping spiders can hear **
**sounds even from 5 meters away. **
<strong>A recent�study show that spiders�have tiny sensitive hairs to detect sound.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-ears">Details: Do Spiders Have Ears?</h2>
<p>According to the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/13/spiders-dont-have-ears-but-they-can-still-hear-you-coming">Paul Shamble research</a>
, their study showed that spiders have acute hearing senses. These insects, despite lacking ears and eardrums, will hear sounds from far distances.
Definitely, the research notes that the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s eardrums are small but its sensitive leg hairs will help the insect to detect sounds. Current research shows spiders will hear humans clap and talk in 5 meters.

<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">Past knowledge</a>
suggested that the hairs on the spiders legs are sensitive to sound waves plus other airborne vibrations - but they said this was limited to sounds only near the spider&rsquo;s body length.
Definitely, most researchers had not realized that the spiders would also interpret the sound waves to a neural activity - this implies that the arachnids could actually hear the sound waves not just sensing even when the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-sleep/">spiders are resting</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="deeper-recording-than-just-visual-information">Deeper Recording than Just Visual Information</h2>
<p>The study conducted on
<em>hidippus audax (jumping spiders)</em>
where the researcher were doing neural brains recordings for the spiders analyzing their processes of processing visual data.
However, Menda conducted an analysis deeper into the spider&rsquo;s brain as
<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/log/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">outlined in this study</a></p>
<ul>
<li>this was unlike their norm in the previous research on the spider&rsquo;s visuals.
When Menda was moving from the spiders, the chair did some squeaking in the laboratory floor. The spider&rsquo;s neurons fired with the chair squeaking - they could hear a &lsquo;pop&rsquo; sound. Again the neural recordings fired again.
To clarify their discovery, the researchers did clap as they moved away from the spider to check when the neurons firing would stop. But the neurons firing continued up to 5 meters from the spider.
<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/log/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">Menda</a>
reported that the accidental discovery had just enabled the researchers to begin a new journey into testing the spider&rsquo;s hearing capability.

<h2 id="testing-spiders-hair-using-water-droplets">Testing Spiders Hair using Water Droplets</h2>
<p>Menda and team went on to determine the spider&rsquo;s hearing capability by placing some droplets of water on the insects legs - the main was to reduce the vibrations that would happen on the hairs.
But the spider&rsquo;s auditory neurons could no fire - which would mean the arachnid could not hear. Tests showed spiders were sensitive to sounds at low frequencies (80 Hz -130 Hz) like for wasps&rsquo; wing-beats.
However, even with their slight haring, spiders won&rsquo;t hear like human do - this is because their brain process such information in a different way.
The researchers are now examining if spider species like fishing spiders and wolf spider show similar reaction on sound waves - as shown in

<p>When fear comes - particularly when attached by spiders, you&rsquo;ll definitely scream but can the arachnids hear you? However, first, vibrations and visuals, are more pronounced.
Previously, researchers thought that spiders could only hear sounds and noises that are just around the insects body. Spiders will smell, taste but will sense vibrations (on hearing) via tiny holes nand hairs all over its body.
Some spiders species such as Phidippus audax and jumping spider do hear noises and sounds that are up to 5 meters away from the spider.</p>

<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33989-9_2">open circulatory system</a>
that is, they lack &ldquo;true blood&rdquo; or veins to transport it. But, do spiders have hearts?</p>
<p><strong>The simple **
<strong>answer</strong>
** is, Yes, spiders have 1 tube-like heart in its abdomen with one artery that carry hemolymph (spiders blood) and ostia (one-way valve) on its sides. However, the spider&rsquo;s heart has no capillaries.�</strong>
<strong>Spiders have the open circulatory system. The animal&rsquo;s heart thus pumps the hemolymph into the sinuses and body cavity soaking its organs and tissues to give them hormones, nutrients, and oxygen.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-hearts">Details: Do Spiders Have Hearts??</h2>
<p>Spiders have the open circulatory system, which is different from that in mammals that have the closed circulatory system. The spiders has 1 heart that&rsquo;s a muscular tube pumping the hemolymph into the open circuit.
The spider&rsquo;s bodies like the
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=OCypCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=Spiders+Have+Hearts&amp;ots=kd5ld9canM&amp;sig=BTTnLEI9RYd9m76MSBHlSGRYGIo">Brown recluse</a>
will be filled with the arthropod&rsquo;s haemolymph that&rsquo;s pumped via arteries into the sinuses (openings) that surround various internal organs. The arthropod&rsquo;s blood would diffuse into the� individual cells and later collected into the spider&rsquo;s heart.
Related:
Do Spiders Have Brains?</p>
<p>Therefore, the spiders won&rsquo;t have definite veins that&rsquo;ll transport the arthropod&rsquo;s Haemocyanin (blood) in the body. The Haemolymph has haemocyanin as opposed to the mammalian Haemolymph .
Haemocyanin has copper molecules compared to hemoglobin that contains iron molecules - the spider&rsquo;s blood have a blue coloration.
But Haemolymph carry more oxygen - actually 17 times more than Haemocyanin. In addition, Haemocyanin has no cells like those in mammalia blood.</p>
<h2 id="human-blood-cells-vs-spider-blood-cells">Human Blood Cells Vs Spider Blood Cells</h2>
<h2 id="bloodcirculationin-spiders">BloodCirculationin Spiders</h2>
<p>The heart of the spider is situated in abdomen, not� cephalothorax, which is on the upper section. This is also evident in other species having a abdominal cuticle that&rsquo;s pale-colored. Check the
best spider spray for indoors
to control the athropods.
Also, its enclosed by a membrane that&rsquo;s thin just like the pericardium around the mammalian heart. The spider&rsquo;s heart will pump the haemolymph via the pedicel then to its cephalothorax through the anterior aorta (large artery).
To guarantee that the blood flows in one-way, the spider&rsquo;s heart has simple valves. Also, the spider has a 30 to 200 heart rate (beats in every minute) varying with level of activity or species.</p>
<ol>
<li>Negative pressure is what will allow the spider&rsquo;s haemolymph to return in its heart - this particularly occurs when the heart relaxes in between the beats.</li>
<li>But the haemolymph that&rsquo;s pump[ed into the spiders cephalothorax is moved via unique channels though pedicel whenver the blood pressure is high in its cephalothorax compared to that in the abdomen.</li>
<li>Further, the haemolymph would collect in the lacunae prior to diffusing into the lamellae of the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-lungs/">book lungs</a>and taken up via the heart&rsquo;s tissue spaces� getting in through the ostia (tiny holes).</li>
<li>The secondary�haemolymph pumping is great since there exists cephalothorax muscles that&rsquo;ll expand and compress to allow easy movement of the spider&rsquo;s legs.</li>
<li>Every cephalothorax compression makes the haemolymph that has lost oxygen back via the pedicle moving towards the book lungs for gas exchange and finally getting back to the spider&rsquo;s heart.</li>
<li>However, researchers noted that when the spider moves its legs vigorously, its<a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:871756">heart rate will increase</a>due to a rise in pressure of the haemolymph in the spider&rsquo;s cephalothorax that increase fluid flow into the abdomen.</li>
<li>This on the other hand reduces the flow of haemolymph into the cephalothorax from the abdomen through the spider&rsquo;s anterior aorta. This, therefore, makes the heart rate to slow down as a compensation mechanism.

<h2 id="what-makes-up-the-spider-haemolymph">What Makes up the Spider Haemolymph?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s haemolymph is pale blue in colour since it doen&rsquo;t have haemoglobin (iron molecules containing) in the human blood is the red color matter.
However, the haemolymph contain haemocyanin that carry oxygen and contain copper - making it look blue in color.
But the haemolymph is almost similar to the human lymph which tends to diffuse via the human tissues and finally returns to your circulatory system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Haemolymph cells will help carry oxygen around the spider&rsquo;s body. However, cells also assist in reducing bleeding (just like the mammalian thrombocytes) due to tiny injuries like losing a leg - this encourages faster healing. However, losing a abdomen may be fatal to the spider.</li>
<li>The blood cells in the spider&rsquo;s haemolymph is created in the walls of your arthropods heart - her&rsquo;e you&rsquo;ll find the prohaemocytes cells.

<h2 id="how-do-spiders-accumulate-oxygen">How Do Spiders Accumulate Oxygen?</h2>
<p>Spiders lack the sponge-type lungs but have 1 or 2 book lung pairs for
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00360-016-0962-8">respiration</a>
that look like the fish gills. The book lung allow easy exchange of air carbon dioxide and oxygen due to its large surface area.
However., for spiders having 1 pair of the book lungs, its considered that the second one evolved into a tracheae system (fine tubes) looking like the bronchial and trachea systems in human lungs. To control the arthropods, use
spider foggers.
But these will be kept open using the chitin as opposed to cartilage in humans. However, they have 1 0r 2 spiracles (openings) that are positioned in abdomen&rsquo;s under-side between the spider&rsquo;s book lungs and spinnerets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012814043700025X">Spiders</a>
(in the Arachnida class) are feared by humans for their poisonous bites. However, most spiders are quite harmless - denoting their great diverse family of 38,000 known species.</p>
<p>Arachnids that closely resemble spiders include mites, ticks, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion">scorpions</a>
. We know that
spiders don&rsquo;t &ldquo;sleep
&ldquo;,
have no bones
, plus have a
long tubular and masculine heart
. But, do spiders have lungs?
<strong>The short answer is, YES, spiders have either 1 or 2 pairs of book lungs. The arachnids breathe through their book lungs or trachea - these are the very narrow tubes laid all through the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s body.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-lungs">Details: Do Spiders Have Lungs??</h2>
<p>Spiders have either 1 or 2 &ldquo;book lungs&rdquo; pairs for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_organ">respiration</a>
. These kind of lungs look like
book pages as they have
hollow,
soft, and
thin plates that flap to the air via small openings on abdomen of spider.
The spider&rsquo;s blood (the
Hemolymph
) pass across the lung plate&rsquo;s
inner surface to allow exchange of
oxygen with
carbon dioxide between the spider and its
atmosphere.
The spider&rsquo;s book lungs offers the
big surface area to allow appropriate
gas exchange. Some
tarantulas have surface area of the book lungs being about a
square
27.6 inches (
70 cm
).
The
opening slips in the book lungs tend to
contract and expand but won&rsquo;t close completely. However, during intense spider activity, the slits on the
book lung will open fully.</p>
<h2 id="how-book-lungs-promote-spiders-respiration">How Book Lungs Promote Spider&rsquo;s Respiration</h2>
<p>The book lungs are located in the open-ventral abdominal atrium (the air-filled cavity) and is linked to the environment via the small slits on the side of the abdomen.
The spider&rsquo;s book lung plates - in their unfolded form - contain hemolymph. The folds work to increase the surface area of the lungs and the air it&rsquo;ll contact - allowing better gas exchanged. But most spider species won&rsquo;t require movement of plates to allow effective respiration.
However, some spiders may lack the book lungs but still undertake gaseous exchange through the thin walls in the abdominal cavity and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate_trachea">tracheae tubes</a>
.
Definitely, the spider&rsquo;s trachea seems to have developed from its book lungs since it has super elongated chambers. Thus, other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnid">arachnids</a>
like harvestmen (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiliones">Opiliones</a>
) amd
mites
will do gassoue exchange via tracheae or even just the body surfaces.
Arachnids without book lungs are called apulmonate arachnids and they include
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifugae">sun spiders</a>
,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricinulei">Ricinulei</a>
,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscorpion">pseudoscorpions</a>
, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwhip_scorpion">microwhip scorpions</a>
.
However, those Arachnids with book lungs are called pulmonate arachnids - which include the

was the oldest that recovered in Scotland -
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynie_chert">Rhynie chert</a>
. Further, the

lungs look almost like the book lungs of the spiders / arachnids.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-book-gills-and-respiration">Spiders Book gills and Respiration</h2>
<p>For the
<a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Invertebrates/Horseshoe-Crab">horseshoe crabs</a>
(in males and females), you&rsquo;ll notice book gills similar to what is in spiders. Researchers opine that book lungs developed from the
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467803915000353">book gills</a></p>
<ul>
<li>but you&rsquo;ll find these externally.
The genital operculum is the front flap� but it has no gills. Notably, the flap-like book gills seem to have developmned from legs and they allow respiration when the animal is under water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-spiders-breathe-underwater">How Do Spiders Breathe Underwater?</h2>
<p>Some spiders like Scuba spider use their web like gills to breather when they&rsquo;re under water. Others like the Argyroneta aquatica will breathe via fine�abdomenal hairs to bubbles floating on the water surface.
Some diving-bell spider use their web like a gill for breathing - particularly when they get under water. For example,
<a href="http://www.activetouch.de/index.php?id=38">Stefan Hetz</a>
and
<a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/roger.seymour">Roger Seymour</a>
conducted a study using 12 spiders to note that the spiders used their web like their gill when they&rsquo;re under water.
The web is silk like and will enable oxygen to move from the environment near the ware and get to the spider while also allowing carbon dioxide to get back to the environment.
Seymour reported that the diving-bell spiders could survive for over 24 hours under water. Therefore, these arachnids will easily hide from their prey and predators.</p>
<h2 id="how-sea-spiders-breathe-without-gills-orlungs">How Sea Spiders Breathe Without� Gills or�Lungs</h2>
<p>Many strange creatures exist in the cold Antarctic depths  particularly under the Antarctic ice. Giant sea spiders are the strangest of them all. Definitely, the Antarctic spider species will grow very big while the normal sea spiders are usually small in size.
In addition, these Antarctic spiders have even more strange internal organs. For example, youll find a section of their guts and even all their genitals in their legs. Further, they have a very weak
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-hearts/">heart</a>
and thus it cant pump its blood (hemolymph) in its body.
Therefore, the spiders will only pump the hemolymph via their guts movement as opposed to just relying on their heart for pumping the blood. Definitely, there are additional queries on these spiders but on how the undertake gaseous exchange is a critical issue.
While at it, lobsters, crabs and fish use gills for gaseous exchanges. In this, water will flow over the gills to absorb the available oxygen. However, worms on land or at sea will generally absorb the oxygen via their skin.
However, for sea spiders  they lack lungs or gills while their skin is just
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-bones/">the exoskeleton  but no internal bones</a>
which is thick to allow oxygen absorption. �However, the sea spiders have many pores what they use for respiration.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some spiders even exhibit ballooning behavior - but do spiders have wings? Spiders use the earths electric field as a guide
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/trapdoor-spiders-australia-africa">for flying across oceans</a>
on long strands of silk  without wings!
<em><strong>Well, what about winged spiders? Do these exist? No, not really. There are no known species of <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> with fully developed wings capable of powered flight in any way comparable to that of insects or birds.�</strong></em>
<em><strong>However there is one genus (Palystes) whose females possess wing-like projections called apomoses which cover their reproductive organs and sometimes also extend beyond them. These structures serve only as protective covers and are not used for flight.�</strong></em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spider Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-wings">Details: Do Spiders Have Wings?</h2>
<p>Most insects have wings, but spiders dont. There are winged species of jumping spider (Salticidae) but these do not have wings in any way comparable to that of insects or birds and so they can&rsquo;t fly either.
The jumping spiders&rsquo; wings are actually a very thin layer of chitin, which is the substance that covers their exoskeleton.
The spider&rsquo;s thorax and head comprise what would be called the cephalothorax in other arthropods (such as crustaceans) and thus wings can&rsquo;t be incorporated into the body plan
Some spiders, called &ldquo;ballooners,&rdquo; use the earth&rsquo;s electric field as it would a compass to lift their bodies into the air on long strands of silk - but they&rsquo;re often attracted by light sources which can cause them to fly into flower-like structures or be trapped in clothing!
The spider can then use this silk to trap particles in the surrounding atmosphere for it to float on. This is a form of transportation known as &ldquo;ballooning.&rdquo;

<h2 id="do-spiders-glide">Do spiders glide?</h2>
<p>Spiders like arboreal tarantulas are excellent jumping�- known to glide from tree to tree - and they might grow glider wings over million�of years.
Also,
<em>Selenops change their whole</em>
body into some airfoil and they&rsquo;ll glide for a long time.
Gliding is a great way for spiders (and other arthropods) to escape from predators, and it&rsquo;s also a good means of transportation if they need go long distances!
Some spiders can even use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">changes in wind currents</a>
or tree branches like stepping stones across gaps too wide for jumping.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4oMFOoK50">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4oMFOoK50</a></p>
<h3 id="how-spider-silk-help-in-flight">How Spider Silk help in flight?</h3>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s silk is the strongest known natural material. It&rsquo;s stronger in some ways than steel and Kevlar, yet it&rsquo;s light as a feather!
Spiders can make silk straight from liquid to solid by spinning out of their mouths or rear ends. The spider makes its own glue when needed, just like you might use Elmers glue from a jar.
Spider silk is made mostly of protein. The spider spins the silk using tiny spigots on its abdomen called spinnerets. Through ballooning, a spider will use the silk�to make voyage cross-ocean journeys!
A few spiders have been found that live in the snowy mountains of Alaska.
Its not surprising they are able to survive so far north, because some species balloon as high as 15 miles into the atmosphere with just their silk and then float back down on air currents.

<h3 id="why-wont-spiders-fly">Why Won&rsquo;t Spiders Fly?</h3>
<p>Spiders�show varied behaviors�and lifestyles compared to other insects. For example, while many insects can use their wings to fly and some spiders do ballooning behavior.
A spiders body is covered in tiny hairs called setae that are too small for the human eye to see. These setae help them sense when they touch something or even if a potential predator has touched or grabbed them!
Some spiders are active during the day and others at night. Some can live on trees, some in sand dunes, or even high up near mountain peaks where it is cold enough to snow!

<h3 id="what-if-spiders-had-wings">What If Spiders Had Wings?</h3>
<p>If spiders had wings, they could fly from one place to another. Unlike other insects that can only use their wings for limited periods of time, a spiders setae would allow it to stay in the air all day long!
If�the spiders could fly, they would be able to find mates much more easily. They could also escape from predators!
But humans would be able to find them much more easily around the house and spaces, so it would not be as safe (they&rsquo;d be nightmare bugs).
The spiders would feed on many pests - comparable to bats, but wouldn&rsquo;t be able to clean up the mess like bats.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do Spiders Have Wings? Well, they don&rsquo;t have wings, b
ut can spiders fly? Yes! Some spiders use the earth&rsquo;s electric field as it would a compass to lift their bodies into the air on long strands of silk - this is called ballooning.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Spiders Pee? Animals, unlike plants, must all &ldquo;urinate&rdquo; despite undertaking the process in different ways. Urinating allow removal of unwanted salts, nitrogen, and also maintain water balance in their bodies.</p>
<p>In humans, the urination process starts in the kidney while the bladder stores the urine (nitrogenous urea waste plus water) in liquid form before its ejected.
**So, do spiders pee? The short answer is, NO, spiders don&rsquo;t urinate like humans. But spiders poop-pee uric acid (from malpighian tubules akin to kidneys) that is semi-solid and won&rsquo;t dissolve in water. **
<strong>Simply, spiders won&rsquo;t deposit urine and feces separately like humans. Spiders release the waste in a combined form (feces plus urine) through the anus.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-pee-urinate-7-spider-faqs">Details: Do Spiders Pee? Urinate? 7 Spider FAQs</h2>
<p>Spiders have malpighian tubules (comparable to mammalian kidneys) that&rsquo;ll remove the nitrogenous waste in form of uric acid. The malpighian tubules will drain into the stercoral pocket (a pouch in its digestive tract).
However, unlike human urine, the uric acid is near-solid and won&rsquo;t dissolve in water. Spiders pee-poop that&rsquo;s semi-solid help them avoid losing water through their urine.
In the stercoral pocket, the uric acid is mixed with solid waste coming from the spiders digestive tract to form the semi-solid poop-pee that come out combined through the anus.</p>
<h2 id="conserves-water-with-uric-acid">Conserves Water with Uric Acid</h2>
<p>Insects and spiders will change their nitrogenous waste into uric acid - which is an insoluble and contains minimal water - as a water conservation method for the spider.
Comparatively, flying insects and birds produce dry &lsquo;urine&rsquo;that has uric acid since they avoiding a bladder with water helps them cut their weight.

<h2 id="do-spiders-drink-water">Do Spiders Drink Water?</h2>
<p>Simple answer is, YES, spiders drink water. While in the wild environment, the spiders will drink from droplets on the ground of vegetation. Further, they can drink from evening or morning dew that&rsquo;s hanging on the spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>However, for the caged spiders, you should offer them fresh water using objects like small dish, damp sponge or bottle cap including for the tarantulas species. The Tarantulas will also drink the droplets of water gathered on foliage or leaves around them.
Despite that spiders do drink water must not make you think that the arachnids live in drains. For a spider that&rsquo;s inside the house, the best water sources is water droplets from shower or tap , sink edges, or plugholes.
Definitely,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spiders can&rsquo;t drown</a>
but may remain trapped in the bath or sink due to being too steep or slippery. The whistling spider species creates a silk layer for their long burrow to ensure it remains humid and hydrated.
Raindrops dew can also provide a water sources for some spider species. Garden spider, wolf spider and wolf spider tend to get water from drinking the morning dew. They&rsquo;ll take the water from dew via mound (silk-covered) at the door of their hideout.
Some spider species also drink nectar from the garden plants particularly when there are limited water sources such as rain, dew or tap water. Spider species like the whip spider use their pincers to suck water from sources like dew or nectar flowers.</p>
<h2 id="some-spiders-dont-drink-water">Some Spiders Don&rsquo;t Drink Water</h2>
<p>The red back and black widow (
while they&rsquo;re not all venomous
), interestingly, don&rsquo;t drink water like humans or other spiders. These spiders get most of their required body fluids from sucking their prey.
These are comparable to mammals such as the koalathat don&rsquo;t drink water but derive their fluids from eating eucalyptus (smooth-barked) among other plan leaves.

<p>As noted above, spider&rsquo;s
poop and pee is mixed together</p>
<ul>
<li>through their malpighian tubules to eliminate the nitrogenous waste. So, its fact that spiders don&rsquo;t generate urine but will have the near-solid uric acid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spiders lack a clearly defined urinary tract comparable to that in mammals. Check this
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-spiders-defecate-urinate-and-is-it-harmful-to-humans">amazing answer</a>
on whether spiders pee or poop. You can use
spider spray to control the arachnids
that are unwanted indoors.
The spider&rsquo;s pee-poop is small light brown, cream, or white colored that will appear like round drops. On size, these droppings measure around 1/16 - 1/8 an inch in diameter. Further, the spider&rsquo;s poop mainly contains guanine - just like in the DNA.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us fear spiders (unless it&rsquo;s a pet <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>) because
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">their spider bites are largely poisonous</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if any homeowner sees some insect poop around the house, they worry that they could have spiders around.
<strong>But, do spiders poop? Yes, after feeding and digestion happen, spiders will poop to release their body&rsquo;s waste. The spider poop will be the size of a pinhead (thick liquid) and they have a gray, black, brown, or white color.�</strong></li>
<li>After drying, the spider poop may stain the surface, the floor, and the walls.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-poop-spider-droppings-and-feces">Do Spiders Poop? Spider Droppings and Feces</h2>
<p>As summarized above, spiders will poop� (just like other animals) after eating their popular food; which is the tiny insects. The poop they release is simply body waste.</p>
<ul>
<li>But spiders feed on tiny insects and they don&rsquo;t poop as often as large animals like mammals - which means that you might not catch the spiders in action releasing their body waste.
The metabolic rate of spiders (like the
tarantula
) is quite slow and thus they&rsquo;re able to feed on the tiny insects but will defecate a few times in a given time.</li>
<li>Some of these spider species may feed just once a month and thus with a slow metabolic rate, they&rsquo;ll require less eating and thus lesser pooping.
On structure and size, spider poop is comparable to bird poop - but on color, it&rsquo;s white (when wet) but will turn to light-brown or cream after drying.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-the-shape-size-and-color-of-spider-poop">What&rsquo;s the Shape, Size, and Color of Spider Poop?</h2>
<p>As noted above, spider poop will look something close to the shape, size, and color of the bird&rsquo;s poop - but smaller in size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiders&rsquo; poop will have black stains but whitish in color when it&rsquo;s wet - white liquid.
The spider poop stains are anything around 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch in their diameter. However, once dried, the spider poop will turn black, light brown, or grey.</li>
<li>However, the shape, size, and color of the spider poop will be different depending on the spider species.
For context, some spider species that are large-sized such as the tarantula produce poop that is large - the poop is also less viscous but very water - and hence it tends to dry faster.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="locations-to-check-forspider-poop">Locations to check for<strong>Spider Poop�</strong></h2>
<p>So, which exact locations will you find the spider poop around the house or in the yard?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, note that you&rsquo;ll mainly find the spider poop around the areas that the spiders will frequent.
Notably, the spiders will make their webs and poop around places that have less traffic such as the corners of the garage, ceiling, under the sink, cabinets, garage, and house.</li>
<li>You can also find the spider pop on surfaces such as skirting boards, windowsills, floors, and walls.
The Tarantulas poop will mainly be dropped on walls and glass in their boxed enclosure.</li>
<li>However, the arboreal tarantulas will love to drop their waste in places such as an enclosure door�while other species like the water bowls.
Because these places have less traffic, the spider will settle in the locations so that their insect traps won&rsquo;t be disturbed. Thus, you&rsquo;re likely to get more spider poop here.
Spider poop is largely liquid and viscous in nature since it&rsquo;s made up of spider poop mixed with its pee - which is actually uric acid.</li>
<li>However, spider webs will be created from silk - which is largely protein-based and produced from the silk glands of the spider.
Compared to the spider poo that&rsquo;s mainly undigested food materials that are released from the spider&rsquo;s anus, spider silk is released from the spinnerets that are also around the insect&rsquo;s anus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-times-willspiders-poop">How Many Times Will<strong>Spiders Poop?�</strong></h2>
<p>Spiders have different rates and times of releasing their poop depending on the species. Some species that can show the difference in pooping are the jumping spider and the tarantula.</p>
<ul>
<li>As outlined, spiders with slow metabolism rates will definitely excrete less often and thus you&rsquo;ll find less spider poop in their hiding areas.
For example, there are spider species that&rsquo;ll poop once a day or even in a month - this may vary with the spider&rsquo;s health, their living conditions, and availability of small insects for their food.</li>
<li>Another fun fact is that spider may use their poop to keep off their predators - mainly because the spider poop has a pungent smell that wades off other animals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-safe-is-spider-poop-toxic">How Safe is Spider Poop? Toxic?</h2>
<p>Bites from some common spiders tend to be venomous mainly due to the antimicrobials in their blood and venom but are spider poop toxic? Well, simply stated spider poop is never toxic.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, most animal droppings could be dangerous as they may carry parasites, viruses, and bacteria but<a href="https://www.illinoispoisoncenter.org/my-child-ate-poop">spider poop is classified as less toxic</a>.
But it has
<a href="https://www.pctonline.com/article/pct1013-spider-poop/">been reported that</a>
poop from the Black Widow may bring pathogenic bacteria if it is eaten by flies.</li>
<li>Despite that spider ear insects like flies, most of their poop is non-toxic.</li>
<li>Otherwise, they would transmit pathogens such as Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, or Salmonella spp.
Notably, the antimicrobial cap[abilities that are normally in the venom of a spider are often removed by the poop&rsquo;s bacterias.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-or-remove-the-spider-poop"><strong>How to Clean or Remove the Spider Poop�</strong></h2>
<p>To clean the spider droppings, you&rsquo;ll require just some paper towel, cloth, and some water.</p>
<ul>
<li>But it&rsquo;s best you clean the spider poop very soon because delay may make it leave some yellow stain on the fabric.
But if the spider poop leaves a prominent yellow stain, you can remove it with some aggressive stain cleaners or removers.</li>
<li>The poop from tarantulas spiders could be challenging to clean largely because their droppings may be cluttered.
I suggest you use some long tweezers or tongs to hold the clothe or wet tissue that has been dipped into some water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Further, the spider poop will also be dropped tother with a bolus - I can describe this as the web and part of the flesh of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/">tiny insects like bed bugs</a>
that the spider ate.</p>

go into non-action up-to 6 months without a meal (by reducing energy use). But the spider will spring into action when a prey appears.</p>
<p><strong>But do spiders sleep? Spiders don&rsquo;t sleep like humans but have circadian rhythms - rest &amp; activity cycles. Spiders lack eyelids and don&rsquo;t close their eyes like humans.�</strong>
<strong>During the resting phase, spiders conserve energy during the day and cold areas by lowering the metabolic rate and cutting their activity - how spiders hibernate during winter. But spiders are more highly active at night so as to avoid predators such as birds at day time.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-do-spiders-sleep"><strong>How Do Spiders Sleep?</strong></h2>
<p>In hibernation mode, the arachnids will lower their metabolic rates while also tucking in their legs. Most
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=oJxVDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP6&amp;dq=do+Spiders+Sleep&amp;ots=0sDheMGg5e&amp;sig=BlRRfLwk_a-nKhGyTSZ31hwIiJU">spider species</a>
will be active mainly at night. In addition, these arachnids will hibernate during the cold season.
Do spiders sleep?�To a curious mind, it would make sense that a creature with 8 eyes would need to sleep from time to time. However, do spiders sleep? The answer to this is fascinating and shrouded in mystery as demonstrated below
The fact that spiders do not have eyelids suggests that spiders rest, just not in the way we do but in their own unique way. Spiders have daily cycles of rest and activity. They cant shut their eyelids but their body reduces activity levels and lowers their metabolic rate to conserve energy.</p>
<h2 id="science-behind-sleep-hibernation-in-spiders">Science behind Sleep (Hibernation) in Spiders</h2>
<p>There is scanty research on the science behind animal sleep. However, studies suggest that animals have a cardiac rhythm which is determined by the time of day. Animals are either nocturnal (active at night) or diurnal (active during day time).
During their inactive phase, the creatures tend to burrow and experience a drop in their metabolic activity rate. During cold seasons, spiders curl their legs and reduce their metabolic rate even as they stay huddled together in cocoons during the coldest months of the year.</p>
<h2 id="do-spiders-crawl-in-mouth-while-sleeping">Do Spiders Crawl in Mouth While Sleeping?</h2>
<p>The fact that spiders are capable of such hibernation means that they can do so in short bursts on a day to day basis to give the impression of sleep. As the spider encounters a period of low food availability and harsh climatic conditions, they enter hibernation mode to conserve energy.
When the spiders are resting,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-brains/">their brains</a>
will be working round the clock. For example, they&rsquo;ll feel even the smallest vibration with their great tactile sense. In addition, they&rsquo;ll react in case of danger of when one of their prey gets stuck on their web.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-species---differences-in-sleeping">Spiders Species - Differences in sleeping?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s brain is a little different from the human brain. Therefore, the arachnids won&rsquo;t get bored in their &ldquo;rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; mode. But some spiders may take naps at night.
But hunting spiders posses more powerful eyesight compared to those that build webs. for example, wolf spiders will attack and chase their prey.
Crab spiders will just sit around waiting to ambush their prey on the leaf and flower.�In addition, jumping spiders will use their great
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-ears/">hearing capability</a>
, intelligent and eyesight.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-of-the-arachnids">Lifestyle of the Arachnids</h2>
<p>Different spiders will &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; in their webs but some won&rsquo;t require the web traps against their prey. For example, the trapdoors build their tunnels and install doors (with hinges).
There are over 1000 spider species globally. For example, jumping spiders are computed to be about 5000 - which is roughly 13 % of all species of spiders.
The Salticidae family - particularly jumping spiders don&rsquo;t also create spider webs but will spin tether ropes if they&rsquo;re jumping. So, spiders will be quite at rest waiting for a suitable prey or while conserving energy.</p>
<h2 id="arachnidssnoring-andbody-language">Arachnids&rsquo;�Snoring and�Body Language</h2>
<p>In hibernation mode, the arachnids will lower their metabolic rates while also tucking in their legs. Therefore, the spiders will live longer with no food as they won&rsquo;t be burning calories - particularly at night and during the cold weather.
However, whenever you see a spider that has taken an odd position such as legs tucked plus lying on its back - it could be dead.�What about snoring in spiders? Well, spiders won&rsquo;t snore like human beings.
In fact, these insect will be hiding in wall crack among other protected areas. Further, for survival these arachnids will sleep, nest, and hunt out of predator&rsquo;s harm.

<p>Some factors like cold temperatures or circadian rhythms may make the spiders such as Agelenopsis aperta may pass out or remain unconscious - you might in fact think that the insects is dead.
In addition, some drugs like marijuana, caffeine, or chloral hydrate may make the spiders to pass out or it&rsquo;ll negatively affect the insect&rsquo;s web-making capability.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders, those unwelcome houseguests! They often seek refuge indoors during colder months, especially in our cozy heated homes. When we spot them, we scramble to find ways to
eliminate them
, like considering <a href="/posts/does-bleach-kill-bed-bugs/">bleach</a> (Sodium Hypochlorite).
<strong>But does bleach  really work against spiders? Indeed, highly concentrated bleach (above 11%) with its potent acidity can effectively exterminate spiders, their eggs, and even other pests like flies when generously applied.�</strong>
However, it&rsquo;s important to be aware that bleach is not environmentally friendly due to its high toxicity. When using it indoors, protective gear is essential. Additionally, be cautious about using bleach on hardwood floors or natural materials such as wood and stone.</p>
<p>For a simpler and more efficient spider control solution, consider opting for specialized products designed to eradicate these arachnids, such as
spider bait traps
and
insect growth regulators (IGRs)
.</p>
<h2 id="is-bleach-effective-against-spiders"><strong>Is Bleach Effective Against Spiders?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="a-bleach"><strong>a. Bleach&rsquo;s Acidic Power</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, high-concentration bleach is effective against spiders and other arachnids and insects. Its acidity disrupts spider cell activity, leading to their demise.</p>
<p>You can also use bleach to remove webs and create a barrier outside your home to keep spiders away. For targeted applications, a bleach spray with a sprayer works best.

<h2 id="how-to-use-bleach-to-get-rid-of-spiders-at-home"><strong>How to Use Bleach to Get Rid of Spiders at Home</strong></h2>
<p>With nearly 40,000 spider species out there, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to find them in your bathroom. Luckily, you can use bleach to eliminate them due to its acetic acid properties. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need:
<strong>Materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum or broom</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Bleach</li>
<li>Spray bottle</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-mix-bleach-and-water"><strong>Step 1: Mix Bleach and Water</strong></h3>
<p>Mix bleach and water in a 1:3 ratio or use equal amounts if needed. Pour this mixture into your spray bottle and shake it well.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-spray-the-spiders"><strong>Step 2: Spray the Spiders</strong></h3>
<p>Spray the bleach solution directly on the spiders from a distance of 5 to 10 inches, ensuring you cover them adequately based on their size. Also, target the areas where you suspect spiders are hiding, along with their webs. Don&rsquo;t forget to clean up afterward to remove dead spiders and their eggs.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-clean-up"><strong>Step 3: Clean Up</strong></h3>
<p>Clean the treated areas to remove dead spiders and wipe off any bleach residue from various surfaces, including
clogged drains
.</p>
<p>Be cautious not to use bleach on surfaces that could react negatively with it, such as carpets, fabrics, and sofas. Wear protective gloves to avoid contact with your skin and eyes.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-vacuum"><strong>Step 4: Vacuum</strong></h3>
<p>Vacuum the floors and surfaces to remove any remaining spiders and bleach residue. Follow up with sweeping and dispose of the dead spiders in the trash. Clean any surfaces that came into contact with the bleach mixture thoroughly. Be mindful not to inhale chlorine fumes or let the mixture come into contact with your skin or eyes.</p>
<h2 id="will-bleach-kill-spider-eggs"><strong>Will Bleach Kill Spider Eggs?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, bleach is effective in killing not only spiders but also their eggs. The bleach mixture, when applied with a spray bottle, can kill young spiders and their eggs. The acidic nature of bleach ruptures the outer layer of the eggs and the exoskeletons of young spiders, effectively eliminating them.
<strong>Important Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure you spray the bleach solution on spider-prone areas in your home.</li>
<li>Watch out for hidden spider egg sacs, especially in places like old plant stems, and make sure to treat them with bleach as well.</li>
<li>Seal airtight containers holding food items before using bleach to prevent fumes from contaminating them.
By following these steps and precautions, you can effectively use bleach to deal with spiders and their eggs in your home.</li>

<h3 id="1-how-quickly-does-bleach-kill-spiders">1. How quickly does bleach kill spiders?</h3>
<p>Bleach takes 10 minutes to 2 hours to kill spiders, depending on their size and bleach concentration. Smaller spiders may die in minutes, while larger ones require more time. Increasing bleach concentration can speed up the process.</p>
<h3 id="2-will-bleach-eliminate-brown-recluse-spiders">2. Will bleach eliminate brown recluse spiders?</h3>
<p>Bleach can kill brown recluse spiders due to its acidity. However, it&rsquo;s not a recommended insecticide because it can harm surfaces and humans. For effective brown recluse spider control, consider using contact aerosols or chemical treatments like Zenprox or spider foggers.</p>
<h3 id="3-does-bleach-work-against-black-widow-and-wolf-spiders">3. Does bleach work against Black Widow and Wolf Spiders?</h3>
<p>Bleach can kill Black Widow and Wolf Spiders, but it&rsquo;s not the fastest method. Black Widows are dangerous, so professional extermination is advised. Wolf Spiders, being larger, may take more time to succumb to bleach.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, bleach can indeed be an effective means of controlling spiders and eliminating their eggs, thanks to its potent acidity that disrupts spider cell activity and can suffocate these arachnids.</p>
<p>The chlorine fumes in bleach also poison spiders, making it a viable option for spider control. However, it&rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution when using bleach, considering its high toxicity and potential harm to the environment. Protective gear is essential, and bleach should not be applied to surfaces that could react negatively with it.</p>
<p>For a simpler and more environmentally friendly spider control solution, specialized products like spider bait traps and insect growth regulators (IGRs) are recommended. These alternatives can effectively target spiders without the risks associated with bleach.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windex">Windex</a>
is a degreaser for hard-to-clean surfaces like fans and hoods. But, does Windex kill spiders and their eggs?
<strong>Well, here&rsquo;s my experience!�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recently, I glanced over in your son&rsquo;s room to see a<strong>venomous spider</strong>crawling down the wall. All I found near to kill the Windex degreaser. I sprayed it.</li>
<li>The spider drooped over and died. End of story? Nope! I promptly took on a search about Windex versus spiders.
<strong>So, is</strong>
<strong>Windex deadly enough to kill spiders? Yes! Spray enough Windex on a spider and it&rsquo;ll die fairly quickly. Windex has lethal ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) &amp;�</strong>
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CN100423640C/en"><strong>sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate</strong></a>
** thatll block the spiders book lungs, block its breathing to suffocate it.�**

</ul>
<h2 id="does-windex-kill-spiders-and-their-eggs">Does Windex Kill Spiders and their Eggs?</h2>
<p>This article will discuss the effectiveness of Windex to exterminate spiders &amp; its pros and cons as an
insecticide
.
<strong>Let&rsquo;s dive right in.�</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-surfactants-ammonium-hydroxide--sodium-dodecylbenzene-sulfonate">1. Surfactants: Ammonium Hydroxide &amp; Sodium Dodecylbenzene Sulfonate</h3>
<p>The ammonia and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate in Windex is deadly to spiders; they work collectively to kill the spider on contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use it as a spray, but make sure the spider is directly hit with the chemical, or else they&rsquo;ll flee into their webs after being sprayed</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s more effective to pour Windex on them since they get stuck in the liquid, but this will also kill any eggs that may be nearby
The Sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate accumulates and clings on the spiders air sacs, blocking the path of air into its respiratory system. Ammonium hydroxide is absorbed into the spiders bloodstream causing respiratory failure.</li>
<li>Therefore, oxygen is not absorbed by the blood in the spider&rsquo;s book lungs. Oxygen will get absorbed by ammonia instead of red blood cells. This means that when the bugs inhale Windex, it will suffocate (die) because there is no oxygen left for them to breathe.
Also, Ammonium (ammonia dissolved in water) is also a repellant for

. Windex will release unpleasant gas that protects your house from these bugs. Windex is safe to use on surfaces, but you should not be in the room while it is being used.
However, when you use it to control kill stinging insects like bees, be careful because you may get stung before exterminating the insect.

<h3 id="2-water-in-windex-drowns-spiders">2. Water in Windex Drowns Spiders</h3>
<p>The water in the Windex degreaser will drown insects including spiders and their eggs.
The Windex will lower the oxygen level in a spiders web and so it suffocates spiders by depriving them of air.
Water, with its higher surface tension, will also break the spiders web and force them to relocate.
Windex can kill spider mites with its liquid form, but it will not be as effective against other household pests such as ants or fruit flies because of their tiny size.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-time-does-windex-take-to-kill-spiders">How long (time) Does Windex Take to kill Spiders?</h2>
<p>Windex kills spiders on contact. It will take 1 to 15 minutes (maximum) to kill the spider when it is sprayed in a room and inhaled by a spider.
Windex will kill spiders based on the following factors:</p>
<h3 id="1-windex"><strong>1. Windex&rsquo;s Ammonia Concentration</strong></h3>
<p>Spiders react differently when exposed to ammonia gas in Windex (varied
concentration of ammonia
. If the concentration is high, it will kill them faster. But, if it is lower, it will take a little longer for them to die.
The size and age of the spider will also affect how long it takes to kill it. The older they are, the more time Windex needs to take effect on them.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, household Windex usually contains a small concentration�of ammonia<a href="https://www.immaculatejanitorialservices.com/2012/03/windex-not-just-for-cleaning-glass/">0.05 to 0.1 (5% - 10%)</a>, which will kill baby spiders and eggs - this may not kill large spiders instantly on contact.
The concentration of ammonia in Windex can be increased by adding more or less water to it. This will speed up the process, but increase cost and housekeeping time.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-area-sprayed-sq-feet">**2. Area Sprayed (**sq. feet)</h3>
<p>It takes more than one can/bottle of Windex to cover a large area of the spiders(more than 200sq feet) and kill or exterminate the spiders and their eggs.
Make sure the floors are sufficiently saturated with the ammonia in Windex before moving on to another area; otherwise, you will leave some spiders alive and well.
The ammonia in Windex does not cause any long-term damage to your floors. You can use it again and again without worry about damaging the surface.
Windex is perfect for killing house flies on hard surfaces such as counters or tables with a minimum amount of cleaning needed afterward.</p>
<h3 id="3-closed-or-open-space-">**3. Closed or Open Space? **</h3>
<p>Windex spray kills spiders faster in enclosed rooms than it does in open spaces or fields.
*Why does Windex kill spiders faster in enclosed rooms than it does in open spaces? *
Well, Windex sprayed in small, enclosed areas of a house or compound is more effective than spraying it around an entirely open space. It concentrates ammonia gas in a smaller space and the spider will die from suffocation instead of contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>To kill spiders, use Windex spray and direct it to the spider&rsquo;s hideouts in your house. Spiders hide in holes, cracks, and closets.
If the area is open or out in the field, it will be harder to kill bugs because the winds will blow off the Windex spray and thus kill fewer spiders.
If you&rsquo;re spraying indoors be sure not to miss any corners and to get any cracks or crevices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-windex-to-kill-spiders">How to Use Windex to Kill Spiders</h2>
<p>Windex is a product that you spray onto surfaces to clean them. You will need to follow these steps when using it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you use Windex, wear goggles and a nose mask to protect your eye and respiratory system respectively. Ammonium can make your eyes hurt or give you a headache. You might even have trouble breathing.</li>
<li>Spiders like to make their homes in holes, cracks, furniture, garages, rocks, and cobwebs. You can find the hiding spaces without disturbing the bugs.</li>
<li>If you are going to use Windex in your house, lock all the windows and doors.
Now, remove the top protection seal of the Windex bottle.</li>
<li>Shake the bottle well to release all of the liquid and separate any clumps that may have formed while it was sitting on a shelf.</li>
<li>Point the Windex&rsquo;s nozzle on the spider&rsquo;s hiding place. Then press the trigger to start spraying.</li>
<li>Spray the spider infestation and then leave before they attack.
Next, you will also need to spray other places within the room (to saturation) to boost Windex&rsquo;s killing power.</li>
<li>Lock the room for 30 to 60 minutes so Windex works well.</li>
<li>After the prescribed time, open the windows and doors to allow fresh air in for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Windex is for outside use only. If you are using Windex in an open area, cover the spider&rsquo;s hiding places with a bucket so they cannot escape before dying. You will also want to use Windex with a higher concentration.
NB: Windex is great to kill spiders in an indoor space. If you have a spider infestation that takes a while to die, I recommend that you use another type of spider killer or trap.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="which-windex-does-not-have-ammonia">Which Windex Does not Have ammonia?</h2>
<p>Windex, a glass degreaser is made from surfactants, solvents, ammonia, dyes, and fragrances.
Thus, ingesting Windex may cause vomiting, stomach upset, and minor throat and mouth irritation.
These Windex products are ammonia-free;</p>

<li>Outdoor Sprayer</li>
<li>Multi-Surface Cleaner Lavender</li>
<li>Disinfectant Cleaner Multi-Surface</li>
<li>Vinegar Glass Cleaner</li>
<li>Ammonia-Free Glass Cleaner
However, for spider and insect control, we recommend using a Windex version that has ammonia.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-windex-kill-insects">Can Windex Kill Insects?</h2>
<p>Windex can kill other insects, such as spiders, bumblebees, wasps, ants, spider mites, and beetles. Spray them if they are near the colony and they will be dead in seconds.
Windex is quick-acting when you need to kill small insects and won&rsquo;t require special concentration packages. It is safe to use on regular household surfaces.
Windex will kill these bugs by blocking their breathing (spiracles). It does this because ammonia stays in the blood cells within hemocoel in insects&rsquo; bodies, and suffocating due to insufficient supply/circulation of oxygen.
Moreover, Windex (the ammonium component) will make these insects go away. The smell of ammonia makes them leave.</p>
<h2 id="is-windex-poisonous-to-humans-and-pets">Is Windex Poisonous to Humans and Pets?</h2>
<p>Windex contains chemicals that can be bad for humans and pets. The chemicals Ammonium hydroxide can hurt their skin and respiratory system. It can cause watery eyes or a burning skin sensation.
The fragrance and dye in Windex can cause problems with your respiratory systems. It also causes trouble for people who are allergic to it. The spray may also make your pets cough abnormally and even get choked.
Chemicals like
<a href="https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/2505-windexoriginalglasscleanerwithammoniad">Hexoxyethanol</a>
, Isopropanolamine, and Sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate can make you burn if they touch your skin or when they are breathed in. They can also cause irritation over time.
Note: When you are praying Windex, it is important to wear eye protection, gloves for your hands, and a breathing mask.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-methods-to-kill-spiders">Alternative Methods to Kill spiders?</h2>
<p>Apart from Windex, you can use the following substances or methods to kill spiders.
**1. Use of Vinegar **
Vinegar is a weak acid of pH between 4 to 8 that emits a smell that keeps off spiders in your house or compound without necessarily killing them. You will require to mix 1 cup of vinegar with 5 cups of water. Then, spray the concoction in the spiders hideouts to saturation. You will need to spray the mixture twice per day for 10 to 15 days.
You can also blend white vinegar with coconut oil in a 5:1 ratio. The coconut oil will form a thick layer on their body, blocking their respiratory system. Also, the mixture emits an unbearable smell that keeps off spiders.
You will have to spray this mixture daily for 2 to 6 weeks for the complete elimination of spiders in your home. This combination is friendly as it cause no adverse effect on the user on the application.
<strong>2. Using Black peppers.</strong>
Black peppers are a natural way of eliminating spider infestation in your home. It is a perfect solution when you need to repel spiders in your place than kill. You will need to grind several black peppers into fine pieces and sprinkle them to spider hideouts.
You can also boil (3 to 4 cups of water) the black peppers and then strain the water before spraying in spider-infested areas. Black pepper is also able to repel other insects such as spider mites and ants
<em>.�Keep of kids while spraying your house/place  the spicy peppered liquid causes itching and burning sensation</em>
.
<strong>3. Use of Diatomaceous Earth.</strong>
Diatomaceous Earth is one of the best natural ways of killing and eliminating spiders and
fleas
in your home as it occurs as a natural siliceous and soft sedimentary rock that has a killing portion in it.
You will need to grind it into fine particles before sprinkling it into spider-infested areas.
Diatomaceous Earth
acts on contact. It has sharp edges that penetrate easily, killing spiders&rsquo; entire life cycle (eggs, larvae, and adults).
On contact, the Diatomaceous Earth absorbs fat and oil from the exoskeleton (specifical cuticle) of the spiders, thus killing them by dehydration.
Moreover,
Diatomaceous Earth (for dogs)
emits a smell that repels spiders and other insects such as cockroaches and fleas in your home.
<em>NB: Wear gloves (dehydrates hand), breathing Masks (causes irritation of breathing system), and use food-grade Diatomaceous Earth for safety measures.</em>
<strong>4. Use of Essential Oils.</strong>
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-lavender-kill-bed-bugs/"><strong>Essential Oils (like lavender)</strong></a>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Spiders (Parasteatoda tepidariorum) popular as the American house spider or common house spider are classified under the
<a href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdf/IN/IN39400.pdf">Parasteatoda genus</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>House spiders mainly live in cosmopolitan areas and are described as synanthropic meaning they live near and in human dwellings.
House spiders are largely found indoors (in the house). Also, a spider and its webs will prove to be a nuisance in the house - which makes homeowners classify it as a challenging pest.</li>
<li>You mainly find house spiders in Canada and the United States but they are also in other areas worldwide.
In this article, I will outline the facts, physical appearance, and behaviors of the house spiders.
Let&rsquo;s dig in!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identification-of-the-house-spider">Identification of the House spider</h2>
<p>The house spiders will take shelter in man-made structures such as your home barns and sheds.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you noticed many cobwebs around the house, then house spiders must be this first suspect.
The spiders have a bulbous abdomen and produce uniquely-tangled webs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mc3eU6MdI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mc3eU6MdI</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-body-shape">1. Body Shape</h3>
<p>The female House spiders have an elevated (almost spherical) abdomen and they measure about 5 mm to 8 mm in length.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the male house spiders have abdomens that are elongated and their body length is about 3.7 mm to 4.8 mm.
The spider will appear grey or brown but will have some dark Chevron markings on its body.
The eggs of a house spider hatch in one week leaving it to go through different Instar development.</li>
<li>The female house spiders will go through 7 instars while the males will go through 6 instars.
The ballooning process will then take place - it involves dispersing the spiderlings from the silk threads to other habitats.
The adult house spiders can live 4 for a year or more.
These adults will be brown or yellow in color with their abdomens being Grey (dark and brown-banded legs) and having white marks.</li>
<li>Another differentiating characteristic of the house spiders is that the males and females can live together and thus mate many times.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-color">2. Color</h3>
<p>House spiders are generally around or yellowish Brown in color.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its abdomen is dirty white in color and has a number of dark stripes that meet at an angle.
First, on reproduction, a female house spider will lay roughly 250 eggs that will be wrapped in around (brownish) silken suck that is shaped like a flask.</li>
<li>In its lifetime, the house spider will produce 3700 + eggs that will be put into about 15+ silken sacs.
The house spiders are non-threatening and small in size. The bites are painful but then it will only bite for self-defense.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-legs">3. Legs</h3>
<p>Spiders have eight legs with an elongated bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the characteristic color of the house spiders is yellow-brown or brown.
However, its legs will have dark-colored rings but will still be largely brown.
The eight-legged arachnid has two body segments and lacks both an antenna and wings.
The house spider has 2 palps (pedipalps or appendages) in front of its legs.
If you have noticed some house spiders that have long legs, then outside these are the cellar spiders mainly found in the basements and cellars - damp and dark areas.</li>
<li>In fact, due to their thin and long legs, people refer to these cellar spiders as &ldquo;daddy longlegs&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Canada and the United States have about 20 species of these cellar spiders.
On comparing the common house spider with brown recluse - here&rsquo;s my take;</li>
<li>A sure way of identifying the brown recluse is with its eyes -they have six eyes as opposed to 8 most spiders.</li>
<li>The Brown recluses abdomen lacks markings that you will find in the common house spider and also they have smooth legs.
The brown recluse will also mainly occupy the warmer, darker, and quieter location where they will feed and reproduce.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-house-spider-habitats">3. House Spider Habitats</h3>
<p>House spiders generally love and hide in dark places where they can easily trap insects (such as flies and
bed bugs
) and camouflage from predators.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the outdoor spaces, the house spiders will largely hide under leaves and around windows, particularly around light sources that tend to attract insects.</li>
<li>In the indoor spaces, house spiders will mainly hide in crawl spaces, garages, basements, window frame angles, inside closets, under furniture, and in the upper corners.
Finally, in the warehouse, the house spiders will hide in corners around those that are always open.
The house spiders select the location of their webs through trial and error.</li>
<li>Therefore, the spider webs may build up very fast and also attract a lot of dust in a short time - you&rsquo;ll also see many<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-poop/">spider droppings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="controlling-the-house-spiders">Controlling The House Spiders</h2>
<p>House spiders are generally not dangerous but they make many humans fearful.</p>
<ul>
<li>So to maintain your peace at home and avoid possible venomous attacks you need</li>
<li>to control the spiders in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-spray-spider-insecticides">1. Spray Spider Insecticides</h3>
<p>Spray the house and the surrounding structures with insecticides that are formulated for spiders.
But since the spiders have long legs, it is important to ensure that the spray touches the spider&rsquo;s body directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, avoid squashing the spiders since this could lead to the fastest production of spider eggs and spiderlings will be distributed all over.
If the space under consideration has some cracks, then you should spray on them since spiders can hide inside there.</li>
<li>Since the crack space is small, then the spray chemicals will easily get into contact with the spider&rsquo;s body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-remove-possible-pest-food-sources">2. Remove Possible Pest Food Sources</h3>
<p>Spiders don&rsquo;t eat human food but other pests and insects will and so it is important to remove the foods.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the best and various insects are well fed, then the spiders will also be full and hence reproduce better.
So clean up the various scrubs and open food sources that may be lying around.
I advise that you keep all the food containers well sealed, wash the counters, and wipe all the food crumbs.
Doing such cleaner consistently we&rsquo;ll keep off the insects since they have less food - this will also reduce the spiders in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-adopt-great-pest-prevention-methods">3. Adopt Great Pest Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>The house spiders primarily feed on bugs and insects that get into the house and hence it is important to prevent their entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the entry points into your house will include screen tears, crevices, cracks, or drainages.
Some of the excellent pest prevention methods you can adopt for this include repairing the leaks or broken screens and sealing up the cracks.</li>
<li>This will limit the foods (insects and bugs) that are available for the spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-use-glue-traps">4. Use Glue Traps</h3>
<p>For areas of the house where you are sure to have spiders walking around, I advise that you set up some quality glue traps.</p>
<ul>
<li>The glue traps must be set up in places such as the basement or ceiling where there is darkness.
Spiders have great vision and they will see insects that are trapped and will attempt to catch them.</li>
<li>As the spider attempts to eat the trapped insect, it will also be trapped by the glue.
But remember to position the glue traps in quiet, and dark places like near the beds and around baseboards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-vacuum-the-house-thoroughly">5. Vacuum the house thoroughly</h3>
<p>To prevent the entry and fast reproduction of spiders, I advise that you vacuum the house thoroughly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to vacuum the hard-to-reach places such as the door frames, window frames, and baseboards.
The vacuum machine will help kill the live spiders while sucking up the egg sacs and the spider webs.</li>
<li>The vibrations, chemicals, and trauma caused by the vacuuming process will kill the spiders fast.
Male spiders have real height inside crawl spaces, basements, closets, under furniture, and in the ceiling corners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-dangerous-are-the-house-spiders">How Dangerous Are The House Spiders?</h2>
<p>House spiders aren&rsquo;t dangerous humans but will cause considerable nuisance and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">pain</a>
in case they bite - just like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/wolf-spiders/">the wolf spiders</a>
.
So these spiders won&rsquo;t cause considerable health damage to humans but they may make the house or various spaces feel unwelcoming.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spiders will trigger nervousness among the family members and sleeping off the webs will also be a demanding task.
You can do the spider control as a DIY Project but it is best you hire a professional with knowledge of the various spiders.</li>
<li>You can prevent the entry of spiders and various insects by sealing up cracks using some silicone-based caulk.
If house spiders have gained entry into the house, you should vacuum the spaces to remove the webs, egg sacs, and adult spiders.
Avoid using a broom only in the cleanup since most of the adult spiders will escape.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>House spiders may not pose a great health risk to humans (and like spiders such as the
black widow spiders
) but they are bites are painful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, their presence may cause nervousness among family members.
So it is important that you adopt effective prevention and control of the house spiders.</li>
<li>Prevention will involve filling up cracks that may allow spiders and insects to get into your spaces.</li>
<li>You can control the house spiders byusing spider bombs, spider sprays, and vacuuming.
Cheers!</li>

<p>Spiders seem to pop up everywhere when you least expect them and then they make a silk trail on your shoe, your coffee table, or the kitchen counter.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if you find that spiders are becoming too much of a problem in your home, then I would advise getting an experienced spider exterminator.
<strong>Most of us fear spiders and know little about them</strong>
Most spiders in homes (
<a href="http://agrilifecdn.tamu.edu/elementaryinsects/files/2011/10/TEACHERS-BOOKLET_1.pdf">among the 35000 species</a>
) do not hurt humans. But there are some that can make people sick and give them
painful bites
.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides being painful, the spider bites from

or
<a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/spiders/black_widow_spider.htm"><strong>black widow</strong></a>
may cause reactions such as nausea, fever, persistent itching, and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t feel confident handling spiders on your own or you lack the necessary knowledge, seeking professional help is best.</p>
<ul>
<li>A pest control company or exterminator can help you understand the best ways to<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-spiders/">get rid of spiders</a>.</li>
<li>The spider exterminators will know the habits, diet, and behavior of most spider species.
The professionals will know what types of pesticides work against spider infestations and they&rsquo;ll be able to take care of your problem quickly, safely, and efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-hire-a-professional-spider-exterminator">When to Hire a Professional Spider Exterminator</h2>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve seen a single or few spiders around and you&rsquo;re wondering is it time I called the exterminator?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s important to know the type and number of spiders that you can handle along and when you need to make that call to your exterminator for help with spider control.
**Hire a Spider Exterminator? **
If you can observe the spider and figure out which type it is - harmless or poisonous, then it&rsquo;ll be easy to determine if you should call the exterminator.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just an average, harmless spider in the house then there is no need for any help at all from pest control specialists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, the market hasspider trapsand catchers that enable spider control without touching or coming near the bug.
A spider catcher is a tool that is used for catching and releasing spiders.</li>
<li>A spider catcher usually consists of a long pole with a loop at the end, which can be either an open or closed hoop. The very tip of this rod has soft bristles - what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;the hook&rdquo;.
As soon as you see any type of spider crawling on your wall, in front of windows, etc., simply flick it out using the hooked part to release it outside from where it came from!</li>
<li>These tools will save you all types of panic attacks and stress from spider attacks
In this video, exterminator Jim Triggs provides some tips on how to kill spiders at home using a spider catcher.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwPECUavj8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwPECUavj8</a></p>
<p>Well, a number of factors are important to consider in deciding whether or not you should contact an exterminator. But, before reaching out to a pest control company, take a look at</p>
<ol>
<li>What the company can do for you, and</li>
<li>If this type of problem is within their scope.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="so-how-much-do-spider-exterminators-cost">So, How Much Do Spider Exterminators Cost?</h2>
<p>That depends on a number of factors.</p>
<p>Every company has its own pricing structure that may not be clear upfront, which means you need to take time and research prices before committing to anything.</p>
<p>And even then, there&rsquo;s no guarantee what your actual budget will end up being because rates vary by the city!</p>
<ul>
<li>You also have other factors like how many treatments they offer per year as well as if they provide any type of warranty or guarantees with the service.</li>
<li>Some companies offer monthly packages so make sure you find out this information ahead of time so you know what your total investment will be long-term versus
<strong>1. Cost of a Reactive Spider Treatment</strong>
Reactive treatment to control spiders inside your home can cost anywhere from $100 - $300. This will generally just get rid of any recent, active spiders in the house.</li>
<li>In reactive treatment, exterminators will spray pesticide in areas such as inside baseboards, ceilings, and the crawl spaces around your house.
It&rsquo;s not likely to offer any long-term protection from future infestations because it doesn&rsquo;t get rid of anything outside (in the yard or on neighboring properties) and it won&rsquo;t protect against more spiders coming into your house in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-preventive-spider-treatment">2. Preventive Spider Treatment</h3>
<p>Preventive spider treatment�will cost you anywhere from $500 - $1,000, but it can offer a lot more protection.</p>
<p>In this type of treatment, an exterminator will spray pesticide outside your house and on neighboring properties to deal with any spiders that could come in.</p>
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;ll also seal up the exterior cracks or gaps around your house so those spiders won&rsquo;t be able to get inside either.</li>
<li>This will involve spraying the outdoor-facing areas like various entry points, eaves, door frames, and windows to prevent a spider invasion.
One approach in preventive treatment is to set up a contract with an exterminator who will visit your property quarterly, annually, or both.</li>

<p>Working together, the exterminator and you can effectively get rid of spider infestations inside your spaces - office, yard, or home.</p>
<p>Before you call an exterminator, make sure to know what kind of information they&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<h3 id="1-spider-species-in-question">1. Spider Species in Question?</h3>
<p>The type of spider in question can affect the extermination measures, so it&rsquo;s important to tell your exterminator the specific spider they will be working with.</p>
<p>You can provide the exterminator with a call describing what types of spiders are present as well as their general physical characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Among the most common arachnids found in homes are funnel web,<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/spider-chart"><strong>jumping</strong></a>,<a href="http://entomology.wsu.edu/outreach/bug-info/yellow-sac-spider/"><strong>yellow sac</strong></a>,<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/longbodied-cellar-spider"><strong>cellar spider</strong></a>,<a href="http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/brown-recluse-spiders"><strong>brown recluse</strong></a>,�and<a href="https://texasinsects.tamu.edu/southern-black-widow-spider/"><strong>black widow</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-spider-location">2. Spider Location</h3>
<p>Gathering information about the spiders&rsquo; location will ensure that your exterminator is better prepared for effective treatment.</p>
<p>The exterminator will need to know the specifics of your home or space, such as the spider-infested areas. This will allow them to begin work without wasting time studying coverage areas.</p>
<p>It is important to call your pest control company as soon as you see any evidence that there is a spider problem in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>One way to identify this is seeing webbing anywhere from corners up the walls and in dark spaces like under cabinets, crawl space, or the attic.</li>
<li>Also, check webbing around windowsills, near hanging indoor plants, or behind curtains on window frames that extend floor-to-ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-duration-of-the-spider-infestation">3. Duration of the Spider Infestation</h3>
<p>A spider infestation can be short or long in duration.</p>
<p>If the spiders are only coming inside your home during rainy periods, it might just be a temporary issue with an open window which should clear up when the weather changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>But their webbing keeps increasing over time, then this indicates that professional intervention may need to happen sooner rather than later.
At the time of service, you will have to answer questions about the first spider sighting. This will allow the exterminator to assess the severity of the spider infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-recurring-spiderwebs">4. Recurring Spiderwebs</h3>
<p>If you have been seeing evidence of spider webs for more than six months and there is no reason why they would come indoors (or go outdoors).</p>
<p>Spiders will spin webs periodically, but they are usually only in one place for a short time.</p>
<p>A recurring spiderweb can be an indication that there is a nest of spiders nearby and the web is their hunting ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>The webs will get bigger or recur as more spiders come to feed on prey (i.e., you) until it gets so big that the structure collapses or washes away with rainwater.
This would be especially true if your house has another pest, such as insects or rodents which could attract spiders.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this happens contact exterminators who specialize in removing these pests from homes even before they cause any damage!</p>
<h3 id="5-any-spider-eggs-seen">5. Any Spider Eggs Seen?</h3>
<p>If you spot spider eggs in your home, it&rsquo;s a sign that you have spiders. Spider mothers can lay up to 100 eggs at one time and they will hatch within two weeks of being laid.</p>
<p>Spider eggs are a sign that you have spiders, and if they hatch before extermination is done then it will cause more problems for your home.</p>
<p>So, let the exterminator know if you&rsquo;ve seen spider eggs, and don&rsquo;t spray insecticides indoors without first asking for the exterminator&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may notice egg sacs that are woven on the ceiling or wall, on leaves of any indoor plant, or under the spiderweb inside the corners of a room.
When you notice a number of egg sacs laying around in different corners of the rooms, it is possible an infestation has already begun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-to-ask-the-spider-exterminator">What to Ask the Spider Exterminator</h2>
<p>When it comes to getting rid of spiders, finding the right exterminator matters.</p>
<p>To find out if youve found the right one, ask them these critical questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How often should I expect an exterminator to come?</li>
<li>What are your methods of extermination for spiders and other bugs?</li>
<li>What is the procedure for spider removal from inside walls, ceilings, or window screens?</li>
<li>Would you be picking up any furniture that needs to be sprayed with insecticide?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-licenses-and-credentials">1. Licenses and Credentials</h3>
<p>Certifications and credentials are important, but also only tell one part of the story.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask what licenses they hold instead, especially if you live in a state with specific laws about pest control (like California).</p>
<p>What kind of entomology certification do they have? If there is no response given by the company about their qualifications, it could mean that either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person doesn&rsquo;t know because he has never been asked before</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re too busy trying to get your business</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s something fishy
When looking for the right company to handle your spider infestation, it&rsquo;s important that you ask about their qualifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>You want written proof of their certifications, licenses, and registration. Ask for these documents before hiring the extermination company.</p>
<h3 id="2-references">2. References</h3>
<p>What are former customers saying about the services the spider extermination company offers?</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, ask them how long have they been in business, and how many customers do they serve on a regular basis?
Check the competence of the company by asking previous clients about their experience.</li>
<li>Reliable exterminator review websites such as Angie&rsquo;s List and HomeAdvisor can help you find a qualified specialist in your region.
Interview the past clients on the quality of service that the exterminator provided - especially on spider control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-extermination-methods-and-chemicals">2. Extermination Methods and Chemicals</h3>
<p>Ask the exterminator about their methods of spider elimination. Do they use environmentally safe chemicals?</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, spider control mainly uses<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.html"><strong>pyrethrin</strong></a>as the key ingredient since it kills the bugs on contact.
Barrier treatments, such as those using synthetic
<a href="https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/ent-6003/"><strong>pyrethroids</strong></a>
can offer additional protection.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to know what chemicals will be used by the exterminator in treatment before any chemicals are applied to your spaces.</p>
<p>Spider control can be achieved by using environmentally safe chemicals.</p>
<ul>
<li>This method is best for sensitive areas such as schools and hospitals, or in homes with pets and children.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-spider-control-guarantees"><strong>3. Spider Control Guarantees</strong></h3>
<p>As a homeowner, you want to know that the problems with your spider infestation are going to be treated properly and effectively.</p>
<p>The best way to know for certain that your spider infestation is under control is with a guarantee.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spider Control Guarantees to ensure you don&rsquo;t have any more spiders or be able to come back and treat the problem at no additional charge if they do return.
Many companies offer their clients guarantees, but there are many other factors to consider before selecting which company&rsquo;s services will work best for you.</li>
<li>Some of these considerations include price, length of the service contract, whether it includes maintenance agreements, and what type of chemicals they use in treatment.
Most companies offer a money-back guarantee and limited reapplication, but the duration of the warranty may differ.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-how-many-treatments-are-required">3. How many Treatments are Required?</h3>
<p>To get rid of spiders in your home, you will need to do a few treatments.</p>
<p>The number of spider treatments will depend on how bad the problem is with the spiders and how many there are.</p>
<p>Therefore, discuss the number of treatments required on the space after the exterminator conducts the property inspection.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-handle-pets-during-spider-treatment">How to Handle Pets During Spider Treatment</h2>
<p>When spider control treatment is initiated, it&rsquo;s important to know how to keep your pet safe.
**1. Isolate Pets to Untreated Rooms **
Spider infestations generally don&rsquo;t involve hundreds of spiders. They will typically only cover a small section of the house.</p>
<p>The pet might need to stay elsewhere during an insect treatment service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore the exterminator can accommodate them by giving you the choice of a room or two where they will not be applying pesticides - may be in the living room or bedroom.
If your pet is not allowed out of the house or if you have a cat, then just try to limit their access to areas where they may come into contact with spider control treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you let your pets roam around outside and are treating for spiders in the yard, make sure that all windows and doors are closed so no one can get inside without being noticed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to keep an eye on any plants around the house because some treatments do affect plant life as well as insects and other pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is something that concerns you, it will be best to discuss details with someone from the company before services take place. They should be able to give insight on how much exposure there would be during spider control treatment if needed
<strong>2. Lock them in Pet carriers</strong>
As this article explains, the kennel is one of the best options for pet owners when dealing with pest control in residences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pet owners should consider locking their pets in a kennel when treating pests at home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pet carriers are more portable and lighter than traditional cages, making it easier to move your pet from one location to another.
Pet carriers will offer short-time refuge for the pets against the spider control chemical but it&rsquo;s required.</li>
<li>In the event that you have any questions about how to best handle your pets during spider control treatment, we recommend discussing this with someone from the chosen pest control company.
They should be able to give insight on how much exposure there would be if needed and provide guidance for ensuring pet safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a kennel is not available or can&rsquo;t be used as an alternative option, it will likely be necessary to lock them inside one of their normal crates while spraying takes place in the vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-take-after-the-spider-extermination-or-treatment">Steps To Take After the Spider Extermination or Treatment</h2>
<p>**1. Continnauly Check for Spiders **
First, once the exterminator is done treating your home for spiders, run a dry inspection to check for spiders that may have survived and report, if any, to the exterminator.</p>
<p>After a spider treatment, it is normal for live spiders to continue dying over the next few days and with less frequency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to check indoor areas regularly
<strong>2. Don&rsquo;t Clean Immediately</strong>
Professional exterminators won&rsquo;t leave a mess on the spider-treated spaces. Thus, you must not mop or clean the spaces and floors immediately.</li>
<li>While some treatments are applied directly to the baseboards, others come in granular form that can be vacuumed up after application - avoid this as it&rsquo;ll reduce its effectiveness.
After your pest control service has treated your home, you are left with an insect carcass or two and messy traps - but don&rsquo;t do a deep cleaning at least for a few days.
<strong>3. Repair any leaks</strong>
While looking out for possible survivors, make time to barricade your property against future invaders.</li>
<li>This can be done by sealing cracks and gaps, minimizing prolonged exposure to the outdoors, and avoiding clutter.
Be sure to keep all food in sealed containers if it&rsquo;s not eaten. This will prevent pests from coming in to get their next meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seal up any openings and cracks on the outside of your homes, such as around pipes, doors, or windows.</p>
<p>When painting over these areas use a paint that contains residual insecticide so it&rsquo;ll act as an extra line of defense against unwanted wildlife. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether the new paint is chemical-free, ask for a material safety data sheet (MSDS) before applying it yourself.</p>
<p>If you have gaps smaller than a one-half inch or vents less than 12 square inches then they need to be sealed with steel wool.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-alert-the-neighbors-about-the-spider-treatment">Should You Alert the Neighbors about the Spider Treatment?</h2>
<p>Noticing a spider infestation in your home could mean that you are not on your own!</p>
<p>Homeowners often have a misunderstanding of spiders. On one hand, they only move when it is necessary to do so; yet this doesn&rsquo;t indicate that they cant find their way into better hiding places if needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of the pests must start at every level: inside and outside the property - including on your neighbor&rsquo;s property and thus you should alert them before the spider treatment.
Watch the video below to see how spiderlings hatch from their egg sacs and migrate.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rTEe2vS-VI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rTEe2vS-VI</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the question of how much do spider exterminators cost? it is far more imperative that you get on top of the infestation as soon as possible before it becomes worse.</p>

; start with a vacuum for removing webs, get some sticky traps, and spider repellent on hiding places such as garages, attics, and basements.
Brown recluse is venomous and you&rsquo;ll mainly find them hiding in dark places on the yard and home.� - and they&rsquo;ll be equally challenging to control.
These brown recluses will seek shelter in hidden areas - comparable to the venomous Black Widow - and you&rsquo;ll get them in locations like North America.</p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders">Details: How to Get Rid of Brown Recluse Spiders</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-inspection-for-brown-recluse-spiders">Step 1: Conduct Inspection for Brown Recluse Spiders</h3>
<p>The fiddle-back spider or Brown recluse have markings but will also have many shades such as light or dark brown - you can get them in Kentucky, western Georgia, and central Texas.
These nocturnal hunters will prey on mosquitoes, and flies among other insects. But they won&rsquo;t harm humans - but act in self-defense and they&rsquo;ll use their bites.</p>
<p>You may confuse the Brown recluse with wolf spiders but these ones have eight eyes and larger in body size. The recluse has fine hairs and six eyes but smaller in size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite that bites from brown recluse are rare, they are itchy and become reddish - and may become<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spider-bites/symptoms-causes/syc-20352371">an open sore</a>taking even a weak to heal.
On the body shape, these spiders are violin shape (and dark brown) on their cephalothorax - the section where the bug&rsquo;s legs are attached.</li>
<li>The spider has a uniformly-colored abdomen and legs - it has no multiple abdomen pigments.</li>
<li>It has no spines� but some fine hairs on its legs
The bug has 6 (not eight) eyes arranged in pairs but has some small space that separates the egg pairs. But don&rsquo;t confuse these spiders with the spitting spiders in the Scytodes genus.</li>
<li>Conduct an effective inspection for the spiders - check cobwebs in clutter, in wall voids, and under insulation. Check for irregular and loose webs - destroy them.
Get some vacuum hose - this will help remove spider webs and fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-remove-propitious-favourable-conditions-for-brown-recluse">Step 2: Remove Propitious (Favourable) Conditions for Brown Recluse**</h3>
<p>**
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef631">Brown recluse naturally live</a>
in
debris, woodpiles, logs, and rocks -
outdoors spaces. They&rsquo;ll live in
indoor spaces - even in attics or
unheated basements during winters with no
water or food.
The spiders will hunt during the night for their dead or living prey.� - they may employ suspended webs around outdoor vegetation, ceilings, corners, and walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, to get rid of these Recluse Spiders, ensure to first remove the propitious (favorable) conditions in the yard or home - such acts will remove their shelter of preying areas.</li>
<li>The Brown recluse will hide in locations that are warm, dark, and dry such as in rubber tires, bedding, furniture, shoes, clothing, and boxes - including in cellars, basements, and closets.
The adaptable Brown recluse is largely active (but non-aggressive) in temperatures around 45F to 110F - they&rsquo;ll survive for about 6 months with no water or food.</li>
<li>You can repel the spiders using essential oils such as tea tree, lavender,� and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-peppermint-oil-repel-spiders/">peppermint oil</a>- spray the oils and you may also use Hedge apples to repel the spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3inspect--clean-brown-recluse-hiding-places">Step 3:<strong>Inspect &amp; Clean Brown Recluse Hiding Places�</strong></h3>
<p>Inspect your spaces and clean - using some good vacuum cleaner, and use some suitable aerosol such as Zenprox (with longer residue effect) or CB 80.
As noted earlier, Brown recluse will take refuge in warm and dark places - and hence cleaning practices that&rsquo;ll hit such places will help remove the bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, clean all the objects that could attract Brown recluse such as food sources - don&rsquo;t drop crumbs around the spaces as they&rsquo;ll attract the bugs.</li>
<li>Next, move any boards, lumber, firewood that&rsquo;ll be around your house. Cover these objects and store them away from the ground - and cut all dense vegetation near structures.
Next, cut the tall grasses and trim the bushes - remove items on the garage floor and clean that space. But remove all the clutter that could harbor any brown recluse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-setup-multiple-brown-recluse-traps">Step 4: Setup Multiple Brown-Recluse Traps</h3>
<p>Next, its trap-time - set up multiple spider traps in the house - locate the traps around the bed, water heater chamber, and under your bathroom sink.
The glue traps set up for the spider will help capture the bugs - in the apartment or house. I recommend using a Catchmaster trap - as approved by Kansas University researchers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The glue traps will help identify the type of bugs that are insider your residence or house.
The sticky traps are excellent bug or pest controller gadgets - these will kill or immobilize the spiders that are wandering in your spaces.
Most of the traps are &ldquo;passive&rdquo; and hence it won&rsquo;t require complicated setting-up or attending - just check them occasionally and dump them if they&rsquo;re full of spiders.
But, a major drawback with glue traps is that they trap or even kill both harmful and helpful insects. For example, arthropods and Centipedes may be trapped.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5dust-and-spray-the-brown-recluse">Step 5:<strong>Dust and Spray the Brown recluse</strong></h3>
<p>Dust and also spray the spiders&rsquo; hiding spaces using some
residual ins
ecticide like Onslaught and Suspend Poly Zone (perimeter sprays).</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply sprayunder furniture andinsidebaseboards - places that the brown recluse run. Theresidual insecticides likeZenprox or Suspend Poly-zone - combined withdusting and cleaning.</li>
<li>Ensure the dust or spray (for Brown recluse) gets to the places that are difficult to reach. The Talstar bifenthrin insecticide is a pyrethroid that will repel the brown recluse.
The spayed or dusted surfaces will influence how long the insecticide will remain active. For example, masonite and wooden surfaces allow the insecticide to keep its power for about 7 days.</li>
<li>However, spraying or dusting the insecticide (even with handheld dusters) on vinyl surfaces will maintain the residue active and powerful for about 60 days.
**Residual sprays: **</li>
<li>These insecticide sprays are liquid and you should use them on room perimeters, storage areas, closets edges, eaves, and exterior foundation.</li>
<li>Sprays offering a residual-killing activity that is long should be chosen. Avoid sprays made from oils and botanical extracts that have not been proven to work on the brown recluse.
<strong>Residual dust:�</strong></li>
<li>Dust (such as D-Fence Dust) created to work as residual insecticides must be applied on your crawl spaces that are inaccessible, attics, and also wall voids.</li>
<li>The insecticide dust will easily penetrate those places that won&rsquo;t be easy to hit with spider sprays - and thus give longer brown recluse control.</li>
<li>Treating the attics (area-wide) won&rsquo;t work well because you might contaminate the storage places or even drift to your house through ventilation or light-fixtures.
<strong>Aerosol or ULV sprays:�</strong></li>
<li>The aerosol or ULV (ultra-low volume) sprays that have resmethrin or pyrethrins will effectively control the brown recluse.</li>
<li>The ULV treatment will be effective for controlling spiders in the shingle roofing, attics, and under the wood. They&rsquo;ll irritate the recluse as they contact and move on surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-6-sanitationnon-chemical-treatment">Step 6: Sanitation<strong>Non-Chemical Treatment�</strong></h3>
<p>Sanitation will effectively help clear the Brown Recluse - as it&rsquo;ll remove them from different structures like homes and buildings - including various�hiding places.
I approve of the subsequent practices to get rid of the brown recluse.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut short the different tall grasses around the various structures. Check the garages and basements - improving storages - don&rsquo;t store objects on the floor.</li>
<li>Check the building foundation and cut the heavy vegetation plus remove the piles of debris, boards, stones, firewood, and lumber.
Remove the spiders with egg sacs and webs of the brown recluse - use a vacuum after spotting the spiders during the inspection step - and remove the vacuum bag.
Use caulk to seal gaps and cracks in the cables, wires, pipes, vents, surrounding eaves, and building exterior. Inspect stored items and boxes - and use some vacuum hoses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-7-usediatomaceous-earth-food-grade">Step 7:� Use�Diatomaceous Earth (Food-Grade)</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth
has proven effective and safer for controlling the brown recluse - they have an abrasive effect that&rsquo;ll break the exoskeleton of the spiders.
Sprinkle the powder onto the gaps and spaces on the bedroom closets, inner bedroom spaces, under cabinets in the kitchen, and wall cracks - but avoid damp situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove food sources loved by brown recluse including water, food, and shelter - just like with the moths,ants, flies, and roaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lastly, on how to get rid of brown recluse spiders remove all the external openings and gaps.
This will block the brown recluse from getting into the house. Also, cover the gaps around the doors and windows.
Further, lessen the amount of indoor humidity as this will repel the spiders - you may use a dehumidifier - manage the humidity in the storage spaces, bathrooms, and closets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders will have many benefits, as a homeowner, in your garden including preying on other dangerous insects. But why are spiders among the most loathed pests in the world?
Some spiders can be dangerous, a nuisance, and outright freaky especially black widows and the brown recluse.
Thus, it&rsquo;s terrifying that you may be sleeping under the same roof with these

.
In this article, I&rsquo;m going to show you how to get rid of spiders using a simple Four-Step process. The methods will range from chemical-laden and all-natural techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>As the local temperatures increase, so do the bugs come out in numbers. Hence, you&rsquo;ll require to think seriously consider pest control including getting rid of spiders.�</em>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-spiders-7-effective-tips">How to Get Rid of Spiders (7 Effective Tips)</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-spider-identification">Step 1: Spider Identification</h3>
<p>On
<a href="https://owlcation.com/stem/spider-identification">spider identification</a>
, the 8-legged arachnids (with fangs (chelicerae) and 2 body parts ) belong to the same group as mites, ticks, and scorpions.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-antennae/">Spiders have no antennae</a>
or wing.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are over 35,000 species of spiders worldwide but just a fraction of them will be in your yard or home.</li>
<li>The most common species will be black widows, brown recluses, jumping spiders, orb-weaver, and wolf spiders.</li>
<li>Only black widow and brown recluse have life-threatening venom but other spiders may also leave a nasty and irritating bite.
During the identification process, check the spider&rsquo;s behavioral patterns, color, size, number, and the set pattern of their eyes - but note that spiders will mainly be in some hidden areas.
*Are spiders dangerous? *</li>
<li>Well, most spider species (such as wolf spiders, hobo spiders, orb-weaver spiders, and garden spiders) are harmless.</li>
<li>But, some spiders (including brown recluse and black widow spiders) are dangerous with their venom causing hazardous health issues to humans.
<em>Why do I have a spider problem?�</em></li>
<li>The insects in your home, properties, or yard will attract spiders. They&rsquo;ll move inside during winter and late fall as they prey on insects.
<em>Where will I find spiders?�</em></li>
<li>As reclusive and shy creatures, spiders will live (either outside or inside) in the secluded, quiet, and dark places where they build webs or burrow.
<strong>NB:�</strong></li>
<li>Spiders that build webs such as orb-weaver, garden spiders, or black widows will create such webs in doorways, roof eaves, high trees, shrubs, and decks.</li>
<li>But, the burrowing spiders such as wolf spiders will nest on rockpiles, fallen trees, woodpiles, shrubs, and under bushes.
For the indoor spaces, the spiders will hide in the less-frequented areas such as under furniture and sinks, attics, garage, around windows and ceilings fixtures, closets, and basements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-declutter-and-vacuum">Step 2: Declutter and Vacuum</h3>
<p>Some spider species love dark and damp corners such as rarely-used closets and basements while others will hide in dry plus warm areas like attics.
<em>Declutter�</em>
First, declutter your house - most times spiders will be found in cluttered places such as basements, attics, and garages.
So, reorganize and throw out as many objects as possible - leaving spiders in the open and hence there will be no harborage areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic cleaning and maintenance n your house and spaces will be very important to get rid of spiders. Besides, vacuuming, you must declutter the spaces too.</li>
<li>Decluttering the spaces will remove those hiding places that are in your garage or home. Keenly dust and clean the clutter to reduce the spider-hiding areas.
<em>Vacuum�</em></li>
<li>Since you&rsquo;ve spotted the spiders around your home or yard, there must be some egg sacs lurking around the dark spaces such as crevices and cracks.</li>
<li>So, vacuum the whole house from closet corners and also under the furniture. Further, as you vacuum remember to remove all the spiders and spider webs - and finally dispose of that vacuum bag.
<em>Regular Cleaning:�</em></li>
<li>Regularly clean your spaces, garage, and home regularly to hinder new spider infestations - also dust the tabletops and open spaces to remove cobwebs.</li>
<li>Remove all clutter from the floors, conduct wall-to-wall vacuuming and move objects on countertops, and clean thoroughly</li>
<li>Once monthly, move the small furniture, light fixtures, and dust the ceilings - dusting and vacuuming effectively behind these fixtures.</li>
<li>Also, once monthly, clean under the bed and don&rsquo;t forget any item store beneath there, and for the floor, registers get the vent covers off to dust easily.
<em>Seasonal cleaning:�</em></li>
<li>Clean fire accessories and the fireplace by opening the chimneys flue to remove all cobwebs. Keenly clean and vacuum all items including the screens and fireplace logs.</li>
<li>Check and clean the attic for any cobwebs and leaks. Clean the storage boxes plus your attic floor - and remember to seal all the containers and boxes stored in the attic.</li>
<li>Inspect walls and basement for crack and leaks - fixing all of them while also dusting all the storage boxes and sweeping the surfaces and floors. Clean around the furnace and water heater.</li>
<li>Clean the garage, after getting the car outside to clean it thoroughly and sweep the walls and ceilings plus the exterior door.

<h3 id="step-3-use-terro-t2302-to-kill-any-spiders">Step 3: Use TERRO-T2302 to Kill any Spiders</h3>
<p>TERRO-T2302 gives install-killing results on spiders - quick and easy. Just spray around the holes, garden, crevices, and house or directly on that spider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spider killer will prevent spider re-occurrence for about 6 weeks. It&rsquo;ll kill pests and spiders like black widows and the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">brown recluse</a>, bed bugs, cockroaches, ants, and scorpions.
Spray this TERRO-T2302 on or around the spider&rsquo;s or ant&rsquo;s nest. You can spray it both outdoors and indoors while also controlling cockroaches and Asian-lady beetles.
But is Terro Spider really a spider-killer safe? Well, don&rsquo;t let
pets, kids, and even adults into the sprayed areas before the chemical is dried - avoid direct contact.</li>
<li>With 0.02 % Deltamethrin and 0.05% Pyrethrins as the active ingredients, TERRO-T2302 offers dual function - it&rsquo;ll know down the spiders and also offer 12 weeks bug control.</li>
<li><a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf">Pyrethrins</a>are extracted from chrysanthemum will trigger paralysis and eventual death as it excites the spider&rsquo;s nervous system.</li>
<li>Further,<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/DeltaGen.html">Deltamethrin</a>will disrupt the spider&rsquo;s nervous system killing the insects on contact. But TERRO-T2302 is not waterproof and thus don&rsquo;t use it during the rainy reason.
<em>To use TERRO-T2302 fo spiders�</em></li>
<li>For indoor spraying, use TERRO-T2302 on the non-food locations that pests will hide and pests - remember the spaces behind appliances or shelves and around windows and doors.</li>
<li>But for outdoor spraying, ensure to pint your spray nozzle at a downward angle but away from your body and face - but don&rsquo;t spray in a windy environment.</li>
<li>TERRO-T2302 will kill spiders and other insects on picnic areas and patios surface. The product willkill fleas, silverfish, crickets, ants, and cockroaches.
Ensure that the TERRO-T2302 must come into direct contact with the spider - so spray the outside and inside including the window and door frames.
Remember to spray TERRO-T2302 to get to those difficult spider webs. Also, don&rsquo;t remove the egg sacs and spider webs from those spaces until the spray is fully dried.
Spray the outdoor spaces including on non-crop or bushy areas, and the spider-infested weeds - including on lumber and firewood. Wash the clothes and skin using water plus soap.
Avoid using this spider spray around aquatic animals as it&rsquo;ll be toxic to them including to fish.

<h3 id="step-4-usecatchmaster-72mb-spider-catching-glue-boards">Step 4: Use<strong>Catchmaster 72MB Spider-Catching Glue Boards�</strong></h3>
<p>After monitoring the spider activity, you can use the Catchmaster 72MB as a glue trap to catch multiple insects that&rsquo;ll also capture spiders straying around the room.
Set up these traps around areas that you&rsquo;ve noticed some spider activity - this may include around the closet storage spaces and garage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insects including spider will wall on the glue board and they&rsquo;ll get stuck - ready for disposal. You can also remove the spider webs using the web out spray.</li>
<li>Spray the product under or inside your patio coverings - and this will help break down the spider web and then clean them up using a broom.</li>
<li>Sticky traps are mainly used forcockroachesandrodentsbut will also work against spiders - simply place the traps on hidden spaces such as the attic, basement, closet corners.
Catchmaster 72MB will capture the insects in a non-toxic way (no rodenticides or insecticides ) to get rid of roaches, ants, and mice - but the bugs will be attracted by the scent of the peanut butter.
Ensure to keep the spider traps in some moderate temperatures, avoid freezing or overly hot temperatures. You may also fold the trap to form some tunnel shape - and hence avoids dust.</li>
<li>For indoor use, position your glue boards in a horizontal direction on corners, or against the baseboards. Don&rsquo;t position on the moist surfaces or places near water.</li>
<li>Avoid using on areas with extreme heat. Also, for cold places like the walk-in fridge, get Catchmaster 48WRG which&rsquo;s great for cold temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-use-peppermint-oil">Step 5: Use Peppermint Oil</h3>
<p>Scientific evidence denotes that
peppermint oil will repel or exterminate spiders
working like a natural insecticide against spiders and other arachnids.
It is thought that spiders dislike either the monoterpenoids (with fumigants) or strong odors found in the oil as outlined in a
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014752/#!po=85.2941">2010 study by StudyTrusted</a>
.
But how do you use peppermint oil in controlling or repelling spiders? Just get a water-filled spray bottle and put peppermint oil (about 5- 20 drops) - add some
dish soap</p>
<ul>
<li>shake to mix.
Next, you&rsquo;ll require to spray the water-peppermint mixture around the dark corners and house perimeter plus other spider-hiding areas.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to apply this peppermint oil mixture onto various surfaces once weekly. When the spiders come back prior to wend-of-week, increase the frequency - maybe daily spraying?
You can position some peppermint plants around some strategic areas inside and outside the house. Further, sprinkle some ground peppermint leaves on areas frequented by some spiders.
Here are additional repellents (natural) that&rsquo;ll repel spiders, mainly essential oils:</li>
<li>Citronella Oil</li>
<li>Tea Tree Oil</li>
<li>Lavender Oil</li>
<li>Eucalyptus Oil</li>
<li>Lemon Oil
Spread some cedar mulch near the home to deter or repel the spiders - maybe you can drop some cedar sachet on the drawers and closet.

<h3 id="1-pesticides">1. Pesticides</h3>
<p>Most pesticides and Insecticides in the local market kill wolf spiders and
hobo spiders
by paralyzing them before death takes place.
The toxic chemicals in pesticides/insecticides also inhibit spider&rsquo;s eggs from hatching and further break down their breeding grounds (webs).</p>
<ul>
<li>When purchasing your pesticides/insecticides, be careful to check on the spider labels or recommendations for killing assurance.</li>
<li>Tempo SC Ultra is a good example of an outdoor wolf spider insecticide that kills over 100 other pests. The product is extra concentrated to boost killing power and allows further dilution to form 30 gallons of effective solvent - covers a wide surface area.
When dealing with pesticides/insecticides, be careful since residue left behind may affect your pets or kids upon contact.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-trap-wolf-spiders-in-a-container">2. Trap wolf spiders in a container</h3>
<p>Wolf spider trap container is an ideal method of capturing one or two spiders. Usually, you need a plastic or a glass container and a piece of cardboard or wood -
spiders have no antennae
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon spotting a wolf spider, cover it with a plastic container immediately. Then, gently slide a piece of cardboard beneath the container - be careful that the spider may not escape.</li>
<li>This method encloses the wolf spider and prevents it from crawling or running away. You can easily release the spider far away from your compound - may be in the fields. Don&rsquo;t throw live wolf spiders into a dustbin or garbage pit.
When trapping wolf spiders, wear protective gloves to avoid the case of being bitten in the process. Though wolf spider&rsquo;s bite is less venomous, it may trigger a reaction, for allergic sensitive individuals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-boric-acid-solvent">3. Boric Acid Solvent</h3>
<p>Boric acid solvent, when inhaled by wolf spider, chocks and suffocate it to death in a couple of seconds. The toxic gas blocks the breathing system, thus denying it the oxygen needed for life support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon contact, boring acid solvent weakens and breaks down the wolf spider&rsquo;s exoskeleton - this action exposes internal tissues, which are further dehydrated leading to death.
During preparation, ensure that the boric acid solvent is super concentrated for excellent action.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-use-an-organic-pesticide">4. Use an organic pesticide</h3>
<p>Unlike
commercial chemical-based pesticides
, organic pesticides are manufactured using a special plant-based solvent (Hexa-hydroxyl), which is a non-pollutant.
Actually, these pesticides won&rsquo;t kill wolf spiders directly; instead, the organic substance destroys all insects in which the spider feeds.
By eliminating the wolf spider&rsquo;s primary source of food; then, you will eventually get rid of spiders in the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, organic pesticides come in powder or dust form - you just need to sprinkle it in an area infested with wolf spiders and leave it for a couple of minutes to act.
The organic substance in the pesticides (Hexa-hydroxyl) is safe for both kids and pets - won&rsquo;t cause intoxication or contact reaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-hunt-wolf-spiders-down">5. Hunt wolf spiders down</h3>
<p>Hunting down wolf spiders is a tactical way of elimination where you physically search for these arachnids in their hideouts. Usually, hunting is successful at night more than daytime due to limited light sources, which eases escape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a torch, flashlight over wolf spiders hideouts intermittently - this could be at corners, holes, cracks, woods, patches, or shrubs.</li>
<li>The disc eye shape found in the wolf spiders reflects light at night making them more visible.
Upon spotting the spider, you can opt to kill or capture them alive using a trap. Remember to wear protective gloves when hunting wolf spiders for your own personal safety. Avoid disturbing other animals in the vicinity when hunting.

<h3 id="6-spider-spray">6. Spider Spray</h3>
<p>Spider sprays are specific products manufactured for wolf spiders elimination - the product may be chemical-based or organic, depending on the manufacturer or intended area of use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spider sprays come in pressurized and concentrated forms that act instantly upon contact. Indeed, the toxic substances in the spray integrate a quick-acting formulation that kills instantly upon contact.</li>
<li>Demon Max is a classic example of spider spray that integrates complex chemical formula, which not only kills wolf spiders but also inhibits their re-infestation.
Terro Spider Spray is a market lead spider killer that comes in a 16oz canister and works both indoors &amp; outdoors. Further, Terror Spray instantly kills spiders and other insects such as cockroaches, scorpions, crickets, and ants in the process.
Remember, spider sprays are user-specific, either indoors or outdoors - consider checking the labels before use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-place-sticky-traps-around-the-house">7. Place sticky traps around the house</h3>
<p>If you suspect that wolf spiders are lurking in your compound or house; then, consider using the sticky traps method. The traps are just cardboard pasted with sticky glue on the surface, which acts as the sticking/trapping agent.</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea in this method is that when the wolf spider steps on the sticky surface, it gets stuck and unable to crawl along - this act denies it food leading to death.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to prepare or purchase several sticky traps.
Then, lay them down strategically at places you suspect wolf spiders may pass or crawl (it may be your bedroom, garage, kitchen, store, yard, or toilet) and leave them for 5 days or so. Later, come and inspect your trap for any capture.
Any trapped wolf spider should be disposed of far away from the compound. Ensure the sticky traps are placed far from kids and pets whatsoever.

</ul>
<h3 id="8-wash-spiders-away">8. Wash spiders away</h3>
<p>Using pressurized water, from a hosepipe or jet stream, you can wash away wolf spider infestation. Usually, you aim water jet at the spiders&rsquo; hideouts - the water pushes the spiders out instantly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon removal, the spiders (plus their eggs) float in water and are easily washed away.</li>
<li>This method is best for outdoor wolf spiders&rsquo; elimination.
Also, the drainage through which the washed spiders flow should be sufficiently linked to sewer or septic to prevent re-infestation.
When washing away wolf spiders infestation, wear protective gear (gumboots, gloves, goggles, etc.) for your personal safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-kill-the-spider-with-a-broom">9. Kill the spider with a broom</h3>
<p>By using a standard broom, you can strike and kill a live wolf spider - as
they lack wings
. Normally, you need to aim and hit the spider fast before it senses danger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wolf spiders are fast running - they quickly pace to their hideouts as soon as they detect danger in their vicinity.</li>
<li>Smaller wolf spiders are likely to slip away when striking; thus, making the broom ineffective - you, therefore, need to check the size of the wolf spider before settling for this method.
Alternatively, you can use a solid object or a pair of shoes to hit the spider too. Dead spiders should be disposed of accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-rid-your-yard-of-clutter-and-debris">10. Rid your yard of clutter and debris</h3>
<p>Clutters and debris in the compound or house are possible hideouts for wolf spiders during the day. Heaps of glass, firewood, mulch, bins, compost, or leaves should be cleared from the compound to eliminate breeding grounds for wolf spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, objects such as grills, unused toolboxes, stones, empty flower vases among others should be removed or inspected regularly.
When undertaking the cleaning process, wear protective gear such as boots, gloves, overalls, and gloves for personal safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-seal-cracks-and-holes-in-the-outer-wall">11. Seal cracks and holes in the outer wall</h3>
<p>By sealing cracks and holes on your perimeter wall or house, you will not only keep off wolf spiders from infestation but also inhibit further breeding ground for other insects too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holes and cracks are immediate hideouts for wolf spiders and often than never, they breed in such areas.</li>
<li>You can successfully seal the cracks/holes using patty or caulk - both indoors or outdoors.
Broken window screens should be removed replaced immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-remove-vegetation-from-the-perimeter-of-the-house">12. Remove vegetation from the perimeter of the house</h3>
<p>Heavy plant cover (vegetation) in your compound provides ample ground for wolf spiders infestation. Shrubs, thick flowerbeds, and untrimmed grass cover shied wolf spiders and offer suitable breeding grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>By trimming vegetable covers and clearing plant waste in the compound, you will be exposing wolf spider hideouts; thus scaring them away, if any.
It&rsquo;s recommendable to trim grass cover sufficiently and avoid crowded flower beds in your compound.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-install-insect-screens">13. Install insect screens</h3>
<p>Insect screen in a fine-mesh framework that is firmly fixed at the vent leading to outside. Basically, it&rsquo;s believed that wolf spiders can get into your house through these vents or chimneys as they search for food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to install screens all over the vents in your house or perimeter wall, in order to prevent wolf spiders from crawling in through these points.
Though expensive, this method works excellently and prevents other insects from your home too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-remove-or-change-your-outdoor-lighting">14. Remove or change your outdoor lighting</h3>
<p>The presence of light attracts insects such as flies, mosquitoes, moths among others, which are food for wolf spiders. In response, wolf spiders will come to feed on these insects leading to infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should swift off lights at night, especially if it&rsquo;s not in use. Install light shades in your place instead of floodlights.
Alternatively, go for sodium vapor light in place of a normal/standard outdoor lighting system. As much as you can, maintain dim light at night since wolf spiders love hunting for food at night than daytime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homemade-remedies-for-eliminating-wolf-spiders">Homemade Remedies for Eliminating Wolf Spiders?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for homemade wolf spiders elimination alternative to fix your problem; then, consider the options highlighted below:</p>
<h3 id="1-use-of-hexa-hydroxyl">1. Use of Hexa-Hydroxyl</h3>
<p>Hexa-hydroxyl is naturally blended using plant extracts and oil additives to boots sent. The organic substance can be used to kill wolf spiders by spraying or sprinkling over wolf spider-infested areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>All you need to do ispeppermint, lavender leaves, and red peppers. Mesh these items in a motor and add little water. Sieve the mixture and repeat the process again.</li>
<li>You can opt to add Aloe Vera plant to boost the killing action. The solvent extract kills wolf spiders on contact. Further, the toxic gas released suffocates the spiders to death too
Hexa-hydroxyl is also available in the local market too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-by-using-glue-strips">2. By Using Glue Strips</h3>
<p>Glue can be poured along paths suspected to be used often by wolf spiders. Whether office glue or rubber adhesive, provided that the glue has a substantial adhesive force to hold the spider in place; then, you are good to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>When wolf spiders step on the glue, they will get stuck/trapped and starve to death. Remember, you should use glue that is easier to remove without affecting the primary material upon which it&rsquo;s applied.
Alternatively, you can smear a piece of wood with glue and place it in wolf spiders infested area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-dish-soap">3. Dish Soap</h3>
<p>Highly viscous dish soap act as sticking surface upon which wolf spiders get stuck. However, it&rsquo;s difficult for the spider just to step into dish soap for no reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you will need to have spider&rsquo;s bait placed in the dish soap - this could be a moth, housefly, or any other insect eaten by spiders.</li>
<li>Prepare dish soap sufficiently - add water and stir to form a thick viscous paste. Using a sweep net, capture moths or flies from the fields. Place the dead flies on the dish soap.
Place dish soap in various points where you suspect wolf spider will pass - it may be your garage, shelves, kitchen, or bedroom. Inspect the trap after a day or so to see the presence of trapped spiders.
Scoop and throw away trapped spider. Always refill the dish soap after capture. This method may also traps crawling insects such as ants as well as houseflies.

<h2 id="what-attracts-wolf-spiders-in-the-house">What Attracts Wolf Spiders in the House?</h2>
<p>Some of the following things could attract wolf spiders to your house:</p>
<h3 id="1-food">1. Food</h3>
<p>Food such as flies, moths, mosquitoes, among others is key attractants for wolf spiders into your house. Usually, wolf spiders will hunt them individually.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, in most cases, the spider prefer visiting place where hunting will be less cumbersome.</li>
<li>Home dustbins or stores are common places where such insects thrive and breed in large colonies. Therefore, wolf spiders often build their webs, which acts as traps.
When wolf spiders realize there is plenty of food in your house or compound, they tend to breed and multiply - they end up building a shelter there.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-shelter">2. Shelter</h3>
<p>Wolf spiders love living in a quiet place far from any disturbances. Your quiet house could be such as a serene place for wolf spiders where they would prefer living in.
Moreover, wolf spiders like hideouts that are less inhabited by other insects - like cracks, holes, gaps, shelves, etc. Perhaps your house has room for such hideouts; then, you are likely to find wolf spiders coming to your home.</p>
<h3 id="3-breeding-ground">3. Breeding ground</h3>
<p>Breeding is critical for wolf spiders as they undertake reproduction life in quiet places far from any commotion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your house, especially the ceiling is a good environment that will attract wolf spiders.</li>
<li>Pinholes, vents, cracks, and shelves are the suitable breeding grounds for spiders too - if they located such options in your place during their visit; then, chances are that they will breed and live there.
Remember, wolf spiders will build their web before they lay eggs - this could be a physical sign of infestation in your home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-wolf-spiders-infestation">How to Prevent Wolf Spiders Infestation</h2>

Wolf Spiders prevention, even before you see any sign, would be the best approach to take since further infestation would mean a serious problem that may be more cumbersome to deal with.</p>
<h3 id="4-dispose-of-cardboard-boxes">4. Dispose of Cardboard Boxes</h3>
<p>Old cardboard boxes should be disposed of to clear room for breeding and future re-infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, the wolf spiders build webs in old boxes and breed, especially when items are not cleared for a long period.
Clear bushes and thick vegetation in your compound - these acts as breeding grounds and hideouts for wolf spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on how to get rid of wolf spiders, you can use wolf spider trap container, boric acid solvent, organic pesticides, spider spray, or apply commercial pesticides with spider killing recommendation labels.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you recently seen a <a href="/posts/black-widow-spiders/">black</a> spider (Badumna insignis) in your garden that look like grey-house spider or Badumna longinqua but have white dots?</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re wondering how venomous is a black spider with white dots?
<em>Well, most black spiders with white spots are jumping spider that aren&rsquo;t venomous to humans. However, other similar species like the immature black widow are very poisonous. But this is just a faction of the 3,000 spider spices found in North America. Thus, you must know how to differentiate the spider species.�</em></p>

<h3 id="1-jumping-spider">1. Jumping Spider</h3>
<p>As noted above, jumping spiders make the largest percentage of the black spiders that have black spots. However, the jumping spiders� won&rsquo;t be venomous to humans.
Jumping spiders are named due to their leaping after stalking their pray as they hunt for a suitable meal. You&rsquo;ll notice that the arachnid has a fuzzy look.
The jumping spiders&rsquo; body is black but its spots vary with the species. However, the spiders have white spots on its back but also have white bands on their legs.

But the wolf spiders will mainly have shades of gray as opposed to white or stark black. They also are about 1 inch in body length (without the legs) and medium-sized.
Wolf spiders won&rsquo;t be poisonous or generate any venom that may paralyze their prey including insects but not to humans. For humans, bites from wolf spider are painful and dangerous than bee stings.
Therefore, Wolf spiders bite must be taken care or treated by a professional medical officer or doctor - despite the bites not being venomous to humans.</p>

<h3 id="1-different-in-bite-appearance">1. Different in Bite Appearance?</h3>
<p><em>a. Mosquito bite�</em>
Mosquito bites to animals and humans mainly come from their females to get that blood meal - enabling great egg production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using their proboscis (mouthpart), mosquitos pierce your skin and suck blood.</li>
<li>Its saliva causes your skin to itch and bump. For some people, the effect is more strong redness, soreness, and swelling.
The appearance of a mosquito bite include:</li>
<li>Dark spots on the skin resembling some bruises</li>
<li>Further, mosquito bites will result in reddish and puffy bumps that&rsquo;ll appear some minutes following the bite.</li>
<li>They cause reddish-brown, itchy, and hard bumps - which could also be multiple bumps that&rsquo;ll appear within the day after the bite.
Individuals who&rsquo;ll get adverse effects from mosquito bites include kids and adults that have immune system disorders or those who&rsquo;ve not previously been bitten by these bugs.
Further, mosquito bites reactions may have severe reactions including;</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
<li>Hives</li>
<li>Low-grade fever</li>
<li>Wide-area skin redness and swelling
<em>b. Spider Bite�</em>
The charactratics of spider bites from spiders such as the lack of widow spiders include pinprick-like, sharp, and immediate pain.
Also, the bite location will be numb.�Additional symptoms for bites from the black widow spider are;</li>
<li>Itchy skin rash</li>
<li>Excessive sweating</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Stiffness in the back, chest, shoulders, and painful muscle cramps</li>
<li>Vomiting and nausea</li>
<li>Excessive saliva production</li>
<li>Swollen and droopy eyes</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing
However, some of the bites from the spiders won&rsquo;t be immediately noticeable or painful. But the spider bite pain could be faced within 1 hour.
For the brown recluse, the spider bite symptoms will include;</li>
<li>The Bite area will have an itchy skin</li>
<li>Could lead to a skin ulcer and blisters (and later result in scars) - which start with reddish skin or bruises.
Finally, bites by Hobo spiders - and its bite on your skin will include;</li>

<li>Fatigue.</li>
<li>Pus-producing blisters</li>
<li>Swollen and red skin</li>
<li>Hardened bite-area skin</li>
<li>Severe headache that beings shortly after getting bitten - and the headache could remain active for about a week.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-causes-high-risk-illnesses">2. Causes High-Risk** i**llnesses?</h3>
<p><em>a. Mosquito bite�</em>
Mosquito bites will result in pink, red &amp; rounded, plus itchy bumps. But this bite could result in severe illnesses like eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), malaria, West Nile virus, and Zika virus.
Zika virus will, for many humans, result in a flu-like illness. However, newborns from mothers infected with this virus could get microcephaly�birth defects.
The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com">CDC notes</a>
that the West Nile virus was (in 2019) spread over 47 states of the US.</p>
<ul>
<li>The virus symptoms will be evident within 2 - 14 days - these include skin rash, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, body aches, and headaches.
Further, humans that get West Nile that&rsquo;s severe may develop encephalitis, meningitis, and other signs like convulsions, high fever, disorientation, severe headache, and neck stiffness.</li>
<li>But mosquitoes will largely infect humans with malaria - but the malaria cases have malaria transmission in the US.
The malaria flu will result in symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, muscle aches, headache, and fever. However, CDC notes that malaria is treatable &amp; preventable.
Another mosquito species known as
<em>Aedes scapularis is found in Latin and Caribbean America but also in Florida - as noted by the JMEntomology.�</em>
<em>b. Spider Bite�</em>
Spider bites won&rsquo;t largely result in grave problems. However, you could experience pain, swelling, and redness around the area with the spider bite.</li>
<li>But bites from spiders like the hobo spiders, brown recluse, and the black widow may result in more grave effects
Such effects may include muscle cramps that are painful, severe headaches, and trouble breathing - such effects from spider bites could need urgent medical care.
But how serious are these spider bites? Well, bites from most spiders will be harmless. All spiders will have the venom poison but many of them have small fangs that won&rsquo;t easily puncture the skin of a human.
So, which spider species will be venomous to humans? From the over 60 spider species, but only a few of these spiders will be dangerous - these include:</li>
<li>**Hobo spiders -**The brown-colored hobo spiders have a herringbone (V-shaped) of their belly - mainly occupying the Pacific Northwest. You&rsquo;ll find them on woodpiles, window wells, crawl spaces, moist &amp; dark basements - areas where they&rsquo;ll create their funnel-shaped webs.</li>
<li>**Brown recluses - **Also referred to all the violin or fiddle-back spiders, the spiders largely found in the Southern and Midwestern states. You&rsquo;ll largely find them in sheltered and dry places like on leaves, rocks, piles of wood. Also, you can find them in shoes, attics, and dark closets.</li>
<li>**Black widows -**These back window species will mainly occupy the outhouses, fence, woodpiles, and building eaves (overhangs) - and largely occupy the Southern &amp; Western U.S. Their belly has an hourglass shape that is colored red.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-difference-in-treatment-of-spider-and-mosquito-bites">The difference in Treatment of Spider and Mosquito Bites</h2>
<p>After identifying that bite, it&rsquo;s important to use the right technique to treat the various bug bites.
<strong>Treating Spider Bites:�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by quickly locating that spider which bit you. You might need to search those hiding or dark areas - this will help you identify if the bite is toxic.</li>
<li>For toxic spider bites such as from Brown recluse or Black Widow spider, you&rsquo;ll require emergency medical treatment.</li>
<li>Avoid home treatment if their spider at hand is noted to inject toxic through their bites</li>
<li>Thoroughly clean the spider bite, if the spider is identified as being non-toxic, and this will help avoid further infection</li>
<li>In addition, to prevent an additional allergic reaction from that spider bite, I advise you take some antihistamine
<strong>Treating Mosquito Bites:�</strong></li>
<li>Compared to the bites from ticks or spiders, mosquito bites are known to be largely harmless</li>
<li>So, unless there are serious symptoms such as fever or nausea, you won&rsquo;t require to take those drastic measures</li>
<li>To stop the skin itching after the mosquito bite, I recommend you rub some baking soda or salt.</li>
<li>For those with no sensitive skin or even younger kids, you can use calamine lotion</li>
<li>Further, for mosquito bites, you may use some mild treatments such as honey, tea bags, and ice.
In summary, compared to mosquito bites, some of the spider bites will be more toxic and life-threatening.
But with mosquito bites, it&rsquo;s important to take appropriate prevention steps while also controlling the resulting diseases plus easing the biting pain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On spider bite vs mosquito bite, in summary, that unsettling bite bump on your body could be from a mosquito or spider.
Spiders bites that are largely poisonous are the tarantula, hobo spider, black widow, and brown recluse.</p>
<ul>
<li>But mosquitoes will bite even when they&rsquo;re not threatened - mosquitoes aim to suck mosquitoes for reproduction and nutrition.</li>

<p>They are native to Myanmar but also originate in Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Singapore. They make deep burrows in the ground to live in tropical woods. When it&rsquo;s time to search for food, these tarantulas depart their lairs.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if you want to keep one as a pet, you must recreate their natural environment. It must be warm and humid, with plenty of burrowing substrate.
Cobalt blue tarantulas are medium-sized spiders that grow quickly, molting every four to six months. When spiderlings attain sexual maturity, they reveal their gender. Males develop a blue-gray color, while females remain blue.</li>
</ul>

<p>A
<a href="https://www.topflightdubia.com/cobalt-blue-tarantula-care">cobalt blue tarantula</a>
only emerges from its burrow when it&rsquo;s time to eat, and these spiders are formidable predators.
They move fast and seize prey at the burrow&rsquo;s farthest margins. They pull it back to their lair and consume it alive after injecting it with poisonous venom.
<strong>Categories of Food</strong>
Amphibians, insects such as cockroaches and crickets, mice, and other spiders are eaten by cobalt blues. Some people label their eating habits as &ldquo;greedy&rdquo; because they need a lot of energy to keep up with their quick growth.
Whatever they eat must be smaller than their carapace and must be alive and fresh, rather than frozen or dead. Each week, they can consume up to five huge insects.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not a good idea to feed your tarantula insects such as crickets or<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-cockroaches/">cockroaches</a>from your yard. To guarantee they&rsquo;re clear of worms or parasites, buy them from a pet food shop instead.
However, there isn&rsquo;t much you can do if a bug slips into your spider&rsquo;s enclosure and starts eating it. Just make sure any leftovers are thrown away.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-lifespan-and-health-concerns"><strong>2. Lifespan and Health Concerns</strong></h3>
<p>Female cobalt blue tarantulas can live for 20 to 25 years in captivity. Males have a shorter lifespan than females, ranging from five to ten years. They can live up to 30 or 20 years in the wild, depending on the species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common health problem for these arachnids in captivity is staying hydrated. They frequently become dehydrated. Critical factors for the roach include a moist substrate, water + humidity.
Also, if you don&rsquo;t clean the tank at least once a month, uneaten food might cause bacterial concerns in the substrate. If leftovers are left out for too long, parasites and mites might infect the tarantula.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-nature-of-conduct"><strong>3. Nature of Conduct</strong></h3>
<p>Cobalt blue tarantulas spend most of their time underground in burrows. They will come out at night to eat or build a spider web. They are usually pretty placid, yet they can be highly defensive and &ldquo;touchy&rdquo; in humans&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When threatened, cobalt blue tarantulas are not afraid to attack anyone or anything.
They also have a strong bite that injects a little amount of poison into its victim. Aside from that, they are peaceful, chill, and docile. To keep them occupied, they do not require a lot of exploration space or other sophisticated toys.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-molting-process"><strong>4. Molting Process</strong></h3>
<p>They will cease feeding when they start shedding or molting skin. They will lie down on their backs on the substrate and appear to be dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see something like this, do not be alarmed; it&rsquo;s very normal.
Exoskeleton removal might take anywhere from 15 minutes to many hours. During this time, do not touch or bother the spider because it could lead to their death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-procreation-habits"><strong>5. Procreation Habits</strong></h3>
<p>When a male is ready to reproduce, he makes a little silk sack to deposit his sperm inside.
He then stores this in his pedipalps and seeks out a female to mate with. If she accepts, a perilous and life-threatening mating ritual will be followed by them.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-safeguard-the-cobalt-blue-tarantula"><strong>How to Safeguard the Cobalt Blue Tarantula</strong></h2>
<p>The best way to keep a Cobalt blue tarantula secure is to learn everything there is to know about them before obtaining one as a pet, and there is a lot to learn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn as much as you can about the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-wall-gecko-poisonous-if-eaten/">animal&rsquo;s behavior in the wild</a>and in captivity. Then you will want to make sure your tarantula comes from a trustworthy breeder. Do not get one that has just been caught in the wild.
Then, to ensure that the tarantula&rsquo;s surroundings are to its liking, make sure you have a large enough glass tank with a secure top. Other pets, big or tiny, should be kept away from your tarantula.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-humans-face-a-threat-from-the-cobalt-blue-tarantula"><strong>Do Humans Face a Threat from the Cobalt Blue Tarantula?</strong></h2>
<p>Cobalt blues are naturally defensive; therefore if they feel threatened, they will attack.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post will answer the question &ldquo;What is a Hobo Spider?&rdquo; and give you 9 other interesting facts about these unique creatures!</p>
<p>Hobo spiders (Tegenaria agrestis) are aggressive
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/house-spiders/">house spiders</a>
; they like damp and dark areas like in brick crevices, basement, garage, behind furniture, under radiators, or between boxes.
**What Do **
**Hobo Spiders **
<strong>Look Like? - A summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Characteristics:**The eight-eyed Hobo spider does not have a typical eye arrangement for this species. A close look at the spider shows that its ALEs and AMEs are almost joined.</li>
<li>**Color:**Hobo spiders come in different shades of brown, so it&rsquo;s important to learn the distinguishing features but they&rsquo;ll look anything like the brown recluse spider and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/wolf-spiders/">wolf spiders</a>.</li>
<li>**Males:**The males of the species are typically shorter than 11 mm, with swollen appendages. The appendages are actually their reproductive organs.</li>
<li>**Females: **The female hobos have a length ranging from 11 mm - 14 mm. Their abdomens are larger than that of their male hobo spiders.
So, let&rsquo;s get into the details!
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spider Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-hobo-spider-are-they-serious">What Is A Hobo Spider? Are they Serious?</h2>
<p>**So, how can you tell a hobo spider? **
To tell if a spider is a hobo spider, look at its front body. The front body will be brown (with darker-brown markings) and it has brown legs and yellow abdomen markings.
<strong>Do They Bite?</strong>
They usually do not bite humans, contrary to popular belief. But if they feel threatened, or are provoked, they might.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hobo spiders will bite if they perceive a threat to their young ones or egg sacs - they&rsquo;ll be highly protective in this case.</li>
<li>Most people don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;re encroaching on the hobo spider, which typically hangs out in hidden and dark areas.</li>
<li>For the most part, they&rsquo;re harmless and just make webs but you need to know what they look like.
**Are They Dangerous? **
A previous study of the hobo spider venom reported that Hobo spiders are a medical threat and that they&rsquo;re cause necrotic lesions.</li>
<li>However, current research shows that hobo spiders<a href="https://www.usu.edu/today/story/hobo-spider-bite-may-not-be-so-dangerous">aren&rsquo;t medically threatening</a>
**Other Bug Problems **
The hobo spider, though an expert predator in its own right, is also preyed upon by other animals. These bugs include:</li>
<li>Centipedes</li>
<li>Birds</li>
<li>Bees,Mud-dauber wasps, and hornets</li>
<li>Spiders such as the wolf spider</li>
<li>Rodents and furry animals likesquirrelsor chipmunks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hobo-spider-ecology-habitat-and-distribution">Hobo Spider Ecology, Habitat, and Distribution</h2>
<p><strong>Where are hobo spiders found?</strong>
The spiders in the Agelenidae Family, including the Hobo spiders, spin entangled silk webs that serve as their prey traps, detection devices, and nests.</p>
<p>It is often seen on fence posts and tree branches as the sunset with its web being used to capture small insects flying overhead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally when found in buildings, it will be found seeking shelter under boxes or other debris.
**Their Webs? **
Hobo spiders will weave webs that are funnel-shaped with sticky silk that sticks to small insects flying by them while they are hunting for prey on their webs - they use them also as mating grounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&rsquo;ll create the webs in a tangle of vegetation or at the edge of trees and usually have more than one attachment point to the ground, such as stones or branches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Females stay within their web as males wander in search of mates.
<strong>What Do They Eat?</strong>
The primary food source of Hobo spiders is insects and arachnids, on which they feed until the animal dies. They are also known to prey upon other spiders and arthropods.</li>
<li>Once their prey touches the web triggers (detection devices), there are vibrations on the silken line that&rsquo;ll alert the Hobo.
Though the Hobo Spider bite is not often lethal, some of the symptoms such as necrosis are similar to what you get with bites from the brown recluse.
<strong>Geographic Range</strong>
They&rsquo;re largely Native to Europe but you&rsquo;ll mainly find Hobo Spiders in parts of;</li>
<li>Asia</li>
<li>Europe</li>
<li>The Pacific Northwest US</li>
<li>Montana</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>Utah</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>Wyoming</li>
<li>Oregon, and</li>
<li>Washington.
**Reproduction **
The male Hobo Spider (Tegenaria agrestis) mate with their receptive female counterparts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The male Hobos die or move on soon after the mating process.</p>
<p>So, the female spider is the one who does all of the work to produce new offspring.</p>
<ul>
<li>She lays a single egg sac, and then she guards it against predators until her babies hatch.</li>
<li>The young spiders will wait for their mother on top of or next to her web as she goes out hunting for food; after she returns with prey in tow, they will climb onto her back and feed while riding home again to protect themselves from potential danger along the way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-a-hobo-spider-poisonous">Is a hobo spider poisonous?</h2>
<p>No, the Hobo Spider is not venomous and does not pose any threat to humans or animals -
according to the CDC
.</p>
<p>Recent
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7488.html">studies</a>
show that the venom of the hobo spider does not create significant skin reactions in animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, some people are allergic to their bite and can develop symptoms such as local swelling, itching around the area bitten by the spider, headache, nausea, or vomiting, and general malaise.
If you experience these symptoms after being bit please seek medical attention immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hobos spiders do have an &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; reputation, but they are not venomous creatures. They will typically feed off smaller insects like flies and arachnids.</p>
<p>Notable spiders that have dangerous venom in the US are like the brown recluse or the black widow.</p>
<p>Hobo spiders are not known to be aggressive; instead, they show a tendency to flee and hide when disturbed.</p>
<p>The hobo spider is also not known to be found in areas where humans live, but they are often spotted on the sides of buildings or other places such as a barn.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-kill-a-hobo-spider">Should I kill a Hobo Spider?</h2>
<p>If you can avoid it&rsquo;s best not to kill hobo spiders, since having some spiders around helps keep down pests such as cockroaches; however, there are exceptions to this rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, were born with a natural fear of spiders, as evidenced by the physical response we have every time we see or touch one.
Therefore, sometimes we may have to kill these hobo spiders as a last resort if they are infesting our home and cannot be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hobo spider is not known to be poisonous; however, it can bite humans which may cause some discomfort but usually, no permanent damage will occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should kill hobos by using an aerosol product for killing insects such as bug spray and undertakethorough spider vacuuming.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-you-do-if-you-find-a-hobo-spider">What Do You Do If You Find A Hobo Spider?</h2>
<p>If you find a hobo spider, please contact an exterminator for
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-much-do-spider-exterminators-cost/">spider inspection and control</a>
as they have venomous fangs.</p>
<p>The spider exterminator may employ these steps to get rid of a hobo spider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum to get rid of those spiderwebs. Also, change your vacuum filter regularly; ideally, monthly.</li>
<li>Prevent wandering spiders from entering homes byinstalling sticky trapsin dark, damp places like basements and closets.</li>
<li>Use suitable insecticide powders, sprays, and dust (carefully following label instructions) on crevices, doorways, windows, and baseboards
Spray window screens, door thresholds, and garage doors with the insecticide.
<strong>If you find a hobo spider outdoors</strong>
where it is not dark or damp:</li>
<li>Knockdown the webs (if any) to eliminate hiding places for wandering spiders;</li>
<li>Eliminate their food sources by keeping vegetation trimmed back from foundations of buildings and sidewalks;</li>
<li>Place sticky traps in areas of high-traveling activity near exterior walls.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-a-hobo-spider-kill-a-dog-or-cat">Can a hobo spider kill a Dog or Cat?</h2>
<p>Recent studies shoes that hobo spider�bites aren&rsquo;t harmful or won&rsquo;t kill your cat or dog; this is unlike the case with
**brown recluse and the **
black widow that&rsquo;s fatal to pets and humans.</p>
<p>If your pet or child is bitten by a hobo spider and shows signs of illness, contact the vet immediately for treatment advice.</p>
<p>Since hobos will typically stay in dark corners like sheds, basements, etc., you&rsquo;ll need to sweep them out with a broom into an outdoor area where they can&rsquo;t get back inside and then vacuum up their webs.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there&rsquo;s no access point outside that allows them to re-enter, use sticky traps as well because these spiders also live on walls.
The signs of a bite from such spiders on the cat or dog may include agitation, tremors, diarrhea, muscle rigidity, vomiting, cramping, and muscle pain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on the question of &ldquo;What is a Hobo Spider?&rdquo; we hope this article has been helpful.</p>
<p>Hobo spider bites rarely result in serious medical issues but may cause swelling at the site of injury along with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, and headache.</p>
<p>As always, happy spider hunting!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This question of what kills spiders instantly is very tricky. Why
kill the spiders
when a large number are harmless? Some eat mosquitoes and other bugs in our homes and play an important role in the ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>**So, what kills spiders instantly? Well, use essential oils, vinegar, diatomaceous earth, ammonia, bleach **<strong>among others. You can also use pest control products that kill fast though on the other hand, their safety levels are questionable.�</strong>
That notwithstanding, spiders in our houses-whether venomous or not make our houses look untidy. Related:

<h2 id="what-kills-spiders-instantly---a-safer-and-quicker-remedy">What Kills Spiders Instantly? -� A Safer and Quicker Remedy</h2>
<p>Though most spiders are harmless in our homes, some are a serious threat within the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the US some spiders like the black widow and brown recluse are very common and may force you to take immediate action against all spiders in your house.
As a homeowner, when killing those harmful spiders, always take note of the ways that are also safe and maybe the natural ways of doing it. Essential oils, vinegar, cider, ammonia, diatomaceous earth can be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth"><strong>1. Diatomaceous Earth</strong></h3>
<p>This is a white powder that is very common for use in our households to control
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-antennae/">common bugs and pests</a>
. The good thing about this powder is that it is safe for home use even when there are children and pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>This powder works by dehydrating spiders causing them to die. It absorbs the soils, waters, and fats from the spiders causing their death.</li>
<li>After contact with DE, it will not take more than 24 hours before the spider dies.� This powder also remains active
Also, the DE remains active as long as you are able to keep it intact and also dry within your house.
When applying a tablespoon of DE mixed in a bottle will effectively do the work of killing those venomous spiders and other bugs hiding within and outside your house.</li>
<li>Spray the target areas being careful not to inhale the dust because it is harmful.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ToC2kQm5Bk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ToC2kQm5Bk</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-vinegar"><strong>2. Vinegar</strong></h3>
<p>This is still another useful product within your house that you can use to control or kill spiders. Vinegar has acetic acid which plays a vital role in chasing spiders from our houses.</p>
<ul>
<li>It chases spiders by producing a strong odor that keeps them off.</li>
<li>Vinegar is very common in most homes and also safe to use where there are pets and children.
Before you can use vinegar in control against spiders, mix it with water in a ratio of 1:1 and then spray it around the infested area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ammonia-mixed-with-water-">**3. Ammonia Mixed With Water� **</h3>
<p>Ammonia is a good agent for use against spiders. It works by producing a staunch smell that rebels against them. However, it cannot be used alone and should be mixed with water in the ratio of 1:1.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have achieved this, you can then proceed to spray it around the affected areas to chase away the spiders.
Ammonia has also been used as one of the active ingredients to manufacture Windex which is used to kill spiders both outdoors and indoors.

This leaves the spider with nothing to eat and with no choice but to relocate where there is food.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-vacuum-cleaning-and-dusting-">**7. Vacuum cleaning and dusting **</h3>
<p>Though this does not involve the use of chemicals and substances, dusting helps keep your house off spiders. Spiders love dusty areas where they can establish cobwebs to trap their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>With proper and regular dusting, spiders will not be able to thrive in such an environment.
Alternatively, vacuum cleaning is also a good option for dusting your home and keeping off spiders and also other insects.</li>
</ul>

From the
<a href="https://www.livescience.com/22122-types-of-spiders.html">over 40,000 spiders species</a>
, like argiopes or garden orb weavers only survive for a single season - they&rsquo;ll die over winter but will leave their eggs in sacs ready to hatch. But tarantula or fishing <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> live longer.</p>
<p><strong>Spiders hibernate under attics, cellars, piles of leaves, rocks (rock piles), sheds, garages, underground burrows, or trees. So, do spiders hibernate?�</strong>
Well,
<a href="https://cc.zdtc.app/v1/otc/05YcxvrJv7bM0tkN3uaIbHd?veneer=dynamic&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.burkemuseum.org%2Fblog%2Fmyth-spiders-come-indoors-fall">just 5% of spiders spicies</a>
hibernate to indoor spaces such as your home during <a href="/posts/10-winter-landscaping-ideas-to-spruce-up-your-outdoor-space/">winter</a>. Most spiders won&rsquo;t try getting into your house during winter - it was just a spider myth. Spiders are cold blooded and thus may die or fail to reproduce when they get into your warm house.</p>
<h2 id="details-where-do-spiders-go-in-the-winter">Details: Where Do Spiders Go in the Winter?</h2>
<p>Through natural instincts, the spiders will move to better sheltered areas during winter. These include rock piles, bark cracks on trees or under leaf litter. During winter, the favorable conditions in these areas plus their antifreeze keep the fleas alive.
In addition. spiders like the tarantula will lay their eggs during spring and thus will safely cross the harsh winter as babies in their protective cocoons.
Further, some of the baby spiders, after hatching, will hide in the egg sacs that are webbed for use by the whole spider community over the winter period.
However, the spiders that&rsquo;ll be hiding under rock piles and leaf litter� won&rsquo;t be sleeping (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-sleep/">spiders don&rsquo;t sleep</a>
) but may be moving around searching for food.</p>
<h3 id="1-outdoor-spiders">1 Outdoor Spiders</h3>
<p>Sutdoor spiders� will live very comfortably in your outdoor spaces but won&rsquo;t easily survive the conditions in the indoors. E.g. North American spider can&rsquo;t survive the winter in the indoor shelters.</p>
<p>As &ldquo;cold-blooded&rdquo; insects, spiders won&rsquo;t be attracted to conditions of warmth in the indoor spaces. Thus, spider&rsquo;s won;t get cold or shiver from the winter - they become come dormant and less active.
The outdoor spiders will hibernate into indoor spaces but won&rsquo;t reproduce or they&rsquo;ll even die.
Further, spiders come with &ldquo;antifreeze&rdquo; in their bodies - particularly those from temperate areas. Therefore, antifreeze prevents the spider&rsquo;s body from freezing at temperatures above about -5 C.</p>
<h3 id="2-indoor-or-house-spiders">2. Indoor or House spiders</h3>
<p>The indoor or house spiders are few in terms of species but they&rsquo;ll conditioned to live in the indoor conditions - i.e. limited water supply, bad food supply, and constant climate.
Historically, some species of the house spiders (mainly found in Europe) are known to have always lived in the indoor spaces. The spiders have moved worldwide and some are conditioned to live in the outdoor spaces such as in North America.
These house spiders will occupy your house through
<a href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-all-spiders-make-webs">eggs sacs</a>
that comes with building materials or old furniture. They&rsquo;ll mainly live in the house and only emerge during
<a href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-late-summer-has-most-spiders">the last summer</a>
(which is around September &amp; August).
The baby and female spiders will hibernate in the neglected spaces, behind appliances or furniture, storage rooms, and crawlspaces. Notably, just a small percentage of the house spiders will ever more outdoors.</p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-survive-winter">How Spider&rsquo;s Survive Winter</h2>
<h3 id="1-antifreeze">1. &ldquo;Antifreeze&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Spiders living in the colder regions have an�&ldquo;antifreeze&rdquo; - and adaptation that helps prevent their body from freezing during the cold or winter season.
If the temperatures begin to fall, then the spider&rsquo;s body accumulates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol">glycol compounds</a>
(this acts like the antifreeze) in the blood. The antifreeze will work just like the engine antifreeze.
The glycol enables the tissues in the spider to stay
<a href="https://arthropodecology.com/2016/01/05/frozen-spiders/">unfrozen withvery low temperatures</a>
. However, this method is a short term remedy used by the spiders during winter.
Thus, the spider hibernates to the favorable areas such as neglected spaces, behind appliances or furniture, storage rooms, soil or snow layer and crawlspaces - the
<a href="https://northernwoodlands.org/outside_story/article/subnivean-shelter-snow">subnivean zone</a>
.
The favorable zone will insulate spiders against harsh winter conditions like cold but allow them to run around searching food. But, during the spring, the spiders will eventually stop generating the antifreeze as the air and temperature clears.</p>
<h3 id="2-nests">2. Nests</h3>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, spiders eggs will die from the low and freezing temperatures - and thus they&rsquo;ll do the best to ensure the eggs will survive through winter.
Most of the spiders will produce eggs (after mating)
<a href="https://www.wpr.org/what-happens-spiders-winter">during early fall</a>
. Therefore, the spiders will search favorable places to lay and hide their eggs as the temperatures fall.
These include secluded, dark or hidden areas such as burrows, downspouts, chimneys. This allows the spider eggs to rain alive and warm through winter waiting for spring to hatch.
Further, the spiders create webs that look like webs - creating a safe haven for the eggs. The spiders also create a web wall that&rsquo;ll overall the bare cracks or corners.
After winter or when the temperatures and conditions become better, the baby spiders will gnaw away the spider webs to jump off to the environment.</p>
<h3 id="3-house">3. House</h3>
<p>Definitely some spiders may look onto your house as a safe place to hide away from the harsh and freezing winter climate. Just like
bed bugs
, the spiders will sneak into your home for safety.
Spiders search for humid and warm conditions during winter where they can create their safety webs. Therefore, your home offers the favorable conditions.
The bugs will climb onto roof shingles, siding, walls, windows and get into your home. Also, dark pantries, closets, basements, and attics will be suitable locations for the spiders to hide in your house.
Considering a food sources, spiders will also search for a location that&rsquo;ll enable them to hunt for their prey. Therefore, spiders can prey on other pests that&rsquo;re bugging you during winter.</p>
<h3 id="4-insulation">4. Insulation</h3>
<p>Spiders are equally intelligent bugs that&rsquo;ll create insulation against the freezing winter conditions - they&rsquo;ll
<a href="http://www.actforlibraries.org/spiders-in-winter/">build a warm pod</a>
waiting for warmer months.
The spiders will build the pods on secluded and enclosed places where they&rsquo;ll build web covering the openings to make something looking like their egg nests.
The pod&rsquo;s web will prevent the cold air for hitting the spiders and their eggs for them to survive winter conditions. However, other spiders create the pads under snow or the soil for additional insulation.</p>
<p>Spiders will also insulate their bodies and eggs by building on building sidings and roof corners. However, the bugs will break off from the webs when its warmer to hunt for food.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike the
Black Widow Spiders
, the Wolf Spiders are big hunting spiders that will not require webs to affectively trap their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the United States, youll find 2 main species of the Wolf Spiders (Lycosidae spp); H. aspersa and the Hogna carolinensis.
The Lycosidae family (where the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> belongs) are arachnids that have athletic, hairy, and have a large body size.
The Lycos bit means &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; due to the wolf-like hunting habits but the spiders are solitary animals and thus they hunt alone and not in packs.

<h2 id="wolf-spider-appearance">Wolf Spider Appearance</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about your traditional spider then the wolf spiders won&rsquo;t match that body and behavior archetype.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, wolf spiders will not spin webs but instead hunt down their prey just like wolves.</li>
<li>The Lycosidae (meaning wolf in Greek) may have some similarities with the tarantulas but they are smaller and come from a different family.
Wolf spiders have brown to Gray (and hairy) bodies that have varied lines or markings.</li>
<li>The male spiders are about 19 mm (3/4&quot;) in length while their female counterparts are 23 to 24 mm (3/8&quot; - 1&quot;).
The male carolinensis measure about 18 - 20 millimeters while the females have a length of 22 - 35 millimeters.
The male Tigrosa aspersa measure about 16 - 18 millimeters while the females measure about 18 - 25 millimeters.
The darker color of the wolf spiders helps them camouflage and hide from their predators and approach their prey unnoticed.
The Hogna ingens (desertas wolf spiders) are documented who has the longest body with their legs spanning about 12 cm.
The wolf spiders have eyes that are arranged into three rows.</li>
<li>The eyes in the first row are small-sized (4), those in the second row are larger (2), and finally, the eyes in the bathroom are medium-sized (2).
A unique feature of the eyes in the wolf spiders is that the eyes in their central row are considerably larger.
Next, you should check if the end of the spider&rsquo;s legs 3 claws (tarsal claws).</li>
<li>The tarsal may be described as the last segment in the legs of an insect.
The wolf spiders are in the infra-order Araneomorphae ( &ldquo;true spiders&rdquo;) and the members in this group have pincer-like fangs that have a side-by-side orientation.</li>
<li>The side-by-side oriented fang will help you differentiate the wolf spiders from the small tarantula.</li>
<li>The latter (the small tarantula) are classified in the infraorder Mygalomorphae that come with fangs that are vertically-oriented.
On comparing the brown recluse with the wolf spiders; the wolf spiders have shorter legs and they lack the marking behind-the-head (violin-shaped) which is characteristic in the brown recluse.

The wolf spiders also have hairs that cover their abdomen -
<a href="https://www.uky.edu/Ag/CritterFiles/casefile/spiders/wolf/wolf.htm">Kentucky Entomology</a>
.</li>
<li>This feature may make you confuse them with the tarantula but the wolf spiders are smaller in body size.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wolf-spider-behavior">Wolf Spider Behavior</h2>
<p>As noted above the wolf spiders are hunting arachnids (theyre great sprinters) and so they won&rsquo;t lay webs to catch their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is where the wolf spiders derived their name from because they will hunt down their prey.
Where can you find the wolf spiders? The habitat of the wolf spiders includes the rainforests, alpine meadows, wetlands, coastal forests, inland shrublands, deserts, and dry or Woodlands.</li>
<li>But some species of wolf spiders may occupy suburban gardens, riverbank beds, mountains herbal fields, and coastal sand dunes.
The
<a href="https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=847731">ITIS</a>
reports that the wolf spiders (Lycosidae) have about 2400 species that are classified into 123+ genera.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wolf-spider-habitat">Wolf Spider Habitat</h2>
<p>Examine whether the spider under consideration will retreat to some burrow. The burrows may be found on outbuildings, around the house, and windows or doors.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will identify the spider as a wolf spider if it tends to move into a crevice or burrow as opposed to a web.
But the trap doors and the tarantulas also tend to move into burrows but they are relatively larger in size compared to the wolf spiders.
Another characteristic feature of the wolf spiders is that they will be comfortable on the ground spying on their prey and they will rarely climb onto tall objects.
As noted earlier the wolf spiders will have some white sack (containing eggs) on the back of the abdomen during the summer and spring seasons.</li>
<li>Also, the female wolf spiders tend to carry they are spiderlings on their backs.
Wolf spiders hunt their prey (including caterpillars and crickets) during the night (thanks to having a great night vision) and day.</li>
<li>But the shining of their eyes during the night makes them also be detected easily.
Finally, the wolf spiders are classified as very fast - an adaptation that helps them catch their prey very fast.
The main habitats of the wolf spiders are low vegetation, gravel, stream edges but may sometimes climb on trees although you will mainly find them on the ground.
Wolf spiders can enter your house through breezeways, crawl spaces, and basements.
Females with large bodies can eat small reptiles and amphibians but wolf spiders generally eat other spiders, crickets, and ground-dwelling insects.
Wolf spiders utilize their vibrations sensitivity, fast movement, excellent camouflage, and keen eyesight to avoid predators such as hunting wasps, birds, and lizards.

<h2 id="how-dangerous-are-the-wolf-spiders">How Dangerous Are The Wolf Spiders</h2>
<p>Wolf spiders will only bite humans when mishandled or if they feel threatened.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arachnids will only socialize during the mating season and thus they will walk as lone wolves.
Wolf spiders are venomous but are not classified as poisonous to humans - as reported by
<a href="http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/wolf-spiders">Penn State College</a>
.
This means that the venom produced by The wolf spiders will paralyze the small and crawling insects but won&rsquo;t be toxic people.</li>
<li>In comparison, the wolf spider bite is classified (on pain level and the danger posed) just under a bee sting.
The wolf spider bite will cause redness and pain in most humans but these side effects will go off gradually.
So if you have noticed a spider that is moving fast in the house, most likely it is a wolf spider since the brown recluse spiders don&rsquo;t come out in the open regularly.
When ready to mate, the female wolf spiders will drop scent markings that will help the males locate them.</li>
<li>The males will wave their pedipalps (the sensory appendages around the mouths) and legs to signal their courtship intentions to the females.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So what should I do when I see a wolf spider? You can evade the wolf spider bites by avoiding picking or touching (or even squishing) them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squishing the female wolf spiders may also damage the eggs sacs on their backs and thus may drop hundreds of them and spiderlings in your house - you canuse spider bombs to contol them.
Wolf spiders are mainly walking on the ground and will rarely climb on tall objects or structures.</li>
