<p>But first, the term
<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/moving-away-from-knee-osteoarthritis">bad knees</a>
is way too broad. However, with bad knees, you should work your knees without jarring them to reduce pain and to make them stronger.</p>
<p>Appropriate workouts for your bad knees should incorporate non-plyometric exercises such as sitting back in the squat and avoiding the plyometric exercises such as jumping.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_QZ4dh51ic">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_QZ4dh51ic</a></p>
<h2 id="how-to-exercise-with-bad-knees-to-lose-weight">How to Exercise With Bad Knees to Lose Weight</h2>
<h3 id="1-walking">1. Walking</h3>
<p>Walking is awesome low-impact cardio that will reduce your knee pain. Unlike most bad pain sufferers who take up activity avoidance, you adopt different aerobic exercises such as walking. Such exercises are
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279766">recommended</a>
as they will improve your knees muscle quality and fight sarcopenia.</p>
<p>Luckily, walking and light
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/">running with the right footwear</a>
and cushioned shoes�is a non-pharmacologic therapy, and thus you wont need to take medications. Notably, walking has been wide studies and approved for the disabled and elderly population.</p>
<p>Further, taking long-term walking plans can largely improve your knee pain and body functioning and slows physical function declining, also among the disabled people.</p>
<p>According to a recent
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15696558">study</a>
, increased mobility such as walking in the aerobic treatment is significantly correlated with better ankle and knee angular velocities. Also, adhering to physical activity plans improves physical function and general mobility.</p>
<p>Walking increases your heart rate and would be appropriate during bad weather as you can do it indoors. However, avoid walking on just one place for an extended period since it can strain your knees: mix up the steps for best results.</p>
<p>While walking, make sure you keep your upper body nice and tall while your shoulders should be back and down and pull your abs towards your spine to lose the most amount of calories possible.</p>
<h3 id="2-elliptical-trainer">2. Elliptical Trainer</h3>
<p>Like walking and stationary bicycles, elliptical trainers are considered low impact exercises because they produce circular motion.</p>
<p>The elliptical trainers mimic the cross-country skiing movements, and thus youll exercise through pedal resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, increasing the pedal resistance will enable your muscles to work harder and enhancing aerobic exercise.</p>
<p>Interestingly, with the elliptical trainer  unlike the treadmill  your feet will not leave the machine pedals, and thus there is a reduced possibility of injuring the bad knees.</p>
<h3 id="3-swimming">3. Swimming</h3>
<p>Swimming with your bad knee will be effective in losing weight. Itll assist in improving your flexibility and strengthening your muscles and bones.</p>
<p>Compared to other cardio exercises, swimming will have minimal stress on the bad knees. The buoyancy force will act on your body and hence reduce the tension on the knees and your joints.</p>
<p>Further, due to the reduced pain, youll find yourself working out longer in the water compared to other cardio training.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Therefore, if you are suffering from a specific condition or injury, you should know that not all the exercises we described will appropriate. Therefore, listen to your bodys reaction and follow your doctors recommendations, if are under some for that condition.</p>

You should consider bad knees as just a hurdle to overcome, and never an excuse to evade running and exercise - running with bad knees.</p>
<p>However, take caution while running with a bad knee since any weight-bearing exercise could increase knee pain.</p>
<p>I know, there are significant arguments out there that running with a bad knee could lead to osteoarthritis. However, according to a recent study by
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22632690">Hansen Utah Orthopaedic Centre</a>
, moderate and low volume runners have reduced the risk of developing osteoarthritis compared to non-runners.</p>
<p>Here are the critical factors to consider before embarking on running with a bad knee: muscle problems, ligament tear, and cartilage tear, to have painless running. Read Also:

<h3 id="take-a-break">Take a Break</h3>

&ldquo;Bad knees&rdquo;  the root of most of my fitness challenges  is a collection of injuries that occur to the knee.
The injuries are classified into two: (1) traumatic/ acute injuries and (2) overuse injuries - check these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-walking-shoes-for-men-with-flat-feet/">shoes if you&rsquo;ve flat feet</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-truly-means-to-have-bad-knees">What it truly means to have Bad Knees?</h2>
<p>Most people, experience the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome">patellar pain syndrome</a>
, a kind of knee overuse injury, which involves pain, soreness, and discomfort at the fore and below the kneecap.
Due to bad knees, I was hesitant to do lower body days or even work out the legs since all thought of with the lunges and squats was the pain or additional injury it would cause if I didnt do it right.</p>
<p>You can take different movements that would work your posterior chain to allow the hamstrings and glutes to prevent knee pain.
However, the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/FrameWork-Knee-6-Step-Preventing-Injury/dp/1605295930/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;ascsub&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=p-policy-20&amp;linkId=873671e9e1be6d13419f783a68892104">book</a>
by Nicholas notes that bad knees occur due to overloading the joint with repetitive movements such as excessive lunges, squats, and running, mainly with limited recovery time.</p>
<ul>
<li>If done right and with the correct intensity, duration, and frequency, the above exercises can help improve your bad knee by strengthening muscles supporting the knees like quads, hamstrings, and glutes.
Things youll need to avoid: an abrupt change in your workouts such as everyday training, going to a crazy workout or gymnasium or increasing your runs or racing coverage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="traumatic-or-acute-injury">Traumatic or Acute Injury</h2>
<p>The acute bad knee injury happens because of twisting action or trauma. The amount of pain experienced will depend on the mechanism of induction and its severity. However, avoid excessively strenuous exercise as they could advance the knee injury and pain.</p>
<h3 id="a-anterior-cruciate-ligament-acl-sprain">(a) Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sprain</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury">ACL</a>sprains happened regularly in sports that entail sudden directional changes such as contact sports. Such an injury could also include, knee joint injury and swelling.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament">MCL</a>injury is characterized by a ligament tear in the inner side of the knee. MCL injury happens because of twisting and impact motion. However, MCL sprain could also emerge due to knee joint twisting or falling.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="any-remedies">Any remedies</h2>
<p>Most of the outlined bad knees issue listed above can be prevented by keeping your bad knee safe.</p>
<h3 id="appropriate-exercises">Appropriate exercises</h3>
<p>Notably, your bad knee will not love an intensive workout. Therefore, youll have to shift the workout plan to make the knee to familiarise.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may begin with working out or exercising for about 3 days per week. During this period, you can increase the workout time and intensity while considering your bodys reaction.</li>
<li>If, you&rsquo;ll be jogging or running, ensure you acquire the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/">right shoes for bad knees</a>.�As we had noted earlier, it is essential to take breaks in your workout plans to give your bad knee enough time to recover.</li>
<li>Therefore, for our current workout plan, you can take about 2 resting days during which time the body will recover.
Notably, avoid rushing to a new sport without training the relevant muscles. For example, if youll be starting tennis in the next month, ensure you strength train relevant muscles, which will prepare you to handle the physical stress resulting from the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="balance-your-workouts">Balance your workouts</h3>
<p>Like your proper and healthy diet, exercises should come in a balanced manner. Therefore, avoid following a similar workout plan over and over again: itll weaken your joints, and its monotonous too.
