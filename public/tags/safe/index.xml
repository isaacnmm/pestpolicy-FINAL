      <description>Hey Pet Lovers &amp;amp; Pet Parents,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Pet Lovers &amp; Pet Parents,</p>
<p>Maybe you know that borax (sodium borate) is as a cleaner and antiseptic. Also, it&rsquo;s used in toothpastes, water softener, pesticide, and mouthwashes.</p>
<p>Well, recently, we discussed how borax can be used
as a flea killer
around the house. But how safe is it around
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-borax-safe-for-dogs/">dogs</a>
and cats.
**Is borax safe for cats? **
**Yes and No. **
**Cats, and kittens are more sensitive to the toxicity of borax than humans are - and if your cat ingests a large amount (5 grams and above), it damages their internal organs and skin which can cause poisoning, breathlessness, allergies, and death. **</p>
<ul>
<li>**Moreover, inhaling sodium borate powder can inflame or irritate the respiratory system&rsquo;s mucous membrane. **</li>
<li><strong>Normally, dogs and cats do not lick sodium borate. But if they have it on their paws, they may lick it.</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best <a href="/posts/is-borax-safe-for-dogs/">Fleas</a> Treatment for Cats&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
<li><a href="/posts/borax-flea-killer/">Borax</a> and boric acid are considered safer pesticides in comparison to other chemicals in killing fleas, ants, roaches, and fleas.</li>
<li>The 20 Mule-Team Borax is one of the borax-based cleaning products. However, borax is safe for cats if ingested in small and EPA-approved amounts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-borax-safe-for-cats-borax-for-fleas">Is Borax Safe for Cats? Borax for Fleas</h2>
<p>If ingested in small amounts in ingested as recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency, Borax is safe and won&rsquo;t harm your small pets including cats and dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite not being very toxic, if borax is ingested in large amounts by your hamsters, dogs, or cats, it may be toxic compared to its effects on humans.</li>
<li>Similarly, inhaling sodium borate may inflame or irritate the respiratory system.*But borax will be safe for your cat and kittens. *
Its rare that your cats and dogs will lick the Borax (sodium borate) directly. But if the borax is stuck on the claws of these felines and canines, they may ingest it as they clean their claws.</li>
</ul>
<p>Borax is not harmful to cats - at least when used properly by manufacturers&rsquo; instructions. Boraxo or 20 Mule-Team Boragon can be purchased from most grocery stores without any issue whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="is-borax-great-for-killing-ants-and-fleas">Is Borax Great for Killing Ants and Fleas?</h2>
<p>Yes, borax is safe for cats. Its a popular way of getting rid of fleas, as it dehydrates them while also killing them.</p>
<p>As a result, fleas have no defense against borax. Borax penetrates their skin to get to the larvae and kill them outright. But eggs that are still forming couldn&rsquo;t be penetrated by the borax solution.</p>
<p>Borax is fatal to ants, it&rsquo;ll damage the bug&rsquo;s digestive system and
exterminates the ants within 24-48 hours</p>
<ul>
<li>removing the ant queen and the other colony.</li>
<li>The first step in eliminating an ant infestation is figuring out where they&rsquo;re entering your home.</li>
<li>When ants find food they need to share it with other ants in their colony by leaving behind some pheromone trail.
Actually Borax has some advantages over traditional pesticides such as DEET-based products because it doesn&rsquo;t kill the good bugs like pollinators that are needed to make our food plants grow.
It&rsquo;s also not toxic to humans when ingested in amounts less than what you would get from simply using it once on your carpet; however if swallowed, vomiting may occur due to stomach irritation by gastric fluids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symptoms-of-borax-poisoning-in-cats"><strong>Symptoms of Borax Poisoning in Cats</strong></h2>
<p>The symptoms of toxicity in cats after taking excessive amounts of borax include:</p>
<ul>
<li>If swallowed, vomiting may occur due to stomach irritation by gastric fluids.</li>
<li>Excessive salivation or drooling</li>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Dropping food from the mouth and eating non-food items such as dirt and stones</li>
<li>Loss of appetite (anorexia)</li>
<li>Nervousness or excitability during initial exposure stages followed by depression following chronic intoxication stage.
Signs are most severe between 24 hours after ingestion until 36 hours after ingestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>When ingested in small amounts that would be a normal amount for someone with sensitive skin; however, if swallowed it can cause nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-treat-borax-poisoning-in-cats">How to Treat Borax Poisoning in Cats</h3>
<p>In the event your cat comes into contact with borax, a veterinary doctor should administer treatment to avoid toxicity. If your cat ingested borax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the animal from the area of exposure to prevent further ingestion of the chemical (if not already done).</li>
<li>I would recommend dialysis on the cat as this will easily remove the borax from the animal&rsquo;s body. You may also use IV fluids on the cat to help reduce the effect of borax.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use activated charcoal and don&rsquo;t force the cat to vomit
For further precaution, was the cat thorough using
some mild detergent
or that suitable
cat shampoo
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-borax-on-cat-fleas">Using borax on cat fleas</h2>
<p>Borax is not recommended as a flea control product. It can be used to eliminate carpets, but it does not kill the eggs or larvae of fleas and ticks in your home.</p>
<p>Borax also doesn&rsquo;t work well on hard surfaces and has no residual effect which means that you will still need to use other products if you want complete protection from these pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, if you do decide to apply borax powder directly onto the fur of your pet, we recommend that you only use one teaspoon at a time as this will dramatically reduce any risks associated with its application.
Remember to wash them after they have been outside because fleas and ticks are attracted to their blood which means they could potentially come back inside with them from areas where there&rsquo;s an infestation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Borax is safe for cats plus another small pest if used as intended. Always go for brands and quantities that are
<a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-011001_1-Sep-93.pdf">EPA-registered</a>
for your intended use to reduce chances of toxicity.</p>
<p>If you are trying to control fleas in your cat, fill borax into crevices, cracks, and carpet and leave it there for around 24 hours before vacuuming it. Don&rsquo;t put the borax powder directly on your cat&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>For fleas, borax will damage their exoskeletons but for other insects like termites, ants, and
cockroaches
, it&rsquo;ll cause stomach poisoning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle Borax across the floor, and in carpets. This is great for fleas, as it kills their larvae, but may not exterminate the adult fleas since they&rsquo;ll only feed on pet blood.
Therefore, Borax must be used only as part of a comprehensive flea or ant-treatment program since it may not eliminate these insects alone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The safety of borax for cats is a contentious issue, with some claiming it to be hazardous while others maintain that it can be safe when used correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax for Fleas: Borax is not very effective in killing cat flea and may be toxic if used in large amounts - 5 grams and over.</li>
<li>So, before settling on using borax, employ other flea and ant control methods like IGRs and pyrethrin sprays.</li>
<li>This is less of a concern for dogs, which do not groom themselves as regularly and so are likely to ingest fewer particles.
In short: Borax can be safe if used in appropriate amounts - but should always be used only with other methods of flea control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always store it well in places out of reach of both your children and pets since they may accidentally ingest it. Also, get rid of any spillages.</p>

      <description>The first question is, is borax safe for dogs? The answer to this question is that it depends on the amount and how often they are exposed.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first question is, is <a href="/posts/is-borax-safe-for-cats/">borax</a> <a href="/posts/pet-safe-roach-killer/">safe</a> for dogs? The answer to this question is that it depends on the amount and how often they are exposed.
Borax is a chemical compound (Na2B4O7(OH)410H2O) that has multiple uses in industry, but many people use it as a laundry booster or as an insecticide because of its low toxicity to mammals and birds.
<strong>But, just how toxic is borax to dogs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dogs are susceptible to borax toxicity at over 0.02 oz per lb of body weight. It will <strong><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470699010"><strong>cause clinical signs</strong></a></strong> like loss of appetite, retching, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anemic skin/ gums, shock, and <strong><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/274229"><strong>death</strong></a></strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The dog exposed to borax or boric acid frequently vomits, produces stools with blue-green substance or blood, and becomes lethargic or droopy-eyed.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Dog Food&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-borax-safe-for-dogs"><strong>Is Borax Safe For Dogs?</strong></h2>
<p>Borax is a chemical compound that can be found at many grocery stores. But the real question is how much borax can a small dog eat before being dangerous?
Well, for every pound (half a kilogram) of body weight, dogs are only able to tolerate about 0.25 grams (0.06 ounces) of borax before it is too much for them and can cause serious health problems such as vomiting or diarrhea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax is an irritant, so if your dog consumes any borax, they will likely experience some type of irritation in their mouth or stomach.
<strong>Oral ingestion of b</strong>
<strong>orax</strong>
, either as a pesticide or as a cleaner, has been linked to many disorders in dogs including seizures,
<a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/kidney-problems-in-dogs">kidney failure</a>
, or death when ingested.</li>
<li>When you mix Borax ingredients with others that are also unsafe for your dog, the health consequences can be even worse.
Borax ingestion may also damage the dog&rsquo;s reproductive organs, brain, and endocrine system. Other symptoms of borax poisoning include excessive drooling, vomiting, and diarrhea.</li>
<li>Dogs that have ingested borax may also experience an elevated heart rate or blood pressure, panting, seizures, difficulty breathing, tremors, and unsteady gait.
Further;
**Contact with **
<strong>borax</strong>

*Is *
<em>boric acid</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>toxic for dogs?*
The answer is simple; YES. As Borax and boric acid are so similar, both chemicals could be harmful to your dog. The question remains, then: Which one is worse?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well, it all depends on the kind of exposure that occurs. If you make a mistake with just one like getting it on your dog&rsquo;s paws and they lick it, boric acid is the worse choice.

</ul>
<h2 id="causes-of-dog-borax-poisoning">Causes of Dog Borax Poisoning</h2>
<p>Boron, a naturally occurring element found in a number of products used around the home can have adverse effects on your canine companion.
The causes of borax poisoning include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insecticides</li>
<li>Paints</li>
<li>Fungicides</li>
<li>Rodent poisons and repellents</li>
<li>Medicated powders</li>
<li>Skin lotions</li>
<li>Tick and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/is-borax-safe-for-cats/">flea medications</a></li>
<li>Antiseptics, germicides, disinfectants</li>
<li>Detergents.</li>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">Laundry products</a>(detergent powders)</li>
<li>Shaving cream</li>
<li>Diaper creams
Cosmetics such as soaps or lotions with borax in them can also be a cause of poisoning to your dog if they lick the product of their skin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-20-mule-team-borax-harmful-to-dogs">Is 20 Mule Team Borax harmful to dogs?</h2>
<p>Yes,
20 Mule Team Borax
is toxic to dogs. But there&rsquo;s no need for you to panic because it won&rsquo;t kill your pet instantly unless they consume a large amount in one sitting.
The boron present in the product can cause vomiting and diarrhea with larger doses that may lead to death if not treated promptly by a veterinarian.
What are some of the symptoms I should keep an eye out for?</p>
<ul>
<li>The signs of dog poisoning include nausea, excessive drooling, lethargy or weakness (being uncoordinated), seizures, difficulty breathing or panting, increased heart rate, and/or fever up until 106 degrees Fahrenheit.
If any such symptom persists seek veterinary attention immediately!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-dog-ingested-or-ate-borax-what-should-i-do">My Dog Ingested or Ate Borax, What Should I do?</h2>
<p>In the event that your dog has eaten borax, you should contact your veterinarian straight away. Once youve done this, take note of the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure at what time did he last eat? If it was more than one hour ago then a trip to the nearest veterinarian is not necessary. But, if less than an hour has passed; or he just ate; it is extremely important to get him there as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Contacting your vet will involve gathering information about how big (how many kilograms) is your dog and also finding out whether they have anything which may assist with animal poisoning cases beforehand- such as anti-emetics or charcoal treatments. Assuming no arrangements are made beforehand
Contacting the dog Poison Helpline is a good idea to get answers if your dog has been poisoned. Animal poison control centers exist to provide help in times of need.
One of the many helpful services offered by the poison helpline is to provide insights on potential causes for dog poisoning.
Once you provide your vet with the case number, they can speak directly to the poison helpline toxicologists who will advise on the best course of action.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-at-the-vets-office">What will happen at the Vet&rsquo;s Office?</h2>
<p>When you take your pet to the vet for dog borax poisoning, there are typically a few treatment options that vets recommend.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your veterinarian will decide if the dog needs immediate veterinary attention, and may induce vomiting if appropriate. Ingested borax will be vomited up.</li>
<li>A dog with borax poisoning will be monitored for signs of neurological damage.</li>
<li>If the vomiting continues, or if the dog is lethargic and experiencing muscle tremors, seizures, depression, or difficulty breathing, a veterinarian may decide to admit him/her into an animal hospital intensive care unit (ICU).</li>
<li>Once admitted to ICU he/she will receive intravenous fluids (IV fluids) as well as medications that help reduce stomach acidity and prevent kidney failure from dehydration.</li>
<li>The vet may take blood, urine, or tissue samples to test for damage to organs caused by ingestion of borax.
The vet will keep your pet under observation in order to see whether there are any changes such as skin irritation around their mouth caused by too much saliva being produced.</li>
<li>Intravenous fluids can also cause this so they&rsquo;ll monitor it carefully until all symptoms have cleared up.
The vet may recommend a gastric lavage if your dog shows symptoms of high toxicity such as neurological symptoms.</li>
<li>Gastric lavage is a process of cleaning out your dog&rsquo;s stomach (under anesthesia) and the first part of their intestines by giving them an emetic to induce vomiting.</li>
<li>Otherwise, they&rsquo;ll recommend feeding charcoal (which absorbs some types of poison) in order to absorb any remaining borax that may have been ingested.
The vet will also monitor hydration levels closely through urine output as well as blood pressure if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recovery-from-borax-poisoning-for-dogs">Recovery from Borax Poisoning for Dogs</h2>
<p>Kidney damage from boric acid poisoning is a top concern for vets. The vet may opt to do hemodialysis and dialysis to help remove any boric acid from the kidneys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once they have recovered, make sure to keep them away from any borax.</li>
<li>Leaving it in the house will only tempt your dog and could lead to another poisoning event or death.
The vet may also prescribe
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/borictech.html">medication for boric acid</a>
depending on how much borax was consumed by the dog.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion on the question &ldquo;is borax safe for dogs&rdquo; is a yes with many considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borax is safe for dogs when used in moderation, but can lead to kidney damage if consumed in excess or over time.</li>
<li>It is very important that you always keep borax away from your dog and make sure they have plenty of water during recovery!
If swallowed: Watch out for severe vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy (too tired), seizures (convulsions).</li>
<li>If these symptoms occur seek emergency veterinary care immediately because this could be life-threatening as well. See your vet</li>
<li>I would love to hear any feedback so I may improve on future content.
Thanks again and happy reading!</li>

      <description>Living in a roach-infested house, kitchen,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living in a roach-infested house, kitchen,
apartments
, car e.t.c is a nightmare. The bugs will transmit organisms and destroy newspapers, books, or wallpapers e.t.c.
But you also don&rsquo;t
want to use all/)
harsh ingredients as this may harm your pets - including cats and dogs.
<strong>Check these pet safe cockroach killers.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Roach Baits&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-rid-of-roaches-without-harming-pets">How Do I Get Rid Of Roaches Without Harming Pets?</h2>
<p>Roaches can be found anywhere but they seem to love warm, moist places like bathrooms and kitchens where food spills happen often.
Here we will give some tips on how to get rid of roaches without harming pets?
<strong>1. Prevention</strong>
Sealing up all entry points like loose-fitting door openings can be an important step in preventing roaches from entering the house. Also, keep your counters and floors clean to avoid attracting roaches.
Do not leave pet food out where a roach can jump in from a surrounding counter. Garbage containers should be kept inside and secure, preferably in airtight containers.
Remove clutter like paper, books, and old clothes in your home so that cockroaches will have less of a chance to infest. Also, clean garbage disposals and sink strainers often.
<strong>2. Roach Traps</strong>
There are a few different types of roach traps that can be used to capture and kill these roaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>One is the glue trap, which you just place in an area where there have been sightings of them (such as under or near kitchen appliances).</li>
<li>They get stuck on this sticky surface when they try to cross it. You can then dispose of the captured bugs by simply peeling off the cardstock backing.
Grease bowl traps work by luring roaches in with bait, such as bacon or ham. They are then trapped by a lip on the bowl and cannot get out so they die of starvation.
These traps should be placed where there is an infestation to cut down on their numbers before you try any other type of trap for catching them.
<strong>3. Baits</strong>
This type of roach trap uses poison gel baits that do not harm pets but will kill these bugs within hours after coming into contact with it.
Roach baits
that do not pose a danger to your pets since their ingredients are enclosed in some sealed container.
Put the
boric acid roach Trap
near corners, cracks, or under appliances where you have seen them.
Roach baits work by attracting these bugs and they then eat the bait that contains a fast-acting, slow-killing poison.
This gives you time to find out how roaches are entering your house and control them with more efficient methods.
<strong>4. Boric Acid</strong>
Boric acid is an inexpensive roach killer. It is generally used as an outer perimeter treatment around the perimeters of homes, apartments, or businesses to prevent pests from entering.
It can also be applied inside as bait for German cockroaches only - the
borax
will not kill other roaches such as American, Brown-Banded, or Oriental Roaches.</li>
<li>A little borax goes a long way with this natural product that has been shown in various studies to be up to 95% effective against all types of household insects including ants, fleas beetles, weevils, etc.
In addition, it&rsquo;s safe on plants and won&rsquo;t harm any pets you may have at your home. This makes it one less thing you need to worry about when it comes to pest control.</li>
<li>One reason for this is because bugs are highly attracted to its taste due to the sugar content which makes them take it back into their nest where they then pass it onto others making a chain reaction of death from within.
<strong>5. Diatomaceous Earth</strong>
Diatomaceous earth (&ldquo;food grade&rdquo; option) is a natural product made from the fossilized remains of diatoms that are ground up into dust.
Diatomaceous earth
can be used around pets to deter roaches, but it needs to be applied often.
But theres still some limited risk for your pet if they go outside or lick their fur after walking on dirt where DE has been applied.
Apply the Diatomaceous Earth in the areas where you have seen cockroaches.
It will work as a repellant for them and they wont be able to cross it without feeling that their exoskeleton is being scratched by the DE particles.
You can sprinkle enough food-grade Diatomaceous Earth all over your house (in corners or along walls), it should keep roaches away from your home altogether!</li>
