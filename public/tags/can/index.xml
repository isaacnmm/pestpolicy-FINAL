[<a href="/posts/how-long-can-fleas-live-without-a-host/">Fleas</a> (Ctenocephalides felis) don&rsquo;t have wings](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-have-wings/">https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-have-wings/</a>)
and will move by jumping using their powerful legs.</p>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-can-fleas-live-without-a-host/">Fleas can only live up to 4 days</a>
when removed from their hosts.
So, fleas jump around looking for a blood meal or move from
heat
.
So,
*how high can fleas jump? *
**Fleas can jump a maximum of **
**7 inches (18�cm) vertically and 13 inches (33�cm) horizontally (an average 40 - 99 times of the flea&rsquo;s body length) - it&rsquo;s only second to **
<strong>froghopper. Its hind-most pair of legs are significantly adapted in jumping. Here&rsquo;s how to tell if you have a flea problem.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-high-can-fleas-jump">How High Can Fleas Jump?</h2>
<p>The fleas&rsquo;s legs are long and appropriately build for jumping. The bug provides a forceful and quick jump - it wont depend on power from directly from its muscles but on the energy stored in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilin">resilin</a>
elastic protein pad. It releases the store energy fast like bow &amp; arrow.
Before the flea jump, the bug&rsquo;s muscles will contract to allow the deformation of its resilin pad, this allows storage of energy to be used later. However, the flea uses he &ldquo;catch mechanism&rdquo; that&rsquo;ll hinder premature release of energy and leg movement.
<strong>Dog fleas (Ctenocephalides Canis)</strong>
will jump more compared to cat fleas. Dog fleas will jump about 50 cm (20 inches). The average leap distance or height of 30.4 cm (12 inches) - but the jumps among cat flea and human fleas are similar.
<strong>The oriental rat fleas</strong>
(Xenopsylla Cheopis) tend to jump about 18 cm (7 inches). Further, the Desert Rodent Fleas have a jump of about 7.8 cm - 12.8 cm (3 - 5 inches). On average, the oriental rat fleas have a jump of 10.4 cm (4 inches).
**Bird, bat, &amp; mole fleas **
are some of the fleas species that don&rsquo;t jump well. These fleas have lost their body parts required to jump. Therefore, these fleas (since they don&rsquo;t jump) live in hosts occupying the underground nests and high-aerial roosts.
<strong>Cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Their flea jump height is about 33 cm (13 inches). Most of the cat fleas tend to jump about 13.2 cm (5.2 inches) about above your ankle. Further, some fleas may jump about 17 cm (6.6 inches) - while others can jump at above 60 times of their body length.
<strong>Human Flea (Pulex Irritans)</strong></li>
<li>Human fleas jump at a height and distance similar to cat fleas. Therefore, human fleas jump about 33 cm (13 inches) just like cat fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flea-anatomy--jumping-mechanism">Flea Anatomy  Jumping Mechanism</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to learn the anatomical build of the fleas&rsquo; legs to lean how these bugs jump from one host or area to another. Its legs are segmented into 4 sections� - the segments being tarsus, tibia, femur, and coxa from outwards towards the body.
The leg joints - particularly the femur is a thick joint segment of the fleas&rsquo; leg and it has a large amount of muscle and it links the trochanter to the bug&rsquo;s tibia. the fleas&rsquo; tibia is sectioned and it links femur to the fleas&rsquo; tarsi. In addition, the fleas tarsi stand furthest to the bug&rsquo;s body.
The flea&rsquo;s trochanters are noted to touch the ground when the bugs are jumping. But the tarsi of the flea is a critical part of jumping for the fleas. Notably, fleas derive their jumping power from the spectacular jumps. Its resilin contains some protein that is stretchy - to contract and extends allowing the flea to jump over distances.</p>
<h2 id="how-fast-can-fleas-jump">How Fast Can Fleas Jump?</h2>
<p>Considering the shape and size of fleas - these flat and tiny bugs measure about 1/12 -� 1/8 inches move of jump quickly and effectively over distances or between the pet&rsquo;s hairs. The hind legs, from its 6 legs, of these fleas, allow the bugs to jump quickly.
Some fleas species will jump about 150 times its body length. Further, the record jump ever recorded in fleas was a vertical jump of 4 feet.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-can-fleas-live-without-a-host/">Without a host, fleas can survive for about 100 - 150 days</a></p>
<ul>
<li>however, it must remain undisturbed to avoid wasting energy moving around or jumping.
When fleas attain adult ages and body, they&rsquo;ll be running around looking for a blood meal and later conditions
necessary undertake reproduction. Adult fleas lays about 5000+ eggs in its lifetime and the adult will live or about 2-3 months.
As noted above, fleas won&rsquo;t survive for long without a blood meal or a host - in fact its just a few days. However, with the correct humidity, blood supply, and temperatures, adults fleas will live anywhere from 1-1.5 years. Further, adults fleas will survive for long without feeding if they won&rsquo;t break off their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puparium">puparia</a>
since this would otherwise make them lose excessive energy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-fleas-jump-onto-beds">Can Fleas Jump Onto Beds?</h2>
<p>Definitely, its odd to discover fleas occupying your bed - even after washing and treating all the bedding and such stuff. Maybe the bugs did actually hitchhike your lower legs or feet and finally got into you bed? Possibly, the fleas also climbed onto your bed using the loosely hanging sheets near the ground or floor? NB: Fleas can only jump to maximum height that&rsquo;s around your ankle -
fleas have no wings and thus won&rsquo;t fly
.
If the flea problem persists, then you should consider washing all the bedding regularly than you what you do currently. Further, make sure to tuck your sheet into the bed - this makes sure that the fleas moving around he ground won&rsquo;t get a ladder/ climbing route into your bed. In addition, keenly clean and inspect you feet and socks before you jump into you bed.
The next step will be purchasing a better vacuum - maybe the one you currently have isn&rsquo;t doing it all right in removing the fleas,
flea dirt and their debris
. This will be even more helpful if your carpets have fleas as it&rsquo;ll vacuum the bugs clean. Also, I recommend you get some
cat flea treatments such as Revolution</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid lapse or delays in giving the flea treatments.
Daily cleaning and vacuuming may help kill the flea larvae, eggs,and
baby fleas</li>
<li>in addition to washing the bedding, treating the mattress and pillows. A great sign in your war against fleas is if you don&rsquo;t now notice a lump of flea dirt on the bed rails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-control-fleas">How to Control Fleas</h2>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, fleas have long legs and the hind pair is highly developed to allow them to jump very high. Vertically, fleas can jump about 18 cm (7 inches) while horizontally it can jump roughly 13 cm (33 inches). Therefore, fleas are only second in jumping height-to body length ratio to froghopper.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/how-high-can-fleas-jump/">Fleas</a> are generally parasites that
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5734377/">need a host to survive</a>
. But how long can fleas live without a host? Well, because of their thirst for blood and parasitic nature, they depend on the host most of their time.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Fleas can survive for a period of 4-7 days without a host. But if you subject them to any longer than this, they will die. **</li>
<li><strong>Fleas have different stages of a life cycle but it is the adults that need the host more especially when laying eggs. Fleas can attach to many hosts, but their preferred hosts are the furry homes pets- cats and dogs.</strong>
If you study the life cycle of a flea, you shall get the opportunity to learn and understand about the fleas and their host.

<h2 id="details-how-long-can-fleas-live-without-a-host">Details: How Long Can Fleas Live Without A Host?</h2>
<p>Because fleas are parasites, it is difficult to live without a host. They get their food from the host to survive and reproduce.</p>
<ul>
<li>But if you take a flea from hosts its chances of survival becomes minimal and can die. The longest they can survive without a host is 4-7 days maximum.
In fact, a female flea will not lay her first eggs until after her first blood meal. Hence they need to find a host so they quickly attach to feed and continue with the next stage of the life cycle.

<h3 id="life-cycle-of-a-flea-">**Life Cycle of a Flea� **</h3>
<p>A flea has a life span of between 60-100 days. But they can live even for a whole year even the conditions are not conducive for the egg, larvae, or pupae to rapture to the next stage.��Lets have a closer look at the different stages and their behaviors.</p>
<h3 id="eggs-">**Eggs **</h3>
<p>This is the first stage in a life cycle. A flea likes to lay its eggs on the host. Most of the preferred hosts are pets at home because their blood is nutritious and makes fleas lay more eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the pet is grooming or shaking, these eggs fall on the carpets, bedding, furniture, and any other surface
The fertilized eggs hatch in a span of 2-12 days. From the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/should-you-spray-your-yard-for-fleas/">total flea population</a>
in any house, the eggs comprise about 50-54%.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34MRKpf3rEE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34MRKpf3rEE</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="larvae-">**Larvae **</h3>
<p>This is the second stage of the life cycle. The larvae are translucent to white in color and their size range from 2mm-5mm when they are fully grown.</p>
<ul>
<li>As they mature, their color also changes to a darker color. As for larvae, they prefer dark areas in the house including under the carpets and in the crevices.</li>
<li>After hatching, the new larvae feed have a functionally developed mouth that they use to feed on debris, fleas feces, dead skin, and fur among other debris.
Fleas stay in this stage between 2-14 days as they molt their skin to turn into pupae. The larvae comprise about 35 % of the total population.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pupae-">**Pupae **</h3>
<p>This pupae flea lives in a cocoon. This cocoon is gluey and holds itself to debris, flea feces, and dust among other things to harden the cocoon for protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>This makes the larvae survive even when exposed to vacuum and other pest controls.</li>
<li>If the conditions are right, this cocoon opens up after 5-14 days into an adult flea.
Sometimes, the cocoon may be predisposed to unsuitable weather conditions which may prolong the pupae stage even to a year in the cocoon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adult-">**Adult **</h3>
<p>This is the fourth and final stage of a flea. It is at this stage that the pupa moves out of the cocoon into a full adult (male or female). The body is fully grown with all the feeding and survival adaptations. This is the feeding and the reproducing stage.</p>
<ul>
<li>At this point, the fleas is can jump into the host to start their feeding. However, it is very selective on the host and uses some signals like vibrations and exhaled carbon dioxide to detect their best hosts.</li>
<li>Their hind legs are also powerful enough to jump 150 times their own length to get to the host. As for the female, they start to lay eggs within a period of 48 hours.
All the eggs laid before mating are infertile and will not hatch. As the flea takes more of pet blood it continues to lay eggs that hatch.</li>
<li>A female can lay up 20-30 per day and up to 180 eggs in its lifespan.
However, if the environmental conditions are not good, the pupa may stay in the cocoon for up to a period of one year.�The adult fleas are not many and their population is about 5 percent.

<h2 id="how-long-do-fleas-live-with-a-host-">**How Long Do Fleas Live With A Host? **</h2>
<p>Fleas as parasites that entirely depend on the host for food. An adult flea can live for a period of 60-100 days from which it depends on the host.
In its entire period, an adult attaches to the host unless its removed through some external forces like grooming and pest control.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-fleas-feed-on-the-host"><strong>How Do Fleas Feed On The Host?</strong></h3>
<p>Fleas feed by sucking blood from their host. Their mouths are adapted to pierce through into the skin to the blood vessel where they draw the blood.
After sucking the blood, they produce an anticoagulant substance that prevents blood from clotting. This substance sometimes causes itchiness and also allergic reactions to pets and also humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas have a high preference for furry animals and pets as compared to humans. They thrive and increase rapidly when with these animals.</li>
<li>Their blood is nutritious and increases the fleas fertility as compared to that of humans.</li>
<li>When feeding, they can do it at least once every 12 hours. They can also suck blood to become gorged 15 times the size of their body.
Basically, if you have pets around your home you are more likely to have a high infestation of fleas as compared to when there are humans only.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>How long can fleas live without a host? Approximately 4-7 days
beyond which it dies
. Because fleas are parasites it is hard for them to live without a host for long.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, fleas have non-feeding stages in their cycle that do not require a host and can live on any other surface.
Fleas prefer furry host-like pets as compared to human beings. They also have adaptations that help them attach and feed on a host and for as long as they can.</li>
