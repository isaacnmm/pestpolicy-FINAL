A Retropie controller is indispensable in Retro Gaming on either the custom-built Raspberry Pi console, Mac, and on Windows. You&rsquo;ll find many non-specific Genesis, NES, or SNES replica controllers in the market, but with lousy performance ratings.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been increased innovation and upgrades in modern gaming devices such as the best flight simulator yoke, mainly aiming to achieve more realism in virtual piloting.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the flight simulator yokes vary depending on materials, price, and brand.</li>
<li>Also, the devices run on realism capacity, customs mapping ability of the buttons, and compatibility with different flight games.
Therefore, it is no surprise that we as buyers get confused and overwhelmed when choosing the flight simulator yoke to purchase. Read Also:

<h2 id="reviews7-best-flight-simulator-yoke-2025">Reviews:ï¿½7 Best Flight Simulator Yoke 2025</h2>
<h3 id="1-saitek-pro-flight-yoke---3-lever-throttle-pz44"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TCEU4Q/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Saitek Pro Flight Yoke - 3-Lever Throttle (PZ44)</a></h3>
<p>A unique feature of the Saitek Pro Flight Yoke is that the candle can travel 90 degrees in every direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will affect the aileron travel since it will offer more precise and sensitive control over your ladle axis.
The three-position switch in the Yoke will enable you to assign a 2
nd
and 3
rd
function to every button.</li>
<li>Further, you may engage the reverse thrust by pulling the throttle lever beyond its stop notch, which causes some button press.</li>
<li>Apart from the yoke harsh centering problem in the Saitek device, they are real top products, even superior to CH ones.
The Saitek Yoke is heavy and would not simply sit on a table devoid of clamping. This is mainly because it has a metal cast aluminum compared to other yokes that have plastic casings.
The Saitek Yoke has an aileron action where you will hear a big bump when you move through the center. However, there is a clear and quiet notch at its center, just like when you move in the pitch axis.
<em>Ease of installation -ï¿½</em>
Notably, the Saitek yoke is favorable to make people due to the sturdy steel shaft and high-quality bearings.</li>
<li>This setup will offer you a highly responsive control of the airplane.</li>
<li>Quadrant controls and the Yoke will excellently plug into the PC through the USB.
However, you might need to buy a USB hub to connect to other gadgets. Read Also:

<h3 id="2-ch-flight-sim-yoke-usb-200-615"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B000056SPM/?tag=p-policy-20">2. CH Flight Sim Yoke USB (200-615)</a></h3>
<p>Well, what is the difference between the CH fighter stick and the CH Flight Sim Yoke?
First, the Flight Sim Yoke is fabricated for general aviation for games such as X plane and FS X or professional flight simulators like the X plane Pro.
The CH Flight Sim Yoke is popular among the civil aviation pilots that find it expensive to fly an actual flight, and hence they opt for a virtual cockpit at home to hone their skills cheaply.
You&rsquo;ll need to set up an edge of a desk to clamp the Sim Yoke. Interestingly, it can push in and pull out and turn for effective flight control.
However, the CH Sim Yoke lacks a direct rudder control or rudder control axis, and thus you&rsquo;ll require pedals to achieve this, but you can accomplish this by purchasing the CH Eclipse Sim Yoke or flying small GA aircraft that you can manage with the rudder control.
Further, for a person with a physical disability on our legs, you can try the CH Eclipse Sim Yoke (described above) as it has peddles that you can utilize as a simulated rudder.</p>
<ul>
<li>The CH Sim Yoke has a more realistic simulation of the real aircraft controls and has additional instrument panels.</li>
<li>The sim yoke has two bi-directional flip and rocker switches, four traditional push buttons, and one 8-way POV hat switch.
Also, you&rsquo;ll experience an easy USB installation, without drivers, for your Macintosh and Pc. Further, the device comes with 144 programmable functions.
The Yoke is made of heavy-duty plastic, but you could need to modify the desk to clamp the device for ease of use. Read Also:

</ul>
<h3 id="3-ch-products-eclipse-yoke"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B001GIOGBY/?tag=p-policy-20">3. CH Products Eclipse Yoke</a></h3>
<p>The CH Eclipse yoke is similar to the CH yoke, the cheaper version of the former, but they have a similar internal system.
However, the Eclipse yoke has additional switches, knobs, and buttons. New dual hat switches will enable you to zoom and pan around the cockpit.
Further, you can now control more functions on the Yoke without reaching for your keyword.
The Eclipse was designed to solve one key challenge in the old Yoke: sticking, which the new CH has now incorporated the favorable free-floating shaft design.
The main aim of the Eclipse yoke is to fly the plane in pitch and roll, and thus it is designed around two analog axes aimed at controlling the elevators and the ailerons.
The Yoke features 240 programmable functions that will give you excellent control of your flight simulation. ï¿½With the 7&rsquo; USB cord, you&rsquo;ll achieve an excellent plug-and-play experience.
<em>Thumb Rudder Paddles -ï¿½</em>
Also, similar to the CH Flight Sim Yoke, it has three analog axes as levers at the top of the yoke casing utilized for mixture controls and throttle prop.
The unique feature of the Eclipse Yoke is that it has an extra 6
th
analog axis manipulated by the unique peddle setup. Read Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-ergonomic-sofa/">Ergonomic Sofa</a>
.
The peddle setup is a self-centering axis aimed for use as a rudder control. You can use the thumb rudder paddles for rudder control (for flight games) or like gear shifters (for racing games).
<em>Free-floating shaft -ï¿½</em>
Further, if you&rsquo;ve used an earlier version of the CH Yoke, you&rsquo;ll quickly observe that the Eclipse Yoke&rsquo;s shaft is free-floating during pitch and roll.
Therefore, it implies that it lacks a central notch that could cause mechanical interference for fine control at the central position, and thus you&rsquo;ll easily make the accurate turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite that the aileron axis centers flawlessly at zero, the elevator axis will not do the same.</li>
<li>This is a perfect design characteristic that will allow you to establish little adjustments in pitch through puling or pushing the Yoke and remain there.
The most significant addition to the CH Eclipse Yoke compared to the previous CH yoke is that the Eclipse has finger paddles.
However, I dedicated 37 hours to testing all the flight simulator yokes we review in this article. I went through the pain of testing and comparing so that you don&rsquo;t have to!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Best Flight Simulator Yoke will increase the realism factor in your gaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, with the above information on various flight simulator yokes, you&rsquo;ll readily make the buying decisions.
We pride on a team that is both gaming experts and enthusiasts. Therefore, we offer accurate and up-to-date information on the best gaming devices. Happy Shopping!</li>

<p>We found that the Warthog joystick lacks the toy-like feeling in other joysticks. Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog FlightStick has a dual throttle control panel and system and a USB connection that allows upgradeable firmware.
The A-10C name indicates that the United States Air Force has authorized the H.O. test like a replica of the real a-10 Warthog in military applications.
For example, other joystick setups feel too light and flop around, and you can feel the cheap plastic construction features that are not in Thrustmaster Hotas!
As a high-end joystick, the designers of Warthog aimed to give you value for money by making the device remarkable at 3 kilograms. The device has a weighted and stable base.
It has integrated metal enclosures at all the key areas such as the stick&rsquo;s housing and the base&rsquo;s body. Therefore, you are assured that the joystick will not be falling apart when you slam things while Elite Dangerous gaming.
You&rsquo;ll notice that Warthog is more fluid compared to other joysticks since its spring system has adequate tension to assist you in making accurate movements without no overshooting the target.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, together with the four rubber pads at its bottom and even with no bolting on your desk through the provided screw holes, you&rsquo;ll not easily flop the setup around while using it typically.
Considering its button, Warthog has pinkie push buttons: 1 with a lever, one exposed, two standard push buttons, one dual metal trigger, one four-way hat with push functionality: 8-way point of view hat and 8 Way hats.
The 16-bit resolution joysticks, with a five coil spring system, will offer you a firm linear and fluid tension, which has no dead zones.
With HallEffect AccuRate (H.E.A.R.T.) with 3D magnetic sensors technology, the joystick has surgical precision and will maintain the quality over a long time. Read Also:

Also, the spring systems will help you remain steady. However, if you need to play arcade shooters through fast activating twitch triggers and buttons, then the Warthog metal trigger could feel heavy and will have a long travel distance and thus can be too slow in comparison to others like the aviator.

<p>T-Flight H.O.T.A.S. X comes with detachable throttle control and a cozy wrist rest. It has a detachable throttle, a hat switch, and can move on the z-axis.</p>
<ul>
<li>I consider the joystick as a great competitor in the elite dangerous gaming due to its five programmable axles and twelve buttons.</li>
<li>You can easily climb theï¿½status levels of your Elite dangerous gaming, includingï¿½the CQC Championship.
The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X joystick is delivered with the joystick and the throttle combined.
Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X JoyStickï¿½has unique &ldquo;PRESET&rdquo; and &ldquo;MAPPING&rdquo; buttons for instant switching between programs and functions, which is critical for elite dangerous gaming.
Has an analog slider to add a different axis. It has a real mid-way stopper to easily set the throttle to 50%, where it will click and lock. Read Also:

However, you can easily separate the two using the Allen wrench that is placed at the stick&rsquo;s bottom. You will need to plug and play into your P.C. or PS3 after making the &quot; mode&quot; selection.
Further, the joystick has a stick at its base, which will allow you to modify its resistance. Using the resistance control knob, you&rsquo;ll easily adjust the stick&rsquo;s resistance.</li>
<li>Its ten buttons are excellently placed, and you will find them excellently programmed Joystick for Elite Dangerous.</li>
<li>The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X joystick is delivered with the joystick, and the throttle is joined.
This enables edit inputs separate from the program. Further, the joystick has an internal memory that would allow you to store the unique configurations even after you unplug the stick.
The stick&rsquo;s weighted base will allow you more excellent stability throughout your gaming. Further, it has a wide hand-rest that will enable you to top gaming comfort.
The joystick has a somewhat edgy design, for its price, despite being entirely created from plastic. It does not stray away from thrust masters&rsquo; quality and durability standards.</li>
<li>With its weighted base, the stick will feel sturdy and friendly. Although it has a plastic build, the stick is reliable and durable.

<h3 id="3-extreme-3d-pro-joystick-for-windows---3-pick"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009OY9U/?tag=p-policy-20">3. Extreme 3D Pro Joystick for Windows - #3 Pick</a></h3>
<p>Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is a strong and easy USB joystick that you wont have special connections to play your favorite game.
It has the essential joystick features, which include an eight-way hat switch (top), 11 buttons, a rudder stick twist, 4 control axis, and a trigger (front).</p>
<ul>
<li>To increase stability, the joystick has a broad base build and will come with rubber pads to prevent slipping while you are gaming.</li>
<li>However, we won&rsquo;t label this as an ambidextrous joystick since it will not be appropriate for left-handed gamers.
Despite coming with installation software on CD, the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro will also run effortlessly without installation the same on your P.C.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll not necessitate installing any special software or drivers. You can thus purchase theï¿½Imperial Eagleï¿½ship, which won&rsquo;t need a ï¿½navy rank, and use theï¿½Logitech Extreme 3D Pro to start combat.
Further, the joystick will be automatically formatted for most flight-sim gaming. However, in this case, you&rsquo;ll require programming the stick switches on the stand and the top.
Also, the stick has a superior build quality that will allow it to be highly durable and reliable. Therefore, the joystick will allow you toï¿½dock in the galaxy and repair or rearm your dangerous Elite ship.
Pros: High Durability, Plug and play, Ease of use, and centered joystick, and strong base. Read Also:

<h3 id="4-saitek-x52-pro-flight"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LQ4HTS/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Saitek X52 Pro Flight</a></h3>
<p>The X52 Pro joystick is created by Saitek that comes in the form of throttle and joystick. Saitek X52 Pro Flight&rsquo;s trigger has dual actuation points and permanent blue L.E.D. lights.
Has enabled tension adjustment progressive throttle and two fire buttons, which will enable you to operate the spaceship as you move to the open galaxy.
Has precision-centering mechanism and Advanced Multi-Function Display (MFD) for near-realistic Elite Dangerous flying experience.
However, you can use the X 52 and X 52 Pro without sticks. There is a cable a serial cable that links the stick to the throttle and the throttle plugs to the P.C. through a USB. X52 Pro is considered a lower-end joystick.
Despite that the device is made from plastic, it feels solid for the plastic stick it is. Also, the throttle feels very textured and smooth.
The stick has buttons that are appropriately placed at its base and has three switches (t1 to t6) that you can set up to turn on the shaft or shield cell bank.
The buttons are appropriately placed for the fingers and thumb to reach. Further, the throttle has two wheels that you can use for a head look or navigate between panels.</p>
<ul>
<li>The stick also has a pinky switch that you can use as a secondary combination button to allow you to double the configuration.</li>
<li>The two rotary dials and two dedicated MFD buttons have inbuilt buttons that will enable better control of the game&rsquo;s functionality.
X52 pro allows a detailed flight simulator using multifunction LCD and a fantastic 105 programmable commands. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll easily control your Elite Dangerous flight plan using a stopwatch and clock function.
The stick&rsquo;s lighted buttons will enable you to know the point to press quickly. Also, the fantastic display will offer information on the button configuration.
Further, the device will allow increased X-Y control through the use of non-contact technology. Compatible with: War Thunder, Star Citizen, Rise of Flight, and Elite: Dangerous.
One challenge I identified with the Saitek X52 Pro is that the sticky is adequately grippy, and it has a twist functionality to actuate the rudder  a 3D Twist Rudder Control.
Therefore, when you are twisting the stick, you&rsquo;ll need to clamp down using a lot of strength. However, you can use grip tape to solve this problem permanently.

<p>Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS is my top elite dangerous joystick.
It features T.W.C.S. and the H.E.A.R.T. magnetic precision technology with the characteristic ambidextrous use, which will make your gaming more realistic and have surgical precision.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be great for both the right and left-handed elite dangerous gamers with minimal adjustments.</li>

Uniquely designed for space adventure available in Elite Dangerous, the Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS joystick offers precision and fantastic control in your hands.</li>
<li>The stick&rsquo;s throttle will assist you in gaining more control of your plane.</li>

The stick has twist axes for the rudder control, and the base of the stick has a small throttle axis at the back of the base with 12 buttons (6 on each side).</li>
<li>My first thought of the joystick is an amazing finish with excellent ergonomics.
The joystick is created using high-quality plastic (injection-molded plastic) and rubber, which make it have a durable look and feel, which matches its predecessor, the T 16,000 M flight stick.
The stick&rsquo;s buttons have intentional and firm clicks, which will enable you to acknowledge the effect of each move you make in the Elite dangerous gaming.
The stick has a replacement rubber enabling a change to the right hand from the regular left-hand stick. Notably, Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS is the only joystick that can change from left hand to right hand.
Interestingly, you should know that T.16000M FCS HOTAS has significant build improvements over its predecessor, the T.16000M. Read Also:

Most modern controllers are mapped off mapping and controls scheme of 360 controllers. Has vibration feedback for a better feel.
Microsoft Xbox 360 is a sturdy and comfortable Wireless gamepad that has a great battery and wireless competence.
However, Microsoft Xbox 360 emerges as one of the most pricey first-party gamepads.
Xbox 360 Wireless gamepad has many features similar to the Controller S. For example, the face buttons, control pad, triggers, and analog sticks (both left and right) are situated in the same area like in Controller S.
Xbox 360 Wireless outdoes the Nintendo and Logitech wireless and wired gamepads in the gaming experience, comfort, and responsiveness.
Considering the performance and build, the Xbox 360 Wireless gamepad features are on top of the list.
<strong>But remember this:</strong>
&ldquo;Gaming Platforms&rdquo; or PC controllers are highly personal devices. Also, most PC gamers worship (rightly so) the keyboard-Mouse combo while playing some real-time strategy games (such as Halo Wars) and first-person shooters RPGs (such as 007 Legends).

<h3 id="3-dualshock-4-wireless-sony-controller"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGA9X9W/?tag=p-policy-20">3. DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller</a></h3>
<p>DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller (DS4) was designed for PS4 and had a strong body build.
DS4 allows you to map mouse functionality to its central touchpad for easy windows navigation. However, you&rsquo;ll download the
<a href="http://ds4windows.com/">unofficial DS4 windows software</a>
.
DualShock 4 is built to support almost everything: it comes with an in-built Move feature, Sixaxis tilt controls, face buttons, and the standard analog sticks.
Despite not being designed for PC, DS4 has grown to become a favorite all-around gamepad for most gaming experts.
It feels strong and reliable despite the additional width when compared to Xbox One gamepad.
It comes with a better Xbox One pad and softer curves that will give you a better gaming experience.
The DualShock 4 is the best PC gaming controller as it combines the progressive evolution of nature and the PlayStation controller familiarity.
<strong>New Sticks and Pad</strong>
Further, DualShock 4 has a better d-pad compared to those on Microsoft Xbox, and thus works great for street fighter gaming on PC. However, you might need to use the input mapper.
It has an excellent analog trigger feel, with the bumpers and triggers producing a great tactile feel.ï¿½Its sticks are more sensitive, responsive (at the center), and lighter.
<strong>Concave designï¿½</strong>
DS4 has an excellent concave design to give you a better grip and gaming feel. Also, it has a raised ring near the edge and is thus easier to grip. I found the DualShock 4 to be more sensitive and smoother.
The DualShock 4 adds a front-facing touchpad to its original Sony PlayStation design. Also, it has excellent sticks and triggers. Interestingly, the DualShock 4 controller will work excellently with games such as Steam and Shovel Knight.
With its built-in speaker, light bar, and touchpad, the DS4 Controller will better your gaming experience. Also, if you are a music lover, the Controller has a 3.5mm audio jack just for you.
<strong>DualShock 4 Wireless Sony Controller Reviewï¿½</strong>
**Mac or PC connection? **
For Mac or PC connection, you&rsquo;ll need to use a Sony DS4 USB Wireless adapter. You can fix any DS4 worn-out rubber using the GelTabz PS4 &ldquo;thumb grips.&rdquo; It is Bluetooth compatible and has a rechargeable battery.
**Short and fat trigger **
It comes with reworked triggers and buttons, more extended grips, and a rubber body feel. Compared to the triggers in Xbox 360 that are skinny and long, I noted that DS4&rsquo;s triggers are fat and shot but are equally great to use.
Notably, the DualShock 4 triggers will stop with a click when you press them down, which creates a great tactile feel. Also, the Controller is plug-and-play with a USB cable.
<em><strong>Unique Features</strong></em>
Standard Triggers, Micro USB Cable, Parallel Thumbnails, Inset directional pad, Easy to recharge
**Options button - Share, Stream, and Save **
Note that the Start button is renamed as the Options button. Further, you can press the Share button to save a 15 minutes gameplay before the game ends, which you can share the screenshots and video online.
Further, you can press the Share button to stream video games from sites such as Twitch. Also, while playing, you can enable to show your comments and those of your viewers.
The share button in DS4 will allow you to seamlessly share your best moments, live-stream, screenshots, and videos without interrupting the game action.
<strong>Better grip and ergonomicsï¿½</strong>
With its improved design and better grip, youll find the DualShock 4 as an excellent alternative to the Xbox One controller.
Sony DualShock 4 feels great in the hands due to its excellent ergonomics with the familiar Sony controller design. With its micro USB cable, and on Windows 10, the gamepad will be plug and play.
You can connect your DS4 to the PC wireless through Bluetooth, with Bluetooth functionality in your PC, or purchase the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KYVLKG2/?tag=p-policy-20">DualShock USB Wireless Adaptor</a>
, which you&rsquo;ll input into the computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since many PC games utilize the ABYX button prompts, you&rsquo;ll need to install the<a href="http://ds4windows.com/">unofficial DS4Windows</a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, all the games supporting the use of controllers will work with the DS4 after installing the unofficial drivers.
DS4 enables extensive LED customization. Theï¿½DS4Windows will function effectively and also allow you to use the gamepad&rsquo;s central trackpad like a mouse.
[tabby title=&quot;
<em>DS4</em>
vs DS3&quot;]
<em>But, what is right in Dualshock 4 (DS4) compared to Dualshock 3 (DS3)?</em>
Dualshock 4 now has a clickable 2-point touchpad. Despite its increased length and breadth, DS4 is more efficient than DS3. There are back LEDs that light in different functions, such as during controller charging.
Also, DS4 has remodeled R1, R2, and L1, L2 buttons, which are even more spread out, which will give you better feedback and access. DS4 also has a .5mm headphone jack at the front section to enable the addition of earphones.
At the center of the navigation keys, joysticks, and D-Pad, the DS4 has a touchpad that will enable multi-finger scrolling and enhance the navigation and pinch to zoom functions. Thus, it is possible to swipe commands in games that require such inputs.ï¿½Finally, it is now possible to charge the DualShock 4 when the PS4 is powered off.
However, you need an InputMapper program download for the gamepad to work if you have challenges connecting to the PC.

The sticks have a rasped edge and smooth center, which reduces the possibility of slip. Further, the Guide button is placed far from Xbox One Elites center menu buttons, which reduces the chances of unintentional input.

<p>Your Nintendo Switch will only come with 32 GB as its internal storage capacity.
However, some of the above internal storage space is kept for critical system functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite that Nintendo Switch games are not so large, it is believed that practically the internal storage space is about 25 GB.</li>
<li>Adding some storage space through the MicroSD Card can help you store more digitally downloaded games.
Some of the game downloads (and their capacity) include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/disgaea-5-complete-switch">Disgaea 5 - 5.92 GB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - 7 GB</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="is-a-micro-sd-card-necessary">Is a Micro SD Card necessary?</h3>
<p>Stated, all of you switch fans will require extra external storage for the SwitchSwitch to store the different games.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, if you need to play different third-party games on the SwitchSwitch, you will need to have a large Micro SD card.
The Switch games that are digital download will take up more space and thus will not fit in the internal storage of the SwitchSwitch.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-the-storage-space-runs-out">What if the storage space runs out?</h3>
<p>Despite that you could have added a microSD card to your Nintendo Switch, you might not have achieved a good performance boost.</p>
<ul>
<li>In such a case, you are left with critical options:</li>
<li>Option A: Delete all the games that you are done with, or you are unlikely to use in the coming day.
However, the good part is that you can go back online and download the same games when you require them and have adequate space.
Option B: The other great option is to move your switch games to another external storage or other microSD cards for convenience.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steam has released both the Steam Link and the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016KBVBCS/?tag=p-policy-20">Steam Controller</a>
. The Steam Link helps you in gaming on the TV through a gaming rig.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, in this post, I will do a Steam Controller review. The Steam Controller aims to close the PC-console gap among one of the[PC Wireless <a href="/posts/best-controller-for-steam-link/">controllers</a>](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/)">https://pestpolicy.com/)</a>.
Steam <a href="/posts/best-controller-for-retropie/">Controller</a> will spice up your gaming to look like the console gamepad, maybe even better.
Notably, the video controller layout design, particularly analog sticks and buttons, has somehow remained the same for some time now.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there have been minor but notable changes such as the addition of the light bar
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGA9X9W/?tag=p-policy-20">DualShock 4</a>
at Amazon and
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KL3WBBC/?tag=p-policy-20">Microsoft Xbox One</a>
at Amazon with its new rumble triggers.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great for strategy gaming</li>
<li>analogue stick and Solid buttons</li>
<li>Additional dimension to the Touchpads
Cons:</li>
<li>Buttons are small</li>
<li>Lacks total precision</li>
</ul>
<p>For most PC gamers, the
<strong>mouse</strong>
and
<strong>keyboard</strong>
combo is the ultimate solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, Valve has been trying to combine the console and PC gaming capabilities using Steam technology.
The
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016KBVBCS/?tag=p-policy-20">steam controller</a>
on Amazon is the recent solution by valve aiming to enhance PC-Console gaming combination.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steam-controller-review">Steam Controller Review</h2>
<h3 id="setup-">**Setup **</h3>
<p>Your Steam Controller will come with a connection extender, Bluetooth connector, and AA batteries.
Youll only need to put the batteries at the back of the controller.
Further, you may utilize your MicroUSB cable to link the steam controller to your computer when it runs out of power.
Finally, switch on the controller to begin your gaming!</p>
<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p>The steam controller can be termed as a plug-and-play since after you put the USB dongle to your computer, youll only need to push the controllers Valve logo.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, with the Steam Controller, youll be happy to connect to all the games that are accessible through the Steam marketplace.</li>
<li>However, for the older PC games, youll require to make limited changes to the control scheme.</li>
<li>You can now map the trackpad to the various button actions, which allows the trackpad to replace the mouse.
Also, Steam has these unique features where the software will recommend some possible layouts for your trackpad.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design"><strong>Design</strong></h3>
<p>With the different improvements on the steam controller, the device has achieved a fantastic design and build.
The critical attribute of Steam is the unique trackpads. In addition to their high customization capability, the trackpads are clickable and produce haptic feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the first design had the circular trackpads located in places of the current analog stick.</li>
<li>However, the current steam controller has one analog stick, four triggers, and two face buttons  a features standard in many controllers.
In addition to the general traits, Steam has allowed you to click any handle to achieve a third trigger grip.
However, the steam controller plastic build felt too cheap and light as compared to the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZDNNRB8/?tag=p-policy-20">Xbox Elite</a>
on Amazon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Youll love how Steam advances the console controller features with the PC gaming ideas.
The trackpads, their high customizability, and their hepatic feedback will give you an excellent gaming experience.</p>
