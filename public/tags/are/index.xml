<em>bed bug eggs</em>
hard or soft? Are they hard or soft? This is a question you might be asking in an attempt to figure out whether the substances youre seeing are bed bug eggs.
Well, bed bugs eggs are soft to the touch and tend to crush when you try to pick or dislodge them from the surface.
They adhere to the surface, which makes it difficult to dislodge without squashing. Therefore, bed
bug eggs
are soft and can readily be destroyed by crushing with a stick or bare hands.

<h2 id="details-are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft-bed-bug-shells"><strong>Details: Are Bed Bug Eggs Hard or Soft? Bed Bug Shells</strong></h2>
<p>Bed bug eggs appear as grains of rice attached to surfaces. However, an attempt to touch them with your finger can tell you that they are soft, unlike rice grains.
They tend to adhere to the surface due to the
glue-like substance that bed bugs
use to secure them in place. Any attempt to scrape or pick the eggs from the body makes them crush.
The outer shell of the egg shields the fluid from which
bed bugs grow
. However, its not hard enough to resist a little force from your fingers. - try bed bug
home remedies/)
.
Instead of dislodging from the surface, the eggs tend to spread or smear on the cover whenever you try to lift them.</p>
<h3 id="do-bed-bug-eggs-have-hard-shells"><strong>Do Bed Bug Eggs Have Hard Shells?</strong></h3>
<p>Although
bed bug eggs
are very tiny, they have a hard outer shell covering the internal fluid. Thats why most of the insecticides and home remedies such as
diatomaceous earth cannot kill bed bug
eggs.
Steaming and heat treatment are some of the most effective ways of destroying the hard outer shell found in bed bug eggs - including those of
<em>baby bed bugs.�</em>
Even so,
bed bug eggs squash
easily when subjected to mechanical forces such as when scrapped off or picked from the surface.
A little force breaks the outer shelf and
exposes the fluid from which bed bugs
grow. The fluid smears on the surface and your finger whenever you try to pick them.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug-egg"><strong>What Happens When You Squish a Bed Bug Egg?</strong></h2>
<p>Its almost painful to see bed bug eggs because they are very tiny and seemingly transparent.
But, when squished on fabrics, the
bed bugs appear as small stains
almost faint yellow.
Freshly squished eggs tend to adhere to the surface and smear on your fingers. However, if left to dry on wood or fabrics, the stain may become flaky and break into pieces.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-crush-bed-bug-eggs"><strong>Should You Crush Bed Bug Eggs?</strong></h2>
<p>Well,
bed bugs are as easy to squish
as crushing a cooked rice grain or bean. Although this reduces the number of eggs that hatch into nymphs, its an inefficient
combating bed bug
infestations.
The fact that
bed bugs lay many eggs
makes it impractical to eliminate them by squashing their eggs. Besides, they put their eggs in narrow spaces to avoid predators or disturbance by humans.
To crush eggs in these places, you need a slender stick or a credit card. This can be time-consuming and also ineffective.
Generally speaking, squashing bed bug eggs cannot provide an effective solution to a bed bug menace.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs"><strong>How to Kill Bed Bug Eggs</strong></h2>
<p>While most chemical products and home remedies may prove
effective against bed bugs
, they may not work on bed bug eggs.
So, what
should you do about bed bug
eggs? Below are two treatments you can use to get rid of bed bug eggs effectively.</p>
<h3 id="1-steaming"><strong>1. Steaming</strong></h3>
<p>The hard outer shell in a bed bugs egg makes it difficult for pesticides to penetrate.
It is possible to kill bed bugs with a dry steamer at all their life stages, including eggs - use
bed bug steamers
to kill flea larvae and eggs.
Most steamers come with nozzle attachments, which allow you to direct the steam into
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/">crevices where bed bugs</a>
lay their eggs.
They also come with upholstery nozzle attachments, which can be used to steam upholstery.</p>
<h3 id="2-freezing"><strong>2. Freezing</strong></h3>
<p>Another effective
method for destroying
bed bug eggs is to expose them to shallow temperatures - adult bed bugs can be trapped.
Bed bugs and their
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">eggs cannot survive</a>
at temperatures below 3 degrees Fahrenheit. You can also use
<a href="https://www.bedbugsinsider.com/can-you-kill-bed-bugs-with-ammonia/">ammonia to kill bed bugs</a>
, among other cheap remedies.
Leaving infested items outside during the winter season will
kill bed bugs
and their eggs. If possible, you can put the infested items in a freezer to
kill the bed bugs
and eggs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>However, squashing bed bug eggs does not effectively eradicate bed bugs -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/">mattress encasement</a>
can also help.
The use of chemicals
may also prove futile
because they may not penetrate the hard outer shell found in bed bug eggs. The most
effective methods for destroying bed bug
eggs include steaming or freezing.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The common butterfly bush, <em>Buddleja davidii</em>, is a popular garden shrub renowned for its abundant, fragrant flowers that undeniably attract a multitude of butterflies. Its vibrant blooms, often in shades of purple, pink, and white, seem to promise a haven for these delicate pollinators, making it a staple in many pollinator gardens. However, beneath this seemingly beneficial facade lies a complex ecological issue that has led many environmentalists and even some butterfly enthusiasts to question: <strong><a href="/posts/are-pre-emergent-weed-preventers-safe-around-bulbs/">Are</a> butterfly bushes actually bad for butterflies?</strong></p>
<p>The answer, like many things in ecology, isn&rsquo;t a simple yes or no. While butterfly bushes do provide nectar, their non-native, invasive tendencies and lack of support for the complete butterfly life cycle raise significant concerns. Understanding these nuances is crucial for gardeners aiming to create truly beneficial and sustainable pollinator habitats. This article will delve into the pros and cons of <em>Buddleja davidii</em>, discuss its ecological impact, and offer more beneficial alternatives for supporting butterfly populations.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-butterfly-bush">What Is a Butterfly Bush?</h2>
<p>The term &ldquo;butterfly bush&rdquo; most commonly refers to <em>Buddleja davidii</em>, also known as Summer Lilac. It is a fast-growing, deciduous to semi-evergreen shrub native to China. Its popularity stems from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abundant Flowers:</strong> Produces dense, cone-shaped flower clusters (panicles) from summer into fall.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Nectar Source:</strong> The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar, which is highly attractive to a wide range of pollinators, particularly butterflies, but also bees and hummingbirds.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Growth:</strong> <em>Buddleja davidii</em> is relatively drought-tolerant, adaptable to various soil types, and generally low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardeners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="negative-impacts-of-butterfly-bushes">Negative Impacts of Butterfly Bushes</h2>
<p>Despite their allure to adult butterflies, <em>Buddleja davidii</em> poses several ecological problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Invasiveness:</strong> This is the primary concern. <em>Buddleja davidii</em> is a prolific seed producer, and its seeds are easily dispersed by wind and water. It readily colonizes disturbed areas, roadsides, riparian zones (along waterways), and open woodlands.
<ul>
<li><strong>Ecological Disruption:</strong> Once established, it can outcompete and displace native vegetation, reducing biodiversity and altering natural habitats. In many regions, it is classified as an invasive species (e.g., in the Pacific Northwest, parts of Europe, and areas with suitable climates globally).</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Native Support:</strong> By displacing native plants, it reduces the availability of essential host plants that insect larvae (caterpillars) need to feed on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Pollinator Traps&rdquo;:</strong> While butterfly bushes provide nectar, they are often described as &ldquo;pollinator traps.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li><strong>Nectar Only, No Larval Host:</strong> <em>Buddleja davidii</em> provides nectar for adult butterflies but <strong>does not serve as a host plant for any North American or European butterfly or moth species</strong>. This means no butterfly caterpillar can feed on its leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Nutritional Deficiency:</strong> The nectar, while plentiful, may not be nutritionally complete for all pollinators compared to nectar from native plants. Some research suggests it can contain compounds that may even have negative effects on certain insect species, though more research is needed here.</li>
<li><strong>Diverting Pollinators:</strong> The sheer abundance of <em>Buddleja</em> flowers can draw pollinators away from native plants that <em>do</em> serve as host plants, potentially reducing the reproductive success of those native plant communities and the insects that rely on them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-butterfly-bushes-reproduce">How Butterfly Bushes Reproduce</h2>
<p><em>Buddleja davidii</em> primarily reproduces through <strong>seeds</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seed Production:</strong> Each flower spike can produce thousands of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. These seeds have a high germination rate.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Seeding:</strong> The plant readily self-seeds, leading to new plants popping up in unexpected places, including cracks in pavement, disturbed soil, and natural areas.</li>
<li><strong>Vegetative Reproduction:</strong> While less common than seed dispersal, butterfly bushes can also root from stem fragments, especially in moist conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prolific seed production and rapid establishment are key factors contributing to its invasive nature.</p>
<h2 id="are-butterfly-bushes-bad-for-butterflies">Are Butterfly Bushes Bad for Butterflies?</h2>
<p>In short, <strong>yes, if they become invasive and displace native plants.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem is Indirect:</strong> The butterfly bush isn&rsquo;t directly toxic to adult butterflies. They do feed on its nectar. The harm comes from its ecological behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Disrupting the Life Cycle:</strong> Butterflies have a complete metamorphosis: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa, and adult. Each stage has specific needs. Adult butterflies need nectar for energy, but their caterpillars need very specific <strong>host plants</strong> to eat. If <em>Buddleja davidii</em> outcompetes native plants, it reduces the available host plants, meaning adult butterflies have fewer places to lay eggs and fewer food sources for their offspring. This leads to a decline in butterfly populations over time.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A Monarch butterfly needs milkweed (<em>Asclepias spp.</em>) as a host plant for its caterpillars. If butterfly bush displaces milkweed, there will be fewer Monarchs, regardless of how much nectar the butterfly bush provides for the adults.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, while <em>Buddleja davidii</em> is superficially attractive to butterflies, it ultimately contributes to habitat degradation and a less robust ecosystem that can support the full butterfly life cycle.</p>
<h2 id="prevent-butterfly-bushes-from-invading-other-plants">Prevent Butterfly Bushes from Invading Other Plants</h2>
<p>If you already have <em>Buddleja davidii</em> in your garden and are committed to keeping it, you can take steps to minimize its invasive spread:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Deadheading (Crucial):</strong> <strong>Aggressively deadhead</strong> spent flower spikes <em>before</em> they go to seed. This is the most important step to prevent seed dispersal. Deadhead continually throughout the blooming season.</li>
<li><strong>Choose Sterile or Low-Viability Cultivars:</strong> Many nurseries now offer sterile or low-seed-producing <em>Buddleja</em> cultivars (e.g., those in the &lsquo;Lo &amp; Behold&rsquo; series, &lsquo;Blue Chip&rsquo;, &lsquo;Miss Molly&rsquo;, &lsquo;Pink Micro Chip&rsquo;). These are a much better choice if you want a butterfly bush. Always check the plant tag for information on seed viability.</li>
<li><strong>Containment:</strong> Plant in areas where its spread can be easily monitored and controlled, away from natural areas.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and Remove Volunteers:</strong> Regularly check your garden and surrounding areas for any self-seeded seedlings and remove them promptly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-butterfly-bushes">Alternatives To Butterfly Bushes</h2>
<p>Replacing <em>Buddleja davidii</em> with native plants is the best way to support local butterfly populations and overall ecosystem health. Here are categories of plants that provide both nectar for adults and host plants for caterpillars:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Native Nectar Sources (for adult butterflies):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coneflower (<em>Echinacea spp.</em>):</strong> Various colors, long bloom time.</li>
<li><strong>Bee Balm (<em>Monarda spp.</em>):</strong> Nectar and unique flower forms.</li>
<li><strong>Blazing Star (<em>Liatris spp.</em>):</strong> Tall, striking purple spikes.</li>
<li><strong>Goldenrod (<em>Solidago spp.</em>):</strong> Important late-season nectar.</li>
<li><strong>Milkweeds (<em>Asclepias spp.</em>):</strong> Crucial for Monarchs.</li>
<li><strong>Phlox (<em>Phlox spp.</em>):</strong> Fragrant and colorful.</li>
<li><strong>Zinnias:</strong> While often hybrids, single-petal varieties are great nectar sources and not invasive.</li>
<li><strong>Lantana (Native varieties where applicable):</strong> Some native species are good nectar sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Native Host Plants (for caterpillars):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Milkweeds (<em>Asclepias spp.</em>):</strong> Host for Monarchs.</li>
<li><strong>Pipevine (<em>Aristolochia spp.</em>):</strong> Host for Pipevine Swallowtails.</li>
<li><strong>Fennel, Dill, Parsley (<em>Apiaceae</em> family):</strong> Host for Black Swallowtails.</li>
<li><strong>Willow (<em>Salix spp.</em>):</strong> Host for Viceroy, Mourning Cloak, and many moths.</li>
<li><strong>Oak (<em>Quercus spp.</em>):</strong> Host for hundreds of moth and butterfly species.</li>
<li><strong>Native Violets (<em>Viola spp.</em>):</strong> Host for Fritillaries.</li>
<li><strong>Spicebush (<em>Lindera benzoin</em>):</strong> Host for Spicebush Swallowtail.</li>
<li><strong>Pawpaw (<em>Asimina triloba</em>):</strong> Host for Zebra Swallowtail.</li>
<li><strong>Redbud (<em>Cercis canadensis</em>):</strong> Host for Henry&rsquo;s Elfin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When choosing alternatives, focus on <strong>native plants specific to your region</strong>. These plants have co-evolved with local insect populations and provide the most complete ecological support.</p>
<h2 id="consider-succession-planting">Consider Succession Planting</h2>
<p>To create a truly thriving butterfly garden, think beyond just individual plants. Implement <strong>succession planting</strong> to ensure there are continuous blooms and host plants available throughout the growing season.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Spring Nectar:</strong> Provide flowers that bloom as adult butterflies emerge from overwintering.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Summer Nectar &amp; Hosts:</strong> Ensure a peak of food and breeding sites during the most active period.</li>
<li><strong>Late Season Nectar:</strong> Offer critical nectar sources for migrating butterflies (like Monarchs) and those preparing for winter.</li>
</ul>
<p>A diverse garden with different bloom times, flower shapes, and a mix of nectar and host plants will create a far more robust and resilient ecosystem for butterflies and all pollinators than any single plant, native or non-native.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-on-butterfly-bushes">Final Thoughts on Butterfly Bushes</h2>
<p>While the common butterfly bush (<em>Buddleja davidii</em>) is undeniably attractive to adult butterflies, its invasive tendencies and inability to support the larval stage of most butterflies make it a problematic choice for ecologically conscious gardeners. For true butterfly conservation, the focus should shift from simply attracting adults to creating comprehensive habitats that support the entire butterfly life cycle.</p>
<p>By choosing native plants that provide both essential nectar for adult butterflies and specific host plants for their caterpillars, and by implementing responsible gardening practices like succession planting and invasive species management, gardeners can cultivate landscapes that are genuinely beneficial for pollinators and contribute to a healthier, more biodiverse environment. Opt for sterile varieties if you must grow <em>Buddleja</em>, but ideally, fill your garden with the vibrant, life-sustaining native flora that truly sustains our cherished butterflies from egg to adult.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The intriguing world of <a href="/posts/are-crickets-good-or-bad/">crickets</a> and their place in our ecosystem often spark questions about their role as decomposers.</p>
<p>While they may be known for their melodious chirping on warm summer nights, crickets hold deeper ecological significance than meets the eye.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive exploration, we will investigate the multifaceted world of crickets, addressing whether they can be classified as decomposers, and shedding light on their broader ecological roles.
**The Answer: **
<em>To address the central question at hand, it&rsquo;s essential to clarify that crickets do not fit the conventional definition of decomposers. Decomposers are organisms responsible for breaking down deceased organic matter, typically encompassing fungi and specific types of bacteria. However, the distinction arises from crickets&rsquo; primary diet and ecological contributions.�</em>
<em>In simple terms, crickets do not actively partake in the decomposition of dead organisms. Instead, their diet predominantly consists of plant material and detritus, including decaying leaves, grasses, seeds, and other plant-related matter. While crickets indirectly assist in nutrient cycling by consuming and breaking down plant material, they are not the primary agents responsible for decomposing deceased organisms.</em></p>
<h2 id="understanding-crickets-ecological-significance">Understanding Crickets&rsquo; Ecological Significance</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s delve deeper into the multifaceted world of crickets, drawing insights from the OutLifeExpert article and expanding on their ecological roles:</p>
<h3 id="herbivores-and-detritivores">Herbivores and Detritivores</h3>
<p>As previously noted, crickets are
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-crickets-herbivores-or-omnivores/">herbivores</a>
, primarily consuming plant material such as leaves, stems, and seeds. This aligns with their classification as herbivores.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, crickets can also be considered detritivores, as they play a vital role in the decomposition process by consuming decaying plant matter.
This dual dietary role underscores their significance in nutrient cycling within ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ecological-interactions">Ecological Interactions</h3>
<p>The OutLifeExpert article highlights a crucial aspect of crickets: their role as a sought-after food source for various predators. Birds, reptiles, amphibians, and certain mammals all include crickets in their diet. This predation dynamic regulates <a href="/posts/are-crickets-herbivores-or-omnivores/">cricket</a> populations, thereby contributing to the ecological balance of their habitats.</p>
<p>Crickets, in essence, occupy a critical position in the food chain. As herbivores and detritivores, they connect the plant and animal realms within ecosystems.</p>
<p>By consuming plant material and participating in nutrient cycling, they influence the availability of resources for other organisms. When predators such as birds and reptiles hunt crickets, they not only control cricket populations but also derive essential sustenance from these small, chirping insects.</p>

      <description>As fleas search for food</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As fleas search for food
or flea dirt
, they&rsquo;ll be attracted by different stimuli to know a fitting host - are thermal and visual the main stimuli for attracting fleas?
<strong>So, are fleas attracted to heat (Thermotaxis)? Yes, over 90% of fleas will be attracted to fleas within 30 minutes but on its own, it has limited effectiveness in host-finding.�</strong>
<strong>Combining various stimuli such as movement, heat, and light (or shadows) will result in a higher attracting response on the fleas.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-are-fleas-attracted-to-heat-thermotaxis">Details: Are Fleas Attracted to Heat? Thermotaxis?</h2>
<p>As noted above, cat fleas will get attracted to their hosts through stimuli and thermal cues or stimuli. Thermotaxis denotes the aspect of repulsion or attraction towards heat.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, cat fleas are considered to be attracted and stimulated by heat or warmth - which means that they&rsquo;re positively thermotactic.</li>
<li>The positive thermotactic response in fleas allows them to location possible hosts andblood meals- this is because fleas&rsquo; hosts will emit some body warmth or heat.
But how do fleas detect heat? The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-have-antennae/">fleas&rsquo; antennae-like organ</a>
will work like some sensory organ. So, the fleas&rsquo; antennae will recognize different cues including heat or warmth.</li>
<li>Studies have reported that <a href="/posts/do-fleas-have-antennae/">flea</a> infestations significantly increase when there is a rise in warmth in the surrounding or heat.
If warm objects are positioned in the fleas&rsquo; environment, the bugs will jump randomly. The warm informs the fleas that there could be a possible host such as cats &amp; dogs.</li>
<li>Naturally, fleas love areas that are warmer. This includes places that have around 65 degrees of temperatures - and thus pets will make excellent hosts with their warmth.
Besides getting a great blood meal supply on the pets like cats &amp; dogs, fleas also enjoy the pet&rsquo;s warmth.</li>
<li>Fleas will use pets to gain entry into your house or apartment. But fleas may also hitch-hike your second-hand furniture or clothing.
When the fleas emerge from the cocoons, they&rsquo;ll start searching for a blood meal. If they don&rsquo;t get some blood meal, the bugs will starve within 1 week.</li>
<li>In the food-searching process, those fleas will identify their suitable hostsusing thermal and visual stimuli- this is simply heat &amp; light.
Recent studies report that when fleas are positioned in a dark area, over 90% of them will jump into the areas with light in just 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Considering lights, standard light will have a lower ability to attract fleas to those green-yellow lights.</li>
<li>Besides, the fleas&rsquo; attraction to heat or light will increase if the light source is turned on plus then off and on in quick succession - this mimics the movements of a flea host.
Further, flea traps that utilize intermittent lighting tend to attract &amp; trap more (about 82%) of these bugs.
The bugs will jump towards the heat source - as they&rsquo;ll get attracted to temperatures around 40C (104F).
However, they&rsquo;ll still get attracted by temperatures rising to highs of 50C (122F); and thus the fleas could hitchhike a number of hosts due to variation in temperatures that attract them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heat-alone-wont-promote-fleas-host-finding-habits">Heat Alone won&rsquo;t Promote fleas&rsquo; Host-Finding Habits</h2>
<p>Despite that heat or warmth will attract fleas, this cue (alone) won&rsquo;t work to attract the bugs towards their suitable hosts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs will orient their bodies to some warm gadget and aim to jump, but they&rsquo;ll only jump if there are other stimuli in the environment.
For example,
flea-control gadgets like flea traps
that use just heat as their sole stimulus will not attract the bugs.</li>
<li>Further, for the flea trap using light, including some heat will not boost its fleas&rsquo; attracting performance and host-detecting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fleas-abandon-their-hosts-with-low-temperatures">Fleas Abandon their Hosts with Low Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fleas will remain on their chosen host after they&rsquo;ve landed on such animals. However, fleas will leave that host once it&rsquo;s dying or dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs learn this if the body temperature of the host animals starts to drop.</li>
<li>Thus, the bugs will hitchhike another host or animal that is warm.
Further, fleas may jump onto some predator&rsquo;s body after such an animal has killed a flea-infested prey.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-emerged-flea-adults-on-hosts">Pre-emerged Flea Adults on Hosts</h2>
<p>Pre-emerged adult fleas will respond positively to heat as an attraction cue.</p>
<ul>
<li>After these younglings are adequately developed, they&rsquo;ll stay in<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-cocoons-look-like/">cocoons</a>up to when they detect some host.
The young fleas will be in the quiescent stage for about 5 months - they&rsquo;ll mainly be triggered by physical pressure and heat such as from a
fleas&rsquo; steam cleaner
.</li>
<li>The occurrence of pressure and heat will denote to the bugs that there is some nearby warm-blooded host.
The fleas emerge from those cocoons also due to the human breath that is warm. Another gadget I recommend for triggering the fleas&rsquo; emergence is the flea vacuum.</li>
<li>Will fleas be attracted to cold or heat? Well, fleas will flourish in humid and warm environments - which is about 75F - with their activity slowing down in winter.
Thus, during winter, the house and apartment will offer an appropriate habitat for fleas to grow especially if there are
<em>household</em>
pets like cats &amp; dogs.
For outdoor spaces, fleas will love humid, moist, &amp;
shady areas such as the yard or lawn
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on whether fleas are attracted to heat, YES fleas will be attracted by fleas but it must not be the only cue or stimuli.
Fleas prefer to respond positively to a combination of various stimuli including movement, heat, and light.</p>

      <description>As a home or pet owner, you&amp;#39;d be worried if your lovely dog or cat</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a home or pet owner, you&rsquo;d be worried if your lovely dog or cat
caught fleas
. These bugs will bite and suck blood from these animals, causing your furry friends pain, anemia, or death.
So, it&rsquo;s logical to pursue techniques to help control fleas both in the day and night times. But <a href="/posts/are-leopard-geckos-nocturnal/">are</a> <a href="/posts/are-male-or-female-bernedoodles-better/">fleas</a> nocturnal? do fleas sleep at night?
**In summary, fleas do not sleep but these bugs use the circadian (activity &amp; rest) rhythms. **
**But fleas, like bedbugs, are very active during the night-time or dusk than in the day (maybe they&rsquo;re nocturnal or vespertine?). **
<strong>However, fleas won&rsquo;t be fully inactive during the day and hence they may still jump into humans, between houses, and on pets.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-are-fleas-nocturnal-do-fleas-sleep-at-night">Details: Are fleas Nocturnal? Do fleas Sleep at Night?</h2>
<p><strong>1. Fleas Enjoy the Circadian Rhythm</strong>
Fleas, especially cat fleas, enjoy circadian activity &amp; rest locomotion rhythms while also being highly active at night compared to daytime - it&rsquo;s
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2708627/">unaffected by the</a>
ultrasonic devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, flea baits andflea trapswill work best at night. The bugs will rise some hours before dark with their activity being highest at midnight.
Fleas won&rsquo;t move much during the day - and also their pattern of laying eggs will follow this trend. The fleas lay their eggs mainly at midnight and less of these during dawn.
However, as noted above, fleas won&rsquo;t be fully inactive during the day. But they&rsquo;ll continue pooping during most hours of the day - constantly and randomly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-do-fleas-sleep">2. Do Fleas Sleep?</h3>
<p>First, fleas do not sleep - but as noted earlier they operate with the circadian rhythm - which means they have well-defined rest &amp; activity phases.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, while fleas are resting, they&rsquo;ll burrow themselves into bedding and carpeting plus the pet&rsquo;s fur and bedding.
The fleas will enjoy increased respiration, egg production, and movement at dusk. The adult fleas in their cocoons can remain in this state for even 5 months.
Unlike mammals, fleas won&rsquo;t follow the sleep pattern but during their resting phase, they don&rsquo;t respond well to
stimuli</li>
<li>during this time, the senses of the fleas are slightly insensitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-the-fleas-attack-most-aggressive-at-night">Why is the Fleas Attack Most Aggressive at Night?</h2>
<p>The fleas&rsquo; attack is most aggressive at nighttime since they&rsquo;re parasitic - they&rsquo;ll rest over day time and be overly active in attacks and feeding on hosts&rsquo; blood at night.
The parasitic fleas will depend on blood from pests and mammals (these ara largely diurnal). Thus fleas would benefit in their feeding and movement when their hosts are less active (this is nighttime).</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, as you and your pets lie down to rest during night or dusk, the fleas will have their circadian rhythmic cycle at activity - this allows them to be ready to attack.
During the night, the fleas won&rsquo;t experience much disruption from their hosts even when they&rsquo;re biting and thus this is an advantage to the bugs.
Realizing that these bugs are highly active at night, your flea control should take advantage of those (nighttime feeding) facts.</li>
<li>For example,flea-vacuum your floors and carpetsat night as this will help exterminate the adult fleas (they&rsquo;re highly active at this time), fleas eggs, and also the flea eggs.
I would also advise that you sprinkle some table salt and baking soda around the pet&rsquo;s bed and your bed during the nighttime - these remedies will lethally harm the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-fleasvespertine-or-nocturnal">Are Fleas<strong>Vespertine or Nocturnal?�</strong></h2>
<p>Cat fleas may be challenging to classify as Nocturnal mainly because; on the one hand, the bugs may be considered as Nocturnal because they are largely inactive during the daytime.</p>
<ul>
<li>But cat fleas don&rsquo;t become fully inactive even during the daytime - such as when they&rsquo;re on their hosts like humans and cats, the bugs could still be actively feeding.
On whether fleas are vespertine, the behavior of fleas may be classified as fleas is Nocturnal while that of bed bugs is crepuscular since they&rsquo;re both active as dawn or dusk (twilight).</li>
<li>The fleas&rsquo; egg production is lower during the daytime because the bug&rsquo;s oviposition rates rise at dusk (after sunrise) and they&rsquo;ll be a maximum production at mid of scotophase.
The egg production schedule and rate coincide with the hours of inactivity for domestic pets and humans.</li>
<li>The fleas don&rsquo;t vary their rate of releasing body waste with the time of day. The bugs will produce the waste at contact and random rate throughout its day.

</ul>
<h2 id="flea-diapause--dormancy"><strong>Flea Diapause &amp; Dormancy�</strong></h2>
<p>The pre-emergent adults may enter into some dormant or diapause state.</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the pupating process, the adult fleas will enter into a cocoon for a long time.
The fleas&rsquo; quiescent time is about five months. But the fleas could arise and emerge due to the detection of pressure and warmth.</li>
<li>Fleas may get disturbed while resting such as by the pet or humans due to activity while they&rsquo;re scratching or grooming - the fleas could move off.
Further, humans may also disturb the fleas while resting - you may feel the bites from fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="removing-fleas-from-your-house">Removing Fleas from your House</h2>
<p>When you have fleas in the house such as the bathroom,
carpeting
, the bed, or furniture - remember this could develop into a full infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>When pests walk around the yard or garden - you&rsquo;ll need to take examine whether the fleas may have jumped onto the skin or clothes.
So, you&rsquo;ll require to examine the flea eggs including on areas on the sofa, clothing, and carpet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, fleas will be active more during the nighttime - but the pests are not strictly nocturnal since they&rsquo;ll also be active in the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, fleas will also be active during the day but their activity includes feeding, eggs production, and movement.</li>
</ul>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s a question many homeowners ponder, especially those dealing with recurring clogs or the perceived aesthetic disruption: &amp;#39;Are gutters really necessary?...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a question many homeowners ponder, especially those dealing with recurring clogs or the perceived aesthetic disruption: &ldquo;Are <a href="/posts/all-american-gutters-reviews/">gutters</a> really necessary?&rdquo; While it might be tempting to view them as an optional accessory, particularly in drier climates or on homes with substantial roof overhangs, the reality is that for the vast majority of residential properties, gutters are far more than just an accessory; they are a critical component of your home&rsquo;s defense system against the destructive forces of water.</p>
<p>Without effective rainwater management, your home is vulnerable to a cascade of costly problems, ranging from foundation damage and basement flooding to rot in siding and fascia. Gutters, when properly installed and maintained, silently work to divert thousands of gallons of water away from vulnerable areas, safeguarding your property&rsquo;s structural integrity and long-term value.</p>
<p>This article will delve into a comprehensive understanding of rain gutters, explore common complaints and their practical solutions, and offer a conclusive perspective on why gutters, for most homes, are indeed a necessary investment, not a luxury.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="understanding-rain-gutters">Understanding Rain Gutters</h2>
<p>At their core, rain gutters are simple channels designed to collect rainwater as it sheds from your roof and direct it away from your home&rsquo;s immediate perimeter through a system of downspouts. Their function is deceptively simple but profoundly important.</p>
<p><strong>How They Work:</strong>
When rain or melting snow falls on your roof, gravity causes it to run down the slanted surfaces. Without gutters, this water cascades directly off the edge of the roof. Gutters, positioned along the eaves, capture this runoff. The <a href="/posts/best-3-inch-gutter-guards/">gutter</a> trough is subtly pitched (sloped) towards downspouts, which are vertical pipes that carry the collected water safely down to the ground. From there, downspout extensions further direct the water several feet away from the foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Why They Are Crucial:</strong>
The necessity of gutters stems directly from the immense power of water. A single inch of rain on a 1,000 square foot roof generates over 600 gallons of water. Imagine that volume repeatedly dumping directly onto the ground around your house.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foundation Protection:</strong> This is the paramount reason. Uncontrolled roof runoff saturates the soil immediately adjacent to your foundation. This can lead to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Hydrostatic Pressure:</strong> Water pressing against foundation walls, potentially causing cracks, bowing, and leaks in basements or crawl spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Soil Erosion:</strong> Washing away the soil that supports the foundation, potentially compromising its stability.</li>
<li><strong>Uneven Settling:</strong> If one side of the foundation is repeatedly saturated while another remains dry, it can lead to differential settling and structural damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Basement and Crawl Space Protection:</strong> By preventing water from pooling around the foundation, gutters significantly reduce the risk of basement flooding, dampness, and the subsequent growth of mold and mildew, preserving both your property and indoor air quality.</li>
<li><strong>Siding and Exterior Wall Preservation:</strong> Water consistently running down and splashing onto siding can cause:
<ul>
<li><strong>Staining and Discoloration:</strong> Unsightly streaks on brick, stucco, or siding.</li>
<li><strong>Mildew and Algae Growth:</strong> Particularly on shaded sides of the house.</li>
<li><strong>Rot and Deterioration:</strong> For wood siding, fascia boards, and soffits, prolonged moisture leads to rot, paint peeling, and structural damage, attracting pests like termites and carpenter ants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Erosion Control and Landscaping Preservation:</strong> Gutters prevent the destructive force of water from eroding topsoil, washing away mulch, damaging plants, and creating unsightly trenches in your yard.</li>
<li><strong>Entryway and Pathway Safety:</strong> They prevent slippery puddles on walkways, patios, and driveways, reducing the risk of slips and falls, especially in freezing conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Roof System Health:</strong> While less direct, gutters help prevent water from backing up under shingles (which can lead to leaks) and can reduce the severity of ice dam formation in colder climates by allowing melting snow to drain.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Situations Where Gutters Might Be Less Critical (and their caveats):</strong>
While rare, some homes <em>might</em> theoretically manage without gutters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extremely Arid Climates:</strong> In regions with negligible rainfall, the risk of water damage is naturally lower. However, even occasional heavy downpours can cause issues.</li>
<li><strong>Very Wide Eaves/Overhangs:</strong> If roof eaves extend several feet beyond the foundation, directing water far away. But even then, concentrated drips can still erode soil or splashback.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptional Ground Grading:</strong> Homes on very steep slopes with perfect grading away from all sides of the foundation. However, consistent perfect grading is difficult to achieve and maintain.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Drainage Systems:</strong> Some modern or architecturally unique homes may have hidden or internal drainage systems that serve the same purpose as external gutters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even in these scenarios, the risk profile increases, and a well-designed gutter system almost always offers superior protection.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-common-gutter-complaints-and-solutions">2 Common Gutter Complaints and Solutions</h2>
<p>Despite their vital role, gutters are often a source of frustration for homeowners. Most complaints, however, stem from maintenance issues or improper installation, which have clear solutions.</p>
<h3 id="complaint-1-my-gutters-are-always-clogged-and-overflowing">Complaint 1: &ldquo;My Gutters Are Always Clogged and Overflowing!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This is by far the most common complaint and the leading reason homeowners consider removing gutters. However, this isn&rsquo;t a problem with gutters themselves, but with their maintenance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Clogged gutters are ineffective. When leaves, twigs, shingle grit, and other debris accumulate, they block water flow, causing the gutters to fill and overflow. This negates their purpose and leads to the very damage they are meant to prevent.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regular Cleaning:</strong> The most fundamental solution. Gutters should be cleaned at least twice a year (spring and fall). Homes with many trees nearby may require more frequent cleaning (3-4 times a year). This involves physically removing debris and flushing the system with water.</li>
<li><strong>Install Gutter Guards (Gutter Protection):</strong> For a more permanent solution that significantly reduces cleaning frequency, consider installing gutter guards. These systems (mesh, micro-mesh, reverse-curve, etc.) prevent large debris from entering the gutter while allowing water to flow. While no system is 100% maintenance-free, they drastically reduce clogs and the associated overflow issues.</li>
<li><strong>Address Pitch Issues:</strong> Even clean gutters can overflow if they don&rsquo;t have the correct pitch (slope) towards the downspouts. If water pools or the gutter sags, it needs to be re-pitched or supported by adding/tightening hangers.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Adequate Downspouts and Sizing:</strong> Sometimes, the gutters or downspouts are simply too small for the volume of water they need to handle, especially during heavy rainfall. A professional can assess if you need larger gutters (e.g., 6-inch instead of 5-inch) or more downspouts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="complaint-2-gutters-are-ugly-and-detract-from-my-homes-appearance">Complaint 2: &ldquo;Gutters Are Ugly and Detract from My Home&rsquo;s Appearance.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>For some, the visible presence of gutters can seem like an aesthetic compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Standard gutters can be visually prominent, especially if their color clashes with the trim or if they become stained and dirty over time.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions:</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose Blending Colors:</strong> Select gutter colors that match your fascia board or trim color, allowing them to blend seamlessly with your home&rsquo;s exterior.</li>
<li><strong>Opt for Seamless Gutters:</strong> Seamless gutters, fabricated on-site to the exact length of your roofline, have fewer unsightly seams, creating a much cleaner, streamlined appearance compared to sectional gutters. This is a professional-only installation.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Cleaning:</strong> Dirty, stained gutters are always unsightly. Regular cleaning removes dirt, mildew, and &ldquo;tiger stripes&rdquo; (oxidation streaks) to keep them looking fresh.</li>
<li><strong>Paint Your Gutters:</strong> If your gutters are sound but their color is faded or no longer matches your home, they can often be painted to match your desired aesthetic. Use high-quality exterior-grade paint suitable for metal.</li>
<li><strong>Concealed Hangers:</strong> Choose hidden gutter hangers that are not visible from the ground, providing a cleaner look than external spike-and-ferrule or strap hangers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>So, are gutters necessary? For the overwhelming majority of homes, the answer is an unequivocal <strong>yes</strong>. They are a vital, non-negotiable line of defense against the relentless force of water, protecting your most valuable asset from potentially devastating and costly damage. The initial investment in a well-installed gutter system, coupled with consistent maintenance, pales in comparison to the expenses associated with foundation repairs, basement flooding, or exterior rot.</p>
<p>Rather than questioning their necessity, the focus should be on ensuring your gutters are functioning optimally. By addressing common complaints through diligent cleaning, smart repairs, strategic upgrades like gutter guards, and considering professional services when needed, you can transform your gutter system from a perceived nuisance into the silent, efficient guardian your home truly needs. Don&rsquo;t compromise on this essential protection; invest in the longevity and integrity of your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladybugs, with their distinctive red and black spots, <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> not only charming but also incredibly beneficial for your garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>These tiny beetles are natural pest controllers and contribute significantly to a healthy garden ecosystem.�Understanding the role of ladybugs can help you create a more vibrant and thriving garden.
This article will explore how ladybugs naturally control pests, how to attract them to your garden, and their overall impact on our ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="natural-pest-control-by-ladybugs">Natural Pest Control by Ladybugs</h2>
<p>Ladybugs are voracious predators of many common garden pests, particularly aphids. These pests can cause extensive damage to plants by sucking sap from leaves, stems, and buds.</p>
<p>A single ladybug can eat up to 5,000 aphids in its lifetime, making them extremely effective in protecting your plants. In addition to aphids, ladybugs also prey on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-medicine-for-ear-mites-in-cats/">Mites</a></li>
<li>Scale insects</li>
<li>Other harmful bugs
By reducing these pest populations, ladybugs significantly decrease the need for chemical pesticides in your garden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-attract-ladybugs-to-your-garden">How to Attract Ladybugs to Your Garden</h2>
<p>To attract ladybugs to your garden, consider planting a variety of flowers and herbs that they find appealing. Some of the best plants to attract ladybugs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dill</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cilantro</strong></li>
<li><strong>Yarrow</strong></li>
<li><strong>Marigold</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dandelion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cosmos</strong>
Additionally, providing a water source and avoiding chemical pesticides will make your garden more inviting to ladybugs. You can also purchase ladybugs from garden centers and release them into your garden during the evening to give them the best chance of establishing a population.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-role-of-ladybugs-in-our-ecosystem">The Role of Ladybugs in Our Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Ladybugs play a crucial role in maintaining a balanced ecosystem. By controlling pest populations, they prevent the overgrowth of harmful insects that can damage plants and crops.</p>
<ul>
<li>This natural form of pest control supports biodiversity and reduces the reliance on chemical interventions, which can negatively impact the environment.</li>
<li>Healthy plants promote a more vibrant and productive garden, benefiting not only the plants themselves but also other wildlife that depend on them.
In conclusion, ladybugs are invaluable allies in your garden, providing natural

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leopard geckos <a href="/posts/are-fleas-nocturnal/">are</a> terrestrial animals that mostly live on the ground and under rocks. Naturally, you will find them in the Middle East and Asia in countries like Iran, Afghanistan and India. So,
<em>are <a href="/posts/what-does-leopard-gecko-eat/">leopard</a> geckos nocturnal?�</em>
**In summary, contrary to popular belief Leopard geckos **are crepuscular and not nocturnal. They are not active the whole night, but you&rsquo;ll only enjoy them at fading light at dusk and dawn during twilight. ****
<strong><strong>Leopard geckos difference from the rest of nocturnal gecko is they have large eyes and ears so they can see and hear clearly at night.�</strong></strong></p>

<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Geckos&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="detailsare-leopard-geckos-nocturnal">Details:<strong>Are Leopard Geckos Nocturnal?�</strong></h2>
<p>Geckos may fall under the lizard family, but physically, they are very different from lizards. Lizards lack eyelids and lick their eyes to clean them. Finally, all geckos have vocal cords that allow them to bark as a protective mechanism to scare away predators.</p>
<p>Leopard geckos, on the other hand, have a unique set of features that differentiate them from your normal gecko. They lack sticky toe pads which limit their ability to climb. Leopard geckos have vocal cords just like other geckos. Leopard geckos are different from other geckos as they have eyelids and dont lick their eyes to clean them.
<em>Leopard geckos Described:�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An adult Leopard length is between 20.5-27.5cm and may weigh between 45-65 grams.�During winter, they undergo semi-hibernation (brumation), which is triggered by low temperatures.</li>
<li>During brumation, they sleep fulltime and uses energy reserves stored in their tails, waking up only to drink water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-all-geckos-crepuscular-"><strong>Are all Geckos Crepuscular ?</strong></h2>
<p>Geckos make good reptile pets. However, you may not enjoy them much as you may want to. It all depends on the time of the day they are active.</p>
<p>Geckos come in different species each exhibiting its unique set of characteristics. Some are active during the day (diurnal species); others are busy act night (nocturnal) while others are active at dusk and dawn during twilight.
<strong>1. Diurnal Species (Day Geckos)</strong>
The diurnal species is made up of mostly genus Presume geckos. Naturally, they are found in Madagascar, Mauritius and some select islands in the West Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>In recent years, the day geckos have gotten introduced to other parts of the world like Hawaii and Florida. They have been christened with fancy names like gold-dust gecko, yellow-headed gecko etc.</p>
<p>Yellow geckos are mostly green with blue or yellow markings get treated like treasures by their owners. The problem with day geckos is that owners cant enjoy them much by holding them as their loose skin may come off if strained.
<strong>2. Lygodactylus Geckos</strong>
These geckos are very different from your healthy geckos as they are heliothermic meaning they bask in the sun to gain warmth.</p>
<p>A good example is the Lygodactylus williamsi naturally found in Africa. The Lygodactylus geckos are very rare, and many pet dealers dont stock them.
<strong>3. Nocturnal Geckos</strong>
Nocturnal geckos are active during the night and spend most of their day time sleeping.</p>
<p>There are several species of geckos that are predominantly nocturnal like Moorish gecko which active at night but will occasionally feed or drink water during the day.</p>
<h2 id="do-leopard-geckos-need-light-at-night"><strong>Do Leopard Geckos Need Light At Night?�</strong></h2>
<p>The establishment that Leopard geckos are indeed not nocturnal but
<strong>Crepuscular�</strong>
led to a debate on whether they need Ultraviolet lighting. Many pet owners dont offer UV lighting to their leopard geckos.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there are no apparent health issues associated with a lack of UVB. However, research has further shown that although they dont bask under the sun to get UV light, they use the few hours they come out to feed at dusk and dawn to get UV too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBTZJAG-EJE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBTZJAG-EJE</a></p>
<p>A study has also shown that the skin of leopard gecko has a high affinity for UV in low light as compared to other reptiles. The expose explains why the leopard geckos spend the early hours of the morning or dusk active as this is the perfect time for them to absorb UV light.</p>
<p>If not exposed to UVB, health issues may arise to your captured gecko. The situation gets worsened by lack of proper supply of dietary Vitamin D. Lack of Vitamin D causes reduced utilization of calcium in their food resulting in a metabolic bone disease brought about by lack of calcium.</p>
<h2 id="which-temperatures-and-humidity-are-good-for-leopard-gecko"><strong>Which Temperatures And Humidity are good for Leopard Gecko?</strong></h2>
<p>Leopard gecko structures should be large enough to offer ample space for exercise and relation. It should be adequately ventilated to allow for proper aeration.</p>
<p>A Proper substrate should be availed, and sand is a no for geckos. Use artificial plants, cardboard boxes in place of sand as it interferes with skin shedding and if accidentally ingested may cause death to the gecko.</p>
<p>As a pet owner, you must put into consideration that geckos as reptiles are exothermic. Its, therefore, necessary for you to provide an adequate heat source to raise the temperatures in the gecko housing.</p>
<p>A bulb offering basking temperatures of 32 degrees should be available for the gecko the whole day in the spot area. In the cool end, the temperatures should be maintained at 25 degrees.</p>
<p>You must monitor the temperatures and humidity levels more so during the winter to ensure that the gecko is kept sufficiently warm.</p>
<h2 id="what-time-of-day-should-i-feed-my-leopard-gecko"><strong>What Time Of Day Should I Feed My Leopard Gecko?�</strong></h2>
<p>You may be wondering what the ideal time of the day to feed your gecko is. Geckos mainly feed insects like crickets, locusts etc. The live food in the form of insect gets loaded in calcium balancer, and phosphorus should not be included in the diet.</p>
<p>The ideal time for you to feed your gecko is between 7-9 pm immediately after its active following a docile day. It is also the best time to enjoy your pet as its up and full of glory.</p>
<p>The feeding lasts between 10-20 minutes after which any unconsumed live food should be withdrawn from the gecko.�If your gecko is less than a year old, feeding it once in a day is enough.</p>
<p>Adult geckos should, however, be fed once in two days. Sometimes your leopard gecko may refuse to eat. The scenario is as a result of illness.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the gecko is about to shed its skin or need to reduce its food reserves, it may refuse to eat. However, you should raise the alarm if this persists for several days as its a sign of illness.</p>
<h2 id="what-time-are-leopard-geckos-most-active-">**What Time Are Leopard Geckos Most Active? **</h2>
<p>Leopard geckos are active at early hours of the evening and very early in the morning. They remain docile during the day and also sleep after dusk only to be active again at dawn. They also use the busy hours to feed and hydrate themselves.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>If you are looking to acquiring your first reptile pet, searching for the best leopard gecko species is very important.</p>
<p>Top of your priority should be exploring the cost of maintaining the pet as a leopard gecko can live up to twenty years, which requires a lifetime commitment.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-vertebrates-or-invertebrates/">Lizards are vertebrates</a>
.</p>
<p>Lizards will bite you when they feel threatened.�But are lizards poisonous?
<strong>Short answer is NO. Most house lizards are not poisonous. But they have viruses and bacteria on their skin which can cause serious illness when consumed by humans.�</strong>
<strong>Only the Blue-tailed <a href="/posts/are-lizards-vertebrates-or-invertebrates/">lizard</a> has poison on the skin. A few lizards are known to have venomous bites. These include the Mexican Bearded Lizards, Iguanas and the Gila.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="are-lizards-poisonous"><strong>Are Lizards Poisonous?</strong></h2>
<p>**1. Lizards Bite for Defence **
Most house lizards are harmless creatures and will always scamper for safety whenever they feel threatened. In rare cases they can bite you as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>However, their bites are not known to be poisonous. Although they might inflict some pain, the bites wont have any serious effects on your body. But
there are some
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8331-lizards-poisonous-secret-is-revealed/">venomous lizards</a>
.
<strong>2. Desert Lizards Are Poisonous</strong>
The only lizards with venomous bites include the Mexican Bearded Lizards, Iguanas and the Gila. These are found in northern Mexico and south-western US. These lizards live in the desert regions and rarely come to dwelling places. They are also not know to bite unless they feel threatened.
**3. Pathogens on Lizardss Skin **
Your only worry with lizards should be the pathogens on their skin such as
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/reptile/care/diseases-your-pet-reptile-can-give-you">Salmonella</a>
. When you touch your pet lizard, you might ingest the harmful pathogens causing you fall sick.</p>
<p>Lizards are attracted to food stuff especially milk. Thus when they touch your food or accidentally fall into milk, you might incur serious infections.�A few lizards like the blue-tailed lizard contain poison on their skin.</p>
<h2 id="common-venomous-lizards">Common Venomous Lizards</h2>
<p><strong>1. Gila Monster</strong>
Gila is an endangered lizard of northern Mexico and the south-western US. Its usually black in color with bright spots on various parts of the body. It has a notable stout body which is bulged at the head and tail.</p>
<p>An adult can reach about 20 inch and feeds on birds, small mammals and their eggs. The bulged head helps in holding the prey in place as it injects the venom to paralyze it.</p>
<p>But unlike snakes, all venomous lizards such as
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/11/17/1506321.htm">Australian lizards</a>
dont have fangs. Venom flows over the groves on their teeth to the prey. They rarely bite humans. If they bite they wont cause death.
<strong>2. Mexican Beaded Lizard</strong>
A close relative to the Gila monster, Mexican Beaded Lizard lives in western as well as the central parts of Mexico. It resembles the Gila monster in all aspects except that its darker and grows longer (32 inches).</p>
<p>Its also an endangered species and its trade has been banned. They inhabit thorn scrubs and pine forests where they feed on small mammals, birds and their eggs - like the
blue tailed lizards are venomous
.</p>
<p>Similar to Gila, this lizard bites it prey and holds on it with its powerful jaws before paralyzing it with its venom. For humans, the bite is only painful but it wont cause death.</p>

<strong>3. Iguana</strong>
These are large lizards stretching to about 6.6 feet long. The most common is the green iguana usually found in Brazil and Mexico. They mainly inhabit arid areas, tree and the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Unlike most lizards, iguanas are vegetarians. However, they have sharp teeth which they use to bite impending intruders. Their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom">venom</a>
is relatively mild compared to other venomous lizards.</p>
<p>Although they dont attack easily, they can cause serious injuries on soft skin such as face, hands and legs.�But they are known to warn intruders before they strike. Watch out for iguanas when they take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on their fours.
<strong>4. Monitor Lizard�</strong>
Last but not least is the
monitor lizards
. Commonly found in Australia, these lizards vary greatly in size (2/3 foot to 10 feet). They are not usually very aggressive to intruders and will tend to run away.</p>
<p>Although they are venomous, they wont cause death. Whenever they are cornered, they might cause injuries with their powerful claws or jaws. Or they may whip with their powerful tails.</p>
<h2 id="can-lizards-harm-my-cat">Can Lizards Harm My Cat?</h2>
<p>Venomous lizards will definitely harm your cat in two ways  Being bitten by a venomous lizard or ingesting a poisonous lizard.</p>
<p>Your curious cat tends to run after every crawling creature oblivious if the dangers. Some lizards like the Blue-tailed lizard have poison on their skin. If your cat eats such a lizard it might suffer serious reactions from the toxins.</p>
<p>Possible symptoms of the toxin include vomiting, fever, dizziness, staggering, diarrhea etc. some toxins can even lead to paralysis. If venomous lizards stray into your compound, they might end up biting your curious cat in their encounter.</p>
<p>The Mexican Beaded and Gila Monsters lizards are two lizards to watch out for. When they bite your cat, they wont release easily. By the time you release the animal, itll have released the venom to your cat. Symptoms of the bite might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>General weakness</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Shock</li>
<li>Low blood pressure</li>
<li>Vomiting and nausea</li>
<li>Abnormal defecation and urination</li>
<li>Lizards broken teeth in the wound
The first thing you do is to try and remove the lizard from your cat using the safest method possible. You can insert a metal rod into the lizards mouth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively put some drinking alcohol or vinegar into the lizards mouth. After successively removing the lizard, take the cat to the vet.</p>
<p>Also if you dont manage to remove the lizard, take the cat to the vet with the lizard in place. Your vet will remove the lizard, and administer an anti-venom.</p>
<h2 id="are-lizards-harmful-to-humans">Are Lizards Harmful To Humans?</h2>
<p>Lizard venoms will inflict pain and cause serious reactions to your body. The intensity of the reactions will depend on species of lizard that bites you.</p>
<p>Lizard venoms are however less serious compared to snake venoms and can be treated with minimal complications. Kids can be at risk of developing serious complications from lizard venoms.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-carry-salmonella"><strong>Do Lizards Carry Salmonella?�</strong></h2>
<p>Lizard bites can transfer pathogens such as
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/salmonella/symptoms-causes/syc-20355329">Salmonella</a>
.
Symptoms of lizard bites in humans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain and Convulsions</li>
<li>Decreases blood pressure</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Swelling and�Numbness</li>
<li>Diarrhea and�Shock</li>
<li>Difficulty in breathing
In case of lizard bites, seek medical attention as soon as possible. Delayed medical attention can lead to complications or even death.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-lizard-bites">How to Treat Lizard Bites</h2>
<p>When youre bitten by a lizard you might not immediately know whether its poisonous or not. So the first thing to do is to call poison expert to help in identification.</p>
<p>If they cannot respond your call of distress with prompt, take a photo of the lizard and report to the nearest hospital.�If possible take the lizard with you. But you risk getting more bites which can worsen the condition.</p>
<p>Waiting for symptoms to show might only make the condition worse. Treatments for poisonous and non-poisonous lizard bites include:
<strong>1. Treating Non-Poisonous Lizard Bites</strong>
House lizard are certainly not poisonous. So, if youre bitten by a house lizard you dont have to go to hospital.</p>
<p>You can treat yourself at home with simple methods and ingredients to prevent infection and ease the symptoms. Heres what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop the bleeding by applying a little pressure on the bite.</li>
<li>If the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">lizard broke its teeth on the wound</a>, remove them carefully with a pair of tweezers.</li>
<li>Clean the wound with warm water to prevent infection.</li>
<li>Apply a little petroleum jelly on the wound to inhibit bacterial contamination.</li>
<li>If need be, cover the wound with a non-stick bandage.</li>
<li>A cold therapy can help ease pain and inflammation.</li>
<li>If symptoms persist, see a medical doctor.
<strong>2. Treating for Poisonous Lizard Bites</strong>
If youre certain that the lizard is poisonous or you are not sure about that, call for medical assistance - but some
lizards such as
Green Anole are venomous.
Meanwhile here are some home interventions you should try before medical help is available.
<strong>First Aid</strong></li>
<li>Keep calm and remove tight cloths and jewelry. They are hard to remove when swelling begins.</li>
<li>Call poison control hotline. These will help in the correct identification of the lizard and advice you accordingly. You may be asked to send photos of the lizard.</li>
<li>Keep the affected part below the heart level.</li>
<li>Monitor the spread of the venom with 15 minute interval markings.
<strong>What a Medical Specialist Will Do</strong></li>
<li>Cleaning the wound and Removing any lizard teeth</li>
<li>Administration of painkillers, anaesthesia and antibiotics</li>
<li>Performing sawyers extraction to remove the venom</li>
<li>Tetanus injection</li>
<li>Cardiac examination</li>
<li>Pulse monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-know-if-a-lizard-is-poisonous">How Do You Know If A Lizard Is Poisonous?</h2>
<p>Therere only few venomous lizards on earth. Unlike the common house lizards, venomous lizards live in the wild away from humans. Most of them live in burrows and dont come out so often. Here are notable features to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theyre relatively larger than house lizards</li>
<li>Their skin is beaded skin instead of being scally</li>
<li>Can be recognized by their distinct colors i.e black and yellow, black and red or black and orange.</li>
<li>Strong limbs</li>
<li>They exhibit signs of panic. For instance, some lizards will produce a hissing sound. Notably the iguanas will take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on its four limbs.</li>
<li>When they bite, they clamp on until they are forcefully dislodged</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-dislodge-a-lizard-from-a-victim">How to Dislodge a Lizard from a Victim</h2>
<p>Whenever they bite, venomous lizards tend to cling on the victim while they release venom. The powerful jaws on their head makes it hard to detach.</p>
<p>Its advisable not to try to pull the animal as this would leave broken teeth in the victims flesh and cause further tissue damage. Here is what to do.
<strong>Open the Jaws with a Prying Tool -�</strong>
A prying tool such as a pliers or butter knife can be used to force open the jaws, and safely dislodge the lizard from the victim.
<strong>Immerse the Lizard in Water -�</strong>
Immersing the victims body together with the lizard in cold water is a safe way of detaching the animal. Some lizards are protected and so killing them is an offence.
<strong>Flame under the Chin -�</strong>
Another method of getting the lizard from the victims flesh is to slightly apply a flame just below the chin.
<strong>Allow the Lizard to Stand On Its Feet -�</strong>
If the lizard gets good grip on the ground, it may feel secure and release the grip. But this is not a quick method if you want to save the victim from subsequent venoms.</p>
<h2 id="final-word"><strong>Final Word</strong></h2>
<p>Most lizards are non-venomous and will not readily bite you. Even the few venomous lizards bite when provoked or in defense when they feel threatened.</p>
<p>Although the venom can barely kill a human, it can cause serious body reactions. In addition the bite can cause serious tissue damage. So, it good to be on the safe side whenever you encounter such lizards.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May be you have come across various species of lizards in your home, park or zoo and wonder whether they have backbones or not. How could their internal organs be protected or supported? Could they be having similar anatomy as mammals or other animals?
**So, Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates? The simple answer is, all species of <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">Lizard</a> are vertebrates (they have backbone also called the vertebral column/spinal column). **
**The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal regions and sacral apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into caudal and precaudal. **
<strong>The main function of the backbone is to offer protection to the spinal cord. It also provides an option for attachment of body muscles.�</strong>

<h2 id="are-lizards-vertebrates-or-invertebrates">Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates?</h2>
<p>Lizards including
bearded dragons
are vertebrates whose spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal and sacral vertebrae. Some species may have lumbar region too.</p>
<p>The main function of vertebral column in Lizards is to protect the spinal cord (this house the nervous system and aid in body coordination). In addition, the backbone offers support to the body and attachment of muscles, pectoral and pelvic girdle for easier locomotion.</p>
<h3 id="a-vertebral-column-in-lizards">a. Vertebral column in lizards.</h3>
<p>Lizard (apart from legless lizards) have vertebral column also called spinal column or backbone that is divided into four parts i.e. cervical, dorsal, sacral and sacral vertebrae. Some lizard species may also have lumbar region.</p>
<p>These vertebral sub-divisions are formed mainly to help perform a given functions in lizards. The major function of vertebral column it to ensure sufficient protection of spinal cord  which runs vertically and centrally within vertebral column from the head to tail. The spinal cord helps in condonation of the nervous system of the entire lizard.</p>
<p>Related:
Do Lizards Have Teeth?
<strong>i. The cervical vertebrae.</strong>
This vertebra is found at the neck region of the lizards. The cervical vertebrae help support the neck and assist in free movement of the neck  side by side, up and down or around.</p>
<p>The special type of cervical vertebrae called atlas is well adapted to help in nodding while axis allows rotary motion. In most lizards, the vertebral are articulated and fused is such a way that they seem vestigial. In some lizard species, most of these bones are advanced to form dorsal vertebrae.</p>
<p>The cervical vertebrae also provide the option for attachment of neck muscles and skull resting point.
<strong>ii. Dorsal vertebrae.</strong>
This is also called Thoracic vertebrae. The Dorsal vertebrae offer the point for attachment of the ribs. The ribs provide protection for the lungs, heart and the liver. The sternum and scapula are also attached on these vertebrae.</p>
<p>The number of dorsal vertebra varies according to the species. The small lizards such as chameleon lizards and savannah lizards may have 8 to 12 dorsal vertebra. The medium size lizards such as Nile monitor lizards may have 11 to 17 thoracic vertebra while large lizards such as Komodo dragon may have 16 to 25 dorsal vertebra.
<strong>iii. Lumbar Vertebrae.</strong>
These are vertebrae that are found between the dorsal and the sacral vertebral. These vertebrae do not carry any rib. Most lizards do not have Lumbar vertebrae thus their dorsal and sacral vertebrae are directly interconnected.</p>
<p>Lumbar vertebrae are only found in few large lizard species such as monitor lizards and Komodo lizards. The lumbar vertebrae provides an option for the attachment of body muscles. These vertebrae also enable lizards to fold coil easily.
<strong>iv. The Sacral Vertebrae.</strong>
The Sacral vertebral is the found in sacrum section. It is connected with pelvic to offer option for support and attachment of pelvic muscles.</p>
<p>The sacral vertebral has 1 to 7 bones in lizards. The number varies according to the lizard species. The first 3 sacral bones are fuse to form a strong support at the pelvis girdle.</p>
<p>The sacral vertebra has a short stout rib-like protrusion, which offer point of muscle attachment. Moreover, these vertebrae have short arches and spines.
<strong>v. The Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
This is also called the tail vertebrae. In some lizards, the caudal vertebrae are fused with sacral vertebrae. These vertebrae have short stouts on the sizes that provide for the attachment of the muscles. There are 1 to a maximum of 30 caudal vertebra in lizards.</p>
<p>The small-tailed lizards such as stumpy-tailed lizards have few vertebra while long tailed lizards such as skinks, basilisk and chameleon lizards have large number of caudal vertebrae (10 to 30).</p>
<p>The arches and spines in caudal vertebrae continuously decreases up to the last vertebra. The caudal vertebral are adapted to provide easier movement of the tail.</p>

<h3 id="b-the-vertebral-column-of-legless-lizard">b. The Vertebral Column of Legless Lizard.</h3>
<p>Legless lizards are lizard species that have lost their legs independently at a point in life or their legs have reduced into point of no use in locomotion. These lizards crawl on the ground like snakes.</p>
<p>The legless lizard has its backbone divided into two sections i.e. the precaudal and caudal vertebrae. These sections collectively support the lizard and protect the spinal cord from external damage as well as offer support and attachment for body muscles.
<strong>i. Precaudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The precaudal vertebrae consist of bones that are found before the tail/caudal or pelvic region. In precaudal vertebrae, bone are interconnected to form one chain that help the lizards in locomotion.</p>
<p>The cervical, dorsal/thoracic and lumbar are connected into one unit. These vertebrae offer option of attachment of body muscles and the ribs.</p>
<p>Most legless lizards have the first to fifth bones in the precuadal vertebrae fused thus having minimum movement/turning.
<strong>ii. Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The sacral and tail vertebrae in legless lizards are fused to form caudal vertebrae. Legless lizards do not have lumbar vertebrae and pelvic girdle (if any is very small).</p>
<p>The caudal vertebrae forms the tail region, which is powerful for defense action. The first 5 to 10 vertebral bones are fused to give ample strength to the legless lizard at the caudal origin.</p>
<p>The caudal vertebra has stout that protrude laterally to provide option for attachment of back muscles. Moreover, the caudal vertebrae have short spines and arches that decreases gradually till the tip of the tail.</p>
<h3 id="c-functions-of-the-backbonespinal-column">c. Functions of the Backbone/spinal column</h3>
<p>The major function of spinal column in lizards is to protect the spinal cord, which controls the nervous systems. The spinal cord runs vertically from the head to the tail and its centrally located through the hollow sections left along the vertebral column.</p>
<p>The backbone also provides option of attachment of the body muscles and point of growth of other body somatic cells. The muscles grows from the backbone and accumulate enough to help coordinated movement of the lizards.</p>
<p>The backbone provides the point of connections for other appendicular skeleton. The femur, the humerus and scapula are jointed to the backbone using either ball and socket joint or hinge joint to enable easier locomotion. The appendages are interlinked and their entire weight is housed at the backbone.</p>
<p>In addition, the backbone provides extra support and protection to internal organs such as the heart, liver, lungs and intestine. The clavicle, ribs and pelvis girdle are well jointed on the backbone to help in provide further internal protection.</p>
<h2 id="is-lizard-a-reptile-or-amphibian">Is lizard a reptile or amphibian</h2>
<p>All lizards are reptiles including
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-monitor-lizards-poisonous/">monitor lizards</a>
. They are cold-blooded animals (ectothermic). Unlike amphibians (which have smooth and slippery skin), Lizards have skin which is covered with scare  this one features of all reptiles. The following are characteristics/fears of reptiles (lizards):
<strong>1. They are cold blooded</strong>
. This means that their body temperature changes according to the change in temperature on its environment. Because of the ectothermic metabolism of the lizards, they are forced to bask under the sun to raise its body temperature. A warm lizard is more active that a cold one.
<strong>2. Their skin is covered with scale or scutes</strong>
. Reptiles develop hard skin that is made of scale using protein keratin. Reptiles such as turtles and armored crocodile have scutes which form deeper layer under the skin. All lizards skin is covered with scale.
<strong>3. Most reptiles lay eggs.</strong>
Like most reptiles, lizards are oviparous  they lay eggs, which have hard shells. Their eggs are laid mainly on land. Lizards also take care of the eggs until they hatch. The eggs of amphibians (frogs) do not have hard shell. The eggs are enclosed in a jelly substance that offer protection  the female frog never take care of its eggs once laid in water.
<strong>4. They breathe by use of lungs</strong>
. Reptiles (lizards) breathe though the lungs in their entire life  even when in water. Contrary, amphibians such as frogs and toad breath through lungs, skin or gills (at young stage - tadpole).
<strong>5. They have four walking legs (apart from legless lizards)</strong>
. The reptiles (lizards) have four legs that are used for locomotion/walking. Amphibians such as frog, newt or toad have two hind legs for jumping and two front legs adapted for landing. Their legs cant walk as in the case of lizards.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-have-backbones">Do Lizards Have Backbones?</h2>
<p>Yes. Lizards have backbones since they are classified as vertebrates. The backbone is used to give support to body organs, muscles and cells. Moreover, the Backbone of lizards offers option for attachments of body muscles.</p>
<p>The backbone provides point link for appendicular skeleton such as ribs, femur, humerus, sternum or scapula as well as protect internal organs such as heart, lungs, livers and kidneys.</p>
<p>The hard bone spines and arches formed by the spinal column of lizards provide suitable defense tool against its enemies.</p>
<h2 id="major-facts-about-lizard-as-a-reptile">Major facts about Lizard as a reptile.</h2>
<p><strong>1. The Survival Mechanism</strong>
.</p>
<p>Lizards have adapted to living in the harshest conditions without getting extinct due to their feeding diversity. Lizards feeds on variety of food such as small insects, crustaceans, snakes, birds and ever lard animals such as baby turtles.</p>
<p>Lizards such as Komodo dragon and tree crocodile are known for predation culture. They even attack human beings for food.</p>
<p>Lizards are able to camouflage and escape any predator. For example, the chameleon lizards are able to change color randomly to march the background and use this mechanism to escape the predator.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">venomous lizards use the poison to paralyze</a>
their prey before swallowing them. The strong tail of predator lizards is used a weapon to grasp and knock down their prey or defend themselves in case of attack.</p>
<p>Lizards often escape in case they notice dangers to hideouts that make predators difficult to reach them e.g. under the roof, in the thorn bushes or holes/cracks.
<strong>2. The lizard Habitat.</strong>
Lizards are found everywhere in the world. They mostly live on the ground. Lizards do not make nests. You will spot some lizards in trees, marshy areas or riverbanks (Nile monitor and Asian Water monitor)</p>
<p>Though lizards are ectothermic (cold blooded), you will find them in cold region as well as in arid and semi-arid areas e.g. Savannah monitor.
Leopard geckos are crepuscular
.</p>
<p>Lizards such as marine iguanas dwell under the water though they often come to the shore to bask and lay eggs. Lizards, which dwell on trees, have short wide toes that are well adapted to climbing.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All Lizard species are vertebrates. They have backbone, also called the vertebral column/spinal column, whose main function is to protect the spinal cord and offer option for attachment of body muscles and appendicular skeleton.</p>
<p>The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, sacral and vertebrae apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into precaudal and caudal vertebrae.</p>

<h2 id="details-are-male-or-female-bernedoodles-better"><strong>Details: Are Male or Female Bernedoodles Better?�</strong></h2>
<p>Are male or female bernedoodles better?� Well, it depends. Size and personality are the main differentiating factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male Bernedoodles are larger compared to their female counterparts. Consequently, everything about them has dialed up a notch.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://welovedoodles.com/bernedoodle/">characteristics of a Bernedoodle</a>also differ based on their gender. Males tend to be more playful.
If a Bernedoodle is actively running and jumping around, chances are it is a male. They also tend to be quite stubborn when it comes to training.
On the other hand, females are much more docile. They are mild-mannered and take well to training sessions.
Owners tend to get pets that reflect their personalities. So whichever Bernedoodle resonates with you the most should be your pick.
<strong>�</strong>
Owning a pet is a big responsibility but a rewarding one. Naturally, you want to be prepared and provide the best home for your beloved Bernedoodle.
We have already covered the basics but lets take a more analytical approach to raise both male and female Bernedoodles. If that sounds like a good idea to you, keep reading as we have some great ideas to share.
It is important to keep in mind there is no major difference between male and female Bernedoodles. Everything we talk about below can be applied to both genders without much change.

<h2 id="what-are-the-types-of-bernedoodles"><strong>What are the Types of Bernedoodles?</strong></h2>
<p>Bernedoodles come in three major types. They are:</p>
<h3 id="1-tiny"><strong>1. Tiny</strong></h3>
<p>This is the smallest of the Bernedoodles. They weigh between 10 and 24 pounds and grow up to 17 inches.
These dogs are the true definition of pocket-sized. They are harder to handle as pups due to their excitable nature. They become calmer after reaching adulthood.
<strong>2. Miniature</strong>
The miniature Bernedoodle is slightly bigger, standing at 22 inches after maturing.
They can weigh up to 59 pounds. Much like the tiny version, the miniature type is a handful when young.
<strong>3. Standard</strong>
The standard variation is the most commonly seen Bernedoodle. They can reach up to 29 inches and weigh more than 80 pounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>These large dogs are more expensive to groom and feed. They have calm personalities throughout their lives.</li>
<li>As discussed above, male Bernedoodles are bigger in height and weigh more than female ones.
This makes taking care of the male ones a slightly bigger challenge.

<h2 id="a-quick-comparison-to-the-goldendoodle"><strong>A Quick Comparison to The Goldendoodle</strong></h2>
<p>You may have heard of the Goldendoodle dog, which is a cross between the Golden Retriever and the Poodle.
This breed shares many similarities with the Bernedoodle. Their personalities are very similar as they are both playful and jovial.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also exhibit the same levels of stamina throughout their lives.</li>
<li>The Goldendoodle tends to enjoy the water more. This is a trait inherited from its Golden Retriever heritage.
They thrive better in warmer climates compared to the
<a href="https://veterinarians.org/bernedoodle/">Bernedoodle</a>
. Despite minor differences, both breeds make excellent companions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-bernedoodles-behave"><strong>How Do Bernedoodles Behave?</strong></h2>
<p>The Bernedoodle is a hybrid of the Bernese and Poodle dogs. They exhibit the best of both worlds.
This results in a fun-loving pet which easily connects with humans. Males tend to exhibit a more stubborn nature than females. Consequently, they are harder to train and can be a handful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernedoodles are great to have around children and elderly people.
Their mild nature helps them bond easily with anyone. Bernedoodles are easily trained, which makes them one of the best therapy dogs.
Puppies may show a hard-headed personality, but proper training tends to mellow them out.

<h2 id="how-should-you-feed-a-bernedoodle"><strong>How Should You Feed a Bernedoodle?</strong></h2>
<p>How much your Bernedoodle eats depends on a multitude of factors.
Age, height, weight, type, and gender <a href="/posts/are-leopard-geckos-nocturnal/">are</a> among the main ones. Standard Bernedoodles eat much more than their smaller cousins. Males tend to eat more as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernedoodles are not picky eaters. They will eat almost anything and in large quantities. This is a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, you have a wide variety to choose from because they have little to no preference. Conversely, picking the right kind of food can be daunting.
Here are some pros and cons of the different kinds of food:
<strong>1. Kibble or Dry Food</strong></li>
<li>This is the most common method of feeding</li>
<li>Less expensive and lasts longer</li>
<li>Protects from dental issues</li>
<li>The nutritional standard varies greatly
Kibble is an all-in-one solution but may not be the best for a growing puppy.
<strong>2. Wet Food</strong></li>
<li>This is a great transitional food for the growing puppy</li>
<li>A higher quantity of preservatives and chemicals</li>
<li>Potential to cause dental issues</li>
<li>Prolonged use leads to gastrointestinal problems
<strong>3. Raw and Cooked Food</strong></li>
<li>Higher nutritional value</li>
<li>Variety of choices and flavors</li>
<li>It tends to be expensive (for larger dogs)</li>
<li>Improper feeding can lead to malnutrition
Choosing the right type of food is vital for your Bernedoodle. Research has shown feeding habits correlate directly to their personality development.
Consulting a veterinarian is a good idea as they can create custom diet plans for your Bernedoodle.

<h2 id="feeding-schedule"><strong>Feeding Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>A feeding schedule is necessary to avoid health problems. Obesity among dogs is a common issue as owners typically do not follow a diet plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernedoodle puppies are more physically active, which makes feeding them less of an issue. As they grow up, they tend to get slower and proportionally gain more weight.
Typically, you want to feed puppies three times a day. Grazing should be allowed for up to three months.
After this period, you should maintain a schedule. Dogs older than six months require two big meals daily. Experts recommend having set feeding times.
This will condition your pet to be hungry during those times. Fully matured Bernedoodles may still be hungry after each feeding. In such cases, they may be allowed to graze but keep a close eye on them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-best-grooming-habits-">**What are the Best Grooming Habits? **</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Bernedoodles do not have fur on their bodies. They possess a
lot of hair
but do not shed much.</p>
<ul>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/%5Bare%5D(/posts/are-crickets-good-or-bad/)-crickets-good-or-bad/">might be causing harm</a>
, this comprehensive guide will provide you with a thorough understanding of the impact of mole crickets on your green spaces.
We&rsquo;ll delve into their habits, the telltale signs of their presence, and effective measures to safeguard your garden or lawn from these subterranean pests.</p>
<h2 id="unveiling-mole-crickets">Unveiling Mole Crickets</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Meet the Mole Crickets</strong></dt>
<dd>Mole crickets, belonging to the family Gryllotalpidae, are intriguing nocturnal insects known for their subterranean lifestyle.
Equipped with specialized front legs designed for digging, they effortlessly navigate through soil.
<em>Sources</em>

University of Florida - Mole Crickets
Mole crickets come in various species, with the most common ones being the northern mole cricket (
<em>Scapteriscus borellii</em>
) and the southern mole cricket (
<em>Scapteriscus acletus</em>
). While their appearance may vary slightly, their behavior and the damage they cause are relatively consistent.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="assessing-the-impact-of-mole-crickets">Assessing the Impact of Mole Crickets</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Lawn in Distress</strong></dt>
<dd>Mole crickets are infamous for causing chaos in lawns. Their voracious appetite for plant roots results in discolored patches, stunted grass growth, and overall lawn weakness.
The damage inflicted by mole crickets often resembles the appearance of drought stress, making it challenging to identify the root cause.
Lawns with mole cricket infestations may exhibit uneven patches of yellowing or wilting grass. These areas may be particularly susceptible to drought conditions due to the reduced root system caused by mole cricket feeding.
<strong>Garden Troubles</strong></dd>
<dd>In gardens, mole crickets can wreak havoc on the roots of various plants, compromising their overall health and productivity. Vegetable gardens, flower beds, and ornamental plantings are all vulnerable.
Mole crickets are omnivorous, meaning they feed on both plant material and other small insects. This opportunistic behavior can lead to damage not only to the plant roots but also to the ecosystem within your garden. When they consume beneficial insects, it can disrupt the natural balance and lead to pest outbreaks.
<strong>Soil Disruption</strong></dd>
<dd>Beyond their feeding habits, the tunneling behavior of mole crickets can lead to soil erosion and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-crickets-decomposers/">destabilize the ground</a>
, further jeopardizing the well-being of your garden or lawn.
Mole crickets create tunnels in the soil as they move about, leaving behind a network of channels. This tunneling can interfere with the root system of plants, making it difficult for them to access water and nutrients. Additionally, the tunnels can become pathways for water to run off, leading to soil erosion and compaction.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="identifying-mole-cricket-damage">Identifying Mole Cricket Damage</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Wilting and Yellowing</strong></dt>
<dd>Keep a keen eye out for areas in your garden or lawn displaying wilting grass or yellowing vegetation. These are classic indications of mole cricket-induced damage.
To identify mole cricket damage, observe your lawn or garden closely. If you notice areas where the grass or plants appear wilted, yellowed, or stunted in growth, there&rsquo;s a possibility of mole cricket infestation. These symptoms often occur in irregular patches, making them stand out from the healthy surrounding areas.
<strong>Telltale Tunnels</strong></dd>
<dd>Examine your soil for mole cricket tunnels, which manifest as raised, irregular ridges on the surface. These tunnels serve as clear evidence of their subterranean activities.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Mole cricket tunnels are distinct and relatively easy to spot once you know what to look for. These tunnels appear as raised, winding ridges on the surface of your lawn or garden beds.</li>
<li>They can be especially noticeable after heavy rains or irrigation when the soil becomes saturated and the tunnels rise closer to the surface.
<strong>Nighttime Sightings</strong>
: Since mole crickets are nocturnal, conducting nighttime inspections with a flashlight can reveal their presence as they surface to feed.
To confirm the presence of mole crickets, you can conduct nighttime inspections. Armed with a flashlight, venture into your lawn or garden after dark. Mole crickets emerge from their tunnels to forage for food during the night, and with a little patience, you might spot them on the prowl.

<h2 id="the-impact-on-golf-courses">The Impact on Golf Courses</h2>
<p>Mole crickets are not just a concern for residential lawns and gardens; they can also wreak havoc on golf courses. Golf course superintendents often grapple with mole cricket infestations, as these pests can disrupt the pristine putting greens and fairways, leading to costly repairs and maintenance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mole cricket damage on golf courses can manifest as irregular patches of yellowing or dead grass. These unsightly areas not only affect the playability of the course but also tarnish its aesthetic appeal.
In some cases, the tunneling behavior of mole crickets can create hazardous conditions for golfers, particularly when the ground becomes uneven and unstable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="safeguarding-your-garden-or-lawn-from-mole-crickets">Safeguarding Your Garden or Lawn from Mole Crickets</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Harnessing Natural Predators</strong></dt>
<dd>Encourage the presence of natural predators like birds and armadillos, which feed on mole crickets and assist in population control.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>One eco-friendly approach to mole cricket control is to create an environment that attracts their natural predators. Birds, such as robins and grackles, are known to feed on mole crickets.
To attract these birds to your garden or lawn, consider providing water sources and maintaining bird-friendly habitats. Similarly, armadillos are effective mole cricket hunters, so creating inviting conditions for these creatures can help keep mole cricket populations in check.
<strong>Strategic Chemical Treatments</strong>
: In cases of severe infestations, consider applying insecticides designed specifically for mole cricket control. Precise application is critical for optimal effectiveness.
When natural control methods prove insufficient, chemical treatments may be necessary. Insecticides formulated for mole cricket control can effectively reduce their numbers. It&rsquo;s essential to follow application instructions carefully, as timing and technique are crucial for successful results while minimizing environmental impact.
<strong>Embracing Cultural Practices</strong>
: Adopt healthy garden or lawn practices, including regular mowing, proper irrigation, and soil aeration, to deter mole crickets. A healthy garden or lawn is less inviting to these destructive pests.
Maintaining a healthy garden or lawn is your first line of defense against mole crickets. Implement the following cultural practices to create an environment less conducive to mole cricket infestations:</li>
<li><strong>Regular Mowing</strong>: Keep your grass at the recommended height for its species. Mole crickets prefer tall, lush grass, so maintaining a shorter lawn can deter them.</li>
<li><strong>Proper Irrigation</strong>: Avoid overwatering, as excessively moist soil can attract mole crickets. Water deeply and infrequently rather than shallow and frequent irrigation.</li>
<li><strong>Soil Aeration</strong>: Aerating your soil can improve its health and reduce mole cricket habitat. Aeration enhances root growth and drainage while making it less appealing to these pests.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Excess Organic Matter</strong>: Mole crickets thrive in soil rich in organic matter. Minimize thatch buildup and excessive mulch in your garden or lawn.

<h2 id="are-pantry-bugs-harmful-if-eaten-can-pantry-moths-make-me-sick">**Are Pantry Bugs Harmful If Eaten?-�**Can Pantry Moths Make Me Sick?</h2>
<p>No. If you have accidentally eaten a pantry bug, there is not much need to worry since most of them are not harmful.
But since its hard to tell the difference between good and harmful bugs. It is better not to eat them at all. Some bugs may have the potential to transmit diseases that could a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-pantry-bugs-live/">long-term effect on you</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like other insects, most pantry bugs have three life cycles-egg, larvae/pupa, and adult stage.</li>
<li>At adult stages, these pantry bugs will either turn into beetles, moths, or weevils. In this stage, you are more likely to find them in rice, maize, and other types of cereals.
Below is a list of identification of some pantry bugs for easier verification and general knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-maize-and-rice-weevils">**1. **<strong>Maize and rice weevils</strong></h3>
<p>These are very common in granaries where you have
stored up your maize, rice, and other cereals
.� They are also known to attack other crops like oats, wheat, barley, peas, sorghum, and cottonseed among others.
They bore holes into grains, cereals, and legumes making. Below is their life cycle and how to identify them.
<strong>Life-cycle</strong>
A grain weevil has a life span of 5-8 months. This happens if the temperature and the humidity are constantly constant. For temperatures are between 15-34 C and humidity of 40 percent.
The life cycle of the weevil begins when a mature female lays its egg inside the grain. It can lay 300-400 eggs per lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female weevil lays one egg per gain after which she seals off the holes with some wax. The wax released to seal the entry dries off forming a raised mark on the seed.</li>
<li>When the egg hatches, a white larva is released that is without legs. This larva stays in the grain while feeding on it until it develops into a pupa.
When the pupa transforms into an adult, it bores a hole to exit the grain.�It takes approximately 36 days for a weevil to fully mature and be ready to hatch an egg.
Immediately after leaving the grain, the female releases pheromones insinuating readiness to mate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-drugstore-beetle-">**2. ****Drugstore beetle **</h3>
<p>This is another pantry bug that you are likely to find in your household. They are a common pest in warmer areas and environments.
This pantry bug is normally very destructive on dried plant products and fruits. In the pantry, you are also likely to find them in bread, floor, sweets, spices, cookies among others.
**Life-cycle **
A drugstore beetle has a lifespan of 13-65 days but some can live up to seven months. Their life cycle and life span highly depend on some factors like food and temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its life cycle begins when a female drugstore beetle lays its eggs. It can lay about 75 eggs in its life span.</li>
<li>It has three life stages egg, larvae/pupa, and adult stage. This beetle can survive in its larvae stage for a period of 5-20 weeks. The larvae feed on the grains as it develops.
In the final stages of its larvae stage, it builds a cocoon where the pupa stays dormant for 12-18 days.
The adult breaks out of the cocoon into a beetle that has a life span of 13-65 days. It is at this stage that they mate and lay eggs as the cycle continues.
They need a temperature of 30C and a humidity of 60-90 % for growth and mating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-idianmeal-moths-">**3. ****Idianmeal moths **</h3>
<p>They compromise the largest population of pantry bugs. They are very destructive and are found in grains and cereals, plants, nuts, pasta, fruits, rice, spices, and bread among others.
**Life cycle **
It has 4 life stages-egg, larvae, pupa, and adult.</p>
<ul>
<li>A single female can lay between 100-400 eggs in its life span. It can lay these eggs as a single unit or in clusters of 12-30.</li>
<li>With a temperature of 30C eggs takes 3-4 days to hatch while with a temperature of 20 C they take 7-8 days to hatch.</li>
<li>This larvae also have a web that it leaves behind which can be seen. These larvae also produce a cocoon that houses the dormant pupa stage of this beetle.
The pupa stays in this stage for 15-20 days before transforming into an adult moth.
It takes about 3 days for the adults to mate and lay eggs and the cycle continues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="can-drugstore-store-beetle-harm-you-when-eaten"><strong>Can drugstore store beetle harm you when eaten?</strong></h3>
<p>Like most pantry bugs, the drugstore beetle is harmless if eaten accidentally.� However, there are ways of reducing their infestation into your food and grains.
Keeping your foodstuffs below a temperature of 20 C will keep these bugs since they cannot survive in such an environment.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-eliminate-pantry-bugs"><strong>How to eliminate pantry bugs</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Check the food at the store</strong>
-before buying food at the store always make sure you cross-check well. Dont buy food that is not properly sealed or poorly packaged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check packaging dates as most likely the older products are more likely to be infested or even have eggs that later hatch into bugs.
<strong>Proper transportation-</strong>
check your products after transportation just in case the packaging is damaged. Any damaged packaging is prone to pantry bugs and should therefore be used first in your household or properly sealed before storage.
<strong>Using traps-</strong>
if you have noticed some pantry bugs in your kitchen or store, you can use traps to get rid of them. There are baits with sticky traps and some even with sex pheromones that attract bugs and stop them from further multiplication.
<strong>Storage-</strong>
On storage, you also need to check on the opened products and tight seal them to minimize entry of the bugs.
<strong>Grain and cereals Treatment-</strong>
if you find grain weevil, there are some insecticides that can be used to treat your grains and cereals against such.
<strong>Disposing of -</strong>
when the infestation is too much, there can be no better way than disposing of the produce. Instead of risking further multiplication of bugs trashing it is also a good option.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Are pantry bugs harmful if eaten? Though most of them are not harmful, it is good to avoid eating them. On the contrary, controlling their infestation would do more good than even allowing them in your grains, cereals, and other consumables.
That said and done, it is also not healthy to eat the pantry bags. Proper storage, treatment, and other good practices can be useful in getting rid of the bugs.</p>

      <description>Mosquito repellent plugins are the most reliable way of keeping mosquitoes at bay.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mosquito repellent plugins <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> the most reliable way of keeping mosquitoes at bay.</p>
<p>But are they safe for us? I have done a comprehensive research on this topic and have some important facts to share with you!
<strong>Are mosquito repellent plugins safe? When wrongly applied, mosquito repellent plugins can result to the following; they could cause respiratory disorders to babies, allergic reactions, and can cause a condition called hypospadias for babies and pregnant women.�</strong>
Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="details-are-plug-in-mosquito-repellents-safe">Details: Are Plug In Mosquito Repellents Safe?</h2>
<p>Ultrasonic mosquito repellants�devices use high frequency sound waves to keep away mosquitoes.
But does this really work? Research shows that ultrasonic mosquito repellants are not as effective as they are purported to be. They are only 57% effective and I wouldn&rsquo;t advice you get them, instead use chemical mosquito plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mosquito repellent plugins work by slowly releasing an insecticide when plugged into a socket and switched on. The plugins use tablets or liquids which is converted to vapor when exposed to heat.</li>
<li>Other than mosquitoes, these devices are very effective in killing insects such as horseflies, wasps and bees.�The devices have active ingredients like allethrin, DEETA, permethrin and natural oils.</li>
<li>Always carefully read the instructions on the packets before using the device. One thing ,don&rsquo;t use it when the air-conditioning is on, it could violently spread the chemicals that could be toxic for asthmatic and allergic people.

</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-mosquito-repellant-plugin"><strong>What is a Mosquito Repellant Plugin?�</strong></h2>
<p>A plug-in mosquito repellent is a device that works by releasing an insecticide gradually once it is plugged into a socket.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-plugins">They can use either liquid chemicals or tablets, the liquid converts into vapour once exposed to heat. There are various ingredients used in these plugin devices namely DEET, permethrin and natural oils.
<strong>Types of Plugins�</strong></h2>
<p><em>Chemical Plugin</em>
; They contain prallethrin chemical that kills mosquitoes. The chemical poses little danger to you and therefore safe.</p>
<p>-
<em>Ultrasonic Plugin</em></p>
<ul>
<li>They produce high-frequency sound that repels mosquitoes and other insects.</li>
</ul>
<p>How safe are these plug-in mosquito repellents? When you carefully follow the instructions on the packets before use, the repellants are safe. In contrast, they can be quite harmful when there is skin contact.</p>
<h2 id="effects-ofmosquito-repellant-plugin">**Effects of�**<strong>Mosquito Repellant Plugin</strong></h2>
<h3 id="i-on-pregnant-women"><em>i) On pregnant women</em></h3>
<p>If the repellant chemical directly comes in contact with the skin, some of it gets absorbed into the blood system which chances of reaching the fetus. Despite the fact that it might not cause birth abnormalities, it could cause a significant threat to the mother&rsquo;s health especially if she is allergic.</p>
<p>For the mothers who got in contact with plugin repellents during the first three months of their pregnancy, their male babies could have a condition called Hypospadias (difficulty opening penis or its foreskin)</p>
<h3 id="ii-on-babies"><em>ii) On babies�</em></h3>
<p>Plugin Mosquito repellents emit chemical fumes that could cause various respiratory disorders like asthma to your baby. It is advisable to use mosquito repellants when your baby is over 2 months. Below is how you can use the plugin repellents safely when you have a baby below 2 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the plugin repellant starts working, make sure baby is sit or sleep in a different room.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t keep the baby in a room with the plugin repellent all night.</li>
<li>Dress your baby in full sleeved clothes to prevent their skin from being exposed.</li>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly after handling the repellents before touching your baby.</li>
<li>Babyies are crawlers and if you have plugged the repellent in a low level socket, they may attract them. The risk is these plugin repellants heat up quickly and might pause a burning hazard to your baby if he or she touches it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-use-mosquito-repellent-plugins-"><strong>Why use Mosquito Repellent Plugins ?�</strong></h2>
<p>There are several other methods you can use to prevent or kill mosquitoes, but why should you use mosquito plugins? Here is why;</p>

<h2 id="where-mosquitoes-breed-">**Where Mosquitoes Breed **</h2>
<p>Mosquitoes mostly breed in stagnant fresh water. There are however some mosquitoe species that breed can breed in salt water. Below are some of the most likely breeding grounds.</p>
<ol>
<li>Flower Pots: When you overwater your plants in the flowers pot,you cause stagnant water hence creating a breeding ground.</li>
<li>Gutters &amp; Downspouts; These parts could clog causing stagnation of water . This creates an environment where larvae can thrive in.</li>
<li>Garden Decor; gardens would be a mosquito breeding ground especially if it rains. I would advise you to be clearing any water logged area in your garden.</li>
<li>Dustbins; when it rains, dustins collect water resulting into a pile of stagnant water, mosquitoes like that, they breed.</li>
</ol>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As gardeners, we all strive for vibrant, weed-free beds, especially around the delicate beauty of spring-flowering bulbs. The promise of early spring tulips, daffodils, and hyacinths is a highlight of the gardening year, but maintaining their pristine beauty without endless weeding can be a challenge. Pre-emergent weed preventers offer an appealing solution, creating a barrier that stops weed seeds from germinating. However, the critical question arises: <a href="/posts/are-butterfly-bushes-bad-for-butterflies/">are</a> these chemical (or even organic) barriers safe to use around your cherished bulbs without harming their emergence or future development?</p>
<p>The answer, like much in gardening, is nuanced. While many <a href="/posts/when-to-apply-pre-emergent/">pre-emergent</a> products are indeed safe for established bulbs, understanding how they work, which active ingredients to look for (and avoid), and the correct application timing is crucial. Misapplication can lead to disappointing results, from inhibited bulb growth to outright damage. This guide will delve into the science behind pre-emergent weed preventers, clarify their safety around various types of bulbs, and provide best practices to ensure your spring blooms emerge unhindered by both weeds and unintended chemical harm.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="understanding-pre-emergent-weed-preventers">Understanding Pre-Emergent Weed Preventers</h2>
<p>Pre-emergent herbicides work by forming a chemical barrier in the top layer of the soil that inhibits seed germination. They do not kill existing weeds; rather, they prevent new weeds from sprouting from seed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> These products typically interfere with cell division in germinating seeds, preventing root development.</li>
<li><strong>Target:</strong> They target weed seeds as they begin to sprout, not established plants or dormant plant structures like bulbs.</li>
<li><strong>Formulation:</strong> Available in granular or liquid forms. Granular forms are often preferred in garden beds for easier, more targeted application.</li>
<li><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Common active ingredients include pendimethalin, prodiamine, trifluralin, corn gluten meal (organic), and isoxaben.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-safety-of-pre-emergents-around-bulbs">The Safety of Pre-Emergents Around Bulbs</h2>
<p>The good news is that <strong>most pre-emergent weed preventers are generally considered safe to use around established spring-flowering bulbs.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why they are generally safe:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dormant/Established Bulbs:</strong> Bulbs are mature, dormant structures, not germinating seeds. Pre-emergents typically affect the delicate, rapidly dividing cells of newly sprouting seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Root Development vs. Root Growth:</strong> Pre-emergents interfere with the <em>initiation</em> of root development from seeds, but do not harm the <em>established</em> root systems or the emerging shoots of bulbs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Key Nuance:</strong> While generally safe, timing and product selection are critical to avoid unintended harm.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="active-ingredients-what-to-use-and-what-to-avoid">Active Ingredients: What to Use and What to Avoid</h2>
<p>Understanding the active ingredients helps you choose the right product.</p>
<h3 id="generally-safe-for-established-bulbs">Generally Safe (for established bulbs):</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prodiamine:</strong> (e.g., in Dimension�) A popular and effective choice for lawns and garden beds. It creates a long-lasting barrier. Generally considered safe around bulbs when applied correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pendimethalin:</strong> (e.g., in Scotts Halts, Sta-Green Crabgrass Preventer) Another widely used pre-emergent. Similar safety profile to prodiamine for established bulbs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corn Gluten Meal (CGM):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organic Option:</strong> This is a natural, organic pre-emergent that also acts as a slow-release nitrogen fertilizer.</li>
<li><strong>How it Works:</strong> It inhibits root formation in weed seedlings.</li>
<li><strong>Safety around Bulbs:</strong> <strong>Very safe</strong> around established bulbs and other desirable plants. It�s also pet-friendly.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Less potent than synthetic options, and results may take longer to become apparent. Needs to be watered in thoroughly after application for activation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isoxaben:</strong> (e.g., in some granular weed preventers for flower beds) Offers broad-spectrum weed control and is generally safe for established ornamentals, including bulbs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="use-with-caution-or-avoid-near-bulbsflower-beds">Use with Caution or Avoid (near bulbs/flower beds):</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dichlobenil (e.g., Casoron):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk:</strong> While effective, dichlobenil can affect existing plant roots, especially if applied at too high a rate or too close to sensitive plants. It&rsquo;s often used in industrial settings or for specific tough perennial weeds.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Generally <strong>avoid</strong> using this in bulb beds unless explicitly recommended by an expert for a specific, very problematic weed, and with extreme caution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Products with Post-Emergent Herbicides:</strong> Some &ldquo;weed &amp; feed&rdquo; products or general herbicides contain both pre-emergent and post-emergent (kill existing weeds) active ingredients.
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> <strong>Avoid these near bulbs.</strong> Post-emergent herbicides can damage or kill emerging bulb foliage or even dormant bulbs, depending on the active ingredient (e.g., glyphosate, 2,4-D). Always read the label carefully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="timing-of-application-crucial-for-success">Timing of Application: Crucial for Success</h2>
<p>Applying pre-emergent at the right time is paramount for effectiveness and bulb safety.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>For Spring-Flowering Bulbs (Tulips, Daffodils, Hyacinths):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal Timing:</strong> Apply in <strong>late summer to early fall</strong>, after you&rsquo;ve planted your bulbs but <em>before</em> temperatures drop consistently and weed seeds begin to germinate for winter/early spring annual weeds. This means applying <strong>before the soil temperature consistently falls below $13^\circ \text{C}$ ($55^\circ \text{F}$)</strong> for most winter annual weeds (like henbit, chickweed) and spring annual weeds (like crabgrass, if applied for next year&rsquo;s early crop).</li>
<li><strong>Second Application (Optional):</strong> Some gardeners in warmer regions might consider a second application in <strong>late winter/very early spring</strong> (when temperatures are still low but consistently above freezing) to target late-sprouting annual weeds. However, be cautious with this timing, as bulb shoots will be emerging soon.</li>
<li><strong>Why this timing?</strong> This allows the pre-emergent barrier to be in place to stop the germination of cool-season weeds that sprout in fall or very early spring, while the bulbs are safely dormant underground.</li>
<li><strong>What to Avoid:</strong> Do NOT apply once bulb shoots have already emerged, as some products can cause leaf burn or damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For Summer-Flowering Bulbs (Lilies, Gladiolus, Dahlias):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal Timing:</strong> Apply in <strong>early spring</strong>, <em>before</em> weed seeds germinate and <em>before</em> you plant your summer bulbs. If you&rsquo;ve already planted them, apply <em>before</em> their shoots emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Why this timing?</strong> Targets warm-season annual weeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For Perennial Weeds:</strong> Pre-emergents are ineffective against established perennial weeds (e.g., dandelions, clover, bindweed) that sprout from existing root systems, not seeds. You&rsquo;ll need different control methods for these.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="application-tips-for-maximum-safety-and-effectiveness">Application Tips for Maximum Safety and Effectiveness</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read the Label!</strong> This cannot be stressed enough. Every product label will have specific instructions for application rates, timing, and safety precautions around desirable plants. Follow them precisely.</li>
<li><strong>Clean the Area First:</strong> Remove any existing weeds (pull them or use a contact herbicide) before applying pre-emergent. Remember, pre-emergents don&rsquo;t kill existing weeds.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Evenly:</strong> Use a spreader for granular products to ensure even coverage. Uneven application can lead to bare spots for weeds or concentrated areas that could harm plants.</li>
<li><strong>Water In:</strong> Most pre-emergents require watering after application to activate the chemical barrier in the soil. Check the label for specific instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Over-Application:</strong> Applying too much can lead to plant damage or increased environmental risk.</li>
<li><strong>Wear Protective Gear:</strong> Always wear gloves, eye protection, and appropriate clothing as recommended on the product label.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="alternative-and-complementary-weed-control-methods-for-bulb-beds">Alternative and Complementary Weed Control Methods for Bulb Beds</h2>
<p>Even with pre-emergents, a holistic approach is best.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mulch:</strong> A 5-10 cm (2-4 inch) layer of organic mulch (shredded bark, wood chips, straw, pine needles) is an excellent natural weed barrier. It blocks sunlight, suppressing weed germination, and also helps retain soil moisture and regulate temperature. This is highly recommended for bulb beds.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Weeding:</strong> Despite best efforts, some weeds will always get through. Regular, light hand-weeding is still necessary and best done when weeds are young and the soil is moist.</li>
<li><strong>Close Planting:</strong> Plant bulbs in dense drifts or combine them with other early spring perennials or groundcovers that fill in the space, leaving less room for weeds to establish.</li>
<li><strong>Solarization (Nairobi Context):</strong> In very sunny, hot periods, for a bed that isn&rsquo;t currently planted with bulbs but is very weedy, covering the soil with clear plastic for 4-6 weeks can &ldquo;cook&rdquo; and kill weed seeds. This is a pre-planting strategy.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Pre-emergent weed preventers can be a valuable tool in your gardening arsenal, offering an effective way to minimize weed pressure around your beloved spring-flowering bulbs. When chosen correctly and applied at the appropriate time, most formulations are indeed safe for established bulbs, working to stop weed seeds before they ever have a chance to sprout. However, careful selection of products (favoring those without post-emergent qualities and avoiding high-risk chemicals like dichlobenil), precise timing, and meticulous adherence to label instructions are paramount for success and safety. Combine this strategy with generous mulching and consistent hand-weeding, and you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to enjoying a stunning, weed-free display of spring blooms that truly heralds the arrival of a new season.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-soundbars-have-superior-sound-quality">2. Soundbars have Superior Sound quality</h3>
<p>Initially, soundbars fell short on sound quality - they offered a better alternative to the sound system for the flat-screen TV. Thus, soundbars were just slightly superior to the in-built TV speakers.
However, soundbars are now deep and better positioned in the home entertainment space and hence have developed to become better sound systems.
In addition, its now possible to add other fitting components to your soundbars that&rsquo;ll help create an excellent surround sound in your room either small or large.
Further, the in-build speakers in your soundbars are of better quality plus have sub-woofers and surround-sound speakers for better entertainment.
Regardless if you need a 7.1, 5.1, 2.1 or such setup - the soundbars will come a great price. Check the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/2-1-vs-5-1-soundbar/">difference between 2.1 vs 5.1 Soundbars</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="3-soundbars-have-minimalist-and-sleek-design">3. Soundbars have Minimalist and Sleek Design</h3>
<p>To match your chic modern decor, soundbars have a minimalist and stylish design that you&rsquo;ll love. Further, with their wireless subwoofer, you&rsquo;ll have even fewer wires that will be crossing around your spaces and rooms.
Therefore, the soundbar design will match your TV&rsquo;s slim aesthetic - which also providing quality audio that&rsquo;ll go well with the excellent TV visuals for watching different films and TV shows with a great experience.
The soundbar will sit flush with your cinema set-up or against the wall� - which is great for little spaces or small homes - thanks to their minimal and sleek design which is pleasing both to the ear and to your eyes. You can wall-mount the soundbar on the side, above, or in front of the TV screen.
Your traditional surround audio systems have bulky ugly looking components despite giving excellent sound quality. But we hate the disorganization, including the large wiring and equipment particularly if these ones aren&rsquo;t in your main living area.
Therefore, with a good-quality soundbar, you can get great sound while also keeping your rooms and spaces tidy and neat - call it compact and stylish.
For example, the system acts like the receiver while also holding all your front speakers - that&rsquo;s a minus 3 of the large components in your traditional surround audio systems. Notably, wireless connectivity allows you to place the surrounds and sub(s) at your selected location without needing wires.

<h3 id="4-soundbars-are-compatible-with-latest-technology">4. Soundbars are Compatible with Latest Technology</h3>
<p>By design, most soundbars will seamlessly integrate with your favorite smart-home devices that have the latest technology including the smart TV, Amazon Alexa, Dolby Atmos, or even 4K TV.
The latest soundbars allow wireless audio streaming through Bluetooth plus they&rsquo;ll have convenient inputs like Coaxial and Optical, regular HDMI, and HDMI ARC - check differences in
soundbar&rsquo;s HDMI vs optical inputs
.
Therefore, both on cost and convince, getting a soundbar that&rsquo;ll readily integrate and work with current and most future technology is an excellent feature - check these
cameras for music videos
.
<strong>1.</strong>
For example, the soundbar will allow whole-home blue-tooth and audio connectivity by blue-tooth streaming from the computer, tablet, or smartphone to your TV and thus you can easily listen to music or
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/spotify-tips-and-tricks/">Spotify</a>
on higher-quality speakers.
<strong>2.</strong>
Further, you can get smart soundbar models such as
Roku
and JBL that have smart software like
<a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00226270">Alexa</a>
, Google Assistant, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku">Roku OS</a>
. Thus, you can easily give your old TVs a new life without - automation plus streaming - with no need for additional cables or
set-top streaming boxes
.
<strong>3.</strong>
Also, soundbars will have Dolby and channel Atmos - shown with numbers like 5.1.4 where the number (5) represents # of channels, number (1) states if there&rsquo;s a sub-woofer (maybe even a wireless satellite speakers) and the last number (4) denotes support for DTS:X /
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Atmos">Dolby Atmos Surround</a>
that&rsquo;ll support many objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the best soundbar under 200- Well, I recommend this compact and lightweight Vizio SB3621n-E8 to give you excellent quality from your TV at a budget. It has a wireless sub-woofer plus allows blue-tooth connectivity.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the best soundbar with Alexa - Well, I recommend this Yamaha YAS-209 that has an on-board Amazon Alexa to give you great connectivity and great sound quality.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-soundbars-are-cost-effective-between-100--1000">5. Soundbars are Cost-effective (between $100 &amp; $1,000)</h3>
<p>Most soundbars will cost anywhere between $200 &amp; $600 but maybe lows of $100 or highs of $1000. Therefore, these are highly affordable compared to your regular surround audio system.
Components of your regular surround audio system are costly when purchased separately. Compared to the soundbar package or a soundbar, even a package sound system deal will be more expensive.
But, are cheap soundbars any good? There are many top-selling soundbars, its possible to find quality soundbars that are affordable. Thus, no risk of trading on sound quality to the reduced price.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll find low-priced soundbars with impressive sound quality that&rsquo;ll readily replace your traditional audio system package - so check these
affordable and quality soundbars
.
But which soundbar size should you choose? Well, soundbars will come in varied sizes and shapes. Evidently, large-sized soundbars could have more drivers and thus a bugger sound but most of the time this will only give you the longer box.
Most of the new soundbars will cost anywhere from $200 and will come with a number of HDMI inputs that will be helpful for connecting AV devices to your soundbar directly as opposed to taking them through the TV.
However, to future-proof your soundbar, check that it has 3+ inputs and ensure they&rsquo;re passing both HRD and 4K signals - particularly for the 4K TV. You can stream music and other audio for the tablet or audio including from music apps like Spotify or Pandora.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-an-in-built-google-assistant-or-alexa">Do I need an in-built Google Assistant or Alexa?</h2>
<p>Currently soundbars comes with voice-assistants that&rsquo;re in-built made by
Sonos Beam, Google or Amazon. Don&rsquo;t have to purchase soundbar plus a Nest Mini separately - stylish and saving space.
The voice-assistant speaker like the
Polk Command Bar
or the Echo Dot will require that you have the &ldquo;always on&rdquo; microphone - you can control the soundbar functions including turning off lights.
The voice -assistant feature just sit around like a web browser that&rsquo;ll wait for anyone to say &ldquo;wake&rdquo; and it&rsquo;ll respond juts like a web search - check these
best earbuds under $50
.
Also, the app can also allow you to read back that it records - for check on privacy issues. But if such automation are too much for you, simply get a soundbar without the google voice-assistant.
Further, you should know that
Amazon Echo Link
allows a user to install Alexa capability on all soundbars that have analog input - but also check the input to hear music and responses.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-dolby-atmos-or-surround-sound">Do I need Dolby Atmos or Surround sound?</h2>
<p>Previously, 2-channel soundbars sounded alike with stereo or surround modes but wall-bouncing &amp; Dolby Virtual:X like
Sennheiser Ambeo &amp; Samsung HW-Q70R
enhance immersion.
However, you may add extra surrounds (e.g.
Ikea Synfonisks
) on your soundbar like
Sonos Playbar
to get you better surround and extensive immersion for movies.
Luckily, you can include surround speakers to most mid-range soundbars for brands such as Samsung, LG, and Polk using Wi-Fi to link to stand-alone wireless speakers.
Therefore, there has been a major rise in the Atmos soundbars that has led to a significant drop in the prices. Different streaming services like
Netflix
provide
Atmos soundtracks for TV and movies.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After connecting the TV, check if the audio signals are sending correctly to your soundbar through TV audio by turning off the internal speakers of your TV.
You can check other connections like
<a href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/3.5mm+jack">mini-jack - 1/8-inch (3.5mm)</a>
on your basic soundbar to connect audio sources like

      <description>The Gasteracantha (a.k.a</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gasteracantha (a.k.a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_orb-weaver">spiny spiders, spiny orb-weavers, or spiny-backed orb-weavers</a>
) <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> in the orb-weaver genus of spiders. The spiders have unique spikes on their backs.</p>
<p>The female Gasteracantha have brightly-colored spines on their shell-like, hardened, and broad abdomens. However, are spiny orb-weaver spiders poisonous?
<strong>The simple answer is, NO, Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders are not poisonous. While these Gasteracantha spiny spiders can bite, they aren&rsquo;t aggressive or poisonous spider species and they won&rsquo;t trigger any grave symptoms on humans.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="detailed-are-spiny-orb-weaver-spiders-poisonous">Detailed: Are Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders Poisonous?</h2>
<p>Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders measure about 1/4&quot; - 1/2&quot;, have 8 legs and are yellow, orange, black, or white in color with red markings. If you notice the colorful spiders and some large spun webs, then it may be a sure sign that your yard has been infested by spiny orb-weaver.
The spiny orb-weaver will mainly make their nests on shrubs, citrus trees, or around the sides of your house. In addition, these insects will mainly be active from October to January where they&rsquo;ll produce oval egg sacs under man-made structures and tree leaves too - interestingly they do this next to the webs by their females counterparts.
Each eggs sack of this Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders will hold roughly 100 - 300 eggs, and thus its presence will definitely signify a massive infestation in your yard. Sadly, the eggs will hatch within 2 weeks and hence you must control the bugs before the begin their hatching and reproduction.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-identify-the-spiny-orb-weaver">How to identify the Spiny Orb-Weaver</h2>
<p>The bug&rsquo;s body color is the surest way to distinguish between the spiny-back species - particularly in this case the orb-weaver spiders.
The male orb-weaver spiders are largely smaller compared to their female counterparts - their body length ranges from 2 - 3 millimeters but slightly longer in body width. On the other hand the female orb-weaver spiders measure 5 - 9 millimeters in body length and their body width is 10 - 13 millimeters.
[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;360&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Source:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_orb-weaver">Wikipedia</a>
[/caption]
The spiny spiders, just like name mentions, have 6 spines or projections protruding from the rear of their abdomen. You&rsquo;ll find bright color on the dosaum or top of the spiny spiders&rsquo; abdomen - these will be red spines plus black spots on the white background.
However, some of the spiny spiders, may be yellow but have black spikes. But other may also be completely black in color. The male bugs will have 4-5 small humps while their females come with large spines sitting on their back of their body.</p>
<h2 id="special-behaviors-by-the-spiny-orb-weaver">Special Behaviors by the Spiny Orb-Weaver</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.insectidentification.org/insect-description.asp?identification=Spined-Micrathena-Spider">Micrathena</a>
and
<a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/beneficial/g_cancriformis.htm">Gasteracantha</a>
genus are the most prevalent among these spiders - particularly considering their body patterns, shape and colors. The Gasteracantha cancriformis males are tinier while the female adults are about half an inch.
With their spine-like spines, crab-shaped and compact bodies makes these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders look very distinctive. Geographically, the color of the female Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders is different because the black-spot abdomens could be yellow or white.
Further, the spines or projections might be black or red. Further, their male counterparts may have abdomens that are gray, small spines, and white spots.�However, these spiders look like they&rsquo;re dwarfed by their circular and spreading snares. So, simply spot any spider webs at your eye-level and above particularly on shrubs, trees, and buildings.
One unique characteristic of the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders is that you&rsquo;ll note some silk tufts around the house - especially around its foundation lines. The silk turfs act to protect the spider&rsquo;s eggs and babies from humans, other animals and birds. However, the silk tufts may also attract some prey or even caution lizards.
Generally, the female Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders in the Araneidae family are considered web builders. Further, the females will mainly work to rebuild and repair the spider webs - they&rsquo;ll do this in a single location if they won&rsquo;t be disturbed. The remaining time, the females will sit waiting for any predator from which they&rsquo;ll such the animal&rsquo;s bodily fluids.</p>
<h2 id="habitat-and-food-spiny-orb-weaver-spiders-live">Habitat and Food: Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders live?</h2>
<dl>
<dt><em>Habitat</em></dt>
<dd>You&rsquo;l mainly find these bugs in southern states particularly Florida or southern California but they&rsquo;ll also inhabit different regions in the world.
As noted earlier, you&rsquo;ll mainly find these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders in residential places plus citrus groves, around houses, shrubs and trees near your house. You&rsquo;ll notice them from their color and the webs they create plus you might notice their eggs sacs.
<em>Food</em></dd>
<dd>On diet, the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders mainly feed on small insects that they&rsquo;ll capture using their intricately made webs.� Specifically, the bugs will feed on small insects such as flies, mosquitoes, beetles, and moths. The spiders will bite and paralyze the insects as they feed on their ovals.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="controllingspiny-orb-weaver-spiders">Controlling�Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders</h2>
<p>Since the spiders mainly feed on insects, it makes sense to reduce the amount of light that&rsquo;s particularly outside your house - this will keep the spiders away plus also discourage their small insects from coming near your yard and house too.
Therefore, I suggest you change the exterior lights and install &lsquo;bug lights&rsquo; that are particularity yellow in color as this will reduce the amount of light and hence the number of small insects that&rsquo;ll be flying near your yard or house in the evenings and at night.</p>
<p>Further, ensure that you clean and clear all the webs that are around the house as this will discourage the spiders from creating their webs. You might require to undertake more aggressive bugs control measure if you&rsquo;re having a massive Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders� infestation - this may include finding the eggs sacs and bug webs.
For this, I would recommend using de-webbing substances - particularly those that are organic as these will help prevent the spider webs from easily attaching on the house or bushes around the yard or lawn. This ensure that the spiders won&rsquo;t get a habitat from where they&rsquo;d hatch a re-infestation in your residence.
However, on the extreme case of infestation by the Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders, simply hire the services of a professional exterminator to control the bugs. Such services might be costly but its definitely worth it as it immidietly takes the burden off your shoulders.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, are Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders Poisonous? Well, as I&rsquo;ve outlined above, these spiders can bite humans but they aren&rsquo;t aggressive or poisonous. However, the spiders will only bite when they&rsquo;re provoked as these are generally beneficial bugs in your farm or yard.
Definitely, the bites from these Spiny Orb-Weaver Spiders won&rsquo;t be poisonous as won&rsquo;t also cause any grave or dangerous symptoms on you body.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bearded dragons enjoy a diverse and balanced diet that includes leafy greens such as collard greens and
cabbage
, as well as vegetables like bell peppers,
tomatoes
, and
carrots
.
However, it is crucial to carefully assess the food you offer to these unique and docile reptiles, as some foods may be unsafe for their consumption.
So, mushrooms: <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> they safe for Bearded Dragons?
<em>In summary, it&rsquo;s generally unsafe to feed mushrooms to bearded dragons - despite these bites having essential nutrients.�Although mushrooms have essential nutrients, many varieties, including wild mushrooms, are toxic to reptiles, including bearded dragons.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Besides, the consumption of mushrooms can lead to digestive problems or organ failure in bearded dragons due to these bites having high acidity levels and an unbalanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio.�</em>
<strong>Check out these Bearded Dragon Foods.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risks-in-feedingmushrooms-to-bearded-dragons">Risks in Feeding**Mushrooms to **<strong>Bearded Dragons�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-unbalanced-calcium-to-phosphorus-ratio-causes-bone-related-illnesses"><strong>1. U</strong>*nbalanced *<em>calcium-to-phosphorus ratio Causes Bone-related Illnesses</em></h3>
<p>The�calcium-to-phosphorus ratio is a critical aspect when analyzing the foods to give your�bearded dragons. Phosphorus has a critical role in cell functioning and energy production. On the other hand, Calcium is required to appropriate metabolic processes, bone development, and muscle function.
However, the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio must be carefully balanced - their diet must contain a high amount of calcium compared to phosphorus.</p>
<ul>
<li>An imbalance where the bearded dragon&rsquo;s diet has more phosphorus (than calcium) leads to lower rates of�calcium absorption and thus may result in diseases like metabolic bone disease (MBD), fractures, deformities, or even brittle bones.
Bearded dragons require a diet with a calcium-to-phosphorous ratio of 2:1 or 1:1. However, mushrooms have high phosphorus ratios and may lead to bone-related health conditions. For instance, the ratio in portabella mushrooms is 1:16.3 - calcium to phosphorous.
So, feeding your bearded dragon with mushrooms isnt good for their health. The unbalanced Ca:P ratio in mushrooms interferes with calcium absorption in the beardies body.</li>
<li>This results in calcium deficiency which in turn leads to problems such as metabolic bone disease, muscle weakness, and the inability of blood to clot.
When the amount of phosphorous exceeds calcium, phosphorous reacts with calcium to form calcium phosphate which is difficult to absorb in the gut.</li>
<li>Further, experts recommend including more foods that have a balanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/">dragon&rsquo;s diet</a>. Some of these foods are vegetables and calcium-dusted insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-oxalic-acid-in-mushrooms-negatively-affects-calcium-levels">**2. **<strong>Oxalic Acid in Mushrooms Negatively Affects calcium levels�</strong></h3>
<p>Mushrooms have a considerable amount of oxalic acid - an element that&rsquo;ll negatively affect the levels of calcium that&rsquo;s available in the body of your bearded dragon.
So, if you feed mushrooms to bearded dragons, the oxalic acid in the food will bind with calcium to create calcium oxalate (CaC2O4)- a compound that is insoluble and indigestible to your bearded dragons.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, binding calcium in an insoluble compound implies that there less calcium will be readily absorbed for proper body functioning in the beaded dragon such as in bone formation - read this may cause calcium deficiency.
As noted earlier, calcium is a vital nutrient in these reptiles as it helps in enhancing metabolic processes,� nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and making strong bones.</li>
<li>To make up for the low calcium levels, the body tends to get calcium from available sources such as bones. This leads to a condition called metabolic bone disease where bones become soft and weak.
Signs of metabolic bone disease in bearded dragons include deformed limbs, arched spine, limping, bone fracture, and lethargy among others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-mushrooms">Alternatives to Mushrooms</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear, by now, that mushrooms are unsafe for your bearded dragons and so I dig deep into finding nutritious and suitable alternatives for the reptile&rsquo;s diet.</p>
<h3 id="1-leafy-greens">1. Leafy Greens</h3>
<p>Using leafy greens the diet of your bearded dragon will help increases the calcium levels absorbed in their bodies.
These greens will give the pets suitable and safe minerals and vitamins. Exp[erts recommend using some of these leafy greens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mustard greens</li>
<li>Collard greens</li>
<li>Kale</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-vegetables">2. Vegetables</h3>
<p>Bearded dragons will benefit from vegetables - as an alternative to the nutrients they could have acquired from mushrooms.
Include some of these vegetables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Bell peppers</li>
<li>Tomatoes
The vegetable will give your bearded dragons an excellent mix of fiber and vitamins -which will significantly benefit the good health of your pet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-calcium-dusted-insects">3. Calcium-dusted insects</h3>
<p>Feed the bearded dragon with calcium-rich foods such as calcium-dusted insects - they&rsquo;ll also offer proteins. You may require to dust these insects with some reptile-friendly calcium powder before feeding your beaded dragons.
Some foods under this category include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dubia Roaches</li>
<li>Mealworms</li>
<li>Crickets
You can supplement calcium for the reptiles through substrates - Experts recommend using some considerable
substrate
in the diet of these reptiles to supplement the calcium levels in their food - but this must be done in moderation to avoid impaction or digestive problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mushroom-toxicity-for-bearded-dragons"><strong>Mushroom Toxicity for Bearded Dragons�</strong></h2>
<p>Although some mushrooms are included in the human diet, therere a few species of toxic mushrooms. They are potentially harmful to both humans and animals including bearded dragons when accidentally ingested.
Out of the common mushroom species, only a few species are lethal. Many others will only lead to noticeable symptoms when ingested by humans or animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms is extremely difficult because they share a lot of similarities.</li>
<li>Thats why misidentification is the leading cause of mushroom poisoning in humans.
Mushrooms can grow anywhere theres high moisture content including the yard, garden, basement, garage, and so on. To avoid accidental ingestion by your bearded dragon, kids, or other animals its advisable to get rid of any wild mushrooms.
Some of the common toxic mushrooms include:</li>
<li>Amanita phalloides</li>
<li>Inocybe</li>
<li>Amanita muscaria</li>
<li>Amanita pantherina</li>
<li>Clitocybe</li>
<li>Scleroderma citrinum

<h3 id="1-symptoms-of-mushroom-poisoning-in-bearded-dragons"><strong>1. Symptoms of Mushroom Poisoning in Bearded Dragons</strong></h3>
<p>Bearded dragons are usually confined to their tanks or terrarium. However, some beardie owners may once in a while take their pets outdoors to get some warmth from the sunlight.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your bearded dragon accidentally eats poisonous mushrooms in the yard, it may fall sick within a short time or even die.
Symptoms of mushroom poisoning vary depending on the pets vulnerability and the mushroom species. Below are some symptoms to look for in case your bearded dragon or other pets accidentally eats toxic mushrooms:
**a. Gastrointestinal Irritation (GI): **
It is the first sign of mushroom poisoning and may entail diarrhea and vomiting. These symptoms occur within 6 hours and may last up to 24 hours. However, if GI is not accompanied by other symptoms, its an indication of mild poisoning. Thus, it may not require major veterinary intervention.
<strong>b. Muscarinic Effects and GI:</strong>
If gastrointestinal irritation is accompanied by muscarinic effects such as pupil constriction, tear production, and drooling, these could be signs of more serious poisoning. In this case, your bearded dragon needs veterinary attention as soon as possible.
<strong>c. Muscarinic Effects, GI plus Lethargy, and Depression:</strong>
Apart from the muscarinic effects and gastrointestinal irritation, severe symptoms like lack of energy, depression, bleeding, and seizures. Eyes and the mucus membrane may turn yellow indicating possible liver damage.
These could be symptoms of Amanita phalloides mushrooms popularly known as death cap. Symptoms begin within six hours and may last up to 20 hours. Serious clinical attention is required to avoid fatality.
<strong>d. Hallucinogenic Syndrome:</strong>
Though nontoxic the magic mushroom causes hallucinogenic symptoms such as staggering, seizure, depression, muscle problems, or coma in severe cases. Since these mushrooms are illegal, its unlikely to find them in someones yard.
The only possible place your pet may pick magic mushroom is from the trash. If such symptoms are observed, serious veterinary intervention is required.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-how-to-preventdeal-with-mushroom-poisoning"><strong>2. How to Prevent/Deal with Mushroom Poisoning�</strong></h3>
<p>Mushrooms grow anywhere as long as theres high moisture content. They can grow in the yard and damp places like in the garage, or basement.
When you take your bearded dragon outdoors -
keep them caged
, therere chances of ingesting toxic stuff including mushrooms.�Here are tips for preventing/dealing with mushroom poisoning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove any mushrooms that are growing in your home. Common areas to check for mushroom growth include the yard, flower garden, near woodpiles, outdoor water points, and so on.</li>
<li>Ensure your bearded dragon does not stray to the garden or yard.</li>
<li>If you cannot immediately identify a mushroom, treat it as toxic. Therefore, you should contact your vet in case of suspected mushroom ingestion.</li>
<li>If you can locate a piece of the ingested mushroom, take it with you to the veterinarian.</li>
<li>If the bearded dragon defecates or vomits after mushroom ingestion, take with you a sample of the poop or vomit to the animal clinic.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The high acidity levels and
<a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/which_pet_is_right_for_me">unbalanced calcium-to-phosphorous ratio</a>
in mushrooms can lead to deteriorated health in your bearded dragon. In addition, some mushrooms are very poisonous which makes them unfit for bearded dragons.</p>

? This is the right place for you because we have prepared the right answers to this question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody wants bugs in their homes, but sometimes they are inevitable. There are many pantry bugs common in our kitchen, stores, and other parts of our household.
But today I want to address the small brown insects that are slowly become a menace in our homes.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spray for Pantry Bugs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-small-brown-insects-in-my-kitchen"><strong>What Are Small Brown Insects In My Kitchen?</strong></h3>
<p>The small brown insects in your kitchen could be the
many kinds of pantry bugs
in our houses. There are many bugs that are brown in colour and more likely to be found in our kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of these bugs are harmless but their infestation in our kitchen and particularly in our food is totally unwelcome.</li>
<li>Though most of them cause no damage when consumed, it is highly discouraged since we cannot tell the possible outcome on your health.
I have identified a few of this brownish insects, their life cycle, and other characteristics. This will help you spot the actual insect in your kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-beetle-">**1. Beetle **</h3>
<p>This beetle is very common in our kitchens. Apart from kitchens, they are also found in
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-pantry-bugs-harmful-if-eaten/">food storage areas</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you leave your flour, cereals, spices, vegetables, or even drugs open, dont be surprised to find these beetles enjoying the meal.
They thrive well in temperatures above 23 C reproducing up to 5 times or more per year. However, their reproduction goes down if the temperatures go below 15C.
Keep your flour and packaged food tightly sealed if you really want to keep this pest out of your kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-silverfish-">**2. Silverfish **</h3>
<p>How do you know that brownish insects in your kitchen are silverfish? Well, silverfish has a colour ranging from white to brown-grey and others are bluish-silver in colour.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also identify them by their teardrop shape. And last but not least, you can identify them by their rear 3 long bristles.
Silverfish thrive in dark and also humid areas. Unlike other
pantry bugs, silverfish targets
where there are books and papers.
Due to their love for the humid and moist areas, you are most likely to find them in leaking kitchen sinks and bathrooms among other moist areas.</li>
<li>Toilets are also other areas you can find them as well as wardrobes because of clothes.
Though they dont pose any serious threat to humans, their presence in the kitchen and other home areas is irritating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ticks-">**3. Ticks **</h3>
<p>This is a tiny brown parasite that bugles after sucking blood. You are only likely to find them in your home if you have pets around. This is because they hardly move around unless with the help of a host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other bugs in our homes, ticks are parasites and also harmful. In the event that they suck blood from the host, either humans or pets, they can transmit Lyme disease.
They have 3 life cycles and in each case, they need to suck blood for survival. There are also very many species but in most cases, the adult stage is not so much active as the male dies after mating and the female lays eggs for the next cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-granary-weevil-">**4. Granary weevil **</h3>
<p>This is also another brown insect that you are likely to find in your kitchen. In most cases, this granary weevil is found in food stores and kitchens.
You can also find them in beans, rice, macaroni, and spaghetti, nuts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The egg is laid in the grain where it hatches intolarvae and feeds the inside of the grain. Though most of these weevils are small, their size also highly depends on the grain size.
They are found in almost all parts of the world and their economic significance cannot be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5cockroaches-">5.**Cockroaches **</h3>
<p>These are rather small insects that are reddish-brown in colour. You can also identify them by their oval body that is also flattened.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also have two long antennae and spiny legs.
They are some of the most stubborn pantry bugs in homes. You will literally find them almost in every area in your house, closets, and stores.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-these-bugs-harmful"><strong>Are these bugs harmful?</strong></h2>
<p>It is normal to get scared about the harm that can be caused by these insects. However, it is important to note that most of these bugs are harmless.</p>
<ul>
<li>At some point, you may find yourself eating such bugs without your knowledge. There is no need for getting scared though it should not be entertained.
In the case of ticks, they are parasitic and also harmful because they suck blood and can even cause Lyme disease.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-small-house-brown-bugs"><strong>How do you get rid of small house brown bugs?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-cleaning"><strong>1. Cleaning</strong></h3>
<p>If you have already identified the specific brown insects in your kitchen, the immediate question is how to control them.
Most insects thrive in damp and dirty environments. Keeping your kitchen clean and properly sanitized minimizes the chances of survival for most pests.</p>
<h3 id="2-disposing-of-infected-food-">**2. Disposing of infected food **</h3>
<p>If your feed is infected, one of the best ways of stopping any further multiplication of the pest is through
disposing of the infected feed
.</p>
<h3 id="3-using-traps-">**3. Using traps **</h3>
<p>A UV home trap will be most convenient to use to get rid of the pantry bugs. The insect control KATCHY trap is also very safe for use indoors.
This trap lures the insects through ultraviolet light and though it does not necessarily
kill them it traps
them and also helps reduce their population.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Silverfish</strong>are very tricky bugs to control because of their hideouts and complexity. Despite, the challenges to control it, you can still use insecticides to do it. Of most importance is to watch over kids and pets within your house.
<strong>Ticks</strong>
can be controlled by using acaricides in farms but this cannot be applied in our homes because of its effects and strong smell. Therefore if you have a large infestation of your home, I would recommend contacting a vet officer to deal with the issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-">**Final Thoughts **</h2>
<p>What are small insects in my kitchen? The highest probability is that you are having pantry bugs in your kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>These insects could be beetles, weevils, and silverfish among other bugs that have the same resemblance. A closer look at them and from some description given can tell what they really are.
If indeed these are pantry bugs, you can employ the appropriate control measures given or even others that are favourable to you.</li>
