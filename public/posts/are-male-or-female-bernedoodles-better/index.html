<p>Are male or female bernedoodles better?� Well, it depends. Size and personality are the main differentiating factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male Bernedoodles are larger compared to their female counterparts. Consequently, everything about them has dialed up a notch.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://welovedoodles.com/bernedoodle/">characteristics of a Bernedoodle</a>also differ based on their gender. Males tend to be more playful.
If a Bernedoodle is actively running and jumping around, chances are it is a male. They also tend to be quite stubborn when it comes to training.
On the other hand, females are much more docile. They are mild-mannered and take well to training sessions.
Owners tend to get pets that reflect their personalities. So whichever Bernedoodle resonates with you the most should be your pick.
<strong>�</strong>
Owning a pet is a big responsibility but a rewarding one. Naturally, you want to be prepared and provide the best home for your beloved Bernedoodle.
We have already covered the basics but lets take a more analytical approach to raise both male and female Bernedoodles. If that sounds like a good idea to you, keep reading as we have some great ideas to share.
It is important to keep in mind there is no major difference between male and female Bernedoodles. Everything we talk about below can be applied to both genders without much change.

<h2 id="what-are-the-types-of-bernedoodles"><strong>What are the Types of Bernedoodles?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-the-types-of-bernedoodles">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bernedoodles come in three major types. They are:</p>
<h3 id="1-tiny"><strong>1. Tiny</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-tiny">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is the smallest of the Bernedoodles. They weigh between 10 and 24 pounds and grow up to 17 inches.
These dogs are the true definition of pocket-sized. They are harder to handle as pups due to their excitable nature. They become calmer after reaching adulthood.
<strong>2. Miniature</strong>
The miniature Bernedoodle is slightly bigger, standing at 22 inches after maturing.
They can weigh up to 59 pounds. Much like the tiny version, the miniature type is a handful when young.
<strong>3. Standard</strong>
The standard variation is the most commonly seen Bernedoodle. They can reach up to 29 inches and weigh more than 80 pounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>These large dogs are more expensive to groom and feed. They have calm personalities throughout their lives.</li>
<li>As discussed above, male Bernedoodles are bigger in height and weigh more than female ones.
This makes taking care of the male ones a slightly bigger challenge.

<h2 id="a-quick-comparison-to-the-goldendoodle"><strong>A Quick Comparison to The Goldendoodle</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-quick-comparison-to-the-goldendoodle">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may have heard of the Goldendoodle dog, which is a cross between the Golden Retriever and the Poodle.
This breed shares many similarities with the Bernedoodle. Their personalities are very similar as they are both playful and jovial.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also exhibit the same levels of stamina throughout their lives.</li>
<li>The Goldendoodle tends to enjoy the water more. This is a trait inherited from its Golden Retriever heritage.
They thrive better in warmer climates compared to the
<a href="https://veterinarians.org/bernedoodle/">Bernedoodle</a>
. Despite minor differences, both breeds make excellent companions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-bernedoodles-behave"><strong>How Do Bernedoodles Behave?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-do-bernedoodles-behave">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Bernedoodle is a hybrid of the Bernese and Poodle dogs. They exhibit the best of both worlds.
This results in a fun-loving pet which easily connects with humans. Males tend to exhibit a more stubborn nature than females. Consequently, they are harder to train and can be a handful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernedoodles are great to have around children and elderly people.
Their mild nature helps them bond easily with anyone. Bernedoodles are easily trained, which makes them one of the best therapy dogs.
Puppies may show a hard-headed personality, but proper training tends to mellow them out.

<h2 id="how-should-you-feed-a-bernedoodle"><strong>How Should You Feed a Bernedoodle?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-should-you-feed-a-bernedoodle">¶</a></h2>
<p>How much your Bernedoodle eats depends on a multitude of factors.
Age, height, weight, type, and gender <a href="/posts/are-leopard-geckos-nocturnal/">are</a> among the main ones. Standard Bernedoodles eat much more than their smaller cousins. Males tend to eat more as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernedoodles are not picky eaters. They will eat almost anything and in large quantities. This is a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, you have a wide variety to choose from because they have little to no preference. Conversely, picking the right kind of food can be daunting.
Here are some pros and cons of the different kinds of food:
<strong>1. Kibble or Dry Food</strong></li>
<li>This is the most common method of feeding</li>
<li>Less expensive and lasts longer</li>
<li>Protects from dental issues</li>
<li>The nutritional standard varies greatly
Kibble is an all-in-one solution but may not be the best for a growing puppy.
<strong>2. Wet Food</strong></li>
<li>This is a great transitional food for the growing puppy</li>
<li>A higher quantity of preservatives and chemicals</li>
<li>Potential to cause dental issues</li>
<li>Prolonged use leads to gastrointestinal problems
<strong>3. Raw and Cooked Food</strong></li>
<li>Higher nutritional value</li>
<li>Variety of choices and flavors</li>
<li>It tends to be expensive (for larger dogs)</li>
<li>Improper feeding can lead to malnutrition
Choosing the right type of food is vital for your Bernedoodle. Research has shown feeding habits correlate directly to their personality development.
Consulting a veterinarian is a good idea as they can create custom diet plans for your Bernedoodle.

<h2 id="feeding-schedule"><strong>Feeding Schedule</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#feeding-schedule">¶</a></h2>
<p>A feeding schedule is necessary to avoid health problems. Obesity among dogs is a common issue as owners typically do not follow a diet plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bernedoodle puppies are more physically active, which makes feeding them less of an issue. As they grow up, they tend to get slower and proportionally gain more weight.
Typically, you want to feed puppies three times a day. Grazing should be allowed for up to three months.
After this period, you should maintain a schedule. Dogs older than six months require two big meals daily. Experts recommend having set feeding times.
This will condition your pet to be hungry during those times. Fully matured Bernedoodles may still be hungry after each feeding. In such cases, they may be allowed to graze but keep a close eye on them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-best-grooming-habits-">**What are the Best Grooming Habits? **<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-the-best-grooming-habits-">¶</a></h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Bernedoodles do not have fur on their bodies. They possess a
lot of hair
but do not shed much.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should wash your pet with shampoo once every month. Since they have curly hair, you may also choose to clip once every two months.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that curly hair requires regular brushing. This also serves as a bonding experience between the two of you.
Clip their nails whenever you feel they are too long. Avoid excessive bathing as it can decrease the shine of their coat.

<p>Bernedoodles fall under the Swissridge category of dogs. It is strongly recommended to spay or neuter them early in their lives.
Pet stores typically sell neutered dogs. If you want your pet to be able to breed, then contacting a breeder is your best option.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-exercise-does-your-bernedoodle-need"><strong>How Much Exercise Does Your Bernedoodle Need?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-much-exercise-does-your-bernedoodle-need">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bernedoodles are active pets. They like to jump and run around more compared to other dogs. Males are particularly energetic and require more exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended you take them out on half-hour walks three times every day.
Bernedoodles are adaptive and can have fun in any scenario. Whether it is a city block or the countryside, they will enjoy themselves.
<strong>What are the Health Issues Bernedoodles Face?</strong>
The Bernedoodle is a relatively newer breed. This has resulted in limited documentation of their health problems.</li>
<li>Common dog diseases like distemper, influenza, and worms still apply to them.
Consulting a veterinarian will give you a clearer picture of your pets overall health. They can also advise you on vaccinations.
Vaccinations play a vital role in preventing life-threatening diseases. Some common vaccines are:</li>
<li>Anti-Rabies</li>
<li>Parvovirus</li>
<li>Parainfluenza</li>
<li>Leptospirosis
Bernedoodles like to play around as they are social dogs. Consequently, they are more prone to diseases than other breeds. Timely vaccinations are important for both you and your dogs good health.

<ul>
<li>The mini and tiny ones have an average lifespan of 18 years. Size plays an important role here.
Smaller-sized dogs tend to have longer lives. Female Bernedoodles take after their Bernese mountain dog ancestry and typically live longer.</li>
