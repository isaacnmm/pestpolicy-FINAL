Apply on a clean and bare concrete surface, which can be achieved by etching with acid.

<ul>
<li>Classy finish</li>

.</p>
<p>This Kilz edition is suitable for porous concrete commonly installed in pool deck areas.� This product works by creating a barrier to keep water out while allowing trapped vapor to escape, resulting in less corrosion, efflorescence, and spalling.
Before application, adequate preparation of the surface is needed. For uncoated concrete surfaces, the manufacturer recommends allowing curing for up to 30 days. Etching the surface with grit sandpaper or muriatic acid is prudent to achieve a textured surface.
For previously coated surfaces, use recommended products to clean and prepare the surface adequately. If there are peels, using a paint stripper is highly recommended to sand the concrete surface down.
The manufacturer recommends applying the coating within the temperature range of 10-32C for best results. For hairline cracks of up to 3mm, apply the coating with a nylon/polyester brush and allow drying completely before applying with a roller.
Since the first coating acts as the base, it will not cover the surface adequately, and hence over application should be avoided while also not cracking or breaking easily to cause
<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/uv-radiation.html">ultraviolet exposure</a>

Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for both vertical and horizontal surfaces</li>
<li>Unmatched waterproofing and protection</li>
<li>Reputable brand</li>

DuraGrade Concrete coating is a single part PU coating, which is moisture-cured. It is activated on exposure to the moisture in the air on application.
Whats more? Minimal chemical compounds are included in this paint, making it a compliant option for all 50 states. It also provides an excellent chemical and scratch resistance performance as compared to its competitors.
Applying DuraGrade concrete coating is an easy affair based on current user feedback. The manufacturer recommends mixing the components for approximately one minute using a stir stick.
Whipping it up introduces air, which creates small bubbles when rolled out to allow for moisture-curing. Being a PU based coating; it spreads thinner compared to epoxy-based paint, and a minimum of two coatings are needed.
For best results, a wait time of 2-6 hours is needed in-between recoats. The wait time depends on the level of humidity since the product is moisture-cured.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal preparation needed</li>
<li>Wide range of application</li>
<li>Build to last</li>
