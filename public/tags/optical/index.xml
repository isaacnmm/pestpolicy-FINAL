to the audio system or AV receiver requires using either an Optical or HDMI connection (digital-audio).</p>
<p>Remember the old day of coaxial cable for video and audio signals to your TV? The new connection, new challenges?
Well, in this article, I&rsquo;ve outlined the differences between these Digital-Audio connections - Soundbar Optical Vs HDMI.
In summary, comparing Optical Vs HDMI, I would
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/why-would-it-matter-that-a-soundbar-doesn-t-have-hdmi-550351/">take the HDMI</a>
. Read on to see my reasoning on this. Read Also:

<h2 id="soundbar-optical-vs-hdmi---differences">Soundbar Optical Vs HDMI - Differences?</h2>
<p>Considering the digital-audio basics, both the optical and HDMI cables will pass your digital-audio between 2 devices. you won&rsquo;t have a difference either on Dolby digital plus other multi-channel audio.
However, a notable difference is your HDMI cables will give you higher-resolution audio that comprises the format you&rsquo;ll find in DTS HD Master and Dolby TrueHD audio.
On the other hand, Fiber optic can&rsquo;t transmit similar kinds of high-resolution formats of sound. Further, HDMI will also transmit video signals plus quality sound.
Therefore, HDMI is a great choice when you want to deal with lesser cables. However, consider if your different devices have the HDMI option or even its an older receiver.
Also, if you&rsquo;ve already connected different inputs to the TV and you only require the audio to a

<li>you&rsquo;ll thus require to use the optical cables.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1construction">1.�Construction</h3>
<p>HDMI cables are mainly made from Copper - it reduces interference occurrence and its equally less costly. But fiber optics are the key component making your Optical cables.
Being tiny glass (fiber optics), they won&rsquo;t transmit electricity but will be great for passing light signals - but they&rsquo;re expensive. Also, Optical cables will have less interference.
In addition, the fiber optics are covered by a dark sheath that&rsquo;ll bar other light sources, and hence they won&rsquo;t enter to interfere with the signal.

<h3 id="2length">2.�Length</h3>
<p>For most of use, your cable&rsquo;s length might not play a major role in the quality of your digital-audio transmission. However, some users may require long cables for various media rooms.
Optic cable - Thus, for longer cable lengths, it&rsquo;s given that you&rsquo;ll lose some signal quality. Thus, always for the shortest cable between HDMI fiber optic cable.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, take about 10 meters of the optical cables and this will work just okay but some users still go up to 30 meters.
HDMI - HDMI connections have stricter length limitations compared to what you&rsquo;ll find with the optic cable.
So, for HDMI, only go for a maximum of 5 meters or you&rsquo;ll get poor quality sound transmission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3audio">3.�Audio</h3>
<p>On audio support, HDMI will work great with a format like DTS HD, TrueHD formats, and Dolby Digital Plus.
But the optical cables will support any surround sound that has a maximum of 5.1 channels.
Most TV programming will be broadcast using surround sound but there are also some Blu-ray discs that provide pimped sound quality.
Therefore, for Blu-ray content watching, I would say you consider HDMI as opposed to taking the fiber optical cables.

<h3 id="4-video-support">4. Video Support</h3>
<p>On video support, HDMI will transmit both video and audio and thus you won&rsquo;t require an additional cable for video signal transmission.
However, with optical cable, you&rsquo;ll require another cable for undertaking video signal transmission. Notable, an HDMI cable could be cheaper compared to the 2 optical cables.
So, on the choice, it&rsquo;ll largely depend on your individual requirements. Note that you&rsquo;ll still get decent audio from�the optical cables.
However, for convenience with your

, the HDMI will be the better cable - plus most current devices and systems will support it.
HDMI offers superior quality features buts it&rsquo;s highly upgradable while it&rsquo;ll also transmit both video and audio signals - and there&rsquo;ll be less wire jungle.�Read Also -

<p>Also, you must think about where you&rsquo;ll place the soundbar - and appropriate location for both sound quality and device safety. Note that Soundbar help to reduce the footprint of the home theater.
Soundbarproviude a minimalistic and sleek sound device compared to the home theater. So, using the HMDI cable will sustain your minimalistic efforts - carrying video and audio.
However, the Digital Optical implies that you&rsquo;ll require a larger number of wires when you require to transmit video to the television.
However, for only sound or music streaming, you&rsquo;ll do just okay with the Digital Optical cable. Thus, HDMI will save you both cabling and space.</p>
<h3 id="6input-options">6.�Input Options</h3>
<p>Further, consider the kind of input you have on your devices. This consideration must be made both on the Soundbar and your media devices including TVs.
Therefore, if the devices you&rsquo;re using won&rsquo;t allow HDMI, you&rsquo;ll require to acquire the appropriate video cables for transmitting images to the TVs.

<p>Finally, on soundbar optical vs HDMI - digital-audio? - HDMI will be a better choice depending on the device input you have. With easy installation and bing cheaper, optical is inferior.
However, some devices may lack HDMI and thus you&rsquo;ll miss out on the high-res audio from your Blu-ray. Further, Dolby Digital can be a reason you get fitting devices.</p>
