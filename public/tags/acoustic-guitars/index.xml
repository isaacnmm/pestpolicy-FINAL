<p>Talman TCY10 is a quality acoustic-electric guitar with a double-cutaway design - Width at Nut: 43mm (1.69 inches). It has a beautiful body - spruce top plus mahogany sides and back.</p>
<p>Talman TCY10 is a durable small-hand acoustic guitar that has an excellent weight-to-strength ratio. Further, for additional reliability, the manufacturer included yet X bracing top. Check these
cheap acoustic guitars
.
The guitar&rsquo;s rosewood 20-fret fingerboard is supported by a mahogany neck. Also, the die-cast tuners on the neck are very factional and beautiful - with an ergonomic body &amp; light materials.
On comfort, Talman TCY10 cutaway provides enough comfort just like with the single-cutaway guitars. You easily use all the fingers to hold the necks foundation and reach the last frets.
On adjustability, this one is very convenient since you can use the chrome (die-cast) tuners to regulate the strings. Further, it&rsquo;ll be easy to take out Talman TCY10&rsquo;s Ibanez Advantage bridge pins.
The double-cutaway design significantly improves the sound quality of this Talman TCY10. It makes the acoustic guitar more resonant but also reduces its bass.
Further, the spruce top plus mahogany sides and back will add bright or warm tones plus extra resonance to the guitar&rsquo;s sound - I consider it harmonic-sounding.

On compatibility, this guitar will be great for stage performances (with
mics
) and private practice - excellent budget student guitar with simple playability.
