<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-size">1. Size</h3>
<p>Some products, like the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OAYXTK/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Exo Terra Allglass Terrarium</strong></a>
, offer ample space, which is crucial for bearded dragons as they need room to move, climb, and bask. A cage that is too small can lead to stress and health issues.</p>
<p>The recommended minimum size for an adult bearded dragon is 40 gallons, but larger is always better. The Exo Terra provides adequate space for adult dragons, making it an excellent choice for their growth and well-being.</p>
<h3 id="2-ventilation">2. Ventilation</h3>
<p>Proper ventilation is vital to prevent the buildup of humidity and ensure fresh air circulation. The
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PHABI8/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Zoo Med ReptiBreeze</strong></a>
is designed with this in mind, featuring a fully ventilated screen top that allows for optimal airflow.</p>
<p>Poor ventilation can lead to respiratory issues, so a cage with a well-ventilated structure is essential for maintaining your bearded dragon&rsquo;s health.</p>
<h3 id="3-material">3. Material</h3>
<p>The durability and safety of the cage material are crucial.�For instance, the
<strong>Carolina Custom Cages Terrarium</strong>
is made of sturdy glass with a metal mesh top, providing both durability and security.</p>
<p>Glass is often preferred as it retains heat well and allows clear visibility. However, its important to ensure that the materials used are non-toxic and safe for your pet.</p>
