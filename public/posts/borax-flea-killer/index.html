I&rsquo;ve described how you can use a borax flea killer (an
<a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US4617188">old-time flea control</a>

Well, it&rsquo;s
budget-friendly, effective, all-natural treatment, and safe around kids, cats, and dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Borax in your laundry room provides a safer way to control fleas - without using harsh chemicals.</li>
<li>Borax can help homeowners control flea problems in and around our homes - includingflea eggs?. Let&rsquo;s find out!
<em>In summary, Borax will kill both adult fleas plus other insects that feed on plant juices and animal and human blood. But Borax won&rsquo;t kill immature insects, including. Though, you must note that are differences between boric acid and Borax.�</em></li>

My vet advised using this Borax 20 Mule Team against a flea infestation in the yard, carpets, or whole house. I left the borax flea killer on the floors for two days - remember to apply the fine powder under the stove, refrigerator, and couch.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition tokilling fleas, Borax�will remove bad odors from your living spaces.�You can pour the Borax into areas where dogs and kittens do visit.</li>
<li>Further, avoid watering the yard (and use it when there&rsquo;s no rain) after applying Borax as this can reduce its effectiveness.
Generally, Borax is used as a�natural herbicide,�cleaner,� floor cleaner, and rust remover. This�20 Mule Team Borax will kill fleas and
kill insects such as roaches
but won&rsquo;t kill them in their�immature growth stages.
First, I vacuumed the whole house and then the areas where I had poured the Borax. Luckily, this product can be used as a color-safe bleach, laundry booster, and garbage disposal cleaner.

<p><strong>Step 1: Deep Floor and Carpet Vacuuming�</strong>
Choose the best borax brand for
flea treatment
.
Vacuum
your house thoroughly to ensure you attack the insect in all its life cycle stages.
Also, consult your vet for advice on the best brand depending on your dogs age (if a</p>
<ul>
<li>puppy*
)
*, pregnancy, or if the dog is under other insecticides treatment. *
Ensure that you reach and evident
fleas from their hideouts such as under carpets
, in cracks and crevices.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>99% Pure Boric Acid contains Acidum boricum, orthoboric acid, boracic acid, hydrogen borate, and boric acid. Therefore, you can use this neutron absorber, flame retardant, flea control insecticide, or antiseptic. Read Also:

.
<strong>Step 2: Pour Borax Powder�</strong>
Treat your dogs play area thoroughly with various
flea treatments
. Target the borax flea treatment to the places where your dog frequents.
If you note that your dogs playmates have fleas, you may consult with their owner on the possibility of undertaking a parallel treatment plan on their pets too.
If your
dog has a massive flea
infestation, you should place him in an outside shelter after treating him. Use that time to treat the
house for fleas using Borax.
<strong>Step 3: Leave Sprinkled Borax for 8 - 48 Hours</strong>
Now,�leave the sprinkled Borax for 8 - 48 hours on the
carpet and flea-treated
areas.
Consult your vet on the best de-worming medication for your dog as the
flea larvae
tend to host tapeworm eggs.</li>
<li>Note that tapeworms can put your dog&rsquo;s health in danger if you dont have them in time.Let borax work for a few hours in the area; it will dry the fleas, eggs, and larvae out and killing them in the process.</li>
<li>Treat one room at a time; do not allow your pets to the area as you clean it. Do not treat pets with Borax or feed them with Borax.
In using Borax to kill fleas, you will need to powder Borax in areas where your pets frequent, such as the bed, sofa, carpets, and crannies.
<strong>Step 4: Final Flea Vacuuming</strong>
You may use this treatment regularly to make sure that all the fleas in your home are gone. Vacuum your floors, carpets, and sofas frequently to assess for fleas. Make sure that the vacuum is emptied and the reusable vacuum bag is cleaned.
Remember to
flea comb
your cat to
get rid of flea eggs
and
flea dirt
. Definitely, you must vacuum the carpet and floors thoroughly after treating with
diatomaceous earth
and Borax.</li>

<h2 id="how-does-borax-kill-fleas"><strong>How does Borax Kill Fleas?</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-does-borax-kill-fleas">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong>
As a powder, Borax has no smell and can control fleas by dehydrating them. The borax powder breaks the fleas exoskeletons and enters their body, which leads to dehydration and death.
<strong>Method 2:</strong>
As the flea larvae hatch, Borax dehydrates the fleas outer tissues and kills them. Therefore, Borax stops the flea from hatching.
<strong>Method 3:</strong>

To avoid poisoning and contamination, ensure that no human being or animal steps in the yard for about 2-3 days. Note that if your pets ingest the borax mixture, they might get poisoned.
<strong>Step 5: Water the Yard</strong>
After 2-3 days, water the yard to wash away the borax moisture. Check whether there are signs of
live fleas
, and if you find any, repeat the treating process. Always ensure to repeat the process once after 15 days to make sure the
