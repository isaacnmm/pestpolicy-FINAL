<p>When searching for the best termite bait station, therere certain factors that you should consider in order to get the best value for your money. These include:</p>
<h3 id="area-to-cover"><strong>Area to Cover</strong></h3>
<p>The area to be covered determines the number of bait stations required for effective termite control.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the different bait station brands come with directions for use including the distance between each station.</li>
<li>The distance between each bait station depends on its effectiveness and the extent of the infestation.
So, once you have settled on a brand, consider the area to be covered so that you can buy adequate bait stations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extent-of-infestation"><strong>Extent of Infestation</strong></h3>
<p>The level of termite infestation determines whether bait stations are enough to control the termites, or you need to combine with other remedies.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the infestation has already gone out of hand, youll have to use bait stations together with other effective products such as liquid insecticides.</li>
<li>The extent of infestation also determines the number of bait stations needed to achieve better termite control.
If youre dealing with a large infestation, youll have to place your baits closer to one another for more effectiveness. Thus, youll require more baits than when you have a small infestation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The former only detect the presence of termites, but it gives you the freedom to use any other termite poison to kill them.
The latter gives you convenience because you replace the detection cartridge with the bait cartridge once termite activity is detected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another factor to consider is the type of ingredient utilized in the bait cartridge of your bait station.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the ingredients contained in some products may be toxic to the soil or vegetation.</li>
<li>To have a piece of mind, get a product that does not harm your property.

<p>Not all bait stations will work effectively on all termite species. Therefore, its advisable to know the type of termites you have to get the most effective bait station. You can get a professional pest exterminator to help in identification.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-installing-termite-bait-stations"><strong>Tips for Installing Termite Bait Stations</strong></h2>
<p>If this is your first encounter with a termite bait station, you might need some guidance on how to get the best results from your product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, most of the products come with instruction manuals/booklets for easy installation.</li>
<li>These are general<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-prevention/">tips that apply to most types of termite</a>bait stations. They include:
<strong>Mapping Out the Affected Area</strong>
The installation of bait stations needs to be done accurately to cover the exact areas that have been infested. Mapping out the exact areas to be treated enhances your accuracy and estimates the number of stations to be used.
Start your mapping at least 3 to 4 feet from the foundations of buildings or fences.</li>
<li>The distance between each bait station should be between 8 and 12 feet depending on the brand and the infestation extent.</li>
<li>For more accurate mapping, you can sketch the affected areas showing the bait station locations.
Make sure the locations do not coincide with the roof drip lines. This will prevent water from getting into the bait station, affecting results, or damage the cartridges.
<strong>Drilling Holes</strong>
Bait stations come in different sizes. Holes should be dug to fit the size and design of the bait station.
Some products come with an auger to facilitate easy digging. If your chosen brand does not have a digging tool, you can buy one separately or use your garden shovel.
Make your holes deeper than the bait station&rsquo;s length to prevent damage to the cartridges by groundwater.
<strong>Inserting the Bait Station</strong>
Once the holes are ready, insert the bait stations and compact them with soil to ensure they are firm.
Also, ensure that the top part is level with the ground to avoid interference by your pets or lawnmower.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring"><strong>Monitoring</strong></h3>
<p>Bait stations require regular monitoring to maintain their performance to an optimal level.
Monitoring for termite activity should be done at least once after every 30 days.
If termites are detected, the monitoring cartridge should be replaced with the cartridge containing the poison.
Monitoring also entails checking the soil moisture content to ensure your bait cartridge is not damaged. Replace bait cartridges in case of damage or when it has been completely eaten out.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Termite control
using liquid insecticides requires a lot of digging, which may cause considerable property damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, bait stations are easy to install and only require holes for installation. Thus, you dont risk destroying your property.</li>
<li>When installed correctly, bait stations prove to be very effective methods of eliminating termites.
Get yourself one of these bait stations to help you eradicate termites from your home.</li>

      <description>If you have seen flying termites around your home, you probably have a lot of questions in mind.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have seen flying termites around your home, you probably have a lot of questions in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do flying termites eat wood? Though most people confuse flying termites with flying ants they are clearly different.
<strong>So, do Flying Termites Eat Wood? Flying termites do not eat wood but only fly out to mate and reproduce and to form a new colony. In this flying termite stage, they only survive in that state for nearly an hour or two before their wings fall off and they seek a nest to lay their eggs.�</strong>
<strong>But, when they shed wings, they cause destruction by burrowing into woods or establish nests where they start their next life cycle - know how to control termites.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Flying Termites Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-flying-termites---know-these-insects"><strong>What Are Flying Termites - Know these Insects�</strong></h2>
<p>Flying termites are part of the termites life cycle and part of the larger insects family. They are winged and also are the reproductive part of the termites cycle. They are known as the alates.
If you have never seen flying termites, you are most probably going to confuse them with the flying ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alates have 4 wings of the same size with a pair on each side. Their thorax and abdomen are almost similar in size and the waist is thick. The antennae are straight with a 3/8 inch long body that can reach even  inch wide.</li>
<li>There are 3 major species of the alates that include subterranean termites, damp wood, and Formosan termites.</li>
<li>From the 3 species, Formosan alates cause more destruction than other species. Dampwood alates are also known to destroy anything woody including furniture, books, and rotting pieces of wood.
Therefore, every time you see flying termites, you need to raise an alarm over an incoming or an already existing infestation in your home.

</ul>
<h2 id="where-can-you-find-the-f"><strong>Where can you Find the F****lying Termites?�</strong></h2>
<p>The flying termites come from an already established nest to go mate and reproduce. After mating, their wings fall off as they seek a new nest to start another colony.</p>
<ul>
<li>They burrow underwood and other suitable places for the next colony.</li>
<li>When they are successful, they reproduce and the cycle continues
There are different species of flying termites and each species has a different swarming season.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-do-flying-termites-swarm"><strong>When do flying termites swarm?</strong></h2>
<p>The major reason why flying termites come out from their colonies is that they are out to mate. However, there are different species with different swarming seasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see a swarm of termites in broad daylight during the spring season, these are the subterranean species.</li>
<li>If the infestation is during the late summer, the swarm is from the dry wood species they also like appearing in the evenings.</li>
<li>They are very fond of artificial lights and will storm into your house in case you leave your windows and doors open.</li>
<li>Lastly, damp wood species like swarm during summer but also like hiding under damp wood and rotten pieces of timber.
When the summer season is on, damp wood species also like entering our houses like swollen balloons if the windows and doors are open.� Use window shields to prevent these termites and other insects from getting into your house.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-flying-termites-live"><strong>How Long Do Flying Termites Live?</strong></h2>
<p>Flying termites dont survive for long in this nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes approximately 1 hour as they mate and drop off their wings to look for nests where they can reproduce.
The maximum they can take in this state is 2 hours.

</ul>
<h2 id="flying-termites-in-the-house-what-should-i-do"><strong>Flying Termites In The House-What Should I Do?</strong></h2>
<p>The flying termites you see around are completely harmless to you as a person. They dont bite nor do they sting.
But there is a reason to get worried because they are either looking for a nest to establish or there is already an existing nest within your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>If nothing is done, they can be built nests in your attic, ceiling, underground foundation, or any other place within your home.
In the meantime, you need to lock up your windows and doors to prevent their entry into your house. Turning off the lights also helps control those that are attracted to light.
If nothing is done, these flying termites will establish a nest-a a new queen will be formed and this could mean termite infestation. The damage to timber, books, ceiling, and furniture among other things they come around.
Next time you get a swarm of flying termites consult a pest control expert who knows the best way to eliminating them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-rid-of-flying-termites"><strong>How Do You Get Rid Of Flying Termites?</strong></h2>
<p>If you have noticed these flying termites, its a signal that you need to take action against insect control in your area.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an indication that the termites have been hiding in your vicinity and are now going to multiply even more.</li>
<li>Flying termites are actually hard to control because they appear within a very short time and quickly disappear into their nests after mating.
The queen is also very much protected and killing it is hard making it impossible to control the rest of the termites. It will continue laying eggs and releasing more termites into your house.
Using pest control products may work but a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">professional pest control expert</a>
will do a much better job in eliminating them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do flying termites eat wood? No, they dont but they are indications of more destruction to come.</p>
<ul>
<li>This winged stage is normally short for the termites where they mate before wings fall off and they look for the best place to make a new colony.</li>
<li>Though this stage does not cause any destruction, it leaves an alarm of what awaits you if you dont take immediate action to control them.
Expect different flying termites to come out in different seasons depending on their species. They are also attracted to different things depending on their species i.e. artificial light, damp wood among others.
That said and done, there are many available means to
control the termites invasion
. However, the best option remains engaging experts in pest control for the complete elimination of the termites in your home.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soil treatment for termites with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-termite-killer/">chemical termite killers</a>
like fipronil and imidacloprid is the most common termite-removal method.
<em>Termites can eat your home&rsquo;s structural beams causing significant damage. But, which are the best home remedies for termites? One that&rsquo;s effective, budget-friendly, yet safe to the environment?�</em>
<em>In summary, the home remedies for termites (including dry wood�termites) include wet cardboard, orange oil, perimeter barrier, sunlight, nematodes, vinegar, and borates.�</em></p>
<h2 id="home-remedy-for-termites">Home Remedy for Termites</h2>
<p>These insects, like damp wood and dry wood termites, can be
<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Termites">challenging and expensive to control</a>
. So, how you treat the house for termites naturally?</p>
<h3 id="1-wet-cardboard-trap">1. Wet Cardboard Trap</h3>
<p>Do you corrugated boxes in the storage closet or garage? Then you have a great tool to make your termite trap.�Termites love water plus cellulose - so the wet cardboard (contains cellulose) will attract the termites.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick several cardboard pieces (flat strips), wet the cardboard, and position where you suspect a termite colony will pass or are already settled.</li>
<li>Next, termites will settle on the wet cardboard box as they feed on cellulose. Putting the cardboard bait down lures the termites to come together to a single point where you can control them.</li>
<li>After the termites have steeled on the wet cellulose cardboard, pick it with the bugs and burn it outside. This will kill all the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-a-termite-look-like/">termites and their babies</a>. Repeat this process until you can no longer see the termites moving around.</li>
<li>However, the wet cardboard trap won&rsquo;t remove the whole termite colony, and thus you&rsquo;ll need to couple this with other termite prevention methods.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-orange-oil">2. Orange Oil</h3>
<p>D-limonene is an active ingredient in orange oil, and it&rsquo;s highly poisonous to termites. It works, through direct contact, by breaking the termite&rsquo;s exoskeletons and killing its eggs.
But orange oil can also be used in fumigation to kill
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">termites - but works better</a>
as a spot treatment.
Orange oil is extracted from the orange peels or oranges rinds used in making several food additives and cleaning products like drain cleaners.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the termite inspection is costly for you, try DIY methods like sight inspections to advanced tactics, including sniffing dogs, audio detection, or bore-scope cameras.</li>
<li>Apply the orange oil into termite holes and other such openings using an injecting syringe on various affected building components, including wood.</li>
<li>So, you&rsquo;ll inject the orange oil into the hollowed-out sections of the wood since that&rsquo;s where the termites, their eggs, and babies live.</li>
<li>But be cautious as orange oil can irritate your eyes and skin - it must also not be ingested as it may lead to lung irritation.</li>
<li>However, for fumigation, double bag any edibles in the house, including pet food, before you commence the termite treatment process.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3-perimeter-barrier">3. Perimeter Barrier</h3>
<p>This involves creating a perimeter
<a href="https://www.termite.com/Termite-Barrier-Treatments.pdf">barrier against termites</a>
to protect your home and other built structures. Ideally, the perimeter barrier should have been made during the house building process.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, if not, you&rsquo;ll require to install your won barrier despite it being labor-intensive.</li>
<li>Jig small trenches around the house on the ground where you&rsquo;ll put your barrier.
[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;600&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<p>Image Source:
<a href="https://pestsolutions365.com//termites-101/full-perimeter-treatment/">PestSolutions365</a>
[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, apply the right termite treatment in the barrier trenches, and this will protect your structures against subterranean termites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-vinegar-for-termites">4. Vinegar for Termites</h3>
<p>Vinegar is an excellent home solution for controlling household and other termites. Mainly, this solution is used in cleaning showers or kitchen counters.
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/termites-how-identify-and-control-them">EPA</a>
outlines that nematodes are very effective in controlling termites in the lab. Vinegar is acidic, and thus it&rsquo;ll kill the termites readily on contact - but you&rsquo;ll need to spray regularly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix lemon juice (from 2 lemons) with 1/2 full cup of the vinegar. Now, put the &ldquo;juice&rdquo; into the spray bottle since it allows easier dispensing on termite-infested spots.</li>
<li>Spray the Vinegar-lemon mixture on termite mounds and hole entrances that are in or around your house. Spray on garden fences, wooden structures, plus corners of different structures.</li>
<li>Allow the vinegar mixture to slowly seep into the holes and cracks to kill the nasty termites.</li>
<li>After 3-7 days, conduct a termite inspection tosee if the bugshave died. Repeat the treatment if you notice signs of termites or their babies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-beneficial-nematodes">5. Beneficial Nematodes</h3>
<p>Nematodes enter the termite&rsquo;s body and start feeding on its blood and muscles. The parasitic roundworms release bacteria, and this causes blood poisoning for the termites, causing death. Nematodes are effective in killing termites.
You can purchase beneficial nematodes in different local or online stores to control invasive termites. Once the termite dies, the nematodes continue multiplying and move onto their next host and poison it to death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix the nematodes (the microscopic roundworms) with some water. But first, requirements are nematodes, water,�spraying bottle, stirring stick, and bowl.</li>
<li>Fill the bowl with water and pout the nematodes into it, ready to control the nematodes. Use the stirring stick to mix up the nematodes with the water. Leave for 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Put the nematode-water mixture into some spraying bottle and spray on places with a termite infestation or passing routes. Begin spraying from your backyard.</li>
<li>Ensure your spray holds the highest pressure, as this will help prevent blockage. Shake your sprayer while continuing with the spraying to prevent the nematodes from settling at the bottom of the bottle.
Caution: Spray at sunset or early morning as this is when the nematodes will be highly active. Further, the ground temperature must be below 60F to prevent nematode death.</li>
<li>One package of nematodes can treat an area of about 1,600 square feet for termites. The nematodes will be in powder or granule form to allow easier mixing and dissolving.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd8P5Nv7MLA&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd8P5Nv7MLA&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-borates">6. Borates</h3>
<p>Borax powder (Sodium borate) is mainly used as a laundry cleaner, but it&rsquo;s also an effective home remedy for controlling termites. You can mix the borax with water and spray or sprinkle the powered around the house - see
<a href="http://nisuscorp.com/pest-management-professionals/products/bora-care#The-Science-Behind-Bora-Care">this guide</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borates applied on the foundation penetrations, expansion joints, plumbing penetrations, concrete, and wood surfaces will penetrate and offer extended termite control. Keep the surfaces sealed to protect them from moisture.
Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) is the chemical component of borates is safe for plants and humans but relatively toxic to fungi and insects.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Besides the home termite control methods outlined above, I recommend taking preventive measures against the bugs and their babies.
Keep any cellulose, cardboard, firewood, or wood away from the house as they tend to attract termites into the yard and home. Also, ensure adequate drainage and excellent ventilation for the interior and exterior of your house.</p>

<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-termites---pest-control-tips">Details: How to Get Rid of Termites - Pest Control Tips</h2>
<p>Termites have
2,300 species, and they&rsquo;ll gnaw wood in your home and other properties plus included furniture - they&rsquo;ll weaken or damage wooden structures. These bugs have three body parts and six legs.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Subterranean Termites</em>- Subterranean termites (cream-brown colored) create mud tubes to get to wooden structures, particularly in the humid or warm regions. These bugs measure about1/8 inches in length and are largely found in the Southeast.</li>
<li><em>Dry-wood Termites</em>- The dry-wood termites will build nests on and eat dry wood and furniture. These termites are tan- or light-brown colored and measure about3/8 inches in length. The dry-wood termites largely live in coastal states and the Southwest.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYPQ1Tjp0ew&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYPQ1Tjp0ew&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
<li><em>Damp-wood Termites</em>- These termites feed on damaged or wood-soiled damp wood. The damp wood could includelogs, lumber, and stumps. Damp-wood termites are brown in color and measure about inch long plus they&rsquo;re mainly found in Pacific regions like southern Florida.</li>
<li><em>Formosan Termites</em>- Formosan Termites is a highly dangeroussubterranean termite (they love both wet soil and moist wood) and will get into your structures through cracks, unsealed joints, or wood that&rsquo;s in contact with the soil. Formosan Termites are yellow-brown and measure inch long, living in wall nests and underground in the warmer South climates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-inspection---how-to-do-a-termite-inspection">1. Inspection - How to Do A Termite Inspection</h2>
<p>A termite
inspection
is a dirty job requiring you to have a flat-head screwdriver or pocket knife, flashlight, gloves, and coveralls.</p>
<h3 id="i-what-to-look-fobelowow-are-some-of-the-objects-to-look-out-for---including-live-termites-damaged-woods-and-mud-tub-during-the-termite-inspections">i. What To Look FoBelowow are some of the objects to look out for - including live termites, damaged woods, and mud tub during the termite inspections.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Termite wing Piles - Termite swarmers tend to shed wings as they molt to their nextlife stage- and these wings will be piled around light sources such as near windows. Swarmers will have four wings pairs of the same size anddouble in length as the bug&rsquo;sbody.</li>
<li>Damaged furniture or wood - Massive termite infestation will lead to damaged wood when the bugs destroy the structure&rsquo;s joints&rsquo; integrity. Tap the dry wood using a pocket knife or screwdriver - a dull thud will signify termites in wood tunnels.</li>
<li>Mud tubes - Termites, particularly subterranean termites, will build mud tube nests from wet soil, and these will run-up to the wood where they&rsquo;ll get their food. So, if you see the mud tubes running across or around the wooden structure - this shows the presence of termites.
The potential termite infestation places include wooden structures in crawl spaces and basements, window frames and sills, porches, and wooden decks. Additional areas include cement, wood debris, expansion joints, and brick construction cracks and piles, plus wooden porches and slabs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ii-probe-the-ground">ii. Probe the Ground</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to probe the suspected ground using
screwdrivers or picks. Dig into the wood or soil around the house&rsquo;s foundation and examine any mud tubes or wing piles. You&rsquo;ll notice that the mud tubes will measure a diameter of about
inches.
The mud tubes will be moving towards the wooden structures, but you must note that there is also a massive termite infestation for large tubes. Also, termites will escape direct sunlight, and hence they&rsquo;ll be hiding in bushes and shrubs - insulation, floors coverings, and behind walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal weather and behavior - During the warm climates, the termites will go into hiding while they&rsquo;ll start mating and getting new sites insummer and spring.However, in winter,subterranean termites will start burrowing deeper into the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-termite-treatment">2. Termite Treatment</h2>
<h3 id="i-termite-trenching">i. Termite Trenching</h3>
<p>For effective treatment control, termite treat your home&rsquo;s exterior with Taurus SC, among other effective termiticides that&rsquo;ll fully exterminate the termites. The treatment prevents new termites from getting into the structure while also exterminating the termites as they exit their nest.
You&rsquo;ll require a pump sprayer, a medium-sized bucket, and a pickaxe or trench shovel. However, if there is a concrete block on your way, you&rsquo;ll need concrete drill bits (1/2 inches by 24 inches or 1/2 inches by 18 inches) and a hammer drill. Here&rsquo;s the process;</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig trenches that are 6 inches deep by 6 inches wide on then house&rsquo;s foundation and particularly on the external wall - locations that termites bore and build their nests. Make the trench to go a minimum of 10 feet in length or as far as the termite infestation goes.</li>
<li>Next, prepare the termiticide termite treatment. Take your bucket and put water up to about 3/4 of its total level. Next, pour the recommended termiticide treatment to create the right concentration, also using a stirrer to get the right concentration.</li>
<li>Next, pour the termite treatment solution into the trench you&rsquo;ve already created on the wall near the termite nest - this should be done gently for even distribution. Also, pour some of the termite treatment on the soil evacuated from the &ldquo;termite trench.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Spray the soil excavated to ensure that it&rsquo;s an effective treatment as you return it into the termite trench - ensure that the spraying leaves this soil in a moist condition.
If you are drilling any concrete blocks on the way, either on a sidewalk or carport slab - use the tangible drill bits plus your hammer drill to make work easier. Make 2&quot; to 3&quot; drilled holes plus allow distancing of about 12 inches between the holes.
However, ensure you pass through the concrete and make a big hole in the soil under the stone. Finally, fill the drilled holes with the termite treatment solution - a plastic or metallic funnel would also help apply the termiticide into the holes.
Allow the holes and the soil to soak up properly with the treatment solution - come back after 1 hour and repeat the treatment process - this should be some about three times. Finally, patch the holes using concrete using Trebor plugs or a patch filler to get the concrete slat to its initial state.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ii-termite-bait-stations">ii. Termite Bait Stations</h3>
<p>Termite bait stations or Termite traps are excellent treatment options either above or in the ground around the yard or home. The stations have baits (either cellulose, paper, or wood) that contain some poison aimed to kill the termites by design.
Bait stations will be useful in situations where termite trenches are undesirable or impracticable. Luckily, this method is easy to install, cheap (besides using many attractants) don&rsquo;t use harmful chemicals, and it&rsquo;s not labor-intensive. However, the
bait stations require regular inspection -
maybe within three months.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll require a post hole digger, 3/4 inches electric, or hand augers (2 in total) for thistermite treatment process. Typically, you&rsquo;ll install the termite bait stations to create a termite barrier around the home - roughly 3-4 feet from the house&rsquo;s foundation.</li>
<li>Install the bait stations in narrow holes (8-10 inches drilled using augers) and spaces them between 8 and 10 feet apart. However, you may reduce the separation between the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/home-remedy-for-termites/">termite bait stations around then home</a>for a massive infestation.</li>
<li>Ensure that the hole you drill is deeper with about 2 inches to 4 inches than the bait station&rsquo;s bottom - this enables any rainwateror otherwise to drainunder the bait station. Don&rsquo;t damage water, utility, or gas lines as you drill the holes.</li>
<li>Also, install the baits at about 1 foot - 2 feet from the house&rsquo;s foundation, and thus it&rsquo;ll be easy to avoid tampering with previously installed soil treatments or termite barriers - or any that&rsquo;ll be installed at a later date.</li>
<li>Ensure that the bait&rsquo;s lip will be flush with the soil. Finally, create a map of your house and each bait station&rsquo;s locations so that it&rsquo;ll be easier to trace them later.
The next step will require monitoring the termite bait station using a pre-bait made from objects such as an inspection cartridge or wood. However, this process may take several months up to even a year (monitor the station every three months) because it will not immediately attract the termites.
Next, when you notice that the termites are feeding or tampering with the pre-bait, it&rsquo;s now time to install an active bait such as dead or live termites or mud tubes. Don&rsquo;t rush to install the poisoned termite bait as you may end up exterminating the workers required to create the feeding.
Finally, it&rsquo;s now time to install the active or poisoned bait onto the termite bait station. However, monitor the bait station as you&rsquo;d done earlier every three months. Keep records of all the changes, particularly of feeding activity, to allow the bait to rest on the station more - repeat the treatment process monthly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-termite-prevention">3. Termite Prevention</h2>
<h3 id="i-seal-off-windows-and-doors">i. Seal off windows and Doors</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to seal off the house or property from the termites - this is especially important for windows and doors. Therefore, the bugs won&rsquo;t quickly get into your wooden house - you&rsquo;ll need to seal up the crevices and cracks in the rooftops and sidings.
Important is you analyze any possible entry areas that the termites can use and seal them off completely. Further, you&rsquo;ll need to inspect the wooden floors and furniture - including beams and joists, to ensure that the termites aren&rsquo;t wreaking havoc on your house.</p>
<h3 id="ii-repair-leaking-pipes-and-tapes">ii. Repair L**eaking **Pipes and Tapes</h3>
<p>Termite prevention will save you both time, money, and furniture or structure integrity in the future. However, the most important fact is avoiding moisture getting ton your wooden structures - this will help kill off the termite colonies.
So, repair any leaking pipes and tapes - including those of the hot water lines near or around the house. Hence, the lack of moisture around the home will reduce the conditions necessary for the thriving of subterranean termites.
Also, mop all the moisture around your house and remove all the water that could be in water puddles around the house or property - or even inside the home. Keep the house plus floors and carpets dry and well-aerated all round then year.
Also, avoid the overflows from the various air-conditioning and hot water lines away from the house and its sides.</p>
<h3 id="iii-clear-idle-wooden-materials">iii. Clear idle Wooden Materials</h3>
<p>Inspect the house for breached or damaged shielding installed to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/top-7-natural-termite-control-can-easily/">control termites</a>
. Further, remove all idle wooden materials, including cellulose, debris, and timber that may be lying inside, under, or around your house or yard - equally use
yard flea treatments
.
Such timber may act as good food for the termites and equally a hiding place for subterranean termites (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">check their treatments</a>
) and may also conceal termites inside the dead leaves and base-work work-spaces. You&rsquo;ll also require to remove all clothes piles lying around idle as they&rsquo;ll provide food (have cellulose) and shelter for termites.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s how to get rid of termites - for the active termite colony in the wooden structure or house, you&rsquo;ll need to undertake appropriate treatment steps.
But first, undertake termite inspection before taking treatment further, including using
termite baits stations
and soil treatment.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below Ive outlined signs of termites - these will become evident with rising atmospheric pressure, wind, light intensity, moisture levels, and temperatures - proper termite identiifcation will help you decide on the
appropriatrae control method
.
In summary, you&rsquo;ll know if the structures such as the house or other buildings are infested with termites when you see some of these clues;</p>
<ul>
<li>The presence of termites swarmers (dead or alive) inside the structures.</li>
<li>Check the crawl spaces or on the building walls (externally) up from the foundation for mud shelter tubes</li>
<li>When the structures are damaged by termites.
Other signs of termites will include discarded wings, bubbling or uneven paint, and frass.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-9-signs-of-termites---termite-activity">Details: 9 Signs of Termites - Termite Activity</h2>
<h3 id="1-termite-swarmers">1. Termite Swarmers</h3>
<p>Termite swarms can happen outside or inside the house as the termites leave their nests and set up a new colony.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately after the swarmers begin flying, they&rsquo;ll shed wings.</li>
<li>So the swarmers will leave evidence of wings (small piles) on various surfaces and spiderwebs including on the doors, window sills, and the house foundation.
To
differentiate between termites and ants
; note that the wings of termites have the same size whereas ants&rsquo; wings have different sizes.</li>
<li>The rear pair of wings of an and is smaller</li>
<li>While the front pair of wings of ant is larger
To know that the termites are really swarmers, you&rsquo;ll need to use a magnifying glass and check its colour as it&rsquo;s a common sign.</li>
<li>Carpenter ant swarmers are dark brown, black, or red - comparedCarpenter Ants vs Fire Ants</li>
<li>Swarmers of the dry wood termites will be solid red.</li>
<li>Swarmers of subterranean termites will be solid black.
So you can notice termite swarmers emerge from structures such as the house or even Edwards lying on the window sill or on the floor.
Citing the termite swarmers in the house is enough sign that the structure is infested by termites and will require professional termite control.</li>
<li>I advise scheduling a termite inspection and treatment for the building in question.
Scientists note that termites require a number of years for their colonies to grow large and produce swarmers.
If you see many swarmers coming out of a building, it is a sign that a large termite colony is eating up the structure.
However, killing the termite swarmers only will not solve your termite problem.</li>
<li>After all, the termite&rsquo;s swarmers that leave the building eventually die when they can&rsquo;t get too moist ground to feed and reproduce.
Therefore, killing the termite swarmers will only leave the other termite colony thriving unless you treat them.
NB: Finding a few Formosan termites could be an exception when sighted in a building that is appropriately treated for termites.</li>
<li>This is because the Formosan swarmers will be attracted by light from outside colonies or trees and may enter the house, especially in the swam season.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbFdJQuDAzM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbFdJQuDAzM</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-finding-mud-shelter-tubes">2. Finding mud shelter tubes.</h3>
<p>If you see mud shelter tubes moving up the house plumbing, support piers, enable foundation walls, and outside foundation walls, then there could be a termite colony around.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, termites can build shelter tubes on the exterior side of a slab to enable them to get into the house under the siding.
For verification purposes;</li>
<li>Break a small section of that mud tube and check if you see any termites.</li>
<li>Also, check the broken tube after a few days to see if the termites have repaired that section.
These two will be enough signs that the termites are actively infesting the building or structures.
But destroying the mud tubes only will not get rid of a termite infestation (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">but fumigation can help</a>
). This is because the termites will go around and know how to enter the building anyway.</li>
<li>So after finding the mud shelter tubes, I advise you get professional exterminators to inspect the building for termites.
But any shelter tubes that are inactive and old (especially from a previous termite infestation gross profit must be scraped off or removed to make subsequent inspections easier.
You may also find the mud shelter tubes (especially for the Formosan termite) at higher locations of the building such as on the fascia boards, soffit, exterior wall, ceilings, and internal walls.
Other possible reasons for the entry of the termites (especially the Formosan termites) include the presence of above-ground moisture or roof leak.
I advise you to drill some pinholes on the mud shelter tubes or the dried mud on the structures for treatment of termites.</li>
<li>If the pinholes are repaired using mud, it will be clear that the termites have repaired them to prevent airflow exposure.

<h3 id="3-sunken-trails-or-areas-under-the-paint">3. Sunken trails or areas under the paint</h3>
<p>The presence of trails or sunken areas on the surfaces, paint, or wallpaper may signify the presence of termites.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sunken trails or areas under the paint could be resulting from the feeding activity of the termites as they cause damage to the cardboards.
However, termites do not eat gypsum but will feed on the cardboard and wood panelling that is covering it.
The mud may be formed into all shapes on the ceiling and walls particularly during late spring.</li>
<li>For example, the &ldquo;swarm castles&rdquo; of the formosan termites may be 1.5 inches tall and roughly 3 in white.
To identify the presence of the formosan termites, break the mud structures and see if their soldiers will come out defending their colony.
Also, check the foam insulation around the house and see if there are any mud tubes that are traveling through or over it.</li>
<li>The termites really easily tunnel through the foam insulation (particularly if it is sprayed on) but will not eat it.
Some of the termite species that will tunnel through spray-on foam insulation include the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">Eastern subterranean termites</a>
and the formosan termites.</li>
<li>Termite damage in your house may get noticed when you&rsquo;re doing your re-modelling, doing home repairs or replacing old wallpapers.
Despite the fact that termites will leave an area shortly after attacking it, you may still see some of these animals that will denote the presence of an active termite infestation.

<li>But also the structural damage could have resulted from factors such as Wood rot.
But if you see excessive dried or live termites on the damaged timber, this could point out that there are termites attacking the structures.
Another sign that will denote the presence of drywood termites is if you find six-sided pallets that are uniformly-sized (small) on the countertop or floor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Termites will wittingly hide themselves in ward and soil especially in crisis and cars that are hidden on the foundation and the structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if there are clear signs of a damaged infestation, then it is clear that their population is very high (since these pests are challenging to detect).
The presence of shelter tubes moving up on the outside of the foundation wall will show the presence of termites.
However, I advise that you get expert
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-inspection-cost/">professional termite inspection</a>
for your structures and the house for effective control.
Also, don&rsquo;t forget to undertake regular or annual termite prevention and control on various structures and the yard.
Cheers!</li>

.
The insects will chew or gnaw wood and house items like filtration systems, swimming pool liners, insulation, books, and paper. Also, termites can cause emotional strain on homeowners.
In summary: Subterranean termites treatment begins with the wood cure to strengthen the wood and prevent the insects from eating it. Spaying the wood (spot treatment) with the
best termite killers
such as termiticide hinders the termites from chewing your structures.</p>
<h2 id="subterranean-termite-treatment-options---fast-control">Subterranean Termite Treatment Options - Fast Control</h2>
<p>Equally,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-inspection-cost/">termite inspection costs</a>
might be relatively high - also, termite fumigation is equally pricey. So, below I&rsquo;ve discussed the best subterranean termites treatment available for your taking.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="1-apply-liquid-termiticide">1. Apply Liquid Termiticide</h3>
<p>Apply the liquid termiticide underneath and around the wooden or various structures - particularly on portions that termites may attack.
In case you&rsquo;re dealing with new construction, I advise you termite-treat the foundation walls plus the graded soil before pouring your concrete slab. The termite &ldquo;swarmers&rdquo; shed its wings, drop off on the ground and get mates ready to create new colonies.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll have to drill and trench their foundation for the already build structures to treat them with the termiticide. The process creates a barrier between the structure and the termites hiding in the soil.</li>
<li>Further, the termite barrier will also hinder the building&rsquo;s termites from getting back to the soil. Therefore, they will eventually die from dehydration.
Subterranean termite infestations are mainly discovered during spring - they&rsquo;re triggered by rainfall and warm temperatures as they disperse and begin new colonies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-apply-repellent-termiticides">2. Apply Repellent Termiticides</h3>
<p>The pyrethroid termiticide repellents will work just as well as the liquid termiticides to
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef604">repel and kill the termites</a>
attacking your wooden structures. You&rsquo;ll apply it to structures and features, including landscaping, plumbing lines.</p>
<ul>
<li>These repellents with Pyrethroids will quickly poison the termite&rsquo;s nerve but are less toxic to the mammals. The repellents are like Prelude, Demon, Talstar, Cynoff, and Dragnet FT.</li>
<li>The repellent Termiticides will work against the termites that&rsquo;ll work on the termites foraging in areas such as beneath the soil. This also creates a barrier against these foraging and gnawing insects.
Further, pyrethroids are equally cheap to be used as a termite barrier. But the insecticide may sometimes detect the termiticides and hence won&rsquo;t touch the termite barrier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-apply-non-repellent-termiticides">3. Apply Non-Repellent Termiticides</h3>
<p>The non-repellent termiticides will also work against the termites attacking your structures. Luckily, unlike the repellents, termites won&rsquo;t easily detect the presence of the non-repellent termiticides.</p>
<ul>
<li>The termites will easily contact the non-repellent termiticides as they forage in the soil thus are exterminated. Some include Premise by Bayer - with small Imidocloprid doses and kill through contact.</li>
<li>The premise is pricey compared to the pyrethroids. However, Premise can be applied either as spot treatments or also as aerosol or spray form.</li>
<li>Phantom by BASF, made from chlorfenapyr, which is a non-repellent termiticide. The chlorfenapyr will be toxic to the termites when the chemical is broken down through enzymatic action in their immune system.
The chlorfenapyr&rsquo;s metabolites are highly poisonous and will hence stop the termite from generating energy. But the termites won&rsquo;t die instantly and hence will continue transmitting the termiticide back to the nests.
Ask your realtor or the home seller for non-toxic sodium borate and termite barriers. If you are building your own home, you can ask your contractor for professional pre-treatments to be done, so ensure that your home remains free.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-termite-bait-stations">4. Termite Bait Stations</h3>
<p>Termite bait stations
are also the best termite killers. They are drilled into the soil in affected areas or probable entry points of termites. These contain germicidal nematodes that effectively bait subterranean termites.</p>
<ul>
<li>These baits are toxic and lethal parasites in the form of larvae. The termites ingest the nematodes, and once they mature, these parasites will kill their termite host and lay eggs for other termites in the colony to feast on. Eventually, they will spread and acts as a natural defense against termites.</li>
<li>Subterranean termite treatment needs to begin with prevention. Since these species thrive in moist areas and wooden structures that are in contact with the soil, the best way to prevent them from finding their way into your home is to treat the surrounding soil around your house.
Soil treatment involves the injection of short-lived toxins in the surrounding ground surface and foundation of your home. Mostly, these toxins will have a life span of 5 years. You may want to keep track of dates to keep you aware of how long your soil remains in a toxic state.
Fun Fact: Formosan subterranean termite (known as Super Termites) originated from southern China and Taiwan and are highly destructive. These ferocious pests can eat about 13 ounces of wood in a day and can total your home into a useless structure in 3 months. They attack a wide variety of structures that can include trees, buildings, and even boats.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-professional-termite-exterminators">5. Professional Termite Exterminators</h3>
<p>With severe subterranean termite infestations, it is most recommended for you to seek a professional pest control agency&rsquo;s services. Have them diagnose the extent of infestation and damage to your home and discuss the treatment approach.
Make sure you choose one that stands firm on choosing non-toxic and environmentally safe chemical solutions.�Getting on a head start whenever you buy or rent a
home is your best defense
against termites. Of course, whenever you purchase a home, it is always best to buy a home that has been recently built and certified with termite pre-treatments.
Although older homes may not be as stringent with termite pre-treatments upon selling, certain states require a complete and thorough termite inspection with a mandatory order for the owner to shoulder any termite treatments needed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The bad news about subterranean termite infestation is, once a colony has been established in your area, it could be almost futile to eradicate them. They will always keep trying to attack. Your best defense to keep from coming back is to check for vulnerable areas of your home and maintain treatments.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/do-flying-termites-eat-wood/">Termite</a> fumigation is an effective way to eradicate termites from your home or business. This method involves the use of a gaseous pesticide, which is introduced into the affected area to eliminate termites and prevent further damage. In this article, we will discuss what termite fumigation is, how it works, its benefits, and the necessary precautions you need to take.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-termite-fumigation">What is Termite Fumigation?</h2>
<p>Termite fumigation is a professional pest control technique used to eliminate termite infestations. It involves sealing off the affected area and introducing a specially formulated gas, known as fumigant, that penetrates wood, walls, and other materials to kill termites and their eggs. This process can reach deep into inaccessible areas, providing a thorough treatment.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-termite-fumigation-work">How Does Termite Fumigation Work?</h2>
<p>Termite fumigation works by releasing a fumigant, typically a chemical like sulfuryl fluoride, which is capable of killing termites. The fumigant is applied to the infested structure, and the space is sealed to trap the gas inside. The gas penetrates the wood and other materials where termites are hiding, exterminating them upon contact. The fumigation process usually takes about 2 to 3 days, depending on the size of the structure and the severity of the infestation.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-termite-fumigation">Benefits of Termite Fumigation</h2>
<p>Termite fumigation offers several advantages over other termite control methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Comprehensive Treatment:**Fumigation is highly effective in treating large-scale infestations and hard-to-reach areas that other methods may not address.</li>
<li>**Whole-Structure Protection:**Unlike localized treatments, fumigation affects the entire structure, ensuring all termites are exterminated.</li>
<li>**Long-Lasting Results:**Once completed, termite fumigation can provide lasting protection against future infestations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="precautions-to-take-before-and-after-fumigation">Precautions to Take Before and After Fumigation</h2>
<p>There are several important steps to take before and after termite fumigation to ensure safety:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Prepare the Area:**Before fumigation, you must remove all food items, plants, pets, and any items that could be contaminated by the fumigant. You may also need to arrange for temporary accommodation during the process.</li>
<li>**Follow Professional Guidance:**Always hire a licensed pest control company to perform the fumigation. They will ensure the proper use of fumigants and adherence to safety standards.</li>
<li>**Ventilate the Area:**After fumigation, it is essential to ventilate the space thoroughly to ensure all fumigant has dissipated before re-entering the property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cost-of-termite-fumigation">Cost of Termite Fumigation</h2>
<p>The cost of termite fumigation can vary depending on factors such as the size of the structure, the level of infestation, and the location of the property. On average, fumigation can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500. While the upfront cost may seem high, fumigation provides a long-term solution to termite problems and can prevent extensive damage to your property.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Termite fumigation is a highly effective method for eliminating termite infestations and preventing future damage. It is important to hire a professional pest control company to carry out the fumigation and ensure that all safety precautions are followed. By taking the proper steps before and after the treatment, you can protect your home or business from the destructive effects of termites.</p>

<li>Ask the inspector company only to involve the most qualified personnel in your termite inspection.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3-schedule-the-termite-inspection">3. Schedule the Termite Inspection</h3>

<li>Ensure they state any inspection fee that they may require from the process.</li>
<li>Get some written inspection reports and costs according to the areas that are termite infested. Further, ensure you know the number of treatments and materials that will be needed.</li>
<li>What amount of time will be needed to undertake the termite inspection fully. Does the inspector offer any warranty or additional costs while inspecting?</li>
<li>Finally, the inspector should outline how long you, your kids, and kids must remain outside the house after undertaken.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-check-the-inspection-reports-including-costs">4. Check the Inspection Reports (Including Costs)</h3>
<p>Go ahead and
check the inspection reports
to determine the next steps to take. Also, check if the reports offer some guarantees time and the cost involved for that time - is it free?
The next step will be reviewing the provided cost estimates from the inspection. So, now check the difference in the kind of materials to be used in the examination.
Also, ensure that you&rsquo;re good with the materials used in the inspection and
termite treatment
process. Further, compare the materials or items and the costs - including that of labor.</p>
<h3 id="5-select-your-favored-termite-inspector">5. Select Your Favored Termite Inspector</h3>

<h3 id="6-get-and-enter-into-the-inspection-contract">6. Get and Enter into the Inspection Contract</h3>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s time to get your contract from the selected termite inspector. But the provided contact must readily compare to the initial estimate.
Further, ensure that all the details are correct, including contract year, company signature, termite inspection costs, and contact information.
When that is all done, sign the inspection contract ready for the visit. Next, schedule the inspection date and time plus the treatment requirements and terms if that will be required.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-treat-a-house-for-termites">How Much Does It Cost To Treat a House for Termites?</h2>

lethal gas.
The termite extermination cost will vary depending on several factors, including:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Floor area and total structure size of your house to be termite treated.</li>
<li>Level of termite infestation. Whether the structure is dry or damp - this tends to promote fast termite colony reproduction.</li>
<li>The number and type of treatments needed - for example, will be a soil treatment fumigation or spot treatment. For example, you may usetermite bait stations.</li>
<li>Soil treatment costs generally range from $800 - $1,500. But fumigation ranges from $1,400 upwards, while the spot treatment will cost you roughly $250 per area of 10-square-foot.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-select-the-best-termite-control-agency">How to Select the Best Termite Control Agency</h2>
<p><strong>Notably:�</strong>
Give the high cost of repairing caused by termite damage; youll note that it is advisable to conduct a practical termite inspection.
Once youve decided to pre-treat or go all-out war on termites, searching for the right professional pest control agency would be your next call.
You would have to hire their services to have them assess the possible damage already in place and the total termite inspection costs and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">treatment for</a>
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">subterranean termites</a>
.
Your decision will inevitably involve a few factors you would want to consider before making that phone callthe most critical of choosing a licensed pest control company if applicable in your locale.</p>
<h2 id="why-hire-a-licensed-termite-control-agency">Why Hire A Licensed Termite Control Agency?</h2>
<p>Do not just consider the cost of the termite inspection and control agency; competency is an equally important factor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although licensed companies may cost a lot more, it would benefit you most to know that you hired skilled professionals who have been deemed socially and environmentally responsible with their products and services.</li>
<li>In some cases, if there are no licensing and regulatory entities in your area, you can find out if the company is an enlisted member of reputable organizations for pest management and the like.</li>
<li>Some home insurance companies occasionally cover termite inspections and treatments if the pest control agency is duly licensed. This could be big savings and hassle for you.</li>
<li>Window shop for good deals and dont get too carried away by prices. Study their offers, service guarantees, and preventive and maintenance packages they can tie up with your needs.</li>
<li>You may find their packages a very ideal and worry-free termite treatment deal. Sometimes a pricey package can be worth it in the end.</li>
<li>Dont fret as soon as you find out your home is infested with termites. Take your time to make a sound decision by researching online and reading up on factoids and whatnot before you point that finger on the yellow pages on the fanciest looking pest control advertisement.</li>
<li>And lastly, dont get pressured by sales talk. Many pest control agencies will attempt to lure you into signing a contract with them by making it seem like your house will cave-in in a matter of weeks if you take the time to shop around. This is a very dishonest technique that has worked on a lot of homeowners.
<strong>Note:�</strong>
Be very clear and let them know you are merely window shopping for termite inspection costs for the time being, and let them know you appreciate their time and their effort to help you out but would need more time to make a commitment and a decision.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="factors-to-consider-for-termite-fumigation-cost"><strong>Factors to Consider For Termite Fumigation Cost?</strong></h2>
<p>Despite that you might want the termite problem eliminated immediately, you will need to consider the agencies you hire carefully.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether you are in the market for pre-treatment or total termite damage control, a standard termite inspection will entail a thorough visual inspection in all areas of your home, including hard-to-reach places.</li>
<li>Dont hesitate to ask questions about their extent of service and details of treatment procedures. After inspection, a reputable termite company will provide written details of findings and the total areas of treatment coverage. Make sure you keep this for future reference.</li>
<li>Termite inspection procedures and time frames will vary for each home. Naturally, a bigger home will need more time to assess, but sometimes smaller homes can be more tedious.</li>
<li>As long as you feel your home has been thoroughly inspected according to the written guidelines of your agency, and youre satisfied with it, then you know you made the right choice.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="questions-for-termite-exterminators">Questions for Termite Exterminators</h2>
<h3 id="1-can-you-provide-references">1. Can you provide references?</h3>
<p>Request the prospective companies to provide references for past clients. After receiving the references, make a call to them and inquire about the quality and success of the services offered by the prospective company you are considering.</p>
<h3 id="2-experience-level">2. Experience Level?</h3>
<p>To determine how well the company can undertake the pest control process, you need to know the total years that the firm has worked in offering similar services.
Therefore, you require contacting the EPA and the Better Business Bureau to know if some cases or complaints are filed against the prospective firm.</p>
<h3 id="3-are-companies-and-personnel-licensed">3. Are companies and personnel licensed?</h3>
<p>The prospective must prove that they have at least one licensed and certified termite fumigant applicator. Further, you should verify the licenses of the insecticide applicators by contacting the State Departments of Agriculture.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/subterranean-termites-treatment/">subterranean termites (treatment)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>and will thus attract the bugs to the indoor spaces.
Wood and other related materials around the house will hide signs of termite attack. Thus, clear all the dead leaves or debris and wood and wooden pieces that may be lying around your structures and property.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-mop-up-plus-repair-leaking-pipes-and-traps">3. Mop Up Plus Repair Leaking Pipes and Traps</h3>
<p>To prevent and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/top-7-natural-termite-control-can-easily/">control termites</a>
in the indoor spaces, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the soil that&rsquo;s near your structure&rsquo;s foundation dry (with good drainage and grading).
So, net, you&rsquo;ll need to repair all the leaking pipes and taps in the indoor spaces. Also, check on the overflow pipes for hot water inside, around, or under the house. This will prevent an attack from the subterranean termites.
Also, mop up any moisture around and inside the house as this could easily rear a colony of termites. Termites love basins of water in the house, and hence you must keep your house dry and adequately aerated.

<h3 id="4-inspect-wooden-floors-and-furniture">4. Inspect Wooden Floors and Furniture</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to inspect the wooden floors and furniture. This will also involve inspecting the wooden structures, wooden beams, and joists since termites hide and feed on the cellulose.
Further, you must inspect and clean up the hardwood floors in your house to ensure the termites won&rsquo;t be hiding or chewing your wooden structures.
Also, block all the open floor vents and openings since poor ventilation may cause a rise in moisture and humidity in your property - this increases the risk of termite infestation.
Clothes may also attract termites into your house, and thus you&rsquo;ll need to remove the clothing piles. Clothes also have cellulose and hence will attract and feed termites.</p>

<h3 id="1-use-galvanized-post-or-create-2-inch-clearance-for-wooden-fences">1. Use Galvanized post or Create 2-Inch Clearance for Wooden Fences</h3>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll create some 2-Inch Clearance as you set up your wooden fences plus their supporting posts from the soil. Definitely, the wooden timbers lying on the
soil would rear a termite
colony.
Therefore, I would recommend using the galvanized post to elevate the wood from the soil and deny the termites an easy reach to feed on the insects.
Next, repair and bits of the roof that&rsquo;s broken. Further, clear all the woodpiles that may be stacked around your property, including tree trunks, damp or rotten logs.
Ensure you only install the termite-treated fence posts and walls, particularly for the perimeter and garden beds, to prevent termite attacks in the yard.

<h3 id="2-clear-dead-tree-stumps">2. Clear Dead Tree Stumps</h3>
<p>However, ensure that the yard or garden remains clean and neat - including clearing the overgrowth by trimming the grass and
flower bed weeds
.
Next, you&rsquo;ll clean the stumps and dead trees. Termites love the wood cellulose from the stumps and dead trees. Therefore, remove these dead food sources to prevent attacks from termites.
Prevent bushy gardens and climbing plants from growing around your structures and house. Such plants may provide food for the termites plus a ladder for the insects to climb onto wooden parts of your structures.</p>
<h3 id="3-inspect-and-repair-termite-shielding">3. Inspect and Repair Termite Shielding</h3>
<p>Keenly inspect and repair any broken or compromised termite shielding. These would allow you to detect the presence of termites during random inspections easily.
Also, ensure that you uproot any roots that may be tending to break into the house foundation. Avoid planting trees with strong roots that could break the slab and allow termites to gain entry into your house.
Take note of any home addition or alterations as some of these could tamper with already installed termite barriers. Installing some new plumbing, concrete slab, awnings, or gazebo? Well, do a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">termite barrier audit after this process</a>
.
Remove all the timber form-work as this may provide an easy avenue for the termite to attack your house. Finally, don&rsquo; dump air conditioning liquids or hot water near the house foundation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>For the outdoor spaces, termite prevention is an equal tasking job for homeowners. Thus, below I&rsquo;ve outlined the steps you can take to protect the exterior of your house, including the perimeter.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, I will discuss how to naturally control (compared to other
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-termite-killer/">termite treatments</a>
) and eliminate termites without hiring a professional.
Termites have been reported to cause massive damage to buildings each year.
As a result, expensive rebuilding is done to repair their damage. However, if you suspect a termite infestation, dont panic.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Termite Control&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="7-natural-termite-control">7 Natural Termite Control</h2>
<p>It would help if you took swift action to
control termite
infestation because they can cause significant damage over time. Also, if you dont contain the problem of
termite infestation early
, you can end up incurring thousands, if not millions of dollars in repairs, as well as costly termite pest control.
But First! It is essential for you to correctly identify types of termites and all signs of termite infestation before deciding on the best natural method to get rid of the termite infestation.
<strong>1. Borax Solution for Termites</strong>
Sodium borate also is known as the borax solution, helps to kill
subterranean termites
. Youll need to apply sodium borate powder or sodium borate solution to the targeted region to get better results. A sodium borate solution is a mixture of borax and water.
The borax solution is environmentally friendly and does not affect either humans or pests. You can apply borate solution by spraying or painting it on surfaces of wood of newly built buildings. Application of the borax solution can help avert future termite infestation in your residence.
Heres a kicker!!
Always repeat the application of the borax solution until the entire colony of termites is eliminated. You can also decide to use borate treatments combined with other natural
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-termites/">termite treatment for an effective</a>
outcome.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZFXPLG_Uy0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZFXPLG_Uy0</a>
<strong>2. Parasitic Nematodes for Termites</strong>
Nematodes are worm species that love to feed on termites. If you have a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/home-remedy-for-termites/">termite infestation in your home</a>
or business premises, release Nematodes into a colony, the Nematodes will eat up all the termites causing havoc on your premises.
You can purchase nematodes at local pet stores. You can also purchase it online, as many online stores stock it. Nematodes are safe to use. They are not harmful to humans, pets, or plants. They mainly concentrate on pests and ruin their colony within a short period.
Important Point to Note!! If you are not using the Nematodes immediately, store them in a refrigerator. Also, Use the Nematodes after sunset or early in the morning.
<strong>3. Sunlight exposure</strong>
Sunlight is one of the most inexpensive methods to get rid of termites. Termites prefer darkness, and they die when exposed to light or heat.
For your wooden furniture, such as tables and chairs infested with the termite, sunlight treatment for 2-3 days would be the best termite control technique. The sunlight will kill the termites and avert their spread.
If you cant get your furniture out because of unavoidable circumstances, you can purchase or rent UV lamps, which have an equal effect on the suns rays. Take the UV lamps and shine it towards the termite infestation.
<strong>4. Getting Rid Of Moisture to Kill Termites</strong>
Termites flourish and multiply quickly in areas that have excessive water moisture. Therefore, ensure that all parts of the room and building are kept dry. Also, you need to repair structures that are prone to moisture.
Keeping all wooden items dry will also help you counter termite attacks. Its important for moisture to not get into the wood as such conditions would attract termites.
It is also vital you inspect the building&rsquo;s perimeter to ascertain that there are no water leakages that might affect the foundation and cause termite infestation.
<strong>5. Using Botanical Treatments to Kill Termites</strong>
Some of the most effective
natural botanical treatments used to kill
termites are orange oil and Neem oil.
Orange oil:�Orange oil has an active compound referred to as d-limonene. D-limonene has a potent formulation that enables it to kill termites instantly. Orange
oil treatment is also useful
in eliminating colonies of Dry wood termite.
Neem
oil: N
eem oil is also a top-rated botanical treatment for killing termites. This oil is obtained from the Asian neem tree. When using neem oil to eliminate termites, ensure you apply it in their colonies so that the termites will directly ingest it and die.�Remember!!�If you want a quick result, repeat Neem oil&rsquo;s application several times until the whole colony is killed.
<strong>6. Cardboard Trap to Kill Termites</strong>
The use of cardboard is the most non-toxic and
natural termite killer recipe
. Cardboard traps are considered effective as they have an important compound called cellulose, which attracts female termites.
The cellulose enables the cardboard to offer a woody smell, which in turn attracts the termites. To make the smell even more appealing, you can lightly spray the cardboard with water.
Then, place the moistened cardboard close to the target area. After a short period,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-prevention/">termites will cling on top</a>
of the cardboard. Collect the cardboard and get rid of it through burning.
<strong>7. Use Boric Acid to Kill Termites</strong>
Boric acid is an important natural
home remedy that dehydrates the bugs
and halts their nervous system.
For the best result, you can spray or coat the wood with the acid. You can also lightly dust
boric acid
into wall voids, cracks, crevices, or other places the pests are likely to hide.
Boric acid acts by sticking
on the antennae, legs, and bodies of termites. These pests consume the boric acid during grooming, which is poisonous for them, hence dying instantly.
Important Precaution: Boric acid is toxic if inhaled. For your safety, you should always use gloves and masks while using it. Ensure your children and pets dont come into contact with this acid because of its toxic properties.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-termites">Types of Termites</h2>
<p>Drywood Termites:�If your residence or business is infested with Drywood termites, youll notice wood that is not directly in contact with the ground is eaten up.
Drywood termites are easy to identify since they dont build earthen mud tubes. A sure way to confirm a dry wood termite infestation is by looking out for hard, dry fecal capsules that normally form piles.
Drywood termites attack all kinds of dry wood. Further, they sometimes attack furniture or other wood products, especially in those that would normally not have this kind of termites.
Subterranean Termites:�On the other hand, the subterranean termites live underground and depend on the soil for moisture and colony formation.
Youll identify subterranean termite infestation on your building&rsquo;s external walls when you see tubes made of mud, wood chips, and soft fecal matter directed towards the wood product.
Below are the top termite killer recipes that will guarantee you a termite-free residence within the shortest time possible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that you are informed on the Natural Termite Control Methods You Can Easily Do, youll easily prevent or eliminate termite infestation on your premises.
For effective results, you can combine one method with the other, especially when treating a problematic termite colony. These
natural home</p>
<p>remedies
guarantee maximum safety because they dont contain harmful chemicals.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-termite-killer/">termite killers</a>
will fail if you don&rsquo;t accurately know the physical appearance of termites. It might also help to understand the
termites vs. ants
and how to tell them apart.
But don&rsquo;t also confuse them with
fire ants
or
carpenter ants
.�So, have you noticed some
cylindrical, dry, and brown tunnels around the house or yard? Well, these are signs of an ant infestation- maybe dry-wood termites or subterranean termites. But what does a termite look like?
<em>In short, termites are hemimetabolous insects that are 1/4 inch long (for subterranean) to 1/2 inch long for (dry woods and damp woods), have a pair of wings (both of equal length), straight antennae and soft body, thick waist, and short legs.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Termite Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-termite-look-like-termite-identification">What Does A Termite Look Like? Termite Identification</h2>
<p><em>Despite that swarming termites are mainly darker while worker termites look lighter - termites&rsquo; color will be anything from white to light brown. But western dry-wood termite will have reddish-brown heads while western subterranean come with yellowish heads.�</em></p>
<h2 id="a-termite"><strong>a. Termite&rsquo;s Color�</strong></h2>
<p>The termite&rsquo;s
life cycle and the colony
have three castes - (1) reproductives, (2) soldiers, and (3) workers. Every caste has unique features that enable them to perform their colony roles effectively -

Being hemimetabolous, all termites, including their nymphs, will be involved in social activities, are assigned roles. However, pheromones affect which soldier termites grow into reproductives or workers.</p>

<h2 id="1-reproductive-or-the-termite"><strong>1. Reproductive (or the Termite <strong><strong>Alates</strong></strong>)�</strong></h2>
<p>Reproductive or Alates have compound eyes with sclerotized cuticle, which makes their eyes look relatively brown.
But reproductives exist as alates, de-alates, king &amp; queen, and the neotenic. In their development phases, have wing stumps, wings, and wing buds.</p>
<h3 id="a-alates"><strong>a. Alates:�</strong></h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alate">Alates</a></dt>
<dt>are the winged and young termite swarmers - both male and female. The alates are the</dt>
<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite">reproductives</a></dt>
<dt>that&rsquo;ll leave their nest to start other colonies. It may take about four years for a termite colony to produce new swarmers.</dt>
<dt><em>Appearances</em></dt>
<dd>Both females and males have a body size of about 1/4 - 1/2 inch and have grey and pale brown wings. Drywood Alates will have 3+ veins on their wings while the subterranean termite has just two such veins.
During this time, roughly 100-1000 termite alates will larvae their colony, go mate, and colonize other locations. The developing termites will mate and finally settle on favorable locations such as rotting tree stumps where they&rsquo;ll raise their colony.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="b-de-alates"><strong>b. De-alates:�</strong></h3>
<p>De-alates refers to the alate termites after they shed or lose their wings following their mating expedition or flight. They
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-have-wings/">lose their wings</a>
from rubbing after they&rsquo;ve finished mating.
Both female and male alates will lose their wings following their swarming expedition and landingthe
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/termite-fumigation/">process called deciduous - where the termites</a>
will drop off their wings when they finish flying.
In this process, the termite&rsquo;s suture tends to de-alates (drops off), leaving behind a permanent scale. Then, the male termites start searching for a female partner while seeking a location to colonize.
To start with, just a limited number of eggs will be laid and reared by the female termite de-alate.
With time, there will be an increase in workers that&rsquo;ll assist the queen intending the colony&rsquo;s brood. Within 3-5 years, the colony will be too large for practical survival.</p>
<h3 id="c-king--queen"><strong>c. King &amp; Queen:�</strong></h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted above, the alates will lose their wings immediately. They settle down in their new colony 0- becoming what we&rsquo;ve called the de-alate. However, the de-alates swarmers quickly now change into new termites called king &amp; queen.
Next, the queen will reproduce to generate the three forms of termite casts we&rsquo;ve named termite workers, termite soldiers, and the termite reproductive.
Surprisingly, the termite queen can lay about 1,000 eggs each day. Also, the queen can live for up to fifty years. However, the queen will increase the number of eggs it lays to avoid overworking the alates.</p>
<h3 id="d-neotenics"><strong>d. Neotenics:�</strong></h3>
<p>Next are the �Neotenic reproductives that are termites with juvenile features allowing them to easily replace the queen &amp; king (the termite&rsquo;s colony&rsquo;s primary reproductives).
The Neotenics will have wings having an equal length (2 pairs), and the wings will be almost equal to the body of the termite. However, these Neotenic swarmers have straight antennae, a straight abdomen, and two body segments.</p>
<h2 id="2-soldier-termites"><strong>2. Soldier Termites�</strong></h2>
<dl>
<dt>Soldier termites will work hard to offer protection to the whole termite colony against enemies or intruders. Just like the other two termite castes, soldiers are effective in their working in the colony.</dt>
<dt><em>Appearance</em></dt>
<dd>The soldiers have a big head with a unique shape. Further, to safeguard their colony, the soldiers have mandible that is protruding in nature. Further, the soldiers are white, light brown, or pale red with an elongated body on color.
The soldier termites are infertile and thus will solely work to defend their colony - being guardians and fighters. They&rsquo;ll employ their large mandibles and
<a href="https://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/152nd/fink.html">armored heads to fight their enemies</a>
.
Besides, soldiers provide early warnings whenever the colony&rsquo;s security, such as the walls, is compromised. In such cases, the termites will create phalanx to block off possible intruders.
<em>Appearance:�</em></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Look like worker termites - creamy or white body.</li>
<li>Their head is enlarged and can be yellow, red, orange, or brown.</li>
<li>Soldiers have mandibles that are long to offer adequate security and defense against intruders and enemies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-subterranean-workertermites">**3. ****Subterranean Worker�**<strong>Termites�</strong></h2>
<p>Subterranean termites will protect themselves and reach their food using &ldquo;mud tubes&rdquo; - special kinds of tunnels. You&rsquo;ll find workers in secluded places or underground locations.
Workers&rsquo; times have scissor-like jaws that&rsquo;ll easily gnaw wood throughout the day. Equally, worker times feed on substances that have cellulose.
With their saw-toothed jaws, workers termites are highly destructive - they&rsquo;ll shear any wood.
<em>Appearance:�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Body size - about  - 3/8 inches</li>
<li>Workers have a creamy or white body</li>
<li>Relatively dark head and they&rsquo;re wingless</li>
<li>Have a soft body and mouth-parts that&rsquo;s hardened</li>
<li>Workers will molt with no change in body size
