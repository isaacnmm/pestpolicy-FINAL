      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you drink alkaline <a href="/posts/best-water-tables-for-1-year-old/">water</a> every day? Alkaline water contains a pH that&rsquo;s higher than 7 - regular tap water has a� pH of between 6.5 to 8.5 on the pH scale -
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/drinking-water-regulations-and-contaminants">according to EPA</a>
.</p>
<p>On the health benefit claims, alkaline water is considered that its high hydrogen content allows better hydration compared to pure water, particularly during a workout.
So, in summary, YES and NO - there are both benefits and cons of alkaline water on daily intake - leading to
<a href="https://twitter.com/_AyeVee/status/1085823220157054976">clear skin</a>
and weight loss and reduce cancer.
So, begin with a moderate intake of alkaline water. Likely effects of excessive consumption of alkaline water include
skin irritations, nausea, and gastrointestinal problems.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-drink-alkaline-water-every-day-7-pros">Can You Drink Alkaline Water every day?? 7 Pros</h2>
<p>Using water made from one of the
<a href="https://upurifywater.com/best-alkaline-water-pitcher/">best alkaline water pitchers</a>
reduces bone loss, improves digestion, reduces acid in the blood, slow the aging process, increase your energy, and helps improve metabolism.</p>
<h3 id="1-cuts-diabetes-and-blood-pressure">1. Cuts diabetes and Blood pressure</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-SHYI200112005.htm">Researchers report</a>
that within a year of taking alkaline water, human beings show reduced levels of blood lipids, blood sugar, and blood pressure. They&rsquo;ll reduce the blood viscositystickiness plus thickness.
The alkaline water has a high pH electrolyte, and it was shown to reduce blood viscosity following workout (from de-hydration), and this cut cardiovascular strain.
Alkaline water produces better urine pH effect - particularly in the anaerobic test, plus the increased hydration allows one to increase their energy for your skeleton.
Therefore, regular or daily intake of alkaline water will significantly improve your nutrition as it affects your body&rsquo;s hydration, plus the balance in the acid-base.

<h3 id="2-reduces-osteoporosis-and-improves-bone-health">2. Reduces Osteoporosis and Improves Bone health</h3>
<p>Scientists have noted that alkaline water will lead to benefits including
<a href="http://www.thebonejournal.com/article/S8756-3282(08)00781-3/abstract">osteoporosis plus better bone health</a>
as it reduces bone resorption causing better bone regeneration.
High mineral density plus less bone resorption makes your bones to gain more strength. The calcium and bicarbonate in the alkali water enhance better bone growth.
Alkaline water reduces the occurrence of osteoporosis - a condition that would otherwise make your bones brittle and highly brittle.
Further, taking alkaline water was
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195546/">noted to cause</a>
lower levels of calcium in the human urine - but the research didn&rsquo;t prove a reduction in osteoporosis or better bone health.</p>
<h3 id="3-reduces-acid-reflux">3. Reduces Acid reflux</h3>
<p>Acid reflux will happen if the acidic food content in your stomach - and these will splash into your food pipe, causing GERD - gastroesophageal reflux disease.
However,
<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000348941212100702">recent research</a>
discovered that alkaline water reduces the occurrence of GERD caused by acidic reflux of food into your food pipe.
Notably, the pH above 7 in the alkaline water prevents the progression of the activities of the enzymes, causing acid reflux or GERD.
Also, alkaline water contributes to the reduction of the acidity in the stomach and its contents. However, taking excessive alkaline water may prevent killing or pathogens like bacteria.</p>
<h3 id="4-increases-longevity">4. Increases Longevity</h3>
<p>Research done on mice talking alkaline water over three years showed that they had improved longevity - living longer and further aging at a lower rate.
Results from an analysis of the mice&rsquo;s brains, livers, hearts, intestines, and kidneys, demonstrated that the bugs experienced no danger of diseases due to taking alkaline water.
Further, on cancer,
<a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010438.full">research showed</a>
that there was a reduced risk (in mice) of getting urinary bladder cancer after taking alkaline water.
However, some studies show that drinking alkaline water
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195546/">could promote</a>
a better update of chemotherapy medication for humans with cancer.

<h2 id="alkaline-water-vs-plain-water">Alkaline Water vs. Plain Water</h2>
<p>Many people consider that plain water more suitable for their health as compared to drinking alkaline water. This is mainly because of fear that alkaline water would neutralize their&rsquo;s blood acid.
However, as noted above, moderate drinking of alkaline water will reduce the chances of getting heart disease, high blood pressure, or even cancer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s safe to drink alkaline water eat and every day as it has different health benefits, including reduces chances of getting high blood pressure, cancer, or diabetes.
However, avoid excessive intake of the water because it might lead to neutralization of blood acid or the acidic level of the contents in your stomach - so begin the drinking with low intake and aim to increase the intake slowly.
Excessive intake of alkaline water may lead to skin irritations or gastrointestinal problems. This is because of a disturbance of the normal pH of your body, causing eventual nausea.</p>

      <description>How do portable water filters work? You can make your water potable or drinkable.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do <a href="/posts/best-portable-air-compressor-for-jeep/">portable</a> <a href="/posts/best-water-tables-for-1-year-old/">water</a> filters work? You can make your water potable or drinkable.</p>
<p>The methods include water treatment and water filtering including
<a href="https://upurifywater.com/best-portable-water-purifier/">emergency water purifiers</a>
to use during camping or exploration missions.
Water purification will involve passing the water via filters (make from fiberglass or ceramic) that&rsquo;ll remove the soil sediments and other bad microorganisms.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-portable-water-filters-work">How Do Portable Water Filters Work?</h2>
<h3 id="1-squeeze-filters"><strong>1. Squeeze Filters�</strong></h3>
<p>Squeeze filters are lightweight, easy to use and hence you can carry them upcountry, camping, or just general road and off-road traveling.
So, readily filter your water and take safe and clean water with unmatched confidence. Luckily, most can readily fit into your hands - easy to use, and it&rsquo;s highly packable.
Squeeze filters will mainly consist of pores that are as small as 0.1 microns. They&rsquo;ll come with some printed usage instructions to allow easier operation.
It may come with a drinking cup, back-flush cup for easy sharing into other bottles or drinking. Further, some purifiers may have a back-flush plunger.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNCzjJCEjK8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNCzjJCEjK8</a>
The water filters have tiny pores that&rsquo;ll only let molecules of water to go through them while filtering out protozoa (cryptosporidium plus giardia) or bacteria such as e-coli.
However, various microorganisms including bacteria need filters that have pores measuring under 0.2 microns for effective removal. Further, water filters having carbon elements will assist in improving the water flavor.
Squeeze filters work akin to the pump filters but won&rsquo;t need additional housing material and weight like it is with other general pumps.
On operation of the squeeze filters, you&rsquo;ll simply need to squeeze the pouch or bottle and this will make the water move out - hence are good for camping or backpacking.

<h3 id="2-pump-filters"><strong>2. Pump Filters�</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://ufonline.ufl.edu/infographics/five-water-purification-designs/">Pump water filters</a>
will utilize your body&rsquo;s energy for pumping out water via the filter. These are excellent for quick water filtration like when you&rsquo;re on camping or exploration missions.
Considering your pumping energy - you can get clean and safe water within a very short time - buts its filters will age fast and it requires high amounts of energy for the pumping process.
However, get a pump filter that&rsquo; easy to use and clean - this enables you to rejuvenate the pump filter within a short time. The pump filters are equally light-weight and easy to use.</p>
<h3 id="3gravity-filters">3.<strong>Gravity Filters�</strong></h3>
<p>Gravity filters profit from the force of gravity to get rid of contaminants and sediments in your water. It has 2 chambers - a lower one and a
mediator
one that holds
filter elements.
Also, the gravity filters equally utilize similar filters like the pump filters - you can let it rest while filtering as you do your comping or other leisure activities in the wild.
In comparison, gravity filters weigh less than the pump filters and hence are considered more portable and usable on travels or camping.
So, as you camp in the wild, take some dirty water, and simply let it get down through the gravity filters as you wait for your safe and clean water. Read Also:

Strain the dirty water through a shirt or bandanna to remove the debris and finally pass them through the chemical treatment process to kill micro-organisms like viruses.
However, chemical water treatment solutions could leave some bad after-taste and may need that you leave the water standing for some time before drinking.</p>
<h3 id="2-uv-light-treatment">2. UV Light Treatment</h3>
<p>You can also treat the water using UV light that&rsquo;s generated by a special type of water filter - this will remove the debris, sediments, and kill various micro-organisms.
Boiling the water can also be effective in treating the water but may not be as great as the chemical methods like water purification tablets.
Ensure that the water continues boiling for about 1 minute or more at elevated temperatures to exterminate all the dangerous microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standing <a href="/posts/best-water-tables-for-1-year-old/">water</a> in your yard, often manifesting as persistent puddles or squishy, waterlogged patches, is more than just an unsightly nuisance. It can wreak havoc on your landscape, drowning desirable plants and turfgrass, creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and potentially leading to foundation issues for your home. A perpetually wet yard can also make outdoor activities unpleasant, turning what should be a usable space into a swampy hazard.</p>
<p>Addressing standing water requires understanding its root causes, which can range from poor soil conditions to improper grading or even structural problems with your home. Once the cause is identified, a variety of solutions, from simple DIY fixes to more elaborate drainage systems, can be implemented to reclaim your yard and ensure its long-term health. This guide will walk you through common culprits behind soggy lawns and provide practical, effective ways to remove standing water from your property.</p>
<h2 id="causes-of-standing-water">Causes of Standing Water</h2>
<p>Before you can effectively tackle standing water, it&rsquo;s crucial to identify why it&rsquo;s accumulating. The root cause will dictate the most appropriate and lasting solution.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Poor Soil Drainage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Clay Soil:</strong> Clay particles are very small and packed tightly together, leaving little space for water to percolate through. This leads to slow drainage and water pooling on the surface.</li>
<li><strong>Compacted Soil:</strong> Over time, foot traffic, heavy machinery, or even heavy rain can compact the soil, reducing pore space and restricting water infiltration. This is common in high-traffic areas or new construction sites.</li>
<li><strong>Hardpan:</strong> A layer of dense, impermeable soil that forms below the topsoil, often due to natural geological formations or improper tilling practices. It acts as a barrier, preventing water from draining deeper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improper Grading or Sloping:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depressions or Low Spots:</strong> If your yard has natural dips, uneven ground, or intentional landscaping features that create low points, water will naturally collect there after rain or irrigation.</li>
<li><strong>Negative Grading Towards Home:</strong> This is a serious issue. If the ground slopes towards your house instead of away from it, rainwater will collect around your foundation, potentially leading to leaks, damp crawl spaces, and structural damage.</li>
<li><strong>Impervious Surfaces:</strong> Driveways, patios, and sidewalks can redirect large volumes of stormwater, overwhelming nearby permeable areas and causing pooling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High Water Table:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In some geographic locations, the water table (the level below which the ground is saturated with water) is naturally high, especially during rainy seasons or near bodies of water. When the water table is close to the surface, the soil can&rsquo;t absorb much additional water, leading to pooling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Underground Obstructions or Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buried Debris:</strong> Construction debris (concrete, rocks, wood scraps) buried beneath the soil can impede natural drainage paths.</li>
<li><strong>Damaged Pipes:</strong> Leaking underground irrigation lines, downspout drains, or even septic systems can continuously saturate an area, leading to chronic standing water.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clogged Gutters and Downspouts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your home&rsquo;s gutters are clogged with leaves or debris, water can overflow and dump directly onto your lawn or foundation. Similarly, if downspouts discharge water directly onto a flat or improperly sloped area of the yard, it can create persistent puddles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excessive Irrigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overwatering your lawn or garden can saturate the soil beyond its capacity, leading to temporary puddles, especially if underlying drainage issues exist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Identifying the specific cause is often a process of observation. Watch where and when the water collects, how long it persists, and consider your soil type and yard&rsquo;s topography. This diagnostic phase is critical before implementing any drainage solutions.</p>
<h2 id="9-ways-to-remove-standing-water-in-your-yard">9 Ways to Remove Standing Water in Your Yard</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified the cause of standing water, you can implement a range of solutions, from simple DIY fixes to more involved landscaping projects.</p>
<h3 id="1-improve-soil-drainage-with-aeration-and-organic-matter">1. Improve Soil Drainage with Aeration and Organic Matter</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> For compacted clay soils, or general puddling across the lawn.</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aeration:</strong> Use a core aerator (rentable or hire a professional) to remove small plugs of soil from your lawn. This creates channels for water and air to penetrate compacted soil. Best done during your lawn&rsquo;s active growing season.</li>
<li><strong>Add Organic Matter:</strong> For new beds or areas where you can till, incorporate compost, well-rotted manure, or other organic materials. Organic matter improves soil structure, making clay soils more permeable and sandy soils better at retaining moisture without becoming waterlogged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Top-dressing your lawn with a thin layer of compost after aeration can further enhance soil health and drainage over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-adjust-your-landscaping-grade-regrading">2. Adjust Your Landscaping Grade (Regrading)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> If water is pooling due to low spots or negative slopes (water flowing towards your house).</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong> This involves moving soil to create a gentle slope away from your house and towards a designated drainage area (e.g., a street, a swale, or a rain garden).
<ul>
<li><strong>Minor Low Spots:</strong> For small puddles, you can sometimes fill in the depression with a mix of topsoil and sand, then reseed or re-sod.</li>
<li><strong>Negative Grading:</strong> For slopes towards the house, you&rsquo;ll need to add soil near the foundation to create a positive grade (a slope of at least 1-2% away from the house for the first 10 feet). This is crucial for protecting your foundation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For significant regrading, it&rsquo;s often best to consult with a landscape architect or drainage expert.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-install-french-drains">3. Install French Drains</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> For persistent soggy areas, especially where water originates from an uphill source or needs to be channeled away from a structure.</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong> A French drain is a trench filled with gravel and containing a perforated pipe that redirects surface and subsurface water away from a problem area.
<ul>
<li>Dig a trench (typically 6-12 inches wide, 18-24 inches deep) with a slight downhill slope (at least 1% grade).</li>
<li>Line the trench with landscape fabric to prevent soil from clogging the pipe.</li>
<li>Lay perforated drainage pipe inside the fabric-lined trench.</li>
<li>Cover the pipe with gravel, fold the fabric over, and then top with a layer of soil and turf or decorative rock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the French drain empties into a safe, downhill area where the water can disperse without causing new problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-create-a-rain-garden">4. Create a Rain Garden</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> For aesthetic and eco-friendly management of stormwater runoff, especially from downspouts or large impervious surfaces.</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong> A rain garden is a shallow depression planted with native, water-loving plants designed to temporarily hold and absorb rainwater runoff.
<ul>
<li>Dig a shallow basin (typically 6-12 inches deep) in a low spot, away from your house.</li>
<li>Amend the soil with compost and sand to improve drainage and infiltration.</li>
<li>Plant with deep-rooted, moisture-tolerant native species that can handle both wet and dry conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Rain gardens not only manage water but also create beautiful habitats for pollinators and reduce overall runoff.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-install-a-catch-basin-with-drainage-pipes">5. Install a Catch Basin with Drainage Pipes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> For collecting large volumes of water from a specific low point, driveway, or patio and diverting it elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong> A catch basin is a grate-covered box installed at the lowest point of a pooling area. Drainage pipes (solid PVC) are connected to the basin to carry the collected water to a suitable discharge point (e.g., a storm drain, dry well, or lower part of the property).</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the pipes have sufficient slope to allow gravity to move the water effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-extend-downspouts-and-clean-gutters">6. Extend Downspouts and Clean Gutters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> If puddling occurs directly below your roofline or around your foundation.</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clean Gutters:</strong> Regularly clear gutters of leaves and debris to ensure water flows freely.</li>
<li><strong>Extend Downspouts:</strong> Attach extensions to your downspouts to carry water at least 5-10 feet away from your foundation. Consider flexible corrugated pipes or more permanent underground extensions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Point downspout extensions towards permeable areas of your yard, a rain garden, or a French drain, rather than onto another impervious surface or a neighbor&rsquo;s property.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-create-a-dry-well">7. Create a Dry Well</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> For containing and dispersing water underground in areas where surface discharge isn&rsquo;t feasible, often in conjunction with downspouts or catch basins.</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong> A dry well is an underground pit filled with gravel or a pre-fabricated plastic chamber, designed to collect and slowly disperse water into the surrounding soil.
<ul>
<li>Dig a pit (e.g., 3-4 feet deep and wide).</li>
<li>Line with landscape fabric.</li>
<li>Fill with large gravel or install a dry well chamber.</li>
<li>Connect to an incoming drain pipe (e.g., from a downspout or catch basin).</li>
<li>Cover with soil and re-turf.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the dry well is sized appropriately for the volume of water it will receive and that the surrounding soil has sufficient permeability to absorb the water.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-plant-moisture-loving-vegetation">8. Plant Moisture-Loving Vegetation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> For persistently damp but not necessarily deeply pooling areas, or as a softening element around drainage solutions.</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong> Introduce plants that thrive in wet conditions. Their root systems can help absorb excess moisture and improve soil structure over time.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Bald cypress, river birch, willow, certain ferns, sedges, irises, rushes, and many native wetland plants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> This is a complementary solution, not a standalone fix for severe pooling, but it can be effective for slightly soggy spots.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-install-a-sump-pump-indoor-to-outdoor">9. Install a Sump Pump (Indoor to Outdoor)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to use:</strong> If water is pooling around your foundation due to high groundwater or basement flooding, and needs to be actively pumped away from the house.</li>
<li><strong>How:</strong> A sump pump is typically installed in a basement or crawl space pit (sump pit) and activates automatically when water levels rise, pumping the water out through a discharge pipe to a safe exterior location.</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ensure the discharge pipe extends far enough from the foundation to prevent the water from simply re-saturating the same area. Consider connecting it to a French drain or storm drain if permissible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Standing water in your yard is a clear signal that something is amiss with your property&rsquo;s drainage. Ignoring it can lead to a host of problems, from damaged landscaping and mosquito infestations to potentially costly foundation issues. By understanding the common causes � be it compacted soil, improper grading, or clogged gutters � you can effectively diagnose the problem.</p>
<p>The solutions available are diverse, ranging from simple fixes like extending downspouts and aerating your lawn, to more involved projects like installing French drains, creating rain gardens, or regrading your yard. For minor issues, a DIY approach might suffice, but for persistent or severe problems, consulting with a landscape architect or drainage professional can save you time, money, and frustration in the long run.</p>
<p>Ultimately, addressing standing water is an investment in the health, beauty, and functionality of your outdoor space, ensuring your yard remains a place of enjoyment rather than a soggy challenge. A well-drained yard is a healthier yard, protecting your plants, your home, and your peace of mind.</p>

are often mistaken for cockroaches. Mistaking one bug for the other leads to wrong pest eradication interventions -
get rid of cockroaches
.
Although they bear a close resemblance, it is possible to differentiate the two based on some factors.
Ill take you through some of the features you can use to differentiate cockroaches (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">including baby roaches</a>
) from water bugs.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Water Bugs Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="water-bugs-vs-cockroaches-7-key-differences">Water Bugs Vs. Cockroaches (7 Key Differences)</h2>
<h3 id="1-appearance"><strong>1. Appearance</strong></h3>
<p>**Waterbug **
The length of a giant waterbug is about 3.8 cm (1.5 inches), and its the one that is mostly confused for a cockroach. Some waterbugs can reach up to 10 cm (4 inches) long. They have an oval-shaped body and three pairs of legs.
The forelimbs are modified to have sharp claws, which they use to pierce and hold on to their prey. Waterbugs are dark brown, almost resembling a dead leaf. They related:
Mold vs. Mildew
.
**Cockroach **
Cockroaches are also oval and possess three legs and one pair of antennae. Most cockroach species are relatively smaller than waterbugs. But at between 3.2 and 5.4 mm long, the American roach will most likely be mistaken for a waterbug.
The best way to differentiate an American roach from a waterbug is to look at the color. Generally, American roaches are reddish-brown in color. They also have a distinct yellowish coloration on their head resembling figure 8.

<h3 id="2-location"><strong>2. Location</strong></h3>
<p>**Cockroaches **
The German and American roaches are the most common indoor cockroaches. They inhabit warm, humid, and dark places, especially where food is readily is available. You can find them in the kitchen, bathroom, near the sink, food stores, and cabinet, among other places.
Roaches
live near wet places
because their body requires water regularly. But since they are not aquatic, they wont get into the water. Only a few species of roaches are known to survive underwater for long.
<strong>Waterbugs</strong> Water bugs live
outdoors, especially in water or wet places. Thats where they get their name from. Stagnant water, leaking pipes, or wet surfaces around the compound make ideal places for them to thrive and reproduce.
Their ability to adapt to aquatic conditions is made possible by a respiratory tube (siphon). Now and then, they stick the siphon out of the water to breathe in some air, which they store in a small chamber.
It is this air that they use to breathe when hunting for prey under the water. Since only a small amount of air can be stored at a time, they regularly come near-surface to refill.</p>
<h3 id="3-life-cycle"><strong>3. Life Cycle</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cockroaches</strong>
Roaches develop from
eggs to larvae
than to adults. Depending on the species, females lay 10-40 eggs. The eggs are contained in a protective casing, usually referred to as an ootheca.
The egg incubation period ranges between 20 and 60 days for different roach species. Adult roaches can live up to 180 days.
**Waterbugs **
A giant waterbug goes through egg-nymph-adult stages. A female lays eggs on things, just able the water level. Eggs hatch into adults within 1 or 2 months, and the adults live for 3 to 4 years.</p>
<h3 id="4-diet"><strong>4. Diet</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cockroaches</strong>
The diet of a cockroach mainly consists of food substances, especially those containing sugar, fat, and starch. Thats why they like clinging around your kitchen. However, in the absence of food substances, theyll feed on almost anything, including decaying matter, hair, dead skin, small insects, books, and so on.
In insects&rsquo; case, they dont go hunting but will eat any insect they find on their way.
**Waterbugs **
Unlike roaches, waterbugs are omnivorous insects that survive mainly by eating aquatic insects, small reptiles, tiny fish, and amphibians. They kill their prey by hunting it down and sucking their internal organs using a digesting enzyme.

<h3 id="5-temperament"><strong>5. Temperament</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waterbugs</strong>
Waterbugs are aggressive hunters of small aquatic creatures like fish, snails, frogs, etc. However, they wont generally pursue
humans to bite
them. They only
bite humans
when they few threatened or when you invade their habitats.
If you walk in their territories barefooted, you may get a toe bite from waterbugs. For this reason, waterbugs are sometimes called toe-biters. Such bites are very painful, but they wont make you ill.
**Cockroaches **
Cockroaches are timid creatures and will always scamper for safety whenever exposed to light. Therefore, its scarce to sustain a
cockroach bite
. However, they can bite as they go about looking for food, especially when theres no alternative food.
You dont have to be scared of roach bites! These creatures are always running away for humans or light.</p>
<h3 id="6-pest-threat"><strong>6. Pest Threat</strong></h3>
<p>**Cockroaches **
Cockroaches are considered a pest threat when they invade our homes. They tend to contaminate our
food as they scavenge for something to eat
. Cockroaches are carriers of the salmonella bacteria, which may be transmitted to humans when they touch their food.
Salmonella&rsquo;s symptoms appear within 12-72 hours from the time of infection and may include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on.
Roaches can also cause asthma through their fecal excrement and molted skin.
**Waterbugs **
Waterbugs prefer outdoor conditions because they are attracted to dampness. However, they might come into your house in search of food or warmth. Although they are not known to cause a lot of havoc, they can also be considered pests when they get to your house.
Unlike cockroaches, waterbugs are not associated with infections. The main concern with waterbugs is the risk of bites and asthma.

<h2 id="how-to-eradicate-cockroaches-vs-waterbugs"><strong>How to Eradicate Cockroaches Vs. Waterbugs</strong></h2>
<p>Waterbugs are more comfortable to eradicate than cockroaches. That because roaches tend to be invasive and quickly adapt to the environment for their survival. They also live in large colonies and reproduce rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="1-roach-baits-">**1. Roach Baits� **</h3>
<p>However, both pests can be eradicated using the same methods. Below are some of the most effective remedies for cockroaches and waterbugs.
Roach baits
provide an easy and convenient way of eradicating waterbugs and cockroaches. The
best roach baits
contain attractants that lure the insects to the insecticide. Most of the popular roach bait brands contain a slow-acting ingredient that kills insects slowly.
This technology ensures that the insects have enough time to share the poison with the rest of the colony. Such roach baits or
roach foggers
will be ideal for eliminating a whole colony of roaches or waterbugs.
Roach baits can be placed on various locations depending on their type. For instance, roach motels are ideal for low-laying places such as beneath the furniture. Roach gels are suitable for areas above the surface, such as on walls and along baseboards.</p>
<h3 id="2-roach-spray"><strong>2. Roach Spray</strong></h3>
<p>Roach sprays
can be used to kill and repel roaches and waterbugs. Most of the
best roach killers
come as insecticide concentrates, which require diluting water and sprayed directly on the affected areas.</p>
<h3 id="3-boric-acid"><strong>3. Boric Acid</strong></h3>
<p>The boric
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/harris-boric-acid-roach-powder-with-lure-review/">acid powder can be spread on the affected areas to kill roaches</a>
and waterbugs. This powder exists as microscopic particles that can break through the insects exoskeleton, causing dehydration.
You can also make a solution by mixing the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/">boric acid</a>
powder with water. This solution can be applied by sprinkling or by using a spray bottle.</p>
<h3 id="4-vinegar"><strong>4. Vinegar</strong></h3>
<p>Vinegar can be used as a natural method for repelling
roaches and waterbugs. Make a vinegar solution and spray on the affected areas to repel these creatures.
Although it wont kill them, it forces them out of place and deters them from coming back. However, due to its short-lasting effect, you need to apply regularly to keep these creatures at bay.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-waterbugs"><strong>How to Prevent Waterbugs</strong></h2>
<p>Waterbugs will thrive in your compound and eventually find their way into your house. So, the best thing to do is to eliminate all possible avenues for breeding and thriving. Getting rid of wet conditions denies waterbugs a place to thrive and breed. Below are some steps you can follow to inhibit their survival.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you suspect that you have awaterbug infestation, ensure that all possible water pools inside the house are drained. These include pet water vessels, flower vessels, sink, and so on.</li>
<li>Get rid of pools of water around the compound. These may include rainwater collection vessels, birdbaths, and ground holes. For ground holes, you can fill them with soil.</li>
<li>If its raining, ensure that the flowing water does not get blocked by debris or items on your compound. The idea here is to reduce the ability of water to pool around.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-cockroaches"><strong>How to Prevent Cockroaches</strong></h2>
<p>Cockroaches come to your house in search of food, water, and warmth. So, effective prevention measures must be geared towards eliminating anything that attracts roaches. Below are some
tips for preventing
cockroach infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your house clean and free from spilled food or crumbs.</li>
<li>Any cooked food should be kept in covered vessels or the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Always keep your utensils clean.</li>
<li>Uncooked food should be locked in an adequately sealed store.</li>
<li>Dispose of garbage regularly.</li>
<li>Dustbins should have tight-fitting lids.</li>
<li>Clean your sink after use to eliminate food particles</li>
<li>Clean your bathroom and kitchen with a disinfectant</li>
<li>Do not leave pools of water in your kitchen, bathroom, or any other place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-survive-in-water/">Water bugs</a>
and cockroaches exhibit several similarities that might make it difficult to differentiate. This guide makes it very easy to differentiate the two common household pests.
One notable difference is the presence of sharp claws in waterbugs, which is not the case with cockroaches. Correct pest identification enables you to embark on an effective eradication method.</p>
