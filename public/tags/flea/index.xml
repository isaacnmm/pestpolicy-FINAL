      <description>Dealing with fleas? I&amp;#39;ve been there. Here are my honest reviews of the best flea traps that actually work, focusing on effectiveness, safety, and ease of use.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While sprays and treatments are essential for tackling a full-blown infestation, one of the most powerful tools in your long-term arsenal is a simple, plug-in flea trap. Think of it as a silent sentinel, working 24/7 to monitor and capture the adult <a href="/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/">fleas</a> that are hopping around your home. When you start your search, you&rsquo;ll immediately find dozens of options, but most of them are variations of a classic design, like the iconic <span style="color:red;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000668Z96/?tag=p-policy-20">Victor Flea Trap</a></span>, which has been a go-to for decades.</p>
<p>For a modern take on this classic, many people now opt for models like the <span style="color:red;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MEG8LKK/?tag=p-policy-20">Aspectek Sticky Dome Flea Trap</a></span>, which offers a similar mechanism with a slightly different design. But with so many choices, how do you pick the right one?</p>

<h3 id="what-i-look-for-in-a-flea-trap">What I Look For in a Flea Trap</h3>
<p>After trying several models over the years, I&rsquo;ve learned to judge them on a few key things that really matter in a real-world home environment.</p>
<p><strong>First and foremost, does it actually catch fleas?</strong> This is non-negotiable. An effective trap uses the right combination of light and heat to be more attractive to a flea than your ankles are. The proof is right there on the sticky pad in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Is it safe for my curious pets and kids?</strong> This is my next biggest concern. Since these traps sit on the floor, they need to be designed so that a curious nose or paw can&rsquo;t easily get stuck on the glue pad. I look for traps with a sturdy plastic dome or cage that protects the sticky surface.</p>
<p><strong>How much of a hassle is it?</strong> Life is busy, especially when you&rsquo;re dealing with a pest problem. I want a trap that I can assemble in under a minute, that uses sticky pads that are easy to peel and replace, and that is built durably enough that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it breaking if it gets bumped by a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<h3 id="my-top-5-flea-trap-recommendations">My Top 5 Flea Trap Recommendations</h3>
<p>Here are my honest reviews of the flea traps that have proven themselves to be the best in the business.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Old Reliable: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000668Z96/?tag=p-policy-20">Victor Flea Trap</a></strong>
There&rsquo;s a reason the Victor trap is a classic. It’s highly effective, straightforward, and it just works. The design is simple: a light bulb sits over a sticky disc. Fleas are drawn to the warmth and light, and they get stuck. It can attract fleas from up to 30 feet away, making it a powerhouse for monitoring a large room. The only downside is that in a heavy infestation, you might find yourself changing the sticky pads often—but that’s also a good sign that it&rsquo;s doing its job!</p>
<p><strong>2. The User-Friendly Champ: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MEG8LKK/?tag=p-policy-20">Aspectek Sticky Dome Flea Trap</a></strong>
If you want something that&rsquo;s incredibly easy to set up and use, the Aspectek trap is a fantastic choice. It functions much like the Victor trap but comes in a simple dome design that snaps together in seconds. It often comes with a generous supply of extra sticky pads, making it a great value right out of the box. It’s a reliable and hassle-free option for anyone who wants to plug it in and forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Safety-First Choice: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4JTZFL/?tag=p-policy-20">Terro Flea Trap</a></strong>
When you have pets or small children, safety is everything. The Terro trap is designed with this in mind. The protective canopy does an excellent job of preventing accidental contact with the sticky surface, giving you peace of mind. It’s completely non-toxic and uses the same proven light-and-heat method to attract fleas. While its attraction radius might be slightly smaller than some other models, its safety-conscious design makes it the top pick for family homes.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Built-to-Last Option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4JTZFL/?tag=p-policy-20">Hoont Indoor Flea Trap</a></strong>
The Hoont trap feels noticeably sturdier than many of its competitors. It uses a bright LED light which is energy-efficient and has a very long lifespan, so you won&rsquo;t be replacing bulbs. The construction is robust, making it a great choice if you plan on using the trap for long-term prevention year after year. It’s a durable workhorse that can stand up to the rigors of a busy household.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Budget-Friendly Pick: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NBKKQSZ/?tag=p-policy-20">Easico Flea Trap</a></strong>
If you need to place multiple traps around your home without breaking the bank, the Easico trap is an excellent value. It delivers solid performance using the same light and heat principle but at a more accessible price point. The replacement pads and bulbs are also very affordable, making it a cost-effective solution for ongoing flea monitoring and control.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-word">The Final Word</h3>
<p>A good flea trap is a crucial part of your flea control strategy. To get the best results, place your trap in the areas where you see the most activity—often in pet bedding areas, carpets, or family rooms where people and pets spend the most time. Checking the sticky pad each morning will not only reduce the number of biting adults but will also tell you how well your larger treatment plan is working. It’s a small investment that delivers huge results and invaluable peace of mind.</p>

      <title>Flea Bombs Vs Flea Sprays</title>

      <description>Standing in the pest control aisle? I&amp;#39;ve been there. Here’s my honest, real-world comparison of flea bombs and flea sprays to help you choose the best treatment for your home.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a unique sinking feeling that hits you the moment you realize fleas have invaded your home. It’s a mix of disgust and urgency that sends you straight to the store, standing in the pest control aisle with one mission: to end this <em>now</em>. In your hands, you’ll likely hold the two most common weapons in this war: a <span style="color:red;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054NFWH4/?tag=p-policy-20">flea bomb (or fogger)</a></span> and a can of flea spray. The bomb promises total annihilation, a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; solution. The spray seems more targeted, more controlled. So, which one should you choose?</p>
<p>I’ve been in your shoes, and I can tell you that the choice you make in that moment is critical. One path often leads to lingering frustration and a re-infestation, while the other leads to lasting peace of mind. To truly solve a flea problem, you need to think beyond just killing the adult fleas you see hopping around. The real enemy is the 95% of the infestation you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> see: the eggs and larvae hiding deep in your carpets and furniture. A good home treatment, like the popular <span style="color:red;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JN9H50M/?tag=p-policy-20">Adams Flea &amp; Tick Home Spray</a></span>, is designed to tackle this entire life cycle, which is the secret to winning the war for good. Let’s break down the real-world difference between these two approaches.</p>

<h3 id="the-flea-bomb-a-grenade-that-misses-the-target">The Flea Bomb: A Grenade That Misses the Target</h3>
<p>On paper, the flea bomb seems like the perfect solution. You press a button, leave the house, and come back a few hours later to a flea-free paradise. It’s marketed as a powerful, hands-off approach to pest control.</p>
<p>But here’s the problem I’ve learned the hard way: <strong>flea bombs are fundamentally flawed.</strong></p>
<p>Think of a flea bomb as a grenade. It explodes and sends a cloud of pesticide mist into the air. This mist then slowly settles downwards, coating every exposed surface in the room—the top of your couch, your coffee table, your kitchen counters. It’s great at killing any unlucky fleas that happen to be out in the open.</p>
<p>The issue is that fleas are smart survivors. They don&rsquo;t hang out in the middle of the room. They hide. They live deep within the fibers of your carpet, under the cushions of your sofa, in the back of your closets, and in the tiny cracks along your baseboards. The fog from a flea bomb simply can&rsquo;t penetrate these hidden sanctuaries where the eggs and larvae are developing. So, while you might kill a portion of the adult population, you’re leaving the next generation completely untouched, virtually guaranteeing the problem will return in a few weeks.</p>
<p>On top of being ineffective, flea bombs require a massive amount of prep work and raise significant safety concerns. You have to remove or cover all food, dishes, and pet supplies. You have to evacuate your family and pets for hours. And because the aerosol can be flammable, you have to extinguish all pilot lights. After all that, you&rsquo;re left with a chemical residue on every surface that needs to be wiped down. It’s a lot of hassle for a solution that doesn&rsquo;t even solve the root problem.</p>
<h3 id="the-flea-spray-a-sniper-rifle-for-where-fleas-actually-live">The Flea Spray: A Sniper Rifle for Where Fleas Actually Live</h3>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about flea sprays. If a flea bomb is a grenade, a targeted flea spray is a sniper rifle. It puts the pesticide exactly where you need it and nowhere you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>With a spray, you can directly treat the areas where fleas, eggs, and larvae are actually hiding. You can spray deep into carpets, under furniture, on your pet&rsquo;s bedding (after washing it, of course), and along the baseboards and crevices that foggers can&rsquo;t reach. This targeted approach is immediately more effective because you’re taking the fight directly to the enemy&rsquo;s stronghold.</p>
<p>But the real power of a modern flea spray lies in a key ingredient: an <strong>Insect Growth Regulator (IGR)</strong>.</p>
<p>An IGR is a miracle of science. It doesn&rsquo;t kill adult fleas, but it does something even more important: it acts as a form of birth control for fleas, preventing their eggs from hatching and their larvae from maturing into biting adults. This is how you <strong>break the life cycle</strong>. When you use a spray with an IGR, you&rsquo;re not just killing the fleas of today; you&rsquo;re preventing the fleas of tomorrow, next week, and next month from ever existing. Many of these sprays provide residual protection for up to seven months.</p>
<p>From a safety perspective, you have much more control. You&rsquo;re not filling your entire home with a chemical fog. You apply the product to specific surfaces and, by following the directions to keep pets and kids away until it dries, you can use it responsibly and with peace of mind.</p>
<h3 id="the-verdict-its-no-contest">The Verdict: It&rsquo;s No Contest</h3>
<p>After dealing with this issue myself, my recommendation is strong and clear: <strong>for almost every single home infestation, a high-quality flea spray with an IGR is vastly superior to a flea bomb.</strong></p>
<p>The flea bomb is an outdated technology that sells a promise of convenience but ultimately fails to deliver a real solution. A targeted flea spray is a more effective, safer, and ultimately more permanent way to reclaim your home from these pests.</p>
<p>For most situations, a product like the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JN9H50M/?tag=p-policy-20">Adams Flea &amp; Tick Home Spray</a></strong> is my top recommendation because it contains an IGR and is proven to be effective. If you prefer an all-natural approach and are dealing with a lighter infestation, a product like <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M8GFPXG/?tag=p-policy-20">Wondercide Flea &amp; Tick Spray</a></strong>, which uses essential oils, is a popular and pleasant-smelling alternative.</p>
<p>The only time I would even consider a flea bomb is for a truly catastrophic infestation in an empty room or space, and even then, I would <em>immediately</em> follow it up with a thorough IGR spray treatment to handle the survivors. Don&rsquo;t waste your time, money, and effort on a solution that only solves half the problem. Choose the right tool for the job and get rid of fleas for good.</p>

      <title>How to Check Your Home for Fleas</title>

      <description>Think you might have fleas? This friendly guide walks you through a simple 5-point inspection to find out for sure, starting with the famous &amp;#39;white sock test&amp;#39;.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It starts with a nagging feeling, doesn&rsquo;t it? A tiny black speck you thought you saw jump. A pet that seems to be scratching just a little more than usual. The suspicion that you might have fleas is enough to make anyone&rsquo;s skin crawl. Before you can declare war, you need to be sure. You have to gather intelligence and confirm that the enemy is actually present. The absolute first place to check is the most likely source: <a href="/posts/growing-chrysanthemums-in-your-garden/">your</a> pet. A quick but thorough combing with a specialty tool like a <span style="color:red;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002AQS0I/?tag=p-policy-20">Safari Flea Comb</a></span> will give you your first definitive clue. The fine-toothed metal bristles are designed to trap live fleas and their tell-tale &ldquo;flea dirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what if your pet comes up clean? That doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re in the clear. The majority of a flea population lives in the environment, not on your pet. They hide in your carpets, your furniture, and your pet’s bedding, waiting for their next meal. To find out if you have a larger environmental problem, you need a way to monitor these areas. Setting up a simple, non-toxic device like the <span style="color:red;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000668Z96/?tag=p-policy-20">Victor Flea Trap</a></span> near your pet&rsquo;s favorite sleeping spot is the perfect next step. The gentle warmth and light attract fleas from the surrounding area onto a sticky pad, giving you undeniable proof of an infestation. Finding fleas early is the key to stopping a small issue from exploding into a full-blown nightmare. This guide will walk you through a simple 5-point inspection to find out for sure.</p>

  </div>

<h3 id="your-5-point-inspection-plan-for-fleas">Your 5-Point Inspection Plan for Fleas</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get methodical. By checking these five sneaky hiding spots, you&rsquo;ll know one way or another if you have a flea problem.</p>
<h4 id="1-the-famous-white-sock-test">1. The Famous &ldquo;White Sock Test&rdquo;</h4>
<p>This is the classic, go-to method for a reason—it works, and it’s incredibly simple. Fleas are attracted to three things: warmth, vibration, and carbon dioxide (your breath). When you walk through a room, you&rsquo;re a walking, talking flea magnet. The white socks just make the dark-colored fleas incredibly easy to spot.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how to do it right:</strong> Pull on a pair of clean, white, calf-high socks. Now, walk slowly and deliberately through the areas you suspect might have fleas. Shuffle your feet as you go to create more vibration. Make sure to cover the carpets, area rugs, and especially the spots where your pets love to lounge. Do this for about ten minutes, then go stand in a well-lit area (like your kitchen or bathroom) and closely examine your socks, all the way up to your calves. If fleas are present, you will likely see a few small black or dark reddish-brown specks clinging to the fabric.</p>
<h4 id="2-ground-zero-your-pets-bedding-and-favorite-spots">2. Ground Zero: Your Pet’s Bedding and Favorite Spots</h4>
<p>If you have fleas in your home, it&rsquo;s almost a guarantee that they are living and breeding where your pet sleeps and rests. This is the heart of the infestation. Get a flashlight and get ready to look closely. You&rsquo;re searching for three things: live fleas, &ldquo;flea dirt,&rdquo; and flea eggs.</p>
<p>Live fleas are small, dark, and move incredibly fast, often disappearing into the fabric before you can get a good look. What&rsquo;s often easier to spot is <strong>&ldquo;flea dirt.&rdquo;</strong> This is actually flea feces, and it looks like tiny specks of black pepper scattered on the bedding. To confirm if it&rsquo;s flea dirt or just regular house dust, wipe some of it onto a damp white paper towel. If it dissolves and leaves a reddish-brown smear (from the digested blood), you&rsquo;ve found your proof. Flea eggs are harder to see; they are tiny, oval, and white, often mistaken for dandruff or salt grains.</p>
<h4 id="3-the-flea-paradise-deep-within-your-carpets-and-rugs">3. The Flea Paradise: Deep Within Your Carpets and Rugs</h4>
<p>Your carpets are a flea&rsquo;s best friend. The dense fibers provide the perfect cover for adults, larvae, and eggs, protecting them from light, predators, and even the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>To check your carpets, you need to get on your hands and knees. Use your fingers to part the carpet fibers and look deep down at the base. Pay special attention to the areas where your pets frequently lie down, as this is where the most &ldquo;flea dirt&rdquo; and eggs will fall off their bodies. Also, check the edges of the room along the baseboards, as this is a common place for fleas to hide.</p>
<h4 id="4-the-nursery-along-baseboards-and-in-floor-cracks">4. The Nursery: Along Baseboards and in Floor Cracks</h4>
<p>Fleas are secretive and prefer to lay their eggs in dark, undisturbed areas. The tiny cracks and crevices along your baseboards and between hardwood floor planks are perfect incubation zones.</p>
<p>Take a flashlight and get close to the floor. Carefully inspect the gap where the wall meets the floor, looking for live fleas or flea dirt. If you have hardwood floors, pay close attention to the spaces between the boards, especially in low-traffic corners or under furniture. It&rsquo;s these hidden spots that allow an infestation to persist even when you think you&rsquo;ve treated everything.</p>
<h4 id="5-the-ambush-zone-in-and-under-your-upholstered-furniture">5. The Ambush Zone: In and Under Your Upholstered Furniture</h4>
<p>Your sofa, armchairs, and other upholstered furniture are prime real estate for fleas. They offer warmth, shelter, and plenty of places to hide before they jump onto their next host—you or your pet.</p>
<p>Start by removing all the cushions and pillows. Using a flashlight, inspect all the seams, crevices, and corners of the furniture frame. Don&rsquo;t forget to check the fabric skirts at the bottom of chairs and couches, as well as the dark, protected space underneath the furniture itself. This is a common &ldquo;ambush zone&rdquo; for fleas.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="confirmed-you-have-fleas-heres-the-crucial-next-step">Confirmed You Have Fleas? Here’s the Crucial Next Step.</h3>
<p>Finding adult fleas is one thing; eliminating them completely is another. The real challenge, and the key to winning this fight, is destroying their eggs and larvae. These are notoriously resistant to many common sprays and powders and can lie dormant for weeks, just waiting to hatch and start the cycle all over again.</p>
<p>If you find fleas, the most effective way to kill the <em>entire</em> flea life cycle on contact is with a powerful steam cleaner. While sprays can kill some adult fleas, the superheated steam penetrates deep into carpets, furniture, and pet bedding to kill everything from the adults to the resilient eggs. It&rsquo;s the most effective way to ensure they are gone for good.</p>

      <description>As fleas search for food</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As fleas search for food
or flea dirt
, they&rsquo;ll be attracted by different stimuli to know a fitting host - are thermal and visual the main stimuli for attracting fleas?
<strong>So, are fleas attracted to heat (Thermotaxis)? Yes, over 90% of fleas will be attracted to fleas within 30 minutes but on its own, it has limited effectiveness in host-finding.�</strong>
<strong>Combining various stimuli such as movement, heat, and light (or shadows) will result in a higher attracting response on the fleas.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-are-fleas-attracted-to-heat-thermotaxis">Details: Are Fleas Attracted to Heat? Thermotaxis?</h2>
<p>As noted above, cat fleas will get attracted to their hosts through stimuli and thermal cues or stimuli. Thermotaxis denotes the aspect of repulsion or attraction towards heat.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, cat fleas are considered to be attracted and stimulated by heat or warmth - which means that they&rsquo;re positively thermotactic.</li>
<li>The positive thermotactic response in fleas allows them to location possible hosts andblood meals- this is because fleas&rsquo; hosts will emit some body warmth or heat.
But how do fleas detect heat? The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-have-antennae/">fleas&rsquo; antennae-like organ</a>
will work like some sensory organ. So, the fleas&rsquo; antennae will recognize different cues including heat or warmth.</li>
<li>Studies have reported that <a href="/posts/do-fleas-have-antennae/">flea</a> infestations significantly increase when there is a rise in warmth in the surrounding or heat.
If warm objects are positioned in the fleas&rsquo; environment, the bugs will jump randomly. The warm informs the fleas that there could be a possible host such as cats &amp; dogs.</li>
<li>Naturally, fleas love areas that are warmer. This includes places that have around 65 degrees of temperatures - and thus pets will make excellent hosts with their warmth.
Besides getting a great blood meal supply on the pets like cats &amp; dogs, fleas also enjoy the pet&rsquo;s warmth.</li>
<li>Fleas will use pets to gain entry into your house or apartment. But fleas may also hitch-hike your second-hand furniture or clothing.
When the fleas emerge from the cocoons, they&rsquo;ll start searching for a blood meal. If they don&rsquo;t get some blood meal, the bugs will starve within 1 week.</li>
<li>In the food-searching process, those fleas will identify their suitable hostsusing thermal and visual stimuli- this is simply heat &amp; light.
Recent studies report that when fleas are positioned in a dark area, over 90% of them will jump into the areas with light in just 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Considering lights, standard light will have a lower ability to attract fleas to those green-yellow lights.</li>
<li>Besides, the fleas&rsquo; attraction to heat or light will increase if the light source is turned on plus then off and on in quick succession - this mimics the movements of a flea host.
Further, flea traps that utilize intermittent lighting tend to attract &amp; trap more (about 82%) of these bugs.
The bugs will jump towards the heat source - as they&rsquo;ll get attracted to temperatures around 40C (104F).
However, they&rsquo;ll still get attracted by temperatures rising to highs of 50C (122F); and thus the fleas could hitchhike a number of hosts due to variation in temperatures that attract them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heat-alone-wont-promote-fleas-host-finding-habits">Heat Alone won&rsquo;t Promote fleas&rsquo; Host-Finding Habits</h2>
<p>Despite that heat or warmth will attract fleas, this cue (alone) won&rsquo;t work to attract the bugs towards their suitable hosts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs will orient their bodies to some warm gadget and aim to jump, but they&rsquo;ll only jump if there are other stimuli in the environment.
For example,
flea-control gadgets like flea traps
that use just heat as their sole stimulus will not attract the bugs.</li>
<li>Further, for the flea trap using light, including some heat will not boost its fleas&rsquo; attracting performance and host-detecting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fleas-abandon-their-hosts-with-low-temperatures">Fleas Abandon their Hosts with Low Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fleas will remain on their chosen host after they&rsquo;ve landed on such animals. However, fleas will leave that host once it&rsquo;s dying or dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bugs learn this if the body temperature of the host animals starts to drop.</li>
<li>Thus, the bugs will hitchhike another host or animal that is warm.
Further, fleas may jump onto some predator&rsquo;s body after such an animal has killed a flea-infested prey.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-emerged-flea-adults-on-hosts">Pre-emerged Flea Adults on Hosts</h2>
<p>Pre-emerged adult fleas will respond positively to heat as an attraction cue.</p>
<ul>
<li>After these younglings are adequately developed, they&rsquo;ll stay in<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-cocoons-look-like/">cocoons</a>up to when they detect some host.
The young fleas will be in the quiescent stage for about 5 months - they&rsquo;ll mainly be triggered by physical pressure and heat such as from a
fleas&rsquo; steam cleaner
.</li>
<li>The occurrence of pressure and heat will denote to the bugs that there is some nearby warm-blooded host.
The fleas emerge from those cocoons also due to the human breath that is warm. Another gadget I recommend for triggering the fleas&rsquo; emergence is the flea vacuum.</li>
<li>Will fleas be attracted to cold or heat? Well, fleas will flourish in humid and warm environments - which is about 75F - with their activity slowing down in winter.
Thus, during winter, the house and apartment will offer an appropriate habitat for fleas to grow especially if there are
<em>household</em>
pets like cats &amp; dogs.
For outdoor spaces, fleas will love humid, moist, &amp;
shady areas such as the yard or lawn
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on whether fleas are attracted to heat, YES fleas will be attracted by fleas but it must not be the only cue or stimuli.
Fleas prefer to respond positively to a combination of various stimuli including movement, heat, and light.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best flea <a href="/posts/do-flea-collars-work/">collar</a> for cats, you can consider things like effectiveness, safety, duration of protection, and ease of use.</p>
<p>These factors play a crucial role in ensuring your cat remains flea-free and comfortable while wearing the collar. Related:
Spot-on flea treatments
.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-effectiveness"><strong>1. Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>The primary function of a flea collar is to repel and kill fleas. Some products, like the
<strong>Seresto Flea and Tick Collar</strong>
, offer nearly instant protection by starting to kill fleas within 24 hours of application.
Others, like the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B8CG5NK/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Hartz UltraGuard Plus</strong></a>
, may take a few days to reach full effectiveness but can still provide long-lasting relief. When considering effectiveness, its essential to look at
how quickly the collar starts working and how long it continues to protect your cat.</p>
<h3 id="2-safety"><strong>2. Safety</strong></h3>
<p>Safety is paramount when choosing a flea collar. Some collars, such as the
<em>Rolf Club 3D FLEA Collar</em>
, are designed with non-toxic materials that ensure your cats safety while wearing them.</p>
<p>Other options, like the
<em>Soresto Flea and Tick Collar</em>
, include a breakaway feature that prevents strangulation in case the collar gets caught. Its important to ensure the collar you choose is both safe for your cats health and minimizes the risk of accidents.</p>
<h3 id="3-duration-of-protection"><strong>3. Duration of Protection</strong></h3>
<p>The duration of protection varies among flea collars. Some products, like the
<em>Seresto Flea and Tick Collar for Cats</em>
, provide up to 8 months of continuous protection, making them an excellent option for long-term flea control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, collars like the
<em>Hartz UltraGuard Plus Flea &amp; Tick Collar</em>
offer up to 7 months of protection, which is slightly less but still substantial. When choosing a flea collar, consider how long you want the protection to last, as this will impact how often you need to replace the collar.</p>
<h3 id="4-ease-of-use"><strong>4. Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p>Ease of use is another critical factor to consider. Some collars, such as the
<em>Bayer Seresto Flea and Tick Collar for Cats</em>
, are easy to apply and adjust, ensuring a comfortable fit for your cat.</p>
<p>Others, like the
<em>Adams Flea and Tick Collar for Cats</em>
, come with adjustable sizes, making them versatile for cats of different sizes. Ensuring the collar is easy to put on and adjust will make the process less stressful for both you and your cat.</p>
<h3 id="5-water-resistance"><strong>5. Water Resistance</strong></h3>
<p>Water resistance is an important feature, especially for cats that enjoy outdoor activities or may encounter wet conditions. Some flea collars, like the
<em>Seresto Flea and Tick Collar for Cats</em>
, are designed to be water-resistant, meaning they continue to protect your cat even
if they get wet
.</p>
<p>Others, like the
<em>Rolf Club 3D FLEA Collar</em>
, may not be fully waterproof but can still withstand minor exposure to moisture. If your cat is often outdoors or exposed to water, choosing a water-resistant collar is crucial.</p>

      <description>In this post, Ive reviewed the</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, Ive reviewed the
best flea combs
for cats.
Flea Combs are safer and simple flea control solutions when liked to
flea spray
, boric acid, or flea shampoo.
With these combs, you can easily
find and remove <a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-use-a-flea-comb/">fleas</a>
, flea dirt, and eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, the combs are non-chemical flea control methods and suitable for kittens and puppies with sensitive or damaged skin.
**Summary: **
To stop scratching and itching in your cats &amp; dogs due to fleas, check these flea combs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-safari-flea-comb--double-row-tines-metal-flea-comb"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002RJMAK/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Safari Flea Comb  Double Row Tines (Metal) Flea Comb</a></h2>
<p>Top on the list of the best flea combs for cats and dogs is the safari flea comb. Initially, I noted that my cat was
dandruffy and scabby in addition to having fleas. In addition to pre-brushing the cats fur, I recommend the Safari
Flea Comb to search and remove
fleas.</p>
<p>Single vs. Double row teeth Flea Combs?</p>
<p>If you have your or orphaned kitten that could be too small to employ topical treatments, then the Safari Flea Comb will come in handy. I noted that I was required to run just a few
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">flea comb strokes through the cats</a>
fur before some fleas started jumping off.</p>
<p>Equally, the flea comb is effective for both flaky and dry skin. Youll need to put extra combing around the
cats tail base, nape of neck, and ears
. The flea combs arrest both the adult fleas, smaller-sized fleas, and flea dirt too. The Safari flea comb is suitable for both long and
short hair
. However, be sure to remove all tangles and mats that might break the combs teeth.</p>
<p>On durability, the Safari Flea Comb has a hard handle and durable body that makes it worth its price and hence will be usable with multiple kitties over time. Its double tines make the flea comb suitable for removing even the tiniest fleas. In addition to searching for fleas, this flea comb is great for identifying coat and skin problems. Just like all other flea combs, youll need to dip it into the soapy water between combing strokes. However, youll need first to remove all the hair tangles on your cats or dogs coat.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The teeth of the Safari Flea comb wont bend if you use it after brushing the cats fur using the regular human hair comb to remove all the tangles or knots. However, if you need to do extensive brushing, you should use a de-shedding comb  particularly for pets with long hair.</dt>
<dt>+</dt>
<dt><strong>Pros</strong></dt>
<dd>Good after using
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-shampoo-for-cats/">flea shampoos</a>
and powders, Easy to control with its great Contoured, does not irritate flea bites, has metal teeth, easy-to-grip handle.</dd>
<dt><strong>Cons</strong></dt>
<dd>Might not work well with long hair.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="2-honbay-flea-and-lice-comb--double-sided-plastic-comb"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K14DKA6/?tag=p-policy-20">2. Honbay Flea and Lice Comb  Double Sided Plastic Comb</a></h2>
<p>Hornby Flea and Lice Comb come second on the list and can comb most of your small pets. However, I noted that this one lacked a handle, unlike the Safari Flea comb. Hence it is a little difficult to use.</p>
<p>But, I loved the pretty pack of colored flea combs.</p>
<p>However, I loved that the flea comb had two sets of teeth of different widths  narrow and wide. The plastic teeth tend to electrify the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-drops-for-cats/">cats hair and thus assists in removing the fleas</a>
. However, compared to metal teeth, the plastic teeth are less strong, and hence the flea comb has lower durability  could twist or bend.</p>
<p>While you can use both sets for flea combing, the side with wider teeth is also suitable for general grooming. Its tines are built from plastic and will be easy on your cats skin  particularly if it has broken skin or flea bites that would cause discomfort during rough flea combing.</p>
<p>Note: Flea combs with a single row &amp; longer teeth are better for removing fleas from pets with long hair. You can also opt for an Electronic Flea Comb.</p>
<p>The double-sided plastic combs come if four colorful pieces that are also greatly priced. The bright color will help you to easily spot any fleas or flea dirt after each combing stroke. For additional comfort, the plastic
flea combs are soft on your cats
coat. Since the comb has only one row of teeth  that are also long teeth-, itll be easy to comb cats with long hair.
**+ The Good: **
Effective and gentle touch, easy flea comb to use, double-sided teeth, great color selection (4 options), great for pets with short or long hair.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Cons</strong></dt>
<dd>Plastic
might bend or break and h
as no handle.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="3-oster-animal-care-comb--suitable-ergonomic-design"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IMJ0286/?tag=p-policy-20">3. Oster Animal Care Comb  Suitable ergonomic design</a></h2>
<p>Oster Animal Care Comb is considered a highly ergonomic flea comb to remove fleas from dogs and cats. Like the Safari comb above, the Oster Animal Care Comb has metal teeth durable and will remove
fleas even in dense cat
coats. Equally, the comb is suitable for both long and short-haired cats.</p>
<p>Despite being made of metal, the combs teeth do not have sharp points and easily remove fleas from the skin while not hurting it. Further, the comb effectively removes some sections of the loose undercoat (that arises during summer) on your cat. This leaves your cat looking beautiful and welcoming.</p>
<p>The combs teeth can turn 90 degrees from your cats skin, which also protects the cat during the flea combing process. Therefore, the flea comb will not dig into your cats skin like other metal teeth in different combs. Dont be fooled by the metal teeth on this flea comb  its lightweight and thus easy to carry around and use.
<strong>+ The Good:</strong>
Has short and thin metal teeth, great for long and short hair, robust design, is slightly curved to ease the combing process.
** The Bad: **
Lacks a handle, thus challenging to use.</p>
<h2 id="4-pet-republique-dog--cat-flea-comb"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MF7SBG2/?tag=p-policy-20">4. Pet Republique Dog &amp; Cat Flea Comb</a></h2>
<p>Pet Republique Cat
Flea Comb is designed from flexible tines with top reliability in removing adult fleas, flea dirt, and dandruff flakes. The design of the comb prevents the occurrence of stray hair from your cat.</p>
<p>Considering ergonomics, the flea comb has sinking patterns and thus easy to hold while flea combing your cat.</p>
<p>The Pet Republique flea comb will work excellently with hair that has shedding, matting, knots, and long fur. Its bristles are designed from a sturdy and hard material, and thus they wont damage your cats skin or coat.</p>
<p>Pet Republique also sponsors the protection of abandoned cats and dogs  for the lovers of charity work or worthy causes.
**+ The Good: **
Easier to grip, ergonomic design, and top-quality pins
** The Bad: **
Relatively pricey</p>

.
With a multitude of�options and solutions to choose from, we can help guide you through the process�so you can identify the right choice for you and your pet.
Luckily, the market today has a lot to offer, and they have massively reduced the use of harsh chemicals so they wont give off a harsh toxic odor or damage your hands nor your pet&rsquo;s skin.
When you have a flea invasion, you may feel like you want to mix every solution you can encounter while the infestation takes over your house. It can irritate not just your pet, other pets, and your family.
It is important to have a little insight into the flea&rsquo;s life cycle to best prepare and know how you can best prevent any further spreading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anadult�flea can produce up to fifty eggsper day, making it crucial to stop these.</li>
<li>Pests as soon as possible. They aresmall and jump, making them hard to spot.
The fleas survive through blood, with the new eggs hatching within six days. A�single
flea can produce two thousand eggs
in its lifetime.</li>
<li>The eggs tend to hatch indoors best nestled in carpets, soft furnishings, and anywhere that provides warmth.</li>
<li>While you have the heating on during winter, this can also encourage fleas to produceoutdoor, fleas hatch in shaded areas and sandy pits.
The worst part about a flea survival tactic is that it can remain in a cocoon for up to three hundred and fifty days until it hatches, waiting for the perfect conditions for best survival.
They wait for body heat and movement.
How�you can identify if your pet has
fleas is a lot easier than getting rid
of�them, unfortunately.
Check your pet&rsquo;s coat by eye and by

comb and look for scales and bite marks on your pet&rsquo;s skin. You may also
Have some
bite marks on your skin
also. You can rub aloe vera on, which will soothe the bite.
Check your bedding if your pet sleeps near you for
flea eggs
and�clean these to prevent spreading.</li>
<li>Same with any bedding that your pets may be�sleeping on.</li>
<li>The most difficult stage to tackle a flea cycle is when the flea is in an immature state.
Again by ensuring your pet&rsquo;s
bedding is washed, you can immediately improve your chances of getting rid of fleas
. You can also apply flea shampoo regularly.
We suggest vacuuming the carpets whenever you can, too, which will remove any eggs or clean floorboards with eucalyptus.
Just be careful to dispose of the
vacuum�bag properly
; otherwise, you may risk the fleas hatching in the bag, and then you have another problem!</li>
<li>In terms of medications, you can provide to your pet; you can try flea bombs, which can be tricky for you if you want to get into your house any time soon.</li>
<li>It is also very toxic, and the smell can linger for quite some time afteryou have used it.
It will work well if you have a terrible and stubborn problem with fleas, but we would only recommend this as a last resort and not to apply directly to your pet, and it can also kill fish and birds.</li>
<li>You will have to remain off.The premises, while the flea bomb is activated too, and use external assistance for this. It is a more expensive option.</li>
<li>The spot-on treatments, which are usually applied behind your pet&rsquo;s ear or neck area, are also a popular option.
We have found that these can be difficult to apply, especially if your cat is particularly squirmy.
The treatment doesnt seem to target a full area, and you will need to reapply regularly on larger animals. With cats, in particular, they will room themselves and obliterate the ointment.
Oral solutions can be an option but do not work for long-term use, and the fleas can jump right back on your pet&rsquo;s coat once the pill is not potent any longer.
Pill and oral medications are an option but hard too often; it is hard to medicate if you are an owner and to ensure that your pet has swallowed the treatment fully.
Often the pet has a reaction to the pill and wont swallow the tablet or throw it up after mixing it in with their usual cat or dog food.
You�can stay ahead of a flea attack and keep your cupboards topped with the right�treatment and have enough so you can treat your pet all year round.
Shampoos are a great alternative to use, and vets and manufacturers have spent a lot of time developing products that wont damage your pet or the environment.
The solutions not only stop fleas in their cycle, but they will also care for your pet&rsquo;s coat, not give off any toxic smells or damage your hands while you are applying the solutions.
Most�of the shampoos are reasonably priced and also come in varying sizes and�smells. They are widely available and have been tried and tested by so many�animal lovers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you have young children who may contact your pet, this may not be the best option for you as the solution is toxic, and they may touch their mouth or eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some pets have also been reactive to this type of treatment, especially if they suffer from hair loss or skin irritation.</li>
<li>The�solution isnt as chemically friendly as other alternatives nor as effective.
We know it can be expensive caring for your pet, and fleas are pests that can keep coming back and attacking.
It is hassle buying products that don&rsquo;t work, and you feel trapped in the pest-ridden household.
Shampoo your pet frequently in the solution, and comb and clean bedding will keep your
home safe�and fleas
at bay.</li>

Also, try to buy a spray that you can dilute in small quantity but end up using in large areas. For instance, if you can use 32 0z on 13,000 square feet, then that is a highly effective product.</p>
<h3 id="4-check-the-reputation-of-the-dealers">4. Check the Reputation of the Dealers</h3>
<p>Currently, many companies claim to manufacture the best pesticide, but you cant be so sure by reading from their website. To be certain about this, look for sites that offer a genuine review of those companies.
Moreover, you can get information from the people that have used their products before. Some companies do not use the right procedures to make insecticides; therefore, they end up selling low-quality products that will not meet your expectations.
Avoid buying products from companies that do not share enough information about the products that they sell.</p>
<h3 id="5-check-the-price">5. Check the Price</h3>
<p>With the price of the product, you can tell whether a product is effective. However, you should not buy products with inflated prices, since this might not imply that they are right.
Reliable companies sell products at reasonable prices since they are not looking to exploit buyers. Shop online, make a list of products that you consider buying, and compares their prices. If possible, save money for going for the ones on offer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this list, we have indicated the best flea spray for the yard. However, you need to note that they work in different ways.
Therefore, you need to pick the one that would best serve your needs. Always make sure to follow the right direction to avoid wasting messing up.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing the best flea treatment for dogs, you can consider things like the product&rsquo;s effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and your dog&rsquo;s specific needs. Selecting the right flea treatment can keep your dog comfortable and protect them from harmful parasites.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-effectiveness-against-fleas-and-ticks"><strong>1. Effectiveness Against Fleas and Ticks</strong></h3>
<p>Some products, like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002J1FOO/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Frontline Plus</strong></a>
, are renowned for their ability to eliminate both fleas and ticks at various life stages.</p>
<p>This broad-spectrum effectiveness ensures your dog is protected from infestation and the diseases these parasites carry. Look for treatments that kill adult fleas and also target larvae and eggs, preventing future outbreaks.</p>
<h3 id="2-safety-for-your-dog"><strong>2. Safety for Your Dog</strong></h3>
<p>Some flea treatments, such as
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00061MSGM/?tag=p-policy-20"><strong>Advantage II for Dogs</strong></a>
, are designed specifically for dogs, ensuring that the ingredients are safe and non-toxic when used as directed.</p>
<p>Consider your dog&rsquo;s age, size, and any pre-existing health conditions when selecting a treatment. Puppies or dogs with sensitive skin may require milder formulations, while stronger treatments might be suitable for
larger, healthy dogs
.</p>
<h3 id="3-ease-of-application-">**3. Ease of Application **</h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>NexGard</strong>
, come in the form of a tasty chewable tablet, making administration simple and stress-free, especially for dogs that resist topical treatments.</p>
<p>Others, like
<strong>Seresto</strong>
, are available as collars that provide continuous protection for up to 8 months. Consider what method your dog is most comfortable with, as this will make regular flea prevention easier to maintain.</p>
<h3 id="4-duration-of-protection"><strong>4. Duration of Protection</strong></h3>
<p>Some flea treatments, such as the
<strong>Seresto Flea and Tick Collar</strong>
, offer extended protection for up to eight months, reducing the need for
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6081898/">frequent reapplications</a>
.</p>
<p>On the other hand,
<strong>Capstar</strong>
provides immediate relief but needs to be used more frequently. Consider how long you want the treatment to last and how often you&rsquo;re willing to reapply or administer it.</p>
<h3 id="5-cost-effectiveness"><strong>5. Cost-Effectiveness</strong></h3>
<p>Some treatments, like
**PetArmor Plus **
with
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671438/">fipronil/(S)-methoprene</a>
, provide a budget-friendly option while still offering effective protection against fleas and ticks.</p>
<p>Balancing cost with effectiveness is crucial, especially if you have
multiple pets
or are looking for long-term treatment. It&rsquo;s important to evaluate whether the price reflects the quality and duration of protection you need for your dog.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="igrs-and-flea-control---selecting-the-best-igr">IGRs and Flea Control - Selecting the Best IGR</h2>
<p>There are 2 major classifications of IGRs for fleas, based on</p>
<ol>
<li>The active ingredient</li>
<li>Added chemicals like knockdowns and synergists
<strong>1. (S)-Hydroprene</strong>
The active ingredient in Gentrol is
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/hydropregen.pdf">(S)-Hydroprene</a>
. This chemical has been found to work for killing both fleas, moths, beetles, and cockroaches.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The knockdown in Gentrol has been found to work for killing both adult fleas and their larvae.</li>
<li>This IGR can be used on carpets, upholstery, cracks and crevices, non-food areas where pets are present indoors only.
<strong>2. Pyriproxifen</strong>
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyriprogen.html">Pyriproxifen</a>
is another IGR for fleas that are applied directly to your dogs and cats.</li>
<li>This chemical has been found to work for killing larval stages of fleas, as well as moths, cockroaches, beetles, and ants.</li>
<li>The knockdown in this product has also proven useful against adult fleas indoors only on carpets or upholstery with no food present.
It can be used outdoors if pets are not around but it must stay dry when applied outside because rain and direct sunlight will affect its effectiveness.
<strong>3. Dinotefuran</strong>
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/TOOLS/PNAI/pnaishow.php?id=29">Dinotefuran</a>
is classified as a
<a href="https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/what-is-a-neonicotinoid/"><strong>neonicotinoid</strong></a>
as it&rsquo;ll damage the fleas nerve synapses&rsquo; receptors in the CNS. This is an insecticide, not an IGR.
Sentinel is a fast-acting product that works as an adulticide, and its residual effect will last for about 3 months.
<strong>3. Methoprene</strong>
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/methogen.html">Methoprene</a>
is available in either r-methoprene or s-methoprene and it&rsquo;s a good choice for fleas because of its low toxicity to humans, pets, and wildlife.
S-methoprene works like an IGR; it&rsquo;s sprayed around on the carpets or upholstery.</li>
<li>This product should be used as soon as possible to prevent new eggs from hatching.</li>
<li>If you choose this option it&rsquo;s important not to let it dry out because rain will wash the chemical away before it has been able to activate.
<strong>4. Prallethrin</strong>
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/180.545">Prallethrin</a>
is an insecticide from the
<a href="http://www.npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf"><strong>pyrethroid</strong></a>
family and it&rsquo;s often used alongside an IGR.
Prallethrin is a chemical generally used for the control of food-contaminating and nuisance insects like ticks, fleas, roaches, and
ants
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Selecting the best IGR for fleas requires careful consideration of various factors, including effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and environmental impact. Products like NyGuard IGR, Precor IGR, and Martin&rsquo;s IGR each offer unique benefits that make them suitable for different situations.</p>
<p>By evaluating your specific needs and the conditions of your environment, you can choose an IGR that provides long-lasting, safe, and effective flea control, ensuring a pest-free home.</p>

embedded pests-in-the-winter/)
.</p>
<p>Regular vacuuming with the right machine can remove up to 30% of larvae and 60% of <a href="/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/">flea</a> eggs from carpets, significantly disrupting their life cycle.�We&rsquo;ve evaluated dozens of models based on these criteria to bring you the top 5 vacuums specifically designed to
combat flea infestations
.</p>
<h2 id="top-9-best-vacuums-for-fleas-in-2025">Top 9 Best Vacuums for Fleas in 2025</h2>
<h3 id="1-dyson-ball-animal-3-best-overall-flea-vacuum"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B75Q388N?tag=p-policy-20">1. Dyson Ball Animal 3 (Best Overall Flea Vacuum)</a></h3>
<p>The Dyson Ball Animal 3 stands as our top recommendation for complete flea eradication. Its�306 AW suction power�(air watts) creates enough force to pull fleas from deep within carpet fibers and upholstery.</p>
<p>The self-adjusting cleaner head automatically adapts its height to maintain optimal contact with different floor surfaces, from thick carpets to hardwoods, ensuring consistent flea removal across your entire home.</p>
<p>What truly sets this model apart is its�whole-machine HEPA filtration system. Unlike vacuums where only the final filter is HEPA-rated, the Dyson Ball Animal 3 maintains HEPA-standard filtration throughout the entire airflow path.</p>
<p>This captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns - including flea eggs that measure about 0.5 mm - preventing them from being recirculated into your home&rsquo;s air.</p>
<p>The tangle-free turbine tool is particularly effective at
removing flea eggs
from pet bedding and furniture with its counter-rotating brushes that prevent hair wrap while agitating surfaces.</p>

<p>The�motorized brush roll�features stiff bristles that dig into carpet fibers to dislodge flea eggs, while the�swivel steering�allows you to maneuver around furniture legs and other obstacles where fleas often hide.</p>
<p>At just 14 pounds, it&rsquo;s significantly lighter than many upright models, making frequent vacuuming sessions less strenuous.</p>

<p>This model comes with the SEB-228 Electro Plus brush, which uses an electrically-driven beater bar that vibrates at high frequency to shake flea eggs loose from carpet fibers.</p>
<p>The AirClean Sealed System ensures no particles escape during operation or disposal - when you remove the bag, it automatically seals shut to contain the captured pests.�At just�64 decibels, it&rsquo;s quiet enough to use even when pets are present, reducing stress for noise-sensitive animals.</p>

around furniture and obstacles
.</p>
<p>With a specialized pet hair tool, this vacuum is ideal for cleaning areas where fleas are likely to be present. The washable filter is another eco-friendly feature that helps improve air quality by trapping dust, fleas, and other particles.</p>
<p>The Bissell CleanView is specifically designed for pet owners battling both hair and flea problems. Its tangle-free brush roll incorporates alternating rows of stiff and soft bristles that effectively remove flea eggs without becoming clogged with pet hair.</p>
<p>The scatter-free technology uses a combination of suction and brush design to prevent flea eggs from being kicked up into the air during vacuuming.</p>
<p>This model features a�HEPA filtration system�that traps flea allergens and a�Febreze odor-eliminating filter�to help control the musty smell that often accompanies flea infestations.</p>
<h3 id="5-irobot-roomba-j7-best-robotic-vacuum-for-flea-maintenance"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094NYHTMF?tag=p-policy-20">5. iRobot Roomba j7+ (Best Robotic Vacuum for Flea Maintenance)</a></h3>

<p>Its�high-efficiency filter�captures 99% of pollen, mold, and flea eggs, while the�dual rubber brushes�are designed to resist hair tangles while agitating surfaces to dislodge pests.</p>
<p>The�smart mapping technology�allows the Roomba to learn your home&rsquo;s layout and focus on flea hotspots like pet resting areas. Its�automatic dirt disposal�feature holds up to 60 days of debris in the clean base, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to handle potentially flea-infested dust bins.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-borax-kill-fleas"><strong>How does Borax Kill Fleas?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong>
As a powder, Borax has no smell and can control fleas by dehydrating them. The borax powder breaks the fleas exoskeletons and enters their body, which leads to dehydration and death.
<strong>Method 2:</strong>
As the flea larvae hatch, Borax dehydrates the fleas outer tissues and kills them. Therefore, Borax stops the flea from hatching.
<strong>Method 3:</strong>
Also, Borax contaminates the food preserves for the flea larvae. The larvae feed on the contaminated food (mainly droppings by adult fleas) and get ripped to death.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-borax-for-fleas-in-yard--lawn"><strong>How to use Borax for fleas in Yard &amp; Lawn</strong></h2>
<p>What youll require to control fleas in your lawn:
<strong>Borax powder, salt, sprinklers or water hose, and diatomaceous earth. But you can also use the�</strong>
Best Flea Spray for Yard
.
<strong>Precautions:�</strong>
Wear
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYMRZEI/?tag=p-policy-20">gloves</a>
and cover your face using a dust protector. The borax powder can cause significant throat and skin irritation if you do not take safety precautions.
First: Clear your Lawn or Yard -
Remove any obstacles such as containers and movable furniture. This will make it easier to apply the Borax on your lawn.
<strong>Step 1: Choose a Dry Day and week</strong>
Borax will be useful in treating fleas when there are low moisture levels in your garden. Therefore, treat your yard when there is no rain or any rain forecast in that week. Also, turn off your water sprinkler system.
<strong>Step 2: �Mix Borax, diatomaceous earth, and salt.</strong>
To achieve the highest effectiveness, mix one part of two parts of Borax and diatomaceous earth with one part of salt.
<strong>Step 3: �Sprinkle borax on your lawn</strong>
Ready? Go! Sprinkle the borax mixture on your lawn using a hand trowel. You will need to reach all the corners of your yard and cover it maximally on the surface.
Also, ensure to maintain the dry atmosphere in your yard 2-3 days after the borax application. The time allowance will allow the Borax to dehydrate the fleas, thus killing them.
**Step 4: Spread the Borax **
Use a tool such as a rake to spread the Borax on the yard to ensure that the powder gets to all the plants and grass. To avoid poisoning and contamination, ensure that no human being or animal steps in the yard for about 2-3 days. Note that if your pets ingest the borax mixture, they might get poisoned.
<strong>Step 5: Water the Yard</strong>
After 2-3 days, water the yard to wash away the borax moisture. Check whether there are signs of
live fleas
, and if you find any, repeat the treating process. Always ensure to repeat the process once after 15 days to make sure the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-eggs-look-like/">fleas and their eggs</a>
are all killed.
In addition to treating your yard, you will need to treat your house using the

<h2 id="is-borax-safe-for-cats-and-dogs-pets"><strong>Is borax safe for cats and dogs (Pets)?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>First:�</strong>
Did you know there is a difference between Borax and boric acid powders? Most pet owners use the above terms interchangeably, which could lead to dangerous outcomes if one is not keen on the one they use on their dog or cat.
It is essential to know which one, between Borax and boric acid, is the recommended natural flea treatment option. You should also be aware of the safety precautions you should take while using Borax to treat fleas on your cat.</p>
<h2 id="borax-vs-boric-acid-powders-which-is-safer">Borax vs. boric acid powders: which is safer?</h2>
<p>Both Borax and boric acid powders are derived from boron. Notably, Borax has mainly been used for glazing and welding and also for pharmaceutical purposes.
As a drug product, Borax is known to act as a fungicide and antiseptic and is utilized to heal eye infections. Boron exists in nature is made up of boron, sodium, and oxygen. However, boric acid is made from Borax mixed with an acid. Both Borax and boric acid can be used to treat pest infections.
**However: **
You should note that Borax is a safer and natural alternative when compared to boric acid. Borax is
safe and not harmful to the human skin or pets
. On the contrary, Borax raptures the fleas skin, absorbs its body moisture and kills it.
Also, Borax has a crystalline structure that allows it to slice the fleas internal organs and thus kills both larvae and adult fleas.
**Note: **
Since Borax is naturally derived from boron, it is considered less toxic to your dog, cat and safer in treating a flea infestation. However, ensure to follow all the product label instructions to avoid accidents.
<strong>Other uses of Borax Powder</strong>
<strong>1: Borax for ants, moths, and cockroaches</strong>
Apart from just treating fleas, Borax can treat other insects like moths and ants. You will need to sprinkle Borax in the cabinets and storage areas. Also, Borax will be useful in
treating bed bugs
, very troublesome insects.
<strong>2: Borax to kill fungus</strong>
Do you have a fungus problem in your house? It is time you tried Borax! Fungus and molds require wet atmospheres to grow. Borax will dry the various surfaces and thus prevent them from increasing.
**3: Borax weed killer **
Borax will effectively kill weeds around your home and on the lawn. You will require only to sprinkle some borax on the weeds. Further, Borax will not harm your plants and grass. However, treat the weeds in sections if you have a big lawn.
<strong>4: Borax for clothes</strong>
Is your detergent very useful? Well, if not, you should try Borax as it is a safe detergent for your clothes. In addition to making your clothes brighter, Borax will also make them shine.
<strong>5: Borax used as a home cleaner</strong>
If you need to clean house objects and surfaces, Borax is an excellent choice. It is quick and tough on stains and dirt without the need to use too much effort.</p>
<h2 id="best-borax-substitute-diatomaceous-earth-powered"><strong>Best Borax Substitute: Diatomaceous Earth Powered</strong></h2>
<p>The borax alternative for killing flea naturally is Diatomaceous Earth.
Diatomaceous Earth
(DE) has razor-sharp edges, which cut the fleas outs shells and absorb their body fluid.
Diatomaceous earth remains the sea and wetland algae, particularly a type of hard-shelled phytoplankton or plankton. Similar to Borax, DE is mined from underground, and it is a natural
pest control
method. Later, the DE powder is crushed into an excellent powder.
Equally, DE is considered a safe
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-cats-get-fleas-in-the-winter/">flea prevention</a>
alternative to Borax. If you purchase DE that is labeled food-grade, you can use it to deworm humans and animals.
It will take DE about 24-72 hours to kill the fleas in your home. The DE powder will also destroy any other fleas that will emerge from their cocoons within that time.</p>

      <title>Can Cats Get Fleas in the Winter</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drier regions of the Midwest and Southwest have a &ldquo;flea season&rdquo; in some months of the year. But in balmy states such as Florida, fleas are highly active and reproduce throughout the year.
So, its no brainer that one reader asked: Can cats get fleas in the winter regardless of my region?
<strong>The simple answer is YES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>But, cats have lower chances of getting fleas during winter since fleas remain dormant in this season. However, the warm environment in the house (due to central heating) allows
fleas to stay
active even during the cold season and thus attack cats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="warm-blooded-hosts-cats-in-winter">Warm-blooded hosts (Cats) in Winter</h2>
<p><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jsilver/Silverman%20et%20al%202581.pdf">Silverman</a>
states that snow (freezing temperatures - over a long time) will kill all fleas&rsquo; life stages. But adult
fleas will live in the warm-blooded hosts
. During winter, fleas will have longer life cycles.
As part of your general flea control in your home, it&rsquo;s essential to flea treat your cat (and other pets) even during winter. Ensure to treat all the pet bedding and toys inside and outside the house, mainly using vet-approved flea control solutions.
Notably, flea treating the cats will prevent diseases such as anemia caused by severe blood loss (from flea bites) and skin problems. However, as noted earlier, fleas will have a longer life cycle during winter. Therefore, it&rsquo;s critical to be vigilant in the bug control efforts.</p>
<h2 id="temperature">Temperature</h2>
<p>Fleas show top activity
and reproduction at temperatures between 70-85 degrees range.
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.621.743&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Michael Dryden</a>
states that fleas will die when the temperature falls under 30.2 degrees Fahrenheit for over five consecutive days.
The optimum temperature for fleas is 70-85 degrees Fahrenheit. However, fleas can also live in warmer or cooler temperatures. Notably, most fleas will be seen between May and September, which are summer and spring.
If the temperature drops below the freezing point for some consecutive days, the adult fleas will not survive. But the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/">flea eggs</a>
, the larvae, and pupa would not die during the cold winter weather. However, the fleas pre-adult stages would remain dormant during winter and begin serious activity when the temperature rises.</p>
<h2 id="humidity">Humidity</h2>
<p>Fleas will thrive at a 70 percent humidity level. Moisture is critical for fleas&rsquo; survival because it helps the eggs to hatch and the other stages to grow over the flea life cycle. Fleas will develop, hatch, and survive at temperatures only at a temperature at or above 13C (55.4F).
Flea pre-adult stages will not survive when the Relative humidity drops below 50%. Therefore, the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-look-like/">fleas larvae</a>
will opt to hide under the�carpet fibers,�moist and�dark places.</p>
<h2 id="flea-treating-your-cat-during-winter"><strong>Flea treating your cat during winter</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Here are the steps to follow while treating fleas (killing or preventing) on your cat.�</strong>
1.
<em>Bathe your cat using an anti-flea shampoo</em>
. Ensure you bathe the cats head, under the body, legs, and tail tool. When your feline friend is all dried  now using the topical anti-flea drop such as Advantage or Frontline on the neck region, specifically on areas that the cat cannot lick.
Repeat this process 1-2 times every six weeks. However, change the shampoo and flea drop brands each time since the flea may grow resistant to the chemicals. You can also flea treat your house using suitable flea foggers.
2.
<em>Vacuum your house,</em>
including paced under the bed, carpet, and sofa - and clean the drain. The first
vacuuming event will clean
about 60 percent of the fleas. However, continue vacuuming your house for one week to clan all the critter, adult fleas, eggs, and larvae. Notably, vacuuming creates strong vibrations that will eject both the adult and the pre-adult fleas from their hiding places and cocoons, respectively.
3. Get a suitable floor cleaner and mop floors in the house. Notably, choose a floor cleaner that the most pungent smell  this will repel the fleas. However, ensure take care of the cleaner you decide if there are small children (maybe those babies) in the house.
4. Clean clothing, bedding, and pillow covers in the washing machine (with a strong detergent) and dryer. Ensure that the washing machine&rsquo;s water must have a temperature of over 55 degrees centigrade. Further, if youve been allowing your cat to your bed, wash all the bedding.
5.�Utilize a
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-comb-for-cats/">flea comb</a>
to remove the flea eggs and flea adults. However, ensure to target the belly, forehead, and neck since thats where many fleas will exist. Ensure to have a basin (half-full) of water with a detergent such as a dishwasher soap where youll drown the fleas - or also use the electronic flea combs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, spray the cat beddings under the carpet and coach using a suitable flea insecticide every two weeks. Use a flea collar on your cat for prevention purposes.</p>

<p>A
quick google search on whether�Can Dog Fleas
Transfer to Humans - most related information available online is false. Some articles claim that only dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis) attack canines and that only the
*Pulex irritans *
can
bite human
beings.
<em>Pulex irritans</em>
feed on blood (humans, dogs, and cats) and will bite human beings (leaving itchy red bumps ) and only
*survive on human blood. *
<em>Fleas�</em>

fleas on clothes
and
kill massive flea infestation with foggers
.</p>
<h2 id="fleas-hitchhike-your-clothes-and-hair">Fleas Hitchhike, your clothes and hair.</h2>
<p>First, fleas lack
wings and thus do not fly
but jump from one host to another or hiding place. Also, fleas have rough bristles that allow them to attach themselves to the pets (
cat or dog
) fur. You can prevent this by using appropriate
human flea repellents
.
There are about 320 flea species: in the US, Ctenocephalides felis is most common. Ctenocephalides canis is common in Europe. Pigs mainly host the above two
flea species all bite
human beings, but Pulex irritans.
The insects jump about 16 inches long and eight inches high to land on any host to bite and suck blood. Notably,
fleas will mainly suck blood from any host
, humans, wild animals, or pets (cats and dogs).
Any
flea brought in by your dogs will hide
under the furniture until their larvae if fully developed. Finally, the fleas hatch and sense your warm blood and take a
bite on your skin
to suck blood. Also,
humans carry fleas to another home
on their hair and clothes.
Fleas will bite
your ankles and legs, which you see if you walk into a house infested with a massive flea population. Theyll leave some rid itchy round bumps on the location they bite.</p>
<h2 id="signs-of-fleas-transfer-from-your-dog">Signs of fleas transfer from your dog.</h2>
<p>So, howll you know when
fleas have transferred from your dog
to you or your family member? Well, first check if your dog is continuously scratching its skin and fur. Thats the first
sign because flea
bites will cause itching on both human beings and dogs.
Also, check whether your
dog has signs of allergies due to a massive flea
infestation. Further, if you note some
flea dirt
and red bumps on the dog, you should be alert that a flea attack could be coming over to you from the dog.
Brush or comb your dog keenly to check whether the comb comes out with some brown color when passed on a white surface - to avoid such purchase

<h2 id="prevent-fleas-on-your-dogs">Prevent fleas on your dogs</h2>
<p>Ive pointed above that you can use flea bombs
to control massive flea

and
Frontline Plus

flea spray for your yards
.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas take host on your dog
, and thus, whenever you come too close to the pet, the fleas could jump over to you looking for a blood source.
However, fleas (apart from
<em>Pulex irritans</em>
) cannot

So far so good, the best clothes that you can put on in a flea-infested zone are long pants and long-sleeved shirts. This is only helpful when it comes to preventing flea bites but that doesnt mean fleas wont attack you.</li>
<li>If not that, you can still use some spray repellents on your clothes to keep off the fleas from your clothes and prevent bites as well.</li>
<li>There are clothes that make us prone to fleas bite-these are;
**Skin tights and thin fabrics - **
These kinds of fabrics are the easy spots for fleas, they can easily penetrate through them. If you have such kinds of clothes dont dare use them
**Loose woven clothes - **
This kind of clothing, though they are thick enough, they have a loose hole and pattern that allows fleas to go through. They are not good to put on in a fleas-infested area.

You may be surprised to learn that fleas can survive in a carpet for 2-3 months. That being said, without a host, they will be unable to breed, and here&rsquo;s why;</p>
<ul>
<li>A femaleflea must take her first feed from a hostto be able to lay her eggs.</li>
<li>Depending on how much blood the female flea can draw from her host will depend on how many eggs she can; you can expect an average female to lay up to 50 eggs in the hours.</li>
<li>The eggs are laid directly onto the host animal, and as they move around, these eggs will fall out of the fur and wherever the land will be where they develop. A carpet is a perfect location for this.</li>
<li>Once the eggs hatch and the larvae become fully developed, they attach themselves to a hand to repeat the cycle.</li>
<li>If you have treated your pet for fleas and have not tackled your carpet, you can be sure that the fleas will continue to inhabit your floor as well as making their way back onto your pet to breed once more.

      <description>Flea bites on humans</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flea bites on humans-bite-humans/)
from cat fleas, dog fleas, rat fleas cause irritation, itching, pain, and distress - they&rsquo;ll bite calves, ankles, lower legs, and feet.
But are flea bites on the human scalp common? Can these pests create a permanent residence in your hair? So,
<em>can fleas <a href="/posts/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/">live</a> in human hair?�</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In summary, when you sleep with a pet, fleas can temporarily hide in dense or full frizzy human hair (like Remy human hair). This is common when they can&rsquo;t find their preferred hosts like cats or dogs.�</em></li>
<li><em>While female fleas have lower fertility inside the human hair, human blood is not preferred by fleas. Thus you won&rsquo;t find flea eggs laid�or developing to other stages in the flea cycle.�</em>
<em>However, chigoe or human fleas (found in tropical areas) will prefer human hosts. Human fleas will burrow into the human skin, suck blood, and lay eggs in their numbers. See the flea spray.�</em>

</ul>
<h2 id="details-can-fleas-live-in-human-hair-7-quick-tips">Details: Can Fleas Live in Human Hair? (7 Quick Tips)</h2>
<p>Usually,
fleas won&rsquo;t stay or live in human
hair. But when humans sleep with pets (including cats and dogs), the fleas may jump off, at night, onto the human hair and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/">clothes</a>
.
The
fleas jump onto the human
scalp, where they&rsquo;ll feed on your blood - a good blood meal despite not being like the pet&rsquo;s blood meal.</p>
<p>Pet&rsquo;s blood meal allows the female
fleas to lay eggs
, and they hatch into the larvae, pupae, before progressing into adults, and thus exterminators concentrate on killing fleas on pets.
So, you can
control fleas in your yard
or apartment using vacuum cleaning, laundering, and thoroughly washing the pet bedding and clothes.
So, if the pet sleeps on your bed, the fleas may jump from the bed and land on the floor or carpets - try some of these
best flea carpet powder</p>
<ul>
<li>including targeting flea eggs and larvae.
Fleas will be dislodged from their pet hosts during pet-grooming with tools like
flea combs for cats
and
dog flea combs
. Also,
flea gets dislodged when the cats
or dogs groom themselves.
Fleas will mainly hop, hide, and
<a href="http://ijpa.tums.ac.ir/index.php/ijpa/article/view/61">bite humans (warm-blooded mammal) 2 to 7 times</a>
immediately; it emerges from the flea cocoon because they urgently need a blood meal and a host.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXX0W8HEJ7I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXX0W8HEJ7I</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-jump-into-the-human-hair">How Do Fleas Jump into the Human Hair?</h2>
<p>Fleas have long hind legs shaped from jumping - about 13 inches horizontally and
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10962162">7 inches vertically</a>
, which is the record coming only second to frog-hoppers.
However, for the fleas to jump onto your head and hence the human hair - you&rsquo;d require holding the cat or dog near the head or sleeping around where the
bugs hide
.
Therefore, despite that fleas can jump high both vertically (about 7 inches) and horizontally, they can&rsquo;t get to the head (and human hair) of a regular height human being from the ground.</p>
<p>The regular flea&rsquo;s
jump being 6 inches will only get the bug
to the ankle of an adult (and standing) human being. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll find most
flea bites are clustered
around the ankles.
Although fleas can
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24923246?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">crawl to good hiding places</a>
, they&rsquo;ll not usually climb up from the human ankles to the pubic hair or even the head hair.</p>
<p>Conclusion? Fleas will only get and hide in your human
hair if you sleep or lay around flea-infested pets
, including cats or dogs. This may also happen when you let flea-infested pets lay on your bed.</p>
<h2 id="signs-that-you-have-fleas-in-your-hair">Signs That You Have Fleas in Your Hair?</h2>
<h3 id="1-allergic-reactions">1. Allergic Reactions</h3>
<p>Some human beings are allergic (anaphylaxis) to flea-bites because their immune system tends to overreact, releasing excessive histamine. Signs include breathing issues, nausea, and swelling.
Humans may also experience hair loss, crusts (scabs), pustules (pus bumps), papules (bumps), and erythema (redness). The head may also become painful and sore due to flea bites -
<a href="https://www.banfield.com/pet-healthcare/additional-resources/article-library/parasites/fleas/flea-allergy-dermatitis-treatment-options">but the flea allergy is treatable</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="3red-bumps">3.�Red Bumps</h3>
<p>When fleas settle in your hair and bite your scalp, you may notice some red bumps. A unique identifying feature is that the red dots are clustered together.
Besides, these red-clustered bumps are the same ones you&rsquo;ll find around your feet and ankles - but will happen on the head or scalp if you sleep near flea-infested cats or dogs.</p>
<h3 id="3-intense-itchiness">3. Intense Itchiness</h3>
<p>Fleas
bites on your head could also cause
intense itching that also comes with major skin irritation. Severe cases would result in skin infection, skin reddening, and hair loss.</p>
<p>However, the head ditch&rsquo;s intensity from the
flea bites in the human
hair varies from one person to another. This may be related to how allergic humans are to flea bites.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-fleas-in-human-hair">How to Treat Fleas in Human Hair?</h2>
<h3 id="1-wash-with-shampoo">1. Wash with Shampoo</h3>
<p>Wash your hair with your regular
shampoo to dislodge the fleas
from your head. For this process, you&rsquo;ll need to rub the shampoo on the hair roots and scalp gently.
Equally important is that you should get a way of catching or holding the fleas that may jump off your head and hair as you&rsquo;re doing the shampoo washing.</p>
<h3 id="2-remove-flea-eggs">2. Remove Flea Eggs</h3>
<p>Sometimes fleas may even leave their eggs (
can be confused with dandruff
) on your hair, and thus you must eliminate them. The eggs will mainly be off-white or translucent in color and oval-shaped, looking like salt grains.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s also critical to flea treat the hair and the environment or yards around your house -
flea bombs
can help with a massive infestation.
I would recommend using warm water plus
baking soda</p>
<ul>
<li>that you&rsquo;ll spray on your hair.
Another remedy would be using
dish soap to kill the fleas for pets</li>
<li>particularly the lemon-scented models. However, avoid dish soap for cleaning your hair, head, or scalp. Rinse and dry the hair.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-flea-shampoo-with-tea-tree-oil">3. Flea Shampoo with Tea-Tree Oil</h3>
<p>Further, I recommend you wash your head and hair using
tea tree oil
plus your regular shampoo to eliminate the fleas. However, you must use the tea tree oil in its diluted type.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s challenging to get the correct and safe measurement for tea tree oil, and thus, it would be helpful to purchase the shampoo with tea tree oil that&rsquo;s ready to use.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rarely do
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-live/">fleas live</a>
in human hair but never say never. But when these fleas get into your hair - and
bite your skin
, they&rsquo;ll cause itching, red bumps, and allergic reactions.
However, human blood isn&rsquo;t the preferred blood meal for fleas, and thus the insects won&rsquo;t lay eggs on the human hair - this is attributed to lowered fertility levels caused by poor diet.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flea eggs and pupae can remain dormant for a prolonged lying under carpets, pet fur, or clothes lying on the floor. But, cats &amp; dogs - which are warm-blooded are their preferred hosts.
Also, fleas may host tapeworms and spread diseases like Lyme diseases. But
<em>, can fleas <a href="/posts/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/">live</a> on clothes?�</em>
<strong>The short answer is, No!</strong>
Cat
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/">fleas can&rsquo;t live on hair</a>
and clothes.
Fleas stay on humans
for only about�7.5 minutes as they suck�blood.
If you disrupt them while sucking blood, the fleas will hide in the seams of your clothes -
for better flea control
. But, sometimes, the
fleas can hide in clothes
for about 24 hours if they can&rsquo;t figure their way out - as they continue sucking human blood.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Fleas Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-can-fleas-live-on-clothes-fleas-and-flea-bites">Details: Can Fleas Live on Clothes? Fleas and Flea Bites</h2>
<h3 id="1-adult-fleas-live-on-cats--dogs-their-hosts">1. Adult Fleas live on Cats &amp; Dogs (their Hosts)</h3>
<p>Cat Fleas (being permanent ectoparasites)
live on their hosts
(mainly cats and dogs)-� and they&rsquo;ll not favor biting human beings. They mostly bite, reproduce, and live off the blood from the warm-blooded hosts without leaving.
But, you can get pupa and eggs hiding in clothing (like winter coats) that�you don&rsquo;t wash regularly.�Thus, you might want to
kill the fleas in a dryer
as the heat and detergents will help in the process.</p>
<h3 id="2-human-beings-arent-fleas-favored-hosts">2. Human beings arent fleas&rsquo; favored Hosts</h3>
<p>Flea bites in humans
are only�incidental compared to those on dogs and cats. Reasons?&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Human beings have no hair(cats and dogs have fur) required by fleas to hide from prying human eyes.</li>
<li>Also, typically,fleas will not reproduce from feeding humanblood.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fleas-bite-humans-beings-and-jump-off">3. Fleas Bite humans beings and Jump Off</h3>
<p>As noted above,
fleas will suck blood on human
beings and jump off to a more suitable�host.
Fleas won&rsquo;t bite
through your clothes.�Hence, the fleas will crawl to an exposed
skin area where they&rsquo;ll make�2-3 bites
before jumping off.
Any interruption will make the flea hide under your clothes for a short time - possibly for a maximum of 24 hours. Fleas won&rsquo;t bite through your clothes. Therefore, if they&rsquo;re trapped in your clothes,
fleas will continue biting and feeding
on the exposed skin.</p>
<h2 id="flea-larvae-wont-live-in-clothes">Flea Larvae Won&rsquo;t Live in Clothes.</h2>
<p>Flea larvae
won&rsquo;t live on cats or dogs. Still, they will mainly be in the carpets ( digging deep into carpet fibers), protected and dark environments like the porches,� underneath decks, attics, and crawl spaces.
Therefore, fleas will largely escape to areas that have a w amount of lighting. For example, the fleas can hide under clothes that are left lying on the floor or hide in seams of clothes/ fabrics to escape being killed by humans or by insecticides such as sprays and
flea bombs
.</p>
<h3 id="1fleas-larvae-hatch-on-their-hosts">1.�Fleas larvae hatch on their hosts</h3>
<p>Flea larvae will hatch from their fleas eggs
while still on their hosts, such as dogs and cats. However, flea larvae don&rsquo;t live on the hosts but will fall off to the environment
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-carpets/">in areas such as carpet</a>
fibers when the cat or dog is walking around your house.
The
fleas&rsquo; eggs
will behave like any round ball that will roll off any surface. Therefore, when the cat or dog rises and shales its body, the
flea eggs
will fall off to the surrounding surfaces in their environment.
Further, when the pet is in its sleeping area, the
flea eggs
will fall off to the bedding, where they&rsquo;ll hatch into larvae and grow.</p>
<h3 id="2larvae-exhibitnegative-phototaxic">2.�Larvae exhibit�negative phototaxic</h3>
<p>Flea larvae will hatch within 2-7 days after the females adult fleas lay the eggs. However, the larvae will tend to hide from any bright light because they have negative phototaxic.
Therefore, the flea larvae will hide deep inside carpet fibers, crevices, and cracks, which implies that they won&rsquo;t favor living in clothes. Use
flea carpet powder
. Also, the larvae will eat
flea dirt
and organic debris.
Flea dirt
is the dried blood excreted by adult fleas after they suck blood from various hosts such as dogs and cats. Also, larvae practice cannibalism, where they&rsquo;ll eat the sickly or injured fleas.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs/">Capstar</a> flea tablets for large dogs contain 57 mg of nitenpyram as its active ingredient and it&rsquo;s effective for
[killing adult <a href="/posts/capstar-flea-treatment-reviews/">fleas</a>](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/</a>)
.</p>
<ul>
<li>The nitenpyram ingredient falls under the group of neonicotinoids.
The oral tablet is effective and safe for killing fleas in large dogs.
However, the manufacturers caution that these oral tablets must not be used for humans.</li>
<li>So, keep the tablets away from the reach of kids.
Luckily, Capstar is safe for use on so you can give a second dose to the dog if it has a fleas&rsquo; re-infestation.
Administering the Capstar flea trap tablets will require that you conceal the medication in the pet&rsquo;s food or drop it into the dog&rsquo;s mouth directly.</li>
<li>Inspect the dog thoroughly to ensure it has swallowed the flea tablet or re-administer the medication if you are not sure if it has swallowed.
NB: Remember that the fleas can multiply and reproduce while on another pet in your household even when you flea-treated your dog.</li>
<li>So, it is good to adopt a comprehensive flea treatment approach for the house and on other pets. Related:<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs/">Capstar Flea Tablets�for Small Dogs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dosage-and-reaction">Dosage and Reaction</h2>
<p>Capstar flea tablets must be administered separately to the dog or other pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, you must not administer Capstar tablets to any pet whose weight is below 2 pounds.
Also, check the packaging instructions 4 outlines on current dosing for the Capstar flea tablets.
No adverse effects have been recorded while administering Capstar flea tablets on dogs or pets over 2 pounds.
You will achieve 90% effective flea control on dogs with these Capstar flea tablets.</li>
<li>Luckily, Capstar tablets have a quick knock-down on fleas since they will kill the bugs in just 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-capstar-flea-tablets-safe-for-nursing-or-pregnant-dogs">Are Capstar flea tablets safe for nursing or pregnant dogs?</h2>
<p>During the flea treatment process, you may notice that the dog may start itching and scratching - this is when the fleas are dying.
Itching and scratching in dogs after giving them the Capstar flea tablets is a temporary reaction to the movement of fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats can show some temporary signs like excessive grooming, vocalization, panting, and hyperactivity.
You can prevent miliary dermatitis and flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) in dogs by treating the pets using Capstar flea tablets.
Also, you can use Capstar tablets in conjunction with other medications including shampoos, deworming medications, vaccines, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and heartworm preventives.
Remember that fleas also spread tapeworms and so controlling these products will have extensive medical benefits to your dog.
Capstar tablets will however not kill the fleas that are in and around the house (
the pets&rsquo; environment
).</li>
<li>So, repeat the flea treatment on the dog using Capstar tablets since the immature fleas in the environment will develop into mature ladies attacking your large dogs again.
So, in addition to using the Capstar tablet to exterminate the adult fleas, you can use an insect growth inhibitor such as program flavor to help control fleas in the other life stages.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-OvxhEkJ0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-OvxhEkJ0</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fleas-life-cycle">Fleas life cycle</h2>
<p>Fleas are known to be fast producers and so their presence can cause a major problem to your pets and the household in general.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, 1 female flea willlay about 2000+ eggsbefore it dies.
These eggs will develop and hatch to become adults in about 3 weeks. Next, once the female fleas have their blood meal from the pets, they will go ahead and lay more eggs.</li>
<li>The flea larvae will emerge from the flea eggs in a few days and will remain in the pet&rsquo;s environment concealed in places such as the pet bedding and the carpet.
Next, the flea larvae will create a cocoon and wait for appropriate stimuli so that they can emerge as young adult fleas.
The fleas in the stage will next
hitchhike your pet
and continue feeding on their blood - growth further to the flea cycle.</li>
<li>So, effectively control the fleas in all the life stages, we recommend a combination of the Capstar tablets (nitenpyram) and the flavor tablets (lufenuron).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capstar-nitenpyram-for-large-dogs">Capstar (nitenpyram) for Large Dogs</h2>
<p>The oral tablets (Capstar) will exterminate adult fleas in large dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens that are 4 + weeks old and whose weight is 2 + pounds.
The nitenpyram (neonicotinoids) Capstar tablets will contain 57 mg of the active ingredient (for large dogs) or 11.4 mg of the same (for small dogs and cats).
But how long will the Capstar flea treatment last?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, Capstar tablets will have a quick knockdown on the adult fleas (killing them in 15 minutes)</li>
<li>However, the effectiveness and life of the free tablets will be around 24 hours when you will be required to re-administer if the pests are still around.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-recent-customer-review">A Recent Customer Review</h2>
<p>The customer notes that he hit the research grounds for an effective flea killer recently.</p>
<ul>
<li>But he is keen to caution that Capstar tablets are our only guide for killing adult fleas on large dogs.
It is therefore impossible to use Capstar tablets to target fleas that are in the environment.</li>
<li>But the customer states that the Capstar flea tablets are an excellent tool that you can incorporate into the flea control mission.
So, if you&rsquo;re planning to utilize mostly or only cut the tablets to control fleas in the house and on the dog, you will require extra vigilance and keen knowledge of the flea cycle.</li>
<li>This would require that you give the large dogs these Capstar flea tablets for a long time - this would require a vet&rsquo;s advice.
This technique might not work for dogs that show adverse skin reactions from flea bites - this would require emergency flea treatment in the whole environment.</li>
<li>So, I recommend you combine administration of the tablets with thorough vacuuming and cleaning plusflea shampooing the dogfollowing a regular schedule.
This combination will provide almost instant relief to the large dogs against fleas while also controlling the pests to slow their growth in the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, the Capstar flea tablets for large dogs are effective in exterminating adult fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>But to control the fleas in the pets&rsquo; environment, you will require acomprehensive flea extermination strategy.
Despite the fact that the Capstar tablets will only work for 24 hours, it offers a quick knockdown on the fleas - which will be around 15 minutes.
Cheers!</li>

Notably, capital will begin killing the fleas on your dog in around half an hour and its effectiveness will last for one day.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I advise that you start the journey of controlling that flea infestation on your car or the dog by administering Capstar - it is an effective flea killer and it&rsquo;s also fast-acting.
Let&rsquo;s dig in!

<h2 id="details-capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs">Details: Capstar Flea Tablets For Small Dogs</h2>
<p>Cops are tablets that are effective and fast in killing fleas on small dogs such that you&rsquo;ll actually see the pests falling off from your pet.</p>
<ul>

<li>Some of the known long-acting play Killers include tick control collars like those produced by Solesto or advantage.
The tablets are easy to administer and we&rsquo;ll kill the adult fleas very fast. You can give the tablets daily - probably with food or even without.</li>
<li>Capstar flea tablets will be effective and safe for controlling fleas in small dogs that measure up to 11 kgs.
KILL ADULT FLEAS: Capstar oral flea treatment tablets (11.4 mg) are safe for dogs and puppies from 2-25 lbs., four (4) weeks and older.

<li>Lucky for convenience and cost reduction, Capstar flea tablets can be purchased without needing a veterinarian prescription.
Capstar flea tablets are all so fast in treating re-infestations - experts advise that you just administer another daily dose until all is cleared.</li>
<li>Capstar tablets also have a quick knock-down effect on the fleas - so the pests will start falling off from the dog in just 30 minutes.

</ul>
<h2 id="effective-and-fast-acting">Effective and Fast Acting</h2>
<p>Capstar is made using the nitenpyram active ingredient which will kill the fleas fast on your cats and dogs - the knock-down effect is estimated at just 30 minutes.
An analysis of the Capstars action shows that the remedy is able to disseminate 90 + percent of the adult fleas in just 4 hours (in dogs) and only 6 hours (in cats).
Besides capsule tablets we&rsquo;ll be safe and effective for use on kittens, cats, puppies, and dogs that are 2 + oz in weight or 4 + weeks in age.
Another advantage of the Capstar tablets is that we will exterminate adult fleas before they begin reproducing and laying eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capstar will exterminate adult fleas that would otherwise trigger allergy dermatitis caused by fleas.
Luckily, Capstar can be purchased for killing fleas in 57 mg for large dogs (25 pounds - 125 pounds) or in 11.4 mg for small dogs and cats (2 lb to 25 pounds).</li>
<li>Administration of the Capstar tablets is easy as you will simply be required to give them in food or drop a tablet inside the pet&rsquo;s mouth.
You can administer Capstar flea tablets with other medications such as the longer-lasting or monthly medications and they&rsquo;ll be safe.</li>
<li>Also, you can administer Capstar flea tablets with flea shampoos, deworming medications, vaccines, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and heartworm preventatives.
However, Capstar flea tablets are not suitable for use as a preventative flea medication.</li>
<li>So you should purchase and use another flea prevention remedy for your small dogs - ensure that a solution is able to kill even the flea larvae and flea eggs.
However, Capstar flea tablets are not safe for use in kittens and puppies that are under 20 pounds in body weight or under 4 weeks in age.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-will-the-capstar-flea-tablets-last">How long will the Capstar Flea tablets last?</h2>
<p>As noted above, Capstar flea tablets are not to be used as preventative medications for fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dosing the small dog with a tablet will only kill please that are on its body at that time.
So, Capstar tablets are widely used in rescue operations - for flea-treating stray cats or dogs.</li>
<li>The process involves dosing the cat or dog using Capstar tablets, feeding them appropriately, and then bathing them probably using asuitable flea shampoo.
So, on how long the Capstar flea tablets last, I will say that this is an incorrect or misplaced question because this solution will not offer long-lasting prevention.
So, the Capstar tablet may be described as an instant flea solution as opposed to being a long-term flea pill.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-capstar-flea-tablets-safe-for-my-small-dog">Are Capstar flea tablets safe for my small dog?</h2>
<p>Yes, Capstar tablets are effective in treating fleas on both cats and small dogs.
However, you must strictly adhere to the dosage recommendations that are on the product description.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 11.4 mg package is suitable for flea-treating dogs and cats that are 2 lb 25 pounds in body weight</li>
<li>The 57 mg package is effective unsafe for flea-treating dogs that weigh 25.1 lb to 125 pounds
The oral medication can be administered by hiding it in the dog&rsquo;s food or simply dropping the tablet into the pet&rsquo;s mouth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flea-free-dogs">Flea-Free Dogs</h2>
<p>My mum received the Capstar tablets package in the evening and she administered it immediately.
She says that, after 1 hour, she&rsquo;s checked through the dog&rsquo;s hair for any live fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, not a single live flea was found but there were many dead ones.
Next, my mum decided to give a dog a thorough washing to remove most of those dead or live fleas.</li>
<li>Finally, my mum reports that her small dog became flea-free and also happy.
However, she noted that the product description classified the product as non-long-term in its action.</li>
<li>So, she had to contact the vet for accommodation with a longer-term flea killer for a small dog.
My mum&rsquo;s review is that Capstar tablets will be great if you need an easy and quick remedy for fleas prior to getting a longer-term remedy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="effective-for-small-dogs">Effective for small dogs</h2>
<p>Capstar tablets worked excellently as described.</p>
<ul>
<li>I used the product on my small dogs that weigh anywhere from 11 lb to 16 pounds.
I noticed that the Shitzu dog that had denser hair on its body came with more fleas.
But we administered 1 dose to each of the dogs and the formulation was able to clear all the pests within 1 to 2 days.</li>
<li>However, it was important to administer another dose to the dog that had long hair after 1 week.
My review is that Capstar tablets are effective safe and well-priced for use in controlling fleas - plus they are nonprescription which makes them very convenient.
Capstar cleared the fleas on my Shih Tzu dog that mainly stays in the US but sometimes moves to the yard - where I believe he picked some fleas.</li>
<li>But ever since this encounter, I also purchased a<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">yard flea killer</a>that has helped so much.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="used-in-conjunction-with-flea-combs">Used in Conjunction with Flea Combs</h2>
<p>Experts recommend that you use the Capstar tablets in conjunction with some quality flea combs.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will increase the chances of catching all the fleas within one hour.
After administering the medication, you will notice that a small dog will begin moving around and becoming restless and scratching crazily.</li>
<li>This is because the fleas will have panicked and so will be moving around as they die from the medication.
Pet owners are advised that this is a common habit but they should comb the outdoors to catch any fleas that may escape.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in summary, Capstar tablets are effective remedies for controlling adult fleas that are already on your small dog.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, be cautious because there is a dosage limitation depending on the age and weight of your small dog.
I also recommend you use Capstar tablets in combination with other longer-term flea remedies such as the Sentry Oatmeal Flea Shampoo.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Capstar tablets are formulated to kill the various adult flea species and they&rsquo;re meant for use on large dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens that are over 2 pounds in weight.</p>
<ul>
<li>For most of these pests, one dose of the Capstar tablets will kill most of the <a href="/posts/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs/">fleas</a> - but you must use other techniques tobreak the flea lifecycle.
In this article, I will online and discuss some of the Capstar flea treatment reviews that are accessible to me.
Let&rsquo;s dig in!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-capstar-flea-treatment-reviews">Details: Capstar Flea Treatment Reviews</h2>
<h3 id="review-1-highly-effective-oral-flea-treatment">Review #1: Highly Effective Oral Flea Treatment</h3>
<p>I can say that I finally landed on an effective and still
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs">safe flea killer - for small dogs</a>
and large dogs plus cats.
Compared to other over-the-counter pesticides and repellents that I had used trying to control the fleas on my pets, Capstar tablets proved much better.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had my reservations in using the oral tablets for flea control especially after going through the CDC reports regarding their safety.
The results after using the Capstar flea tablets proved amazing since the chemical damaged the bug&rsquo;s central nervous system and thus killed them.
Luckily the active ingredients do not affect the body system of the pet and it also acts facts plus it doesn&rsquo;t remain in the body for long.</li>
<li>Therefore the side effects on the pet (if any) we&rsquo;ll be for a short time and others you&rsquo;ll have time to discontinue a medication prior to causing extensive damage.
This will not be like other prescription flea treatments that tend to remain in the pet body for years or months - which may come with adverse health effects.
So my feedback is that Capstar flea tablets produced positive outcomes in handling and finishing the flea infestation that had proved stubborn.</li>
<li>So if those pets including cats kitties dogs and puppies pickfleas from the yardand bring them in the house, Capstar tablets will help you.
Also, fleas make cats and dogs lose their fur through scratching and itchy.
Therefore a suitable oral flea medication will save the pets from dropping off their fur - it will work well for
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-large-dogs">large medium and small furry pets</a>
.</li>
<li>Just within a week, my home became flea-free and my pets why are healing their wounds while also re-growing their fur at a fast rate.
Within a month none of my pets showed any signs of physical or mental sickness and that&rsquo;s why I conclude Capstar flea tablets are quite effective.
Father the natural flea repellents may not work always to control the bags while some chemical pesticides may irritate the pet&rsquo;s skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="review-2-quick-action-and-cheap-in-killing-fleas">Review #2: Quick Action and Cheap in Killing Fleas</h3>
<p>My mum has five indoor cats but just 2 go outdoors for a short time daily. But with the recent massive rains, the flea infestation has increased.
Since the cats are many numbers then controlling fleas on all of them, especially through a veterinarian is quite costly.
Luckily after sharing the Capstar flea tablets among the cats they are now back to resting and relaxing after just 30 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the cats relax my mum checked them out and don&rsquo;t list dead fleas on they are bedding and their bodies.
Capstar flea tablets works!
On cost, I note that Capstar flea tablets are considerably cheap and I would also write them five stars for effectiveness.
You can use the capitol flea tablets in conjunction with other topical flea treatments such as frontline and
revolution</li>
<li>but even when alone the tablets will exterminate the place within 1 to 4 hours.
Capstar tablets should be used in combination with other techniques in a broader flea control mission.</li>
<li>This is because please we require a blood meal to lay their eggs.</li>
<li>So if you can remove the other place from the bed as you treat the house and yard to be easy to break theflea life cycle.
My strategy was a month of thorough flea control that included using home flea sprays, vacuuming, washing, using frontline plus, and flea collars - in addition to the Capstar flea tablets on my pets.</li>
<li>Also, I washed and heat dried the bedding before finally flea-bombing my residence.</li>
<li>I noted that flea bombing the house in conjunction with administering the Capstar tablets to the pets produced the best results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="review-3-exterminates-adult-fleas-only">Review #3: Exterminates Adult Fleas Only</h3>
<p>Capstar flea tablets will work within 24 hours unless you require to administer the medication to the pets.
In 24 hours, you&rsquo;ll be able to clean at the services using other flea control methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advice that you buy the Capstar tablets and administer one for your pet daily but ensure to read the packaging directions.
Another product that will improve the effectiveness of the flea control methods is using flea shampoo.</li>
<li>This is because the Capstar tablet won&rsquo;t exterminate fleas in other life-stages apart from adults.</li>
<li>Using suitable flea shampoo will help you kill the flea larvae and flea eggs.
But make sure to wash the pet thoroughly while using the flea shampoo to give it time for effective extermination of the pests.
After using the Capstar flea tablets most of the fleas will die.</li>
<li>But you can use a flea comb to catch any that are still alive and hiding in the fur of the pet.
The flea comb will also help remove the dead skin and detached hair from the body of the pet and that gives it a better look.</li>
<li>A flea spray that has highly effective but safe ingredients will easily kill fleas in the house and the yard.</li>
<li>But don&rsquo;t spray on or around the pets or allow them to pass near the spread area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vacuum the unwashable items used by pests such as their cat trees and carpets. Also,o laundry on the pet clothes, fabrics, and bedding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore I know that the Capstar flea tablets easily achievedeffective flea control on my petswithin 24 hours but this could only be achieved in about two weeks with other methods.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two main types of <a href="/posts/how-to-tell-if-your-cat-has-fleas/">fleas</a> that live on cats and dogs - cat fleas and dog fleas. If you want to know the difference between cat fleas vs dog fleas, read on!</p>
<ul>
<li>*When our vet informed us that we needed to start treating our dog for cat fleas, I was confused. We don&rsquo;t have a cat and haven&rsquo;t had any in our yard that I know of. *
<em>Let me surprise you!</em></li>
<li>One of the most frequent questions that pet owners ask is this: do cat fleas (<em>Ctenocephalides�felis</em>) exclusively attack cats, while dog fleas (<em>Ctenocephalides canis</em>) live only off dogs?
**So, how do **
**cat fleas compare to dog fleas? While they&rsquo;re different species (only differentiable under a **
<strong>microscope</strong>
**), dog and cat fleas can infest either cats or dogs. But **
<strong>cat fleas (</strong>
<strong>Ctenocephalides felis</strong>
**) are more common in North America than dog fleas. **
Let&rsquo;s check the details!</li>
</ul>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Cat Fleas Vs Dog Fleas&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="comparison-cat-fleas-vs-dog-fleas">Comparison: Cat Fleas Vs Dog Fleas</h2>
<h3 id="1-preferred-host">1. Preferred Host?</h3>
<p>Fleas feed and breed off the blood of warm-blooded hosts, and that&rsquo;s how they make their way onto your cat or dog.</p>
<p>However, both cat and dog fleas do have the ability to survive off human blood for a few months.</p>
<p>Cat fleas�are�commonly found�on both�cats�and dogs in North America, while dog�fleas�are�found�in Europe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat fleas can live on different animals such as wild animals including opossums, birds,squirrels, foxes, mice, raccoons, and rats.
While it is impossible to know how your dog came in contact with fleas, chances are that he found them outside in the yard.</li>
<li>The flea eggs fall off flea-infested animal hosts andhatch to pupaewhen they land in a suitable environment, such as your yard and the pet&rsquo;s sleeping area.
Within two days of exiting the pupae cocoon with an adult form, the adult flea finds a host animal and takes its first blood meal. After feeding, the flea quickly finds a dark place to wait for its next host.</li>
<li>Cat fleas are also better adapted to finding hosts in areas with low levels of light and higher concentrations of carbon dioxide around their host&rsquo;s head as they move around the animals body.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-geographic-distribution">2. Geographic Distribution</h3>
<p>Cat fleas can be found on both dogs and cats, but one of the most important differences between cat and dog flea populations has been their geographic distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat Fleas - Found mainly in warmer habitats with higher humidity levels like in North America, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama;</li>
<li>Dog Fleas - Commonly found throughout Canada until New England.
If you&rsquo;re unsure where your pet picked up a flea population problem, it may help to know that when cats spend time outside they are at risk of becoming a host for both types of fleas, whereas dogs are more likely to be infested with dog fleas.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-size-comparison---cat-fleas-versus-dog-fleas">3. Size Comparison - Cat Fleas versus Dog Fleas</h3>
<p>Another difference between cat and dog fleas is that the former is smaller.</p>
<p>So, how big is a cat flea?</p>
<ul>
<li>Length of adult cat flea ranges from 1.5 - 3.2 millimeters (1/8&rsquo;&rsquo; and brownish-black or reddish black after feeding) with the females being slightly larger.</li>
<li>The female cat fleas have an average body length of 2.5 mm while the male cat flea length is around under 1 mm.</li>
<li>The heads of the female�cat fleas�are smaller and look disproportionate due to being very long.
And, how big is a dog flea?</li>
<li>Dog fleas have a length of 1.5 - 3.2 millimeters (1/8&rsquo;&rsquo;) and are brownish-black in color as well, but they have a lighter abdomen with dark brown stripes on the back of their bodies.
The head or called capitulum is relatively larger than cat fleas&rsquo; heads which makes them look disproportionally large for their body size.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-cat-fleas-infest-dogs">Do Cat Fleas Infest Dogs?</h2>
<p>Yes, cat fleas can infest a dog. Cat fleas jump from the cat to dogs, other animals, and humans.</p>
<p>They will primarily feed on cats but they may also bite domesticated pets such as rabbits, ferrets, and guinea pigs or wild animals like squirrels.</p>
<p>Can fleas transfer from cats to dogs? Yes, fleas can transfer between cats and dogs.</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible for your dog to get fleas from cats, especially if they live in North America where cat fleas very common.</p>
<h2 id="can-cat-fleas-live-on-humans">Can Cat Fleas Live On Humans?</h2>
<p>Both cat fleas and dog fleas don&rsquo;t live on humans but they can still bite you, but they will not reproduce off the human blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is believed that this is because only the cat&rsquo;s saliva triggers a response from eggs to hatch and larvae to develop into adults.</li>
<li>The egg may also need higher levels of heat or humidity than what people generally experience in their homes for it to fully mature.
Cat fleas do not tend to go onto a human host more than once, preferring instead to remain with cats.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are attracted by body warmth and carbon dioxide given off by breathing as well as a movement that could be caused by scratching an itch.</p>
<p>Flea bites cause itching around the bite site and sometimes swelling or hives; some people have sensitive skin reactions such as dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis after being bitten
*What about human hair? *
Fleas can
<em>hide temporarily</em>
in human hair when they cannot find their preferred animal hosts.</p>
<p>But usually, fleas
won&rsquo;t live in human hair
since it doesn&rsquo;t offer the same protection from sunlight and dryness that pet fur does.
<em>Can cat fleas live on your clothes?</em>
No,
clothes and other fabrics (sheets, pillows)
will not provide fleas with an environment in which they can survive.</p>
<p>However, fleas may hide on hems of clothing for a maximum of 24 hours. It is unlikely that fleas will remain on your clothes for long because they feed so often.</p>
<p>Their eggs may also be present on the garments.</p>
<ul>
<li>If these items are not washed or dry cleaned before they&rsquo;re worn again, fleas can end up traveling onto a person&rsquo;s body and causing an infestation.</li>
<li>The best way to prevent this is by either washing clothes after you wear them or putting all of your clothing into the drier for at least I hour (or until it comes out completely dry).
Flea eggs have been found in carpeting and upholstery - these eggs hatch into larvae that cannot move by themselves.</li>
<li>So it is important to vacuum regularly when pets live indoors as well as treat with an insecticide if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-dog-flea-treatment-kill-cat-fleas">Will Dog Flea Treatment Kill Cat Fleas?</h2>
<p>Yes, dog flea treatment can kill cat fleas. It only takes one bite from a dog carrying both types of parasites and the feline will become infested with both species of parasite at once, which is bad news for your kitty.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have products like Bravecto to protect against ticks too!</p>
<p>Our veterinarian doctors recommend you speak with them about what product would be best for your pet&rsquo;s needs today when they come into our office or call us if you are thinking about ordering online or purchasing it in-store.</p>
<p>Once a year, our vet recommends an examination by a doctor because there could be issues other than just pests on board; things such as allergies (fleas love going after dogs who suffer from the skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eggs have been found in carpeting and upholstery, so it&rsquo;s important to vacuum regularly and treat with insecticide if necessary.</li>
<li>Pet owners should comb their pets twice a day while they&rsquo;re infested because mature fleas may not be present on the pet 100% of the time - therefore preventing accidental transmission.
If you are going outside with your dog, make sure that he has had his monthly flea preventive recently (check expiration date) as this medication can also kill adult cat fleas!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-treat-my-home-for-dog-flea-and-cat-fleas">How Do I Treat my Home for Dog Flea and Cat Fleas?</h2>
<p>To treat an existing infestation: You will need to;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vacuum all floors (including under furniture) and
carpets
, upholstery in your home at least once every three days until no signs of fleas are found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clean pet bedding at least once a week so that you can get rid of any eggs or larvae your pets may have brought into the home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to use warm water and soap on these fabrics which will kill the flea eggs, prevent new infestations from taking hold in the fabric.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-
Treat the yard
with an appropriate pesticide if there&rsquo;s evidence of adult cat fleas outside; make sure it&rsquo;s safe for pets before applying!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chemical sprays are effective but may pose a health hazard to children or pets if not used correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For severe cases of infestation, speak with your veterinarian about an
oral medication
that can be given monthly to kill adult fleas on the pet as well as in the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You also need to comb your pup twice a day while it&rsquo;s infested so mature insects won&rsquo;t lay new eggs - which could then end up living off of other animals in the house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also

to exterminate the whole flea population in the residence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the subject, &ldquo;cat fleas vs dog fleas&rdquo; - there are a few different differences that you should know about.</p>
<p>Cat fleas are more common than dog fleas in North America, but dog fleas are more commonly found in Europe.</p>
<p>Flea bites can cause itching around the bite site. Some people have sensitive skin reactions such as dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis after being bitten.</p>
<p>Fleas usually won&rsquo;t live in human hair because it doesn&rsquo;t offer the same protection from sunlight and dryness that pet fur does.</p>

      <description>Diatomaceous Earth (DE)</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diatomaceous Earth (DE)
is an effective and equally safe way to kill various pests and insects, including fleas and bed bugs.
DE is made up of tiny fossilized remains of diatoms (a form of algae). DE won&rsquo;t kill fleas immediately, like the contact killers, but its benefits far outweigh the expected wait time.</p>
<p>When crushed, Diatomaceous <a href="/posts/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-dogs/">Earth</a> powder has sharp edges (microscopic) safe for you and your pets but is fatal on pests like fleas. The razor-sharp edges in DE will break the
fleas&rsquo; exoskeletons and kill
them through dehydration.
In this post, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use
Diatomaceous Earth
for fleas&rsquo; extermination safely. But you can click here to check out how to use
DE.

<h2 id="what"><strong>What&rsquo;s Diatomaceous Earth? How Does It Work?�</strong></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Definition</strong></dt>
<dd>Diatomaceous Earth is a soft (powdered) sedimentary rock discovered by a farmer in the 1830s initially thought to be limestone. DE is made up of fossil diatoms, which are hard-shelled algae from different water plants.
DE powder has tiny, razor-sharp edges (if checked through a microscopic) that&rsquo;ll quickly shred or break the fleas&rsquo; exoskeletons and its inner organs, which is definitely fatal.
<em><strong>Sidenote</strong>: These characteristics have afforded Diatomaceous Earth various applications in mild abrasion, mechanical insect repelling, and filtration (charcoal filters).�</em>
If inhaled, the small razor-like diatoms in Diatomaceous Earth will damage the
flea&rsquo;s respiratory system and kill
the bug. Fortunately, DE works through mechanical action, and thus fleas won&rsquo;t develop resistance like they do with chemical flea killers.
DE will also dehydrate and
kill other insects such as fleas
, aphids,� lice, ticks, mites, roaches, ants, bed bugs, and various garden pests. Diatomaceous Earth is suitable for controlling adult and
larvae fleas
in dry or indoor spaces like pet bedding or houses.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-des-action-last">How Long Does the DE&rsquo;s Action Last?</h2>
<p>According to a report by National Geographic,
fleas coming
into contact with the Diatomaceous Earth powder will die within 4-12 hours.
But you&rsquo;ll need to leave the DE powder on the surfaces (yard, floors, or carpets) for 24 hours before you
vacuum to make sure that the bugs
have died.
Diatomaceous Earth will be effective against fleas for three weeks in your yard, provided it&rsquo;s not wetted by rain or sprinkler water. Hence, reapply DE in 2-3 weeks since the fleas usually have an egg-laying cycle of about 1-3 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your Diatomaceous Earth powder dry, or it&rsquo;ll lose its power. Thus, you must not expose the DE to rain or sprinkler water when flea treating your porches, gardens, or yards.</li>
<li>For wet grounds or in the rainy season, useflea sprayswith<a href="https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/ent-6003/">pyrethroids</a>like esfenvalerate and esfenvalerate or other IGR pyriproxifen.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-step-by-step">Using Diatomaceous Earth for Fleas (Step By Step)</h2>
<p>Only use &ldquo;food-grade&rdquo; Diatomaceous Earth since it has no added chemicals that would otherwise poison your kids and pets.�DE used for charcoal filters or swimming pool has carcinogenic ingredients. But, many of the
pest control
DE options are crystalline in nature.
**Step 1: **
ON PPEs - For safety purposes, when applying the diatomaceous earth, put on your gardening gloves to avoid drying or dehydrating the skin. Wear a protective dust mask to prevent inhaling diatomaceous earth as this would damage your mucous membranes in the nose and mouth.
**Step 2: **
Thoroughly Vacuum the
carpet and your indoor spaces to be flea
treated before you sprinkle the DE.
**Step 3: **
To
kill all the adult fleas
, their eggs, and flea larvae - allow the diatomaceous earth powder to sit on the indoor floors and carpets for a minimum of 3-4 days before you vacuum.
**Step 4: **
Finally, reapply the diatomaceous earth powder each week for one month and ensure you vacuum only after 3-4 days.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-diatomaceous-earth-in-flea-control">Benefits of Diatomaceous Earth in Flea Control</h2>
<p>The benefits of using Diatomaceous earth in
flea control
are:
(1)
Reducing inflammation, enhancing the pet&rsquo;s skeletal system, (1) R
educing or preventing the pest burden, and enhancing the pet&rsquo;s coat and skin.
Well, let&rsquo;s discuss the benefits!</p>
<ol>
<li>Food grade or organic Diatomaceous earth in its powder form can be sprinkled onto yourcat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s coat/ fur to kill and prevent fleainfestations. Only apply the DE along the pet&rsquo;s backbone while avoiding getting it into your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s eyes.</li>
<li>Besides working great onpets like cats and dogs, Diatomaceous earth can also control lice, mites, and fleas on livestock like sheep, cows, pigs, goats, and birds.</li>
<li>DE works through mechanical operation, and thus flea and household pets can&rsquo;t develop immunity against it as it happens with the chemical flea killers.</li>
<li>Besides being an organic flea control solution that both effective andsafe for pets, Diatomaceous earth is also safe for humans and their kids.</li>
<li>Luckily, you&rsquo;ll quickly find DE in most pest control outlets in your locality or on the giant e-commerce websites online for quick delivery.</li>
<li>As a side note, DE will also be great in de-worming or for humans in preventing hip problems and other joint pains.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-diatomaceous-earth-safe-for-my-family">Is Diatomaceous Earth Safe for My Family?</h2>
<p>First, is Diatomaceous earth carcinogenicity? Well, NO! According to
<a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1999-04-05">OSHA</a>
, Diatomaceous earth is classified as a Group 3 carcinogen, and thus its no carcinogenicity to human beings.
But is DE harmful to humans? Not, if it&rsquo;s
food-grade
DE. This kind of DE will have anything below
2% crystalline silica, which is considered safe for humans.
On the flip side, inhaling the Diatomaceous earth will hurt the human lungs for a long time. Therefore,
Food-grade DE will be safe for eating, and
cosmetic
**use **
hut will scar the human lungs if inhaled.
Therefore, can you use
Diatomaceous earth to
kill fleas
in your indoor spaces? Yes, DE will be great to use indoors in killing fleas,
ants, or roaches. However, it&rsquo;s advisable not to sleep around the
treated spaces as you might inhale the DE.</p>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-in-yards">Diatomaceous Earth for fleas in Yards</h2>
<p>For yards and other outdoor spaces,
flea treatment
efforts should essentially concentrate on areas where flea larvae are mainly found. The areas include shady places, shrubbery or decks, cat/ dog bedding areas, and crawl spaces.
I was experiencing a problem with fleas in our garden. It seemed no matter my efforts; the fleas would still keep coming back. I had sprayed some over-the-counter solutions and permethrin, but I was playing a falling battle. Luckily, diatomaceous earth came into the picture to save my face against embarrassment from the fleas and ants.
So, use Diatomaceous earth to kill fleas in your deck and yard effectively. You&rsquo;ll need to sprinkle the Diatomaceous earth powder in the yard and around the house, particularly in places where the cats and dogs stay mainly.
<strong>Caution</strong>
:�Diatomaceous earth will be less effective when wet - either due to rains or just yard irrigation and watering. Therefore, DE will be more active on�concrete,�gravel, or�bare ground. Besides, you&rsquo;ll need to reapply the�Diatomaceous earth after watering the yard or following the�rains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle a handful of the Diatomaceous earth powder into the yard and let the dust drip into the flea-infested places.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use a�dust spreader that will increase your efficiency and speed or applying the�Diatomaceous earth.</li>
<li>If the prevalent weather is dry (for the next ten days), you can mix the Diatomaceous earth with water - the DE mixture will change topowder within the next one week and killthe fleas.
DE,�like any other dust, is poisonous if inhaled in large quantities. Also,�DE&rsquo;s sharp edges can harm the soft tissues in your lungs and throat. Therefore, use�safety goggles and�dust-filtering masks when handling or applying diatomaceous earth for fleas.
Despite that diatomaceous earth is not a quick-action flea solution, it&rsquo;s highly effective on heavily infested areas by fleas and fleas larvae, such as pet bedding and house.
How to locate the flea-infested yard areas
To quickly find the flea-infested areas in your yard, wear some knee-high and white socks, and stand at one location in the backyard. If fleas are in the areas you&rsquo;re standing, you&rsquo;ll see the Persky pests jumping onto your white socks.
However, massive flea infestation will be concentrated on a few critical areas instead of being in the whole yard. But yard areas that received a lot of foot traffic or extended direct sunlight won&rsquo;t experience massive flea infestations.
On the contrary, secluded and shaded areas are more prone to massive flea infestations. For example, such fields include�kennels,�doghouses, and places that dogs or cats take a rest in your yard or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-cats">Diatomaceous Earth for Fleas on Cats</h2>
<p>As a natural and thus safe flea control solution,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-cats/">Diatomaceous earth (DE) is excellent for cats</a>
. Therefore, follow the below-outlined
steps to control fleas
in cats using Diatomaceous earth.</p>
<h3 id="1check-the-flea-prone-areas">1.<strong>Check The Flea-prone areas�</strong></h3>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to identify the areas in your house and backyard that are highly prone to flea infestation - particularly places where the cat tends to spend a lot of its time.
Suspect areas include their loved�rug or�pillow, the�cat tree,�kennel, or bed. Therefore, pay special attention to the outlined regions when you&rsquo;re applying the�diatomaceous earth.</p>
<h3 id="2-vacuum-cats-sleeping-areas">2. Vacuum Cat&rsquo;s sleeping areas</h3>
<p>Next up, clean and vacuum the cat&rsquo;s sleeping things and places such as the pillow, rugs. And kennel - particularly areas where the cats mainly rest. I recommend you use a shop vac instead of the regular vacuum, as the latter would burn its motor since DE will be hard on it.
Vacuuming will assist in gathering all the fleas eggs that could be dropped in the areas. This is particularly helpful as it&rsquo;ll remove the flea eggs that the diatomaceous earth can&rsquo;t kill until the time they become a flea larva with a relatively soft exoskeleton.
<strong>3. Pour the Diatomaceous Earth�</strong>
Next up, it&rsquo;s time that you now pour the diatomaceous earth into the cat&rsquo;s resting places. I would suggest you use DE spreaders, a� tied-off sock, or a sieve. The areas to concentrate on include the cat bedding.
However, ensure that you apply the�diatomaceous earth only on the relatively dry areas as it&rsquo;ll ensure that the powder is more effective against fleas attacking your act. Also, allow the�DE to settle on the application area for about 14 days.</p>
<h3 id="4-flea-comb-your-cat">4. Flea Comb your cat</h3>
<p>Sadly so, some
fleas might survive the above harsh treatment
. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll require to
flea comb your cat
, guaranteeing that any remaining fleas are exposed, and you can now kill them using a spray or shampoo.
Ensure that the
fleas you get off the cat
fur won&rsquo;t escape. Also, repeat the
flea combing
process a couple of times a week. To clean up this diatomaceous earth, use the shop vac, some wet towels, and filterless vacuums.</p>
<h2 id="diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-dogs">Diatomaceous Earth for Fleas on Dogs</h2>
<p>You can use�Diatomaceous earth (DE) to prevent or control the number of
fleas that could be biting
your dog. Luckily, as noted above, DE is both
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-dogs/">safe and effective against fleas to use on your lovely dog</a>
. Check the flea control steps you can take on your dog using�Diatomaceous earth.</p>
<h3 id="1-consider-areas-where-your-dog-rests">1. Consider areas where your Dog rests</h3>
<p>First things first, you&rsquo;ll need to consider the places where your dog will spend its time in the house or even in the yard.
Like cats, dogs will spend their time in places such as rugs, pillows, kennels, or beds. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll have known the places you&rsquo;ll concentrate on your application of diatomaceous earth.</p>
<h3 id="2-vacuum-the-dogs-sleeping-areas">2. Vacuum the Dog&rsquo;s sleeping areas</h3>
<p>Next, vacuum the dogs sleeping and resting area, the pillow, rug, and kennels. The process will allow you to gather all the
flea eggs
that are scattered around these areas.
This is because diatomaceous earth wont readily kill the
flea eggs than the larvae
and adult flea stages as it has a protective cover.</p>
<h3 id="3-sprinkle-the-diatomaceous-earth">3. Sprinkle the Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Now, onto the main process using our diatomaceous earth. Just like when we were considering cats above, you may use a DE applicator, tied-off sock, or a simple sieve to spread the diatomaceous earth on the identified places.
The places to concentrate on are�blankets or pet beds  but this must be done with the powder in its dry form to achieve the highest level of effectiveness.
Finally, allow the Diatomaceous Earth powder to stand on the sprinkled areas for about 2-3 weeks to kill all the adult
fleas and their larvae
.</p>
<h3 id="4-flea-shampoo-your-dog">4. Flea Shampoo your Dog</h3>
<p>Allow the dog to play around the areas sprinkled with the diatomaceous earth. This allows any remaining
fleas and their larvae to jump on the dog
as they seek more blood to survive and reproduce.
Use a suitable
dog flea shampoo
, bathe the dog clean to remove and kill all the bugging fleas on the pet. Also, you can use moisturizing shampoo or soap-free to rejuvenate the pets skin. This is important because diatomaceous earth will tend to dry the dogs skin.
Finally, you should
flea comb your dog
to ensure that you eject any of the remaining fleas on the pets fur. Also, ensure you vacuum the house spaces clean in several weeks. For this process, use the shop vac type of vacuum cleaner because it wont burn its motor quickly.</p>

<p>Besides being used as food for cats, DE is also used to eliminate fleas. The following are the
steps to be followed
when using DE to eliminate fleas from your cat.
<strong>Step 1</strong>
Identify the areas your cat likes spending its time the most. Those areas will be the places youll need to focus most when applying DE. Such places could be its favorite couch, the carpet, or even the pillow.
<strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum those places where your cat likes to hang out the most. By this, you will collect any eggs that have not hatched. DE does not affect the eggs and will wait for them to hatch, so it acts.
<strong>Step 3</strong></li>
<li>Sprinkle the areas with DE. Always ensure that the surfaces are dry since damp conditions reduce the effectiveness of DE. You can use an applicator of your choice.�Leave the DE on the surfaces for some weeks.
<strong>Step 4-</strong>
Let your cat roam around the places you have applied DE for some days and then bathe it. Ensure that you use a soap-free moisturizing shampoo.
**Step 5- **
Chances are the
fleas that will not survive
the bath, vacuuming, and DE application.
Comb your cats fur using a flea comb to ascertain that no flea has been left. Do that for several days.
<strong>Step 6-</strong>
Vacuum those places you had applied to DE. The recommended vacuum cleaner is the shop vac since DE might ruin the traditional filtered vacuums.</li>

<p>Apart from using DE as food, it can be sprinkled to
kill fleas
and other insects and parasites.
For application to dogs, these are the required ingredients: Diatomaceous earth (DE), neem, and Yarrow. All the ingredients should be dry for maximum effectiveness.
These are the steps to be followed.
**Step 1 - **
Identify areas where you will apply the diatomaceous earth. You should identify where your pets spend most of their time. This might be its kernel, the carpet.
<strong>Step 2 -</strong>
Vacuum the areas where your pet
resides or hangs out the most. This might be its kernel, your carpet.
This is done to capture any
fleas and flea eggs
that may be around.�It is important to note that DE has no effect on
flea eggs
and will wait for them to hatch, so it acts on them.
**Step 3 - **
Apply DE to the area. After vacuuming, sprinkle the DE on carpets, floors, beddings once a week for 30 days.
Ensure the surfaces where you are applying are dry. Leave the sprinkled DE for several weeks before vacuuming it.
**Step 4 - **
Let your dog roam around the areas with DE for a few days, then bathe it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since bathing dogs dries their skin, so does DE; ensure that you use a soap-free moisturizing shampoo.
**Step 5 - **
There are high chances that most fleas will be eradicated after the bath, vacuuming, and use of DE.</li>
<li>You can use aflea comb on your dogfor several days to ascertain that none was left.
**Step 6 - **
Vacuum the areas where you had sprinkled the DE. The recommended vacuum cleaner is the shop vac- a professional grade.</li>
<li>Vacuuming will ensurethat you have collected any remaining fleas with their eggs, larvae, and pupae.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Apart from being ingested to kill internal worms, diatomaceous can be sprinkled to ensure the flea&rsquo;s menace is eradicated.
This is a very recommendable method since no chemicals are in use, making it safe for the pet (dog), you, and the environment.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Current flea collars are more comfortable, adjustable, non-greasy with flexible designs. Manufactures claim flea collars will offer more extended flea protection (up to months). But
*do flea collars work?� *
<strong>In Summary</strong>
<em>, YES, fleas collars will kill fleas on pets, including cats and dogs. But flea collars are different - some will repel fleas, others will kill, some kill baby fleas but other target adult fleas.�</em>
<em>But go for flea collars whose technology is adequately tested and designed - consult a veterinarian, check the product&rsquo;s label claims or the manufacturers website.�</em></p>
<h2 id="how-do-flea-collars-work">How Do Flea Collars Work?</h2>
<p>Flea collars offer 24/7 protection against fleas on your pets, including cats and dogs. Luckily, these are water-resistant and will be useful even in harsh weather like rain and water.
Flea collars are either:</p>
<h3 id="1gas-based-fleas">1.<strong>Gas based Fleas <a href="/posts/best-flea-collar-for-cats/">collar</a></strong></h3>
<p>These emit some toxic gases to repel or kill the <a href="/posts/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/">fleas</a>. The gas-based toxins will kill fleas and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-eggs-look-like/">flea eggs</a>
on contact when they come around the collar.
The emitted gas won&rsquo;t be absorbed by the pets but will instantly kill the fleas that come into contact. Luckily, the gas isn&rsquo;t absorbed into the pet&rsquo;s skin and thus not toxic to the - cats or dogs.
These gas-based fleas collar will repel and kill the fleas just on the local area near the device. Therefore, you can remove the collar when you&rsquo;re at home and return it when you&rsquo;re in the flea-prone places.</p>
<h3 id="2-high-frequency-flea-collar-">*<strong>2. High-Frequency Flea Collar</strong> *</h3>
<p>These flea collars function by releasing sound waves (ultra-sonic) to scare the bugs off from your pets.
We acknowledge the positive reports above these collars, but there are equally some negative ones out there. However, you may consider using these collars and send us a comment on their effectiveness.
**3. Absorption based Flea collars **
Absorption based Flea collar some substance that&rsquo;ll dissolve into the pet&rsquo;s skin and fatty layers, killing fleas all over their body. Some include Seresto Flea Collar and Bayer Animal Health.
The insecticides in these collars are absorbed and be distributed all over their body to kill the fleas. However, it would help if you also continued any side effects that may appear on the pet.
<strong>Other considerations?�</strong>
But some
<strong>cheap collars</strong>
will only fleas that are near the gadget - this is rather ineffective. Also, some are made up of active ingredients that are hazardous to cats and dogs.
While at it,
<strong>Seresto flea collar</strong>
is a reliable device to repel and kill fleas &amp; ticks on dogs and cats for eight months. Thus, the bugs won&rsquo;t transmit dangerous diseases or causes irritation on pets no more.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hftw4nqNPqg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hftw4nqNPqg</a>
The collars effectively deliver the high-quality active ingredients on the pet&rsquo;s hair or skin surface - the fleas&rsquo; hiding place. Luckily, flea collars will continually repel an kill fleas on the pets.
**Bad odour? **
No current flea collars won&rsquo;t release that kind of pungent odours. The devices will slow-release the active ingredients onto the pet&rsquo;s skin - reducing chances of strong odours.
<strong>Custom-fit?</strong>
The flea collar must be the right fit for your pet - a custom or adjustable fit would be even better to minimise hassle
and stress that comes to a flea attack. Cut off the leftover collar length from the collar to prevent biting and chewing.</p>
<p>But how tight must be the flea collars? Ensure that 2-fingers (pointer &amp; middle fingers) can fit between the pet&rsquo;s neck and the flea collar when you&rsquo;ve fastened it enough. Ensure that the collar is not too tight - but keep it snug.
<strong>Scheduled replacement?</strong>
However, check and adhere to collar replacement schedule as outlined on the product notes. Also, inspect the collar&rsquo;s fit regularly - particularly for growing pets.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients-in-flea-collars">Ingredients in Flea Collars</h2>
<p>**Propoxur **
rapidly kills down the fleas&rsquo; nervous system. Therefore, it has a quick knockdown effect - within 24 hours, the Propoxur ingredient will kill the fleas and their larvae.
However, Propoxur is also toxic to human beings, and thus you must wash your hand after touching the flea collar as you clip it on your pet. Further, keep the propoxur-based flea collars from kids.
<strong>Amitraz</strong>
will mainly appear in preventative flea collars. Your ingredients will kill the ticks and fleas. Luckily, the flea collars will prevent flea infestation on the cats or dogs for about three months - if they continue wearing the collar.
<strong>Deltamethrin</strong>
(synthetic Pyrethroid) will mainly be in the Preventef-D and Adams Delta Force and is considered a safer insecticide. It is similar to the Pyrethrin that&rsquo;ll be in chrysanthemum.</p>
<h2 id="benefitsofflea"><strong>Benefits</strong>of<strong>Flea****Collars</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-prevent-skin-infections">1. Prevent Skin Infections</h3>
<p>Flea collars will help reduce the risk of infection on your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s skin. This is because it reduces the pet&rsquo;s saliva&rsquo;s chances of causing itching, scratching, and allergies.</p>
<p>Therefore, your pets won&rsquo;t over-scratch their skin which would otherwise lead to wounds, skin infections, or even hot spots - this would mean diseases, stress and diseases.</p>
<h3 id="2-long-residue-effect"><strong>2. Long Residue Effect�</strong></h3>
<p>Fleas collars have a long residue effect - depending on the type used - either the gas-based fleas collar, high-frequency flea collar or absorption-based flea collars.</p>
<p>Some fleas collars may continually kill fleas on your pets for about eight months. Compare this to the shorter-term spot-on spray that may only be effective against fleas for 30 days.</p>
<p>Further, collars are highly budget-friendly besides offering better protection against bugs, eggs, and larvae. Thus, you might only require to replace the flea collars after like 8 - 12 months.</p>
<h3 id="3-prevents-atapeworm-infestation">3. Prevents aTapeworm infestation</h3>
<p>Flea collar will addition help prevent an infestation of tapeworms on your pets. This is because fleas are bugs known to carry and transmit tapeworms.
Sadly, tapeworms (transmitted also be fleas) will make your dog and cats experience stomach pains and upsets. Further, puppies and kittens could suffer anaemia, intestinal blockage, and stunted growth.
Further, the collars will prevent the fleas from getting into your indoor spaces. The devices will sit pretty on the pet&rsquo;s neck and thus continually repel and kill fleas.</p>
<h3 id="4-flea-collars-are-convenient">4. Flea Collars are Convenient</h3>
<p>But how would you ensure that the collars fit correctly on your pet? Well, these collars are straightforward and convenient to use since you&rsquo;ll only need to fit it into the pet&rsquo;s neck - not too tight or loose.</p>
<p>No prescription is needed, but you&rsquo;ll need to report any bad skin reactions to your veterinary. However, some of the flea collars won&rsquo;t offer protection for the whole pet body.</p>
<p>Some fleas collars are even custom-fit, and hence it&rsquo;ll be easy and quick to fit them on your pet with minimal hassle or stress. But adhere to the manufacturer&rsquo;s guides. Further, it has no drying period, and thus you won&rsquo;t have to wait.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-a-flea-collar-to-work">How Long Does It Take a Flea Collar to Work?</h2>
<p>Most flea collars (particularly the chemical brands) begin killing fleas in 24 hours, and you may notice a decline of fleas in 3 to 4 weeks. However, the residue effect of the collars may last for 5-12 months.
But natural fleas collars require more time to show reliable flea control results. However, as you use the collars consider the
<a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i2/EPA-finds-risks-flea-collar.html">mild reported risk of flea collars</a>
.
The fleas collars&rsquo; time of action mainly depends on factors such as the pet&rsquo;s condition, flea infestation stages, hygiene, fleas collar type and manufacturer, and the active ingredients used, including tetrachlorvinphos, imidacloprid, and flumethrin.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Flea collars are an effective flea control method on your pets, including cats and dogs. Consider the various types of collars available, including the gaseous collars and absorption type of flea collars.</p>

<p>Flea bites trigger inflammation, itching, and anemia due to blood loss to the parasitic insect in petshowever, it&rsquo;s
clear that fleas
also bite humans.
An adult flea can jump about 150x its height, but they&rsquo;ll also easily move around by
hitchhiking on humans
and pets - mainly cats and dogs while moving around the house or yard.
Fleas will bite
humans on their lower extremities - ankles, feet, lower legs, calves. Therefore, the yard or lawn bugs will target camping blankets, pant legs, stockings, and shoes.
With 3 months (their whole lifespan), adult fleas will bring forth
400 to 500 baby fleas
. However, fleas are mainly left in your yard by wild animals like skunks, raccoons, and moles - check these
durable moles traps
.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-fleas-bite-humans">Where Do Fleas Bite Humans?</h2>
<p>So, is this the case for humans? Well, in this post, I&rsquo;ve tackled this highly itchy question, &ldquo;where do
fleas bite
humans?&rdquo;
<strong>The short answer is</strong>
,
fleas will bite humans
on their lower legs, calves, ankles, feet, and (though rarely) the head, groin, and chest area.</p>
<p>Therefore, rarely will the bites happen above the human knee unless you&rsquo;re lying or sitting on the groundRelated:
How to Get Rid of Fleas
.</p>
<h3 id="1-feet-and-ankles--regular-flea-bites">1. Feet and Ankles -�Regular Flea Bites</h3>
<p>Fleas will bite and suck blood from any part of the human body. But,
cat fleas will jump
a maximum of 5.2 inches -7.9 inches. This height is merely just below the human knees, which means thats where the fleas will land.
When fleas land on the human skin, the
bugs start biting
and sucking blood instantly without roaming or moving around carelessly. Hence,
flea bites will occur more commonly
on humans on the lower legs, calves, ankles, and feet.
<strong>- Bare Skin above Sock Line</strong>
As a rule of thumb, fleas wont bite
through your clothing
either various fabrics, socks, or jeans. But no too fast!�Fleas might actually bite through your thin, loose-fitting clothes like yoga pants, pantyhose, and tights.
Fleas will generally move around while under the clothes and s stay in this hiding situation unless theyre
biting your exposed skin
.
Hence, putting on pants and socks will block fleas from biting you. But, these nasty
bugs may still attack and bite
you on any bare skin just above your sock line. You can
prevent such flea bites
by tucking the pant legs into your socks.</p>
<h3 id="2-above-human-knees--rare-flea-bites">2. Above Human Knees -�Rare Flea Bites</h3>
<p>Fleas will rarely bite
anywhere above the human
. Despite that
cat fleas
can jump about 8 inches, it&rsquo;s not so high of a jump to reach above your knees.
Therefore, fleas wont jump enough to reach above the human knee, and thus most flea bites wont be found in these areas. You can use
flea bombs
to control a major flea infestation in your house.
<strong>- Upper Body Parts�</strong>
However, as noted above, fleas bites above your knee can be witnesses in cases where youre lying or sitting on an infested
place or near the flea
bedding.
If fleas breed uncontrollably, they may spread in many areas and could bite humans on the upper legs, waist, head, pubic area, and the denser parts of their hairs on the chest.
<strong>- Human Head�</strong>
Flea bites on the human head are rare because this body part is so far from the ground, and fleas cant jump that high. For example, fleas could bite your wrists in some rare circumstances.
Nevertheless, such high-octane might still happen when a person is sitting on the floor, and thus the fleas will easily reach the upper body parts.</p>
<h3 id="3-neck-and-scalp">3. Neck and Scalp</h3>
<p>Fleas may bite your neck, but this only happens in major flea infestations. Again, flea bites on either your head, face, or scalp will mainly happen if youre sitting or sleeping on flea-infested ground or near flea bedding.
Equally, you should know that sharing your
bed or couch will a flea-infested dog
or cat may also encourage fleas to attack your head and neck.</p>
<h2 id="fleas-prefer-cats-and-dogs-as-their-primary-hosts">Fleas Prefer Cats and Dogs as their Primary Hosts</h2>
<p>Fleas bites on human beings will mainly be instigated by human fleas, cat fleas, and
dog fleas
. Further, the flea bites on your skin will mainly appear in clusters or large groups. If you&rsquo;re overly sensitive to flea bites, you might get red bumps or hives.
Cat fleas
rarely jump off the bodies of your household pets, including cats and dogs. So, its definite that fleas will always prefer biting
pets over attacking humans since
we dont have body hair where they can hide.
Thus, fleas will hitchhike onto humans (
fleas don&rsquo;t stay on humans
)  during which time they bite the human skin about 2-3 times.
However, whenever disturbed when feeding on your human blood, the
fleas will hide
under your clothes for a maximum of 24 hours. Also, when the cat fleas can trace their way out of your clothes, theyll continue feeding on your blood periodically.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-why-do-fleas-bite">When and Why do Fleas Bite?</h2>
<p>Fleas detect the volatile organic compound (VOC) released from the human body, mainly due to body odor and skin flora, and can readily select their prey.
<strong>~~� Fun Facts ~~�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas will suck blood thats about 15 times their body weight.</li>
<li>The flea eggs have short spikes thatll allow the bug to stick on its host strongly.</li>
<li>After prickling the hosts skin, the flea injects saliva that acts like an Anesthesia. But the saliva may trigger allergic reactions in both humans and pets. Related:
Reliable Roach Killers
.
Further, adult female fleas require to suck more blood compared to their male counterparts. This is because female fleas require more energy to breed or reproduce.
So, if youre wondering, flea bites will mainly be small red dots (which may progress into large patches of redness) that arise from skin injury and allergic reactions due to the flea bite.
Definitely, after a flea bite, a cat, dog, or human being will scratch their itchy skin, and this may result in infections.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-bite-humans">How Do Fleas Bite Humans?</h2>
<p>Fleas use their specially
developed mouths to bite the human
skin and suck blood from their capillaries. The mouth has 3 key stylets that are shaped like some tiny needles.</p>
<h3 id="1-exploratory-probing">1. Exploratory Probing</h3>
<p>Fleas find a good site for biting on humans using the labial palps. Next, the insect pierces the skin in what&rsquo;s known as exploratory probing.
<em>Related:�Best Bed Bug Steamer.�</em>
Two parts of the mouth will bite the human skin cutting it to suitable blood vessels. The insects introduce the anticoagulant saliva to assist in locating human blood.</p>
<h3 id="2-skin-piercing-and-drawing-blood">2. Skin Piercing and Drawing Blood</h3>
<p>Then, the fascicle or epipharynx (needle-like stylet) will go into the capillary and suck blood. The probing process will lead to lesions clusters due to biting reactions.
The flea&rsquo;s maxillary laciniae readily pierces the human epidermis. The middle epipharynx tip goes into the blood vessel, enabling the blood to move up into their fleas body.
The insect has muscles on its fore-gut that&rsquo;ll easily contact to produce some suction force and pump more blood into the flea&rsquo;s body. The blood meal travels easily via the esophagus, and it&rsquo;s mid-gut ready for digestion.</p>
<h4 id="3-saliva-anticoagulant-introduction">3. Saliva (anticoagulant) introduction</h4>
<p>Finally, once the flea has a good blood meal, it&rsquo;ll open its 4 salivary glands and release some anticoagulant into the human body through the needle-like mouth-parts - this prevents blood clotting.
The fleas&rsquo; salivary glands are placed in their abdomen, and thus only long ducts will link it to the insect&rsquo;s mouth.
During the blood-feeding process, the glans will open and drop saliva on the tissues around the wound on the human skin.</p>
<h3 id="4-movement-in-feeding">4. Movement in Feeding</h3>
<p>The anticoagulant in the flea&rsquo;s saliva tends to imbibe blood. The saliva will also soften and spread the human skin tissues, allowing effortless insertion and equal
removal of the flea
fascicle.
So, fleas are vessel feeders as contrasted to bugs that are pool feeders. The human&rsquo;s blood pressure benefits the flea to allow faster feeding - leaving limited or no hemorrhage.
If the insect is disrupted during the feeding process, it&rsquo;ll jump off the human or pet host and only come back to another site shortly. Thus, flea bites on humans will result in multiple nearby bite spots.</p>
<h3 id="5-blooddigestion">5. Blood�Digestion</h3>
<p>Once the flea has imbibed enough blood, the pro-ventricular gut will behave like a valve and hence hinder blood regurgitation chances.
The pro-ventricular gut sprays the ingredients and digestive enzymes necessary for blood digestion. Blood will be digested in the mid-gut that looks like a sac, and later the contents move to the hind-gut.
But female fleas will digest the host blood faster than the male fleas - this is interpreted because the females need more energy and nutrition to create and lay
flea eggs
.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-flea-bite-look-like-on-humans">What Does Flea Bite Look Like On Humans?</h2>
<p>Fleas bites on humans appear like small and reddish dots that exist in 3-4 clusters or groups. The dots will have some light halo or redness surrounding them.
The bites and redness will mainly be found around the lower part of the human body - ankles, feet, lower legs, calves. However, if left alone, the fleas will move all over the body biting more parts of your skin.
Bites are tiny but have a red spot at the center - but when clustered, the bites will create a scab or line that&rsquo;s also irritating and painful to the person.</p>
<h2 id="are-flea-bites-dangerous-for-humans">Are Flea Bites Dangerous For Humans?</h2>
<h3 id="1-pulex-irritans-human-flea"><em>1. Pulex irritans (Human flea)�</em></h3>
<p>The CDC states that human fleas don&rsquo;t carry diseases that can infect humans when bitten. But these fleas may act as intermediate hosts for some parasitic tapeworms.</p>
<h3 id="2murine-typhus--cat-flea">*2.�*Murine Typhus -<em>Cat flea�</em></h3>
<p>Flea bites can cause Murine typhus in humans, mainly carried by rats and transferred to humans by fleas. Fleas defecate around the bite area, leaving the
*Rickettsia Typhi *
bacteria.
As noted earlier, cat fleas love pet hosts, including cats and dogs, compared to human hosts. However, cat fleas will also bite humans and cause diseases such as typhus, cat-scratch conditions, and plague.
Murine typhus in humans will be known by signs such as body aches, nausea, fever, and headache. In the first week, you&rsquo;ll see some rash on your body, legs, and arms.
Untreated Murine typhus will lead to other diseases like kidney disease and diabetes.</p>
<h3 id="3-cat-scratch-disease--chigoe-flea">3. Cat Scratch Disease -�Chigoe flea</h3>
<p>Bites from Chigoe fleas are equal dangers to humans as they&rsquo;ll lead to infections or sometimes amputation.
Chigoe flea can cause
Bartonella henselae
that&rsquo;ll trigger a scratch fever, particularly in cats and kittens. You&rsquo;ll notice the occurrence of this condition if the cat is lethargic or vomiting.
These fleas leave a wound that can attract infections and diseases. However, Chigoe
fleas won&rsquo;t carry any diseases as the other cat
fleas do.
The fleas will transmit the cat-scratch disease to humans through bites or the cat when they scratch, lick, or bite a human being&rsquo;s skin - particularly around scabbed or wounded skin areas.</p>
<h3 id="4mycoplasma-haemofelis--oriental-rat-flea">4.�Mycoplasma haemofelis -�Oriental Rat Flea</h3>
<p>Bites from Oriental rat fleas will lead to the bubonic plague or
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_dg_lyme_disease">Lyme disease</a>
in humans and dogs.
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/mycoplasma-haemofelis"><em>Mycoplasma haemofelis</em></a>
will be transmitted through bites from oriental cat fleas.
Mycoplasma haemofelis will infect the red blood cells, which will eventually cause
anemia
in humans and pets, particularly those with weaker immune systems.
Antibiotics can be used to treat Mycoplasma haemofelis, but pets, including cats and dogs, should be given a blood transfusion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas mainly emerge in the warm months and will bite the warm-blooded mammal to feed on their blood - the

.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleabites will cause you discomfort, allergic reactions, and red spots encircled by reddish bumps.</li>
<li>Fleas will attack the whole body of your household pets like dogs and cats.
Fleas, particularly cat fleas, will bite humans, cats, or dogs within seconds to a few minutes after landing on the host. Besides, the fleas will have sucked their full blood meal from the host within 10 to 25 minutes.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="details-do-fleas-drown-in-water">Details: Do Fleas Drown In Water?</h2>
<p>For the fleas to drown in water, it will depend on the surface tension of the water that you are subjecting them to. Further, it also matters whether you float or submerge the fleas.
In water with normal surface tension, fleas will just float and even jump away from danger. But if they submerge the fleas in normal water, they&rsquo;ll drown within 24 hours - you may also use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-trap/">flea traps</a>
.
But if you put fleas in dish soap water, they will drown in a matter of seconds. Next time you consider drowning as a means of eliminating fleas from your area, you are wrong.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJeDI9vw6eA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJeDI9vw6eA</a></p>
<h2 id="why-dont-fleas-die-when-floated-on-water"><strong>Why Dont Fleas Die When Floated on Water?</strong></h2>
<p>Fleas wont die that fast when floated in water because of their body anatomy. A closer look at its body shows that fleas have a wax-like coating that covers its whole body.</p>
<ul>
<li>This wax-like coating is also called the cuticle.</li>
<li>It is this cuticle that plays an important role in preventing water entry into the fleas respiratory system giving its adaptive mechanism in the water.
Its this cuticle that also allows these fleas to easily penetrate into pets far and into the skin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-drown-fleas"><strong>How to Drown Fleas?�</strong></h2>
<p>Though the wax-coating makes it hard to drown fleas, there are techniques that you can use to get rid of these disturbing pests.
The easiest and fastest way to kill fleas by drowning is to mix dish soap with water. Why is the dish soap water method effective?</p>
<ul>
<li>Dish soap destroys the wax-coating of the fleas and therefore when the fleas drown, water easily gets into the respiratory system and the fleas drown instantly.</li>
<li>Without the dish soap, fleas can survive submerged in water for more than 24 hours increasing their chances of survival.
Another advantage of using dish soap water to drown fleas is because it destroys the water surface tension. This surface tension keeps the fleas afloat and can even escape. But when it is destroyed, they will be submerged and drown in the process.
If you want to get rid of the fleas from your pet, foamless dish soap works best. The biggest challenge with foamy soap is that it allows time for fleas to escape. You can get yourself a formless dish soap from the local outlets.
For effective fleas elimination, dip the dog or your pet into the water at least 2-4 times. You also need to take precautions not to immerse the dog&rsquo;s head because the dish soap may harm the dogs eyes and ears too.</li>
<li>I would also recommend the use of lukewarm water for the effective elimination of fleas. That said and done, dont leave your dog when wet to go and play.</li>
<li>It is good to make a point of drying it by whatever means. I would recommend you use a hairdryer to dry the dog&rsquo;s fur.</li>
<li>The good thing with a dryer is that it produces some heat that has the capacity to kill any fleas hiding under the fur as you dry your pet.
However, this method of killing fleas is very tricky especially if your dog is big. Lifting them and immersing them in the dish soap mixed with water is difficult.</li>
<li>There are other like fleas shampoo and also using food grade diatomaceous earth (DE).</li>
<li>The food-grade DE is a pet and human-safe powder that you can use to control disturbing pests and bugs in your home.
When using this powder, you can sprinkle it on your pet and allow it to effectively kill the fleas. After about an hour, you can use a comb to clear out the dead fleas from the fur.

<h3 id="should-i-use-dishwater-soap-regularly-to-bathe-my-pet"><strong>Should I Use Dishwater Soap Regularly To Bathe My Pet?</strong></h3>
<p>Much as dishwater soap is very effective in eliminating fleas in your dog, it also has its disadvantages and should not be used regularly to wash your dog.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dishwater has a dehydrating effect on the dogs skin which may cause a long time effect on the pet.</li>
<li>It also has an irritating effect on the dog and may also be a cause of diseases and infections.
Avoid using dishwater soap on a dog that has a skin infection because it will further aggravate the infection.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="does-hot-water-kill-fleas-in-cats-and-dogs"><strong>Does Hot Water Kill Fleas in Cats And Dogs?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes. Hot water can also be used ineffectively killing fleas in your pet.
The only challenge remains that fleas can easily sense the hot water and jump from the host only to come back later and re-infest.</p>
<h2 id="if-dogs-swim-in-water-will-it-kill-the-fleas"><strong>If Dogs Swim in Water, Will it Kill The Fleas?</strong></h2>
<p>Swimming does not kill the fleas in the dogs fur.
Most river or lake water is normal water that will hardly penetrate the cuticle of the flea and therefore unable to kill them.
Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-kills-fleas-in-the-yard-naturally/">Kills Fleas in the Yard Naturally?</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do fleas drown in water? An outright yes. But, this does not happen with all types of water. For normal water, they may not drown because of the presence of surface tension and also because of their anatomy.
Fleas float on normal water and can survive up to 7 days but when they drown, they may take up to 24 hours before they drown and die.
If you add dish soap, to any normal water, it destroys the surface tension and also destroys the cuticle that makes fleas survive for long before they drown.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas are notorious for causing discomfort and irritation to both pets and humans. One common question people have about fleas is whether they have antennae. The short answer is yesfleas do have antennae, and they play a crucial role in helping them navigate their environment. In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore the role of antennae in fleas and how they contribute to the <a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">flea</a>&rsquo;s survival.</p>
<h2 id="flea-anatomy-the-role-of-antennae">Flea Anatomy: The Role of <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-antennae/">Antennae</a></h2>
<p>Fleas are small, wingless insects that rely on a variety of sensory organs to detect their surroundings. One of the most important sensory organs for a flea is its antennae. These antennae are primarily used for detecting vibrations, chemical signals, and air currents. Let&rsquo;s dive deeper into how these antennae work and their role in a flea&rsquo;s life cycle.</p>
<h3 id="1-flea-antennae-structure">1. Flea Antennae Structure</h3>
<p>Fleas have two antennae located on the front part of their heads. These antennae are quite short and have several segments, which are covered in sensory hairs. These sensory hairs help the flea detect changes in its environment, such as the presence of a potential host. The antennae are not used for flying (since fleas are wingless), but rather for sensing their surroundings and helping the flea find food, shelter, and mates.</p>
<h3 id="2-how-fleas-use-their-antennae">2. How Fleas Use Their Antennae</h3>
<p>Fleas use their antennae to sense the world around them. They can detect the slightest vibrations, which helps them detect when a host animal is nearby. They can also pick up chemical signals released by potential hosts, guiding them toward a food source. Additionally, fleas can sense changes in air currents, which can alert them to danger or new opportunities in their environment.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-role-of-antennae-in-flea-behavior">3. The Role of Antennae in Flea Behavior</h3>
<p>Fleas rely heavily on their antennae during the process of finding a host. For instance, when they sense vibrations, they can tell if an animal is walking nearby. The antennae help them detect the heat and carbon dioxide released by animals, which is essential in locating a host to feed on. This ability to detect the presence of a host makes fleas effective parasites, as they can quickly find their next meal.</p>
<h3 id="4-flea-antennae-and-communication">4. Flea Antennae and Communication</h3>
<p>While fleas don&rsquo;t communicate in the same way that social insects like ants or bees do, their antennae can help them detect chemical signals that may be related to mating. Male fleas, for example, can use their antennae to detect the presence of a female flea in the area. This sense of chemical detection helps fleas find mates and reproduce effectively.</p>
<h3 id="5-antennae-and-flea-control">5. Antennae and Flea Control</h3>
<p>Understanding the role of antennae in flea behavior can help in the development of better flea control methods. Since fleas rely on their antennae for detecting hosts and environmental cues, disrupting this sensory mechanism can be an effective strategy for flea control. Some flea treatments and repellents may target the sensory hairs or chemicals that fleas use to detect their surroundings, making it harder for them to locate a host and breed.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fleas do indeed have antennae, and these antennae play a critical role in their survival. They help fleas detect vibrations, chemical signals, and air currents, which are essential for finding a host and reproducing. By understanding the role of flea antennae, we can develop more effective strategies for managing flea infestations and protecting our pets and homes from these pesky parasites.</p>

      <title>Do Fleas Have Wings</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/do-fleas-have-wings/</link>

      <description>*So, how do fleas move? Do fleas have wings?� *</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*So, how do fleas move? Do fleas have wings?� *
Wondering if
<a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/ipm/uploads/files/Fleas.pdf">fleas</a>
have wings, can they fly like
gnats?
or do these clitters jump like frogs?</p>
<p>Fleas are tiny insects of the Siphonaptera order that&rsquo;ll feed off human or animal blood.
Fleas move quickly and it may seem like they fly. Most of their over 2,000 types, like human fleas or cat fleas have strong legs, flat bodies and a length of ~ 0.1 inches.
<strong>Well, the short answer is, No, fleas don&rsquo;t have wings. The suffix�&quot;</strong>
*aptera&quot; in *
**Siphonaptera **
*order *
**denote that fleas are **
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptera">wingless arthropods</a>
** - like most ectoparasites such as **
<strong>ticks</strong>
<strong>.�</strong>
<strong>Fleas use their powerful and tiny legs to jump (about 8 inches vertically) or move between hairs of host animal. Fleas, besides froghoppers, have the highest jump-body size ratio.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-fleas-have-wings-9-faqs-for-fleas">Details: Do Fleas Have Wings? 9 FAQs for Fleas</h2>
<p>So, fleas have no wings. The suffix aptera in the order Siphonaptera (a Greek word) denotes that fleas are wingless while siphon is interpreted as siphon.</p>
<p>Most ectoparasites attacking mammals and birds - lice, bedbugs, ticks, and fleas -
cant fly
and lack functional wings. They use legs to walk around but, to move quickly or further, fleas use the powerful but tiny legs to jump.
The over 2,000 <a href="/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/">flea</a> types including human fleas, cat fleas, oriental rat fleas, dog fleas lack wings and thus can&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<h2 id="how-fleas-lost-their-wings">How Fleas Lost their Wings</h2>
<p>Scientific evidence points that fleas had winged ancestors and they lost their wings along the evolution journey. Fleas &ldquo;originated&rdquo; from order Mecoptera. Boreidae insects like snow scorpion-flies are considered to have been the descendants of fleas.
Fleas were not originally parasites in mammals for ages - they were free-living. But when they moved into their parasitic tendencies they ended burrowed in their hosts&rsquo;s bodies - mainly mammals.
Therefore, flying capability and wings became useless in the fleas&rsquo; new life. In fact, wings would tend to hinder their parasitic life as they tried to burrow into their hosts&rsquo;s bodies. Thus, flea wings degenerated in the evolution process.</p>
<h2 id="adapations-in-fleas-for-movement-jumping">Adapations in Fleas for movement (Jumping)</h2>
<p>Fleas move from one place or host (animal) by
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/02/flea-jumping-mechanics/">jumping with their</a>
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/02/flea-jumping-mechanics/">spring-loaded feet</a>
(about 5 feet high) using their strong but tiny hind legs. Also, the fleas&rsquo;
<a href="http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio210/s2012/dorshors_jaco/adaptation.htm">flattened, small body</a>
allow the fleas to easily hide on the animal&rsquo;s hair.
Despite the fleas&rsquo; wings had degenerated, their flight structures were retained and modified to ease its jumping. Fleas have pleural arch that&rsquo;s akin to wing-hinge ligaments found in flying insects.
This
<a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-6-41">pleural arch has resilin</a>
which allow storage of energy required for fleas to make their
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-high-can-fleas-jump/">giant flea jumps - about 5.2 inches vertically</a>
. Also, fleas have flight muscles (basalars and subalars) plus tergo-trochanteral depressor - its starter muscle.
Fleas lack wings and thus won&rsquo;t fly. But fleas don&rsquo;t require the wings to move as they can jump easily with their powerful legs. Fleas will use their powerful legs for clinging on hosts like humans.
Fleas (especially adult fleas) will stick on the skin of their hosts such as pets and mammals while sucking blood. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll take their full feed and lay over
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/">100 flea eggs</a>
daily.
But fleas are toxic bugs that can spread dangerous diseases such as plague and typhus. As the flea jump from one pet or human to another, they&rsquo;ll ready spread the diseases such as Bubonic plague.</p>
<h2 id="what-looks-like-a-flea-but-has-wings">What Looks Like a Flea But Has Wings?</h2>
<p>Have you seen some bugs looking like fleas but can fly? Well, those are definitely not fleas since fleas can only jump but can&rsquo;t fly - these might be small
fruit flies
or
gnats
.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Fruit flies</em>- So, fruit flies are the most regular visitors around your house or yard that you may confuse with fleas. Fruit flies will mainly follow and land around rotten and smelly vegetables and fruits.</li>
<li><em>Fungus gnat</em>- Next up are the tiny fungus gnat that you&rsquo;ll see near windows or houseplants - thus these will definitely look like fleas, they&rsquo;l fly and feed on various houseplants.</li>
<li><em>Dog ticks, Springtails</em>etc. - These smaller bugs that also look like fleas but don&rsquo;t have wings include dog ticks, springtails, flour beetles, black carpet beetles, and springtails.</li>
<li>However, these ones -<a href="http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/stored/drugstore_beetle.htm">drugstore</a>and cigarette beetles have wings but also look like fleas.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-fleas-move-over-long-distances">How Fleas Move Over Long Distances?</h2>
<p>Do fleas have wings? Can they fly?
As noted above, fleas won&rsquo;t fly as they lack wings like other Siphonaptera insects. Thus, fleas rely on their jumping capability or attaching their-selves on humans or host animals to move over long distances.
Notably, fleas will hitchhike their hosts including rodents like mice and rats. In addition, the critters may attach on socks and shoes worn by humans as they move around the house or yard.</p>
<h2 id="do-baby-fleas-jump-orcrawl">Do Baby Fleas Jump or�Crawl?</h2>
<p>First, note that in reality &ldquo;baby flea&rdquo; don&rsquo;t exist. Definitely, flea eggs will hatch to become larvae but won&rsquo;t be adequately developed to be considered as baby fleas - they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;blobs&rdquo;.
The blind fleas will thus require additional time to grow. Therefore, the blobs create cocoons around their body and will thus continue developing to adulthood.
The fleas will attain their
adulthood while inside their cocoons - its
referred
to as &quot;
<a href="http://www.cvbd.org/en/flea-borne-diseases/about-fleas/development-cycle/preemerged-adult/">quiescent phase</a>
&quot; in the life-cycle of the fleas. During this time, the fleas will reduce their
metabolism and thus won&rsquo;t require feeding.
In addition, in the quiescent phase, the fleas will remain motionless in their cocoon as they wait to hatch - for even 5 months. Thus, in their &ldquo;baby&rdquo; stage, fleas don&rsquo;t move around but will be fixed in their cocoons.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, we&rsquo;ve outlined that fleas cannot fly since they&rsquo;re wingless insects. But these bugs have strong legs that help them in jumping from one place or host to another.
In addition, fleas will hitchhike humans, shoes, or clothes such as socks to move over long distances as the animals transit to different places.</p>

incidental
.
But adult fleas will bite and suck blood from humans, cats, dogs, and outdoor animals like opossums, foxes, and rodents both for survival and reproduction purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>*So, in this post, I&rsquo;ve answered this question &ldquo;do fleas stay on humans?&rdquo; **The short answer is YES and NO! *<em>Cat fleas can survive and breed by feeding exclusively on human blood. Female fleas must suck human blood for many hours to reproduce effectively. This is only possible in laboratory settings.�Most fleas species can&rsquo;t live in humans because we lack hair.�</em></li>
<li><em>But human fleas have elongated hind legs and measure about 1.5-3mm, which allows them to hide under the human skin for a bit longer. Overall, fleas will stay on humans for a maximum of 24 hours before jumping onto their preferred host like cats and dogs.�</em>

<p>Cat, dog, or human fleas have
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/flea/infographic/flea-habitats-home">different preferred hosts</a>
. Despite that all of them can feed on a non-preferred host, their fertility is significantly reduced.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the female fleas&rsquo; ovaries won&rsquo;t develop fully when provided on a non-preferred host.
Side note: You can control the fleas on both humans and pets using products the appropriate products like
cleaning shampoos
,
flea repellents
, and
flea bombs
.
Cat fleas (
<em>C. felis</em>
) won&rsquo;t prefer humans as their primary hosts since dieting reduces their fertility.
Notably, cat fleas are thought to have evolved match the chemical composition of ions and proteins in the cat&rsquo;s blood, which allows them to have higher egg production.
Of the more than 2,000 flea species, only the human fleas will stay on humans for a bit long since it has adapted for that purpose - it has extended hind legs and measures about 1.5-3mm in their body length.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas are tiny parasitic insects that feed on the blood of mammals and birds. While they are not capable of causing harm on their own, <a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">flea</a> infestations can cause serious issues for both pets and humans. One of the most common questions people have about fleas is whether or not they actually suck blood. Lets explore this question in detail.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-fleas-do">What Do Fleas Do?</h2>
<p>Fleas are external parasites that rely on the blood of a host to survive. Fleas are equipped with specialized mouthparts designed for piercing the skin and feeding on blood. When a flea lands on a host, it uses its sharp, needle-like mouthparts to pierce the skin and access the blood vessels beneath. Once they begin feeding, fleas can consume a significant amount of blood relative to their size.</p>
<h2 id="do-fleas-suck-blood">Do Fleas Suck Blood?</h2>
<p>Yes, fleas do suck blood. They have specialized mouthparts called
<em>stylets</em>
that allow them to pierce the skin of their host and feed on blood. Fleas typically feed multiple times a day, and a single flea can consume several times its body weight in blood. Their bites are itchy and can cause irritation and inflammation in the skin. The saliva of fleas can also cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-feed">How Do Fleas Feed?</h2>
<p>When a flea bites a host, it injects saliva containing anticoagulants into the skin to prevent the blood from clotting. This allows the flea to feed uninterrupted. Fleas have a specialized feeding tube that enables them to suck up the blood from the hosts skin. Unlike mosquitoes, which feed by sucking blood through a needle-like proboscis, fleas actually pierce the skin with their mouthparts to feed.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-fleas-suck-blood">What Happens When Fleas Suck Blood?</h2>
<p>As fleas feed on blood, they can cause discomfort and lead to various health issues. Some of the most common problems associated with flea bites include:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Itching:**Flea bites often cause itching and inflammation, which can lead to scratching and further skin irritation.</li>
<li>**Allergic reactions:**Flea saliva can trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, leading to hives, swelling, and other symptoms.</li>
<li>**Flea-borne diseases:**Fleas can transmit diseases such as the plague and flea-borne typhus. Fleas are also known to transmit tapeworms to pets and humans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-fleas-only-suck-blood-from-pets">Do Fleas Only Suck Blood from Pets?</h2>
<p>While fleas are often associated with pets like dogs and cats, they can also feed on humans and other animals. Fleas are opportunistic feeders, meaning that they will jump onto any available host to feed. Pets with flea infestations may experience more frequent flea bites, but humans and other mammals are also at risk if fleas are present in the environment.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-flea-infestations">How to Prevent Flea Infestations</h2>
<p>To prevent flea infestations, it is important to regularly check your pets for fleas, use flea preventatives, and keep your living environment clean. If you notice fleas on your pets or in your home, it is essential to act quickly to address the issue and prevent it from spreading.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas do suck blood. These parasites are equipped with specialized mouthparts that allow them to pierce the skin and feed on blood. While flea bites can cause discomfort, they can also lead to more serious health issues, including allergic reactions and the transmission of diseases. It is important to take steps to prevent flea infestations and to seek treatment if you suspect you have a flea problem.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sleeping with you are cat or dog on the bed is quite cozy and soothing but this may turn out different if the pet has <a href="/posts/can-dog-fleas-transfer-to-humans/">fleas</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychological snuggling or sleeping next to your pet has been documented to<a href="https://www.sleepassociation.org/sleep-news/pets-may-help-you-sleep-better/">reduce anxiety and stress</a>from work or school.
So, youre wondering; your dog has fleas and sleeps in my bed, what should you do? Is it safe?
Well, fleas don&rsquo;t generally jump onto humans and bite them but they do occasionally. Therefore if the dog has fleas and it sleeps on your bed, you could end up with a massive <a href="/posts/how-to-tell-if-your-dog-has-fleas/">flea</a> problem, or (at the minimum) the fleas might just bite you while you&rsquo;re sleeping and leave you with itchy or painful skin.
Fleas will bite pets such as cats and dogs
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-dog-fleas-transfer-to-humans/">but will also bite humans</a>
if they share a bed or if you go near there betting that is not flea-treated.</li>
<li>So if youve risen from your bed and you notice that your pet and yourself are scratching continuously, I encourage you to continue reading this article to know the science to check out to know whether you have fleas in the bed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-dog-has-fleas-and-sleeps-in-my-bed">Details: Dog Has Fleas and Sleeps in My Bed</h2>
<p>So if your cat or dog sleeps with you on the bed and they&rsquo;re not
flea-treated
you could be attracting a flea problem around yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because fleas will jump from the dog to your body and clothes while you are sleeping or after they&rsquo;ve hidden in the bed for some time after the pet leaves.
Flea bites are generally not welcome by most humans because they lead to allergies pain irritation and itching. So, youll need to know the various flea signs and how you
can control fleas on the dogs naturally
or using chemicals.
My friend has two cats and one dog and he believes that they could have picked some fleas from the yard or garden.</li>
<li>Since he and his kids do sleep next to their pets regularly I advised him to use some Seresto Cat flea collars.</li>
<li>Further, the vet advised a flea bath (using flea shampoo that is medicated) for the dogs and also thorough vacuuming of the spaces and washing of the fabrics and bedding.
Using these flea control techniques and conducting a regular spot check of the house for fleas helped eliminate the flea problem within weeks.
Fleas love hiding in the hair or fur of dogs but humans lack such features and thus they won&rsquo;t be a favorite as a hiding place for the bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signs-that-you-dog-dropped-fleas-on-the-bed">Signs that you Dog Dropped Fleas on the Bed</h2>
<h3 id="1-flea-bites">1. Flea Bites</h3>
<p>Flea bites (itchy red and itchy dots) on your skin will be the first signs that there are fleas in your bed. The bites from fleas are concentrated in one area (clustered) they are itchy and tiny.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bites will generally be on the lower body around the feet, ankles, and shins - largely in a straight line.
Compared to bed bugs that will bite humans around the neck, arms, and face, the flea will generally bite people on their lower bodies.</li>
<li>But fleas can also on areas of the human skin that is moist and warm such as behind the knees
So if youve been sleeping next to your dog, you can also notice some bites (red dots) on the upper body, and around the elbow bends, chest, and face.
For anyone that is allergic please they may experience other side effects that may come with varied symptoms such as;</li>
<li>Shortness of breath signifying anaphylaxis</li>
<li>Extreme and intense itching</li>
<li>Rush</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Hives</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-flea-dirt-on-the-bed">2. Flea Dirt on the Bed</h3>
<p>If you notice black specks that are tiny in size especially after you enjoyed cuddling with your dog you may already have fleas in the bed.
The black specs are the body waste from fleas (flea dirt) which is undigested blood that is released as poop.</p>
<ul>
<li>These specks can be found on pillows, bed frames, and bedsheets.
As the dog walks around your bed during the night it will drop not just the bugs such as fleas but bacteria too.</li>
<li>So, besides bringing flea bites, the dogs sleeping on your bed could also cause the transmission of salmonella and E. coli.
Therefore, it would be advisable to keep dogs off the bed completely or ensure that you bathe them frequently.
But will flea dirt harm kids and adult humans? First, humans will only be harmed by parasites including ticks and fleas if they are bitten on the skin.</li>
<li>However in theory there is a risk of humans getting harmed when they contact or touch the flea dirt (feces).
Another question that homeowners have is why they would see flea dirt on their bed but can&rsquo;t find fleas.</li>
<li>Well, there could have been fleas on the bed at one time but they may have jumped off or were killed through the grooming and licking actions of the dogs.
So tackling the
flea dirt challenge
will require you to go ballistic to control the fleas including bathing the dog with flea shampoo.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flea-treating-your-bed-and-house">Flea Treating Your Bed and House</h2>
<p>Do you suspect or are sure that there are fleas in your bed you require to wash the bedding using hot water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed while dealing with the pest is a critical factor to stop them from multiplying in your residence.
So wash the beddings through a hot cycle with detergent (including all the mattress pads, pillows, blankets, and sheets).</li>
<li>After washing the bedding, you may use a dryer and the Heat will help kill even more fleas.
Also, you should vacuum the mattress thoroughly (and rigorously) including on the underside and its seams. I advise that you repeat the vacuuming process a number of times.</li>
<li>Remember to vacuum the headboard especially if it&rsquo;s made of fabric.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLxExsHhV2I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLxExsHhV2I</a>
Additional steps you can take to control fleas in the whole bedroom include
using a flea bomb
.
Flea treating the house will ensure you remove the flea eggs and the other place from various places including the carpets.
A product like the Addams house spray will kill bed bugs, ticks, and fleas. The chemical will knock down the fleas in about 5 minutes and offer protection against the pests for about 7 months.
The next product is Adams carpet powder that will kill please in all various life cycle stages. Luckily, each of the packages will flea treat up to 400 square feet (1 - 2 rooms).
Finally, flea-treat they had since the dogs may also carry the bugs from outdoors to the indoor spaces. The product I recommend is the Adams garden spray that will kill ants mosquitoes ticks and fleas for about one month.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flea-treating-the-dog">Flea Treating the Dog</h2>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also very important that you control fleas that are hosted or hiding on them that&rsquo;s including the dogs.</p>
<h3 id="1-topical-and-oral-flea-control">1. Topical and Oral Flea Control</h3>
<p>Despite that plays will persist and become annoying you can use spot-on treatments and dog flea pills to remove these pests.
However, you must know the stage of the flea life cycle that the flea treatment remedy is aimed at for example it could be targeted at larvae and flea eggs or just the adult fleas.
In addition, other treatments will combine heartworm prevention and flea control in that single remedy.</p>
<h4 id="a-flea-medications-that-require-prescription">a. Flea Medications that require Prescription</h4>
<p>Besides some of the flea treatments may not require a prescription but others will - so it&rsquo;s important to consult the vet on this.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, prescription flea medications are an excellent way to exterminate fleas.
An example is the Bravecto (fluralaner) that will continue killing fleas for about 3 months but its knockdown effect is within 2 hours.
Other flea medications with a first-time knockdown effect of about 30 minutes include the Trifexis and Comfortis which will also continue killing phrase for about 30 days.</li>
<li>Among these three treatments are some that will only kill the flea eggs and thus will contribute to the breaking of the flea life cycle over time.
Also, if your pet is hypersensitive or allergic to flea saliva, I advise you to select a treatment that will target faux adult fleas before they bite on the cat or dog.</li>
<li>Some of the approved products for dogs that have hypersensitivity to flea bites include Vectra 3D and Seresto collar.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-flea-medications-that-dont-require-prescription">b. Flea Medications that Dont require Prescription</h4>
<p>The market has a number of flea-treatment products for your dog that won&rsquo;t require a prescription.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the downside is that most of these non-prescription products could have alone effectiveness compared to the prescription-based alternatives.
Some of the flea treatment products that won&rsquo;t require a prescription include spot-on treatments, oral flea treatments, flea collars, flea sprays, flea powders, and flea shampoos.
I have to note that these remedies are good emergency products for flea treatment on your dog but some owners have reported the persistence of fleas even after using these and prescription products.</li>
<li>An example is theCapstar Flea tabletsthat you will give to your dog orally and it will start killing the fleas in 30 minutes and it is able to exterminate almost 95% of the bug population in just 4 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-using-dog-flea-shampoos">2. Using Dog Flea Shampoos</h3>
<p>There are a number of dog shampoos that are formulated to kill fleas and they are considered relatively effective if you use them as directed.
But the effectiveness of the flea shampoo will depend on the ingredients that are used and the procedure used to apply it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, avoid bathing the puppies with dog flea shampoo that may have toxic ingredients such as Tea tree.
Awesome check the age of a puppy to determine if it will be able to understand being method and weighted with the flea shampoo for about 10 minutes - depending on how long the flea shampoo directs the application to last.
Finally, after washing the dog with the flea shampoo you can now use a tick and flea comb to help remove all the dead pests from the dog&rsquo;s fur.</li>
<li>Another point to note is that flea shampoos won&rsquo;t provide continued protection for fleas to the dogs and thus you require to use another flea treatment for that purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in conclusion it is clear that sleeping next to your dog can have many advantages including stress relief but the pet may also cause flea problems if the animal is flea-infested.</p>
<ul>
<li>So it is important that you the dog before allowing it on your bed. Also, wash and dry the bedding exterminate any fleas left behind.
Flea-treating the yard and your house will also help control the bugs from the surroundings.
Thats all.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The small red bumps appearing in specific areas of your skin can be hard to tell apart.�Well tell you how to figure out whether theyre <a href="/posts/can-fleas-bite-through-clothes/">flea</a> bites or
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255965/">bedbug</a>
bites.
<strong>Both these bites swell up and can be itchy, so here are some tips thatll help you tell the difference between them:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fleas prefer animal blood but can drink human blood as well. Whereas bedbugs only drink human blood.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flea bites appear to be red, swollen, and hard. Bedbug bites, on the other hand, seem to have a dark red spot in the center of the bitten and raised area of the skin.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fleas tend to <a href="/posts/do-fleas-bite-humans/">bite</a> randomly over the body, and you might notice clusters of three dots together. Bedbugs, however, tend to bite their hosts strategically in a pattern of a linear row, you can find a group of 10 or more together.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flea bites can be found on the lower half of the body, in places like ankles, calves, or moist areas such as elbows and knees bends. Whereas, bedbug bites are found in the upper half of the body in areas such as the neck, arms, shoulders, and back.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cat ScratchingLets go into detail about all the things that make the two bites different, as well as how to deal with them.</p>
<h2 id="flea-bites-vs-bedbug-bites--the-physical-differences">Flea Bites vs. Bedbug Bites  The Physical Differences</h2>
<p>As both the insects are small in size and feed on blood, the result of their bites look almost the same. However, if you have the right information, you can easily differentiate between the two. Its crucial that you identify them correctly if you want to succeed at the pest control battle against these blood-sucking pests.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-the-bite-occur">Where Does the Bite Occur?</h3>
<p>**Flea Bites **
are expected to occur in the lower parts of your body like your legs, ankle and feet. They are likely to be found in any area where the skin folds such as around the waist and under your arms.
**Bed Bug Bites **
usually appear in the upper areas of your body such as your face, neck, hand and arms. However, at times they can appear anywhere on your body.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-bite-look-like">What Does the Bite Look Like?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
appear in clusters, and look like small bumps surrounded by red patches. They look quite similar to mosquito bites as theyre itchy and might break if you scratch them too much. Since fleas tend to jump, youd notice that the bites would be scattered all over your skin.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
also result in red, small and round bumps. These bites usually have a dark red spot thats raised at the center. Theyre itchy and if you make the mistake of scratching them, itll become worse and you can end up with blisters. As bedbugs crawl on your skin, the bites mostly appear in a linear pattern. They bite several times in the same place before moving on.</p>

<h3 id="what-reaction-does-the-bite-cause">What Reaction Does the Bite Cause?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
might not cause any reaction for some people; others at the same time can suffer from horrible reactions causing you to scratch your skin. It all depends on the sensitivity of your skin. Scratching them may lead to a secondary infection. It triggers hives or an allergy attack for people who have sensitive skin or tend to have strong allergic responses to insect bites.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
would show different reactions for different people depending on the sensitivity of their skin. You might feel the urge to scratch them but the irritation doesnt last for more than a week. People with sensitive skin might experience serious allergic reactions causing you to develop hives or blisters.</p>
<h3 id="can-the-bites-lead-to-infection">Can the Bites Lead to Infection?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
are quite dangerous, as fleas are prospective carriers and transmitters of human diseases, like typhus. They might pass on cat scratch fever to your feline pet thats transferable to humans as well. Fleas are known to host tapeworms, which can make their way to your family and your pets.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
however are much safer, as they arent known to cause any disease. They can, however, be itchy and lead to allergic reactions for some people. Scratching the bites might expose your skin and result in secondary infections. Other than that, they dont pose any major health risks.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-do-they-last">How Long Do They Last?</h3>
<p><strong>Flea Bites</strong>
heal depending on the sensitivity of your skin, and might take between one day and two weeks. Many might not experience any severe reaction to the bite, and would notice the symptoms disappearing within a day or two.</p>
<p>However, if you have sensitive skin, you might have a more serious reaction to flea bites, as well as itchiness and swelling resulting from the fleas saliva thats left behind on your skin. As a result of continuous scratching, you may end up with severe blisters on your skin that can take up to two weeks to heal.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
might take different time to heal for each individual. The bites usually stay for about two weeks. If you dont have very sensitive skin, itll take less than a week for the effects of the bite to go away. Some of you may be lucky enough to not experience any symptoms at all.</p>
<p>However, if your skin has an allergic reaction to bedbug bites, you can experience severe reactions. The bites will be extremely itchy and you may not be able to resist the urge to scratch them constantly, resulting in blisters that usually take long time to heal.</p>
<p>Now that youve identified whether its a flea bite or a bed bug bite, you need to know how to treat them. If youre lucky enough not to be one of their victims, learn preventive methods so you can stay safe.</p>

<p><strong>Flea Bite</strong>
treatments require you to keep the bitten area clean, so wash it daily with soap and water. To reduce the chances of allergic reactions, incorporate an oral antihistamine in your treatment. Get hold of a soothing antipruitic (anti-itch) cream thatll ease the itching on your skin, ensuring that you dont end up with a secondary bacterial infection. To reduce inflammation, consult your doctor regarding a topical steroid that you can use. If the bite doesnt heal and seems to get worse, visit your doctor for an antibiotic prescription.</p>
<p>To treat the bites naturally, you can use Aloe Vera gel to lessen the itchiness and redness. For healing, use black or green tea to wash the area of the bite.
<strong>Bedbug Bites</strong>
become worse when you scratch them. To deal with the swelling and itchiness, you can apply a topical anti-itch cream or calamine lotion to the bites. For pain, an over-the-counter pain reliever should be sufficient. If the bites persists for more than two weeks, even after your home is infestation free, or youve developed a secondary infection, go visit a doctor. They may prescribe you an antibiotic.</p>
<p>For a treatment that you can do at home on your own, use water and baking soda and mix them together make a paste. Apply the mixture on the bite directly, and wash it off after an hour.</p>

or
flea combs for dogs
. It is a lot more common than many people would care to admit, but it can be mistaken for flea eggs to the untrained eye.
There are many causes for dandruff in your pet one such cause could be an infestation of fleas, whilst other causes could be an infection of the skin such as a fungal infection or a bacterial infection.
You might also find that your pet suffers from dandruff after trauma to the skin from things like sunburn or because of an underlying health condition such as diabetes or a bad diet.
We will now look at what you can expect to see if your pet is suffering from dandruff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Theshape of dandruffpieces will always be inconsistent; due to its nature of being dead skin, it will never assume the same shape or size, which is one of its most identifiable features.</li>
<li>Dandruff can easily get caught in the fur of the animal but will brush out quite quickly.
Once you have identified the problem as being dandruff, you will then be able to treat it in one of the following ways.</li>
<li>Regularly brush your pet to remove the dead skin cells; over time, this will eradicate the problem by distributing natural oils found on the skin.</li>
<li>Rinse your dog using a mixture of lime juice and water as vitamin C can assist in dandruff treatment.</li>
<li>Use an anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
<li>Keep your pet&rsquo;s diet balanced and varied; good nutrition is essential for maintaining good skin health.

<li>Fleas feed on blood, and the cycle of a flea&rsquo;s life is closely aligned with that need.</li>
<li>Flea eggs hatch into larvae, which then turn into pupae before emerging as adults. The adults lay eggs as they feed to continue the cycle.

<h2 id="understanding-the-flea-life-cycle---7-facts">Understanding the Flea Life Cycle - 7 Facts</h2>
<h3 id="1-flea-eggs">1. Flea Eggs</h3>
<p>The life cycle for a flea typically starts when an adult female will lay their eggs after feeding on blood from a suitable the host, this is mainly cats or dogs.</p>
<p>One half (50%) of the average home&rsquo;s flea population are flea eggs. Without blood, adult fleas cannot reproduce.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female flea can lay up to 40 eggs per day and as many as 2000 in her lifetime!</li>
<li>The eggs are sticky, so they will stick to the fur of your pet. This is called &ldquo;biting&rdquo; or &ldquo;bloodsucking&rdquo;.
On size, flea eggs are about 0.12mm long and they are yellowish-white in color and they&rsquo;ll be laid in batches of 20 eggs on the pet&rsquo;s fur.</li>
</ul>
<p>A female will lay from one to two batches, or 50% of its total offspring&rsquo;s eggs at a time, on your pets fur before moving on to a new host.</p>
<p>Flea eggs fall from your pet as they move, distributing them in the yard or house.</p>

Flea eggs hatch with the right temperature and humidity with 2-14 days. Larvae will emerge if temperatures are warm and humidity levels are high.</p>
<h3 id="2-flea-larvae">2. Flea Larvae</h3>
<p>Flea eggs can remain dormant for up to 18 months until they sense enough heat, which triggers an egg to hatch ( into larvae) within seconds!</p>
<p>Flea larvae constitute about 35-percent of fleas in your house. The newly hatched larvae will start looking for food immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>The larvae will feed on organic debris on the floor or your pet&rsquo;s fur and hair until they pupate, transforming into an adult flea within a few days.
Flea larvae emerge being wormlike and when - while also hiding from light. Larvae will eat
flea dirt (pre-digested blood)
and various organic debris they get in their surrounding.</li>
</ul>
<p>After feeding, the flea larvae will spin themselves into a cocoon and pupate (transform from an insect-like larva to adult). During this stage they are highly vulnerable if disturbed or exposed to light.</p>
<p>The whole process can take just two weeks with very warm temperatures and humidity levels, or more than a year with cold temperatures.</p>
<p>On size, flea larvae measure around a few millimeters (-inch) long, they&rsquo;ll look transparent (somehow white) and have a slightly bent tail.</p>
<p>Flea larvae will be the first thing you&rsquo;ll spot on your pet&rsquo;s fur or skin, and they might look like tiny white worms that wriggle around.</p>
<h3 id="3-flea-pupae">3. Flea Pupae</h3>
<p>Flea pupae will constitute roughly 10-percent of the fleas in your home. They will be dark brown in color and look like a &ldquo;J&rdquo; shape.</p>
<p>Flea pupae are hard to spot because they&rsquo;re not moving much, but they don&rsquo;t flee from light either - which makes them easier targets for you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make your inspection process easy when it&rsquo;s time to take care of fleas once-and-for-all; on color they&rsquo;re white to yellow and to brown.</p>
<p>This is the last stage on flea development before you get adult fleas. Its cocoon safeguards the pupae for up to weeks or months depending on the environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The sticky outer coating on the cocoon allows it to protect and hide the flea larvae deep inside rugs and carpeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you see flea pupae? Yes, if eggs or larvae can be seen, you will probably also see flea pupae. Though its appearance may seem like debris at first, flea pupae are really just a phase in the lifecycle of this fleas.</li>
<li>What kills flea pupae? The only way to kill flea pupae is by treating your home with a household &ldquo;flea&rdquo; treatment. To encourage them to hatch, vacuum the house first. Once they have hatched into adult &ldquo;fleas,&rdquo; they will be killed by the insecticide in your flea treatment.</li>
<li>What triggers make flea pupae hatch? The timing of when a flea will emerge is triggered by vibrations, high carbon dioxide, and heat - these are signs of presence of a host (warm-blooded). Vacuuming can trigger the flea pupae to hatch.
Therefore, flea pupae will only hatch out of their cocoons and into a &ldquo;flea&rdquo; life stage if they sense vibrations, high carbon dioxide, and heat brought by a pet or human being.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-adult-fleas">4. Adult Fleas</h3>
<p>After emerging from their cocoon, adult fleas start feeding (sucking blood) within 1-3 hours and becomes ready to breed and lay eggs in a few days.</p>
<p>Adult fleas constitute about 5-percent of the flea population in your home. Female fleas cannot lay eggs until they have had a blood meal.</p>
<p>On appearance, fleas are black (flat-bodied) and can be seen with the naked eye. Fleas begin life very small but will bulge upon feeding on host&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>Female fleas have a tube-like mouth structure, called a rostrum, which they use to pierce the skin of their host as well as suck blood from them. The saliva that is injected during this process contains an anticoagulant so it&rsquo;s easier for the flea to feed.</p>
<p>The saliva also contains a substance that prevents blood from clotting until they are done feeding which can take several minutes or hours depending on how much time each individual spends between meals.</p>
<p>Fleas do not have teeth to chew food so when their stomachs fill up, they release digestive juices into the host&rsquo;s blood which breaks down the host&rsquo;s cells. This is what gives a flea its red coloration after it has been feeding for some time on one animal or person.</p>
<p>After this process of digestion, the fleas poop out feces and can leave behind droppings in places where they have lived such as bedding, carpets, blankets and furniture.</p>
<p>Adult fleas will live for several weeks up to months on their host such as a
dog
or
cat
or also hiding on carpet edges, cracks, and pet bedding where they get adequate skin and hair.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-break-the-flea-life-cycle">How to Break the Flea Life Cycle</h2>
<p>Fleas take 1 to 2 months before they can develop into an adult flea and be capable of reproducing. As long as flea prevention and control methods are implemented, no new adults will form.</p>
<p>To break the flea life cycle;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a flea treatment on your pet and clean the house.</li>
<li>Wash all your pet&rsquo;s bedding and</li>
<li>Vacuum carpets to remove eggs, larvae, and pupae.
To ensure a flea free environment vacuum carpets, furniture and floors for three weeks. Machine wash toys, bedding and cloth in hot water to kill all flea stages.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can help speed up the hatching of any remaining flea pupae by increasing the temperature and using a humidifier.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-flea-treat-my-cats-and-dogs">How to Flea Treat My Cats and Dogs</h2>
<p>Pets should be treated with a flea treatment including
dog flea shampoo
or an appropriate
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-shampoo-for-cats/">cat flea shampoo</a>
. Fleas can become resistant to certain treatments, so it is important you use the correct one for your pet&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>A topical or oral medication that has an insect growth regulator (IGR) will help break the life cycle of adult fleas and prevent new from developing into an egg laying female for at least six months.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is important that you use pet shampoos with insecticides, as well as other products such, sprays or lotions on the animal&rsquo;s coat.</li>
<li>Products containing permethrin or pyrethrins are also effective in killing fleas and preventing a new generation from hatching eggs.
It is important that you treat your pets at least twice during the summer months with an IGR product to ensure complete protection, especially if they spend time outside.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, the life cycle of the flea is all about eggs, larvae and pupae.</p>
<p>The adult female lays her fertilized eggs on your pet&rsquo;s fur for them to hatch into larva or even pupae which then turn into adults after a couple weeks time.</p>

where they hide.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking for effective ways of getting rid of fleas in the carpet - we&rsquo;ve got lots of ideas!�Maybe it&rsquo;s through vacuuming or steam cleaning?</p>
<p>In this PestPolicy guide, this is what I&rsquo;ll be exploring:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-end-up-in-your-carpet">How do fleas end up in your carpet?</h2>
<p>The simplest explanation for how fleas (and flea eggs) end up on your carpet is that they jump from one dog or cat to another, or even worse, from the outdoors into a home.</p>
<p>Or people might
bring them home unknowingly
inside their own shoes from walking through an infested area outdoors (for example near other flea-infested homes).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also find that your furniture is another source of fleas if you don&rsquo;t vacuum it regularly, as some pet owners neglect to do.</p>
<p>Flea larvae are the initial stage in a flea&rsquo;s life cycle and will hatch from eggs on carpets or other surfaces where they&rsquo;ve landed.</p>
<ul>
<li>They enter into a pupal state which can last anywhere between one day up to two weeks before emerging as adults.</li>
<li>This time frame depends on factors such as temperature (warm temperatures speed up their development) and humidity levels.
Adult female fleas feed by biting animals like cats, dogs, etc., this helps them produce more eggs (20 - 50 daily). The eggs will roll onto the carper (they&rsquo;re less sticky) as the pet lies down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The flea eggs hatch in 1-2 weeks. So, the carpets provide a warm temperature allowing the fleas to hatch faster.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, there will develop a fully-grown infestation with eggs, nymphs, and adults on the carpet and on the floor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-do-fleas-live-in-carpets">How Long Do Fleas Live in Carpets?</h2>
<p>Fleas can live in carpets for an average of two to three months with a suitable host - cat or dog. If they don&rsquo;t get a blood meal, the flea&rsquo;s lifespan might only last a few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>The flea eggs in your carpet hatch in two to three days.
After the egg hatches, it takes about six days for a flea larva to develop.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have small children or pets in your home, there is a higher chance that they will be bitten and infected with parasites from these bugs. Pets might even bring them into your home on their fur!</p>
<p>The best way to get rid of them would be using natural remedies like garlic oil or Diatomaceous earth which kills pests but is safe for humans and animals alike!</p>
<p>Adult fleas live on average anywhere from 1 day to two weeks, depending on the animal they&rsquo;re living off of. When a long-haired host is available they can survive roughly 8 days.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-with-flea-infested-furniture-and-carpet">What Should I Do with Flea-Infested Furniture and Carpet?</h2>
<p>If you have a lot of fleas on your furniture and carpet, you may need to call an exterminator - or undertake DIY flea control.</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem is usually solved by spraying the house with insecticide which will kill all the fleas in your home - including those that are hiding out in dark corners or under carpets.
The next step is to vacuum thoroughly to remove any eggs left behind from larvae so they don&rsquo;t hatchback into adults later on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Carpets should be professionally shampooed as well because it&rsquo;s hard to get at the flea egg deposits beneath the fibers without using a special product for this purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure not only to spot-clean (or steam clean) upholstery but also floors: In some cases, eggs can survive for months when laid on hard surfaces like tile or linoleum.
If you&rsquo;re having trouble with fleas in the home or in the carpet, a three-step process is essential.</li>
<li>First, treat your cat or dog for fleas using either anover-the-counter remedy or prescription treatmentas prescribed by your veterinarian.</li>
<li>Next, apply chemical treatments to carpets and furniture (unless it will damage the finish) to kill any adult fleas left on these areas of infested surfaces anduse a flea spray.</li>
<li>Finally,vacuum all floorsand wash bedding and other items that cannot be laundered in hot water.
&hellip;but fleas eggs may also fall on the pet bed, furniture, couch, or carpet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flea eggs can hatch in a matter of days or weeks, depending on the conditions where they&rsquo;re present including humidity and temperature - and thus a fresh re-infestation.</p>
<p>Flea eggs are the only stage of fleas that is not killed with adults-killing insecticides, so it&rsquo;s best to avoid using these products including
flea bombs or foggers
.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, exterminators recommend treating carpets with insecticides that haveinsect growth regulators (IGR)ssuch as Precor that has (S)-Methoprene andPermethrinIGRs.
To prevent re-infestation, you will need to
give them a flea collar
and scrub your pets with a
quality flea shampoo
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-steps-to-getting-rid-of-fleas-in-the-carpet---fastest-way">3 Steps to Getting Rid Of Fleas in the Carpet - Fastest Way</h2>
<p>When taking on a flea infestation, one of the most important places to focus is your home&rsquo;s carpet.</p>
<p>Below are the key steps to take when you&rsquo;re perplexed as to how best to handle their flea problem on their floor or in their carpets.</p>
<h3 id="1-vacuum-cleaner-for-fleas-on-carpet">1. Vacuum Cleaner for Fleas on Carpet</h3>
<p>Hi, everyone! What&rsquo;s this? It looks like a vacuum cleaner. Can you hear that sound it makes?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yep, that&rsquo;s the sound of your carpet being sucked up into its tank to keep fleas from riding around on top of your floor and biting you when you have bare feet.
Maybe vacuuming the carpet won&rsquo;t kill all the fleas in your home, but it&rsquo;ll play a great role.</li>
</ul>
<p>A vacuum cleaner will remove fleas on the carpet, but it can&rsquo;t replace a professional pest control treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the contrary, I recommend using an IGR flea fogger such as Precor - about a week after flea-treating your pets.
However, vacuums will reduce the flea population in your home, especially those fleas and eggs that just won&rsquo;t die and are hanging out on the carpet.</li>
</ul>
<p>An unexpected side effect of vacuuming is that you might actually be trapping fleas and their eggs in your vacuum.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, when you&rsquo;re done vacuuming, remember to throw the bag or empty out your vacuum so that fleas can&rsquo;t take up residence in it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-steam-cleaning-the-carpet">2. Steam Cleaning the Carpet</h3>
<p>A steam cleaner is a great way to get rid of fleas- it kills the eggs and larvae. However, it is not something that you should do without taking precautions.</p>
<p>Steam Cleaning the Carpet for Fleas is a process that uses high-pressure steam to remove dirt - plus
flea dirt
, fleas, and organisms like bacteria from carpets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step One: Fill up your clean pot with water and then boil it on the stove until it reaches all of the safety marks; you can now turn off the stove because we are ready for step two.</li>
<li>Step Two: Pour some dish soap into a bucket or container full of hot water (you should have already boiled this) so that you create bubbles in there if needed.</li>
<li>Next, add twelve ounces worth of white vinegar before pouring out about eight inches deep into your carpet cleaner machine to mix with the soap.</li>
<li>Step Three: Fill up your carpet cleaner machine with hot water and then add in two to three ounces of dish detergent for maintenance cleaning, or one scoop of powdered enzyme cleaner if you want a deep clean.</li>
<li>Lastly, pour out about eight inches worth of this mixture into your carpet cleaner machine before turning on the power button so that it starts heating up.</li>
<li>Plugin the steam cleaner hose, as well as turn on its heat until some fog, comes out from it; now you can start pulling away any stains by attaching an accessory like a scrub brush.</li>
<li>Step Four: Once finished, let everything dry for at least 24 hours before vacuuming so that dirt isn&rsquo;t re-deposited onto your carpets.
It&rsquo;s too soon to start living with your pets again after chemicals like IGRs have been sprayed.</li>
<li>You should wait an entire week before letting them back into the areas that were treated or it could trigger a flea infestation and put you on the fast track to suffering from allergies.

<h3 id="3-kill-fleas-on-carpet-with-baking-soda">3. Kill Fleas on Carpet with Baking soda</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a creative way to kill fleas that live on your carpet, then look no further! Baking soda is an unusually effective and inexpensive solution.</p>
<p>When used alone, baking soda may not be as effective as it should be. So in order to make the treatment more potent, mix equal parts of baking soda with finely ground salt (salt and pepper would work too).</p>
<p>To test the potency and freshness of your baking soda, mix 1 tsp. with vinegar and see if it bubbles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dab the baking soda and salt solution into the carpet using little strokes.</li>
<li>Make sure to cover the entire surface of the carpet evenly with some mixture remaining on a small area that can be rubbed into the fibers.</li>
<li>You can use a brush to thoroughly cover the entire surface of your carpet with baking soda.</li>
<li>Treat the flea-infested area and let it settle for at least 12 hours before you vacuum.

</ul>
<h2 id="what-can-i-use-for-fleas-on-my-furniture">What Can I Use for Fleas on my Furniture?</h2>
<p>Sometimes fleas choose to go into your furniture for a hiding place. Thankfully, killing fleas on your furniture doesn&rsquo;t need to be complicated or expensive.</p>
<ul>
<li>The flea larvae and eggs will also drop on the dressers, table, and couch as the cat or dog moves around the house.
That being said, the first thing you should do to control fleas on your furniture is by using an insecticide that comes with an IGR (Insect Growth Regulator).</li>
<li>IGRs will prevent the eggs and larvae from hatching or hinder maturing of pupae, which will help keep your home free of fleas.
Your last step is to vacuum your furniture, which will remove the fleas. The right tool for the job will depend on what type of flooring and furniture you have;</li>
<li>But in general terms, a good attachment should work well across many surfaces.
If you want a more natural solution for getting rid of fleas in carpeting, then try using diatomaceous earth (DE). DE is made from the fossilized shells of ancient sea creatures and it&rsquo;s toxic to fleas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DE will work by sucking out any moisture in the carpet, which coupled with its sharp edges prevents flea eggs from hatching; this is because the DE scratches up their exoskeleton.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the only way to get rid of fleas is by using a tool that can reach the deepest parts of your carpet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other times, all you need are some simple tips and tricks like vacuuming regularly or spraying insecticide onto fabrics where they might be hiding.</li>
<li>IGR Insecticides will kill adult fleas on contact but will also prevent eggs from hatching.
I hope this post was helpful.</li>

      <description>For most home and pet owners,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most home and pet owners,
a flea infestation (see images)-look-like/)
can cause panic. Below I&rsquo;ve discussed the 7 top home remedies for fleas - they&rsquo;re useful, convenient, and budget-friendly.
Fleas bite humans and pets to suck blood, leading to anemia and
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/parasites/4-surprising-%5Bflea%5D(/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/)-diseases-you-need-know">transmission of diseases</a>
such as Tularemia, Tungiansis, Murine typhus, and Bubonic plague.
<em>In summary, you can keep your cats, dogs (including dips, flea combs</em>
<em>), and home being flea-free using simple home remedies that are effective and safe equally - control on the carpet and furniture - including killing flea eggs.�</em></p>
<h2 id="details-7-home-remedies-for-fleas---natural-treatment">Details: 7 Home Remedies for Fleas - Natural Treatment</h2>
<h3 id="1-dawn-dish-soap">1. Dawn Dish soap</h3>
<p>To
get rid of fleas
, I first recommend you use dawn dish soap to wet plus lathe your skin or pet&rsquo;s hair., Dish soap will reduce the surface tension of water and make the fleas drown.
Further, dish soap tends to break the waxy layer in the respiratory system of fleas. Breaking the waxy layer in their trachea will allow water to go into the bug&rsquo;s respiratory systems.</p>
<p>The bugs will suffocate once the air is replaced by water - further, the dawn soap will block the fleas&rsquo; spiracles. So, place a plate or dish and drop some dish soap - position a lit candle.
The candlelight will attract the fleas from where they&rsquo;ll drop and suffocate into the soapy water on the plate. It acts as a trap for the fleas - they&rsquo;ll trap the fleas temporarily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The dish soap created high viscosity in the water - trapping the fleas like glue to kill them.</li>
<li>However, fleas treat with dish soap only at night since fleas are nocturnal bugs. However, the dish soap flea treatment with candlelight may pose a fire hazard.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas">2. Diatomaceous earth for fleas</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous earth will kill fleas at home</p>
<ul>
<li>this will exterminate the fleas will the fossilized-algae diatoms. Luckily, the home remedy is non-toxic for pets and humans.
Besides, Diatomaceous earth will help exterminate
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef602">fleas</a>
on pets, including killing fleas on cats and fleas on dogs - the sharp diatoms break the bug&rsquo;s exoskeleton and cause dehydration.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the diatomaceous earth powder into places that you think have a massive flea infestation and traffic - but apply only a thin layer of the powder.</li>
<li>Let the DE treatment do its work for 3-5 days before you vacuum the floors and carpets thoroughly to prevent the bugs&rsquo; spreading.
However, ensure to use the food-grade diatomaceous earth since it&rsquo;s the natural option that&rsquo;s equally safe for humans and other pets, including cats and dogs.
Don&rsquo;t miss your face with the DE powder since it may irritate your throat and eyes - so ensure that you put on some personal protection equipment like face masks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-baking-soda">3. Baking soda</h3>
<p>Baking soda
will kill fleas just like diatomaceous earth, and it&rsquo;s equally safe to exterminate the bugs - but vacuuming is still the most recommended.
Vacuuming will remove the fleas from your furniture or carpet fibers. Using baking soda with your vacuuming machine on fleas will help improve its effectiveness.</p>
<ul>
<li>So sprinkle the baking soda on the furniture and carpets. However, rub and brush the surfaces and fabric and empty the vacuum bag into a trash can that&rsquo;s placed outside.</li>
<li>The powder will dehydrate and exterminate the bugs, eggs, and flea larvae and, hence, avoid another infestation.</li>
<li>Use the baking soda plus table salt - you&rsquo;ll only need to sprinkle some of your table salt. The best thing is that it&rsquo;s safe for both humans, pets, and kids.
But the salt plus baking soda could trigger some minor irritation on the pet&rsquo;s open wounds. Also, remember to isolate animals in the treating zone.
Baking soda plus sprinkle salt on the affected places, furniture, and carpets and letting it sit overnight will dehydrate the flea eggs and larvae.
However, you&rsquo;ll need to repeat the flea treatment - clean the bag and canister. Repeating the treatment allows you to remove all the left-over eggs to hatch and trigger a re-infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-lemon-spray">4. Lemon spray</h3>
<p>The lemon spray will both exterminate and repel fleas as it contains D-limonene as an active ingredient. But lemon may be used to treat the wasp stings - check best wasp spray.
You&rsquo;ll require a spray bottle, funnel, large bowl, strainer, large pot, fork, and knife. Ingredients; 356 ml or 1.5 liters of vinegar, 711 ml or 0.7 liters of water, and three lemon fruits.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, you&rsquo;ll need to make some citrus spray that&rsquo;ll use on the infected surfaces and furniture. Juice the three lemons after cutting into 3 millimeters thick slices.</li>
<li>Get a lemon slice and put it into the water - finally, boil the water for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Now steep your three lemons - and let the lemon to simmer before removing the water from heat. Allow the citrus juice to stand over the night before putting it into a spraying bottle the next day.
Finally, spray the citrus spray on infested places on the yard, including chairs, pet bedding, and sofas. It&rsquo;ll kill with the juice in the rinds or use a fork to cut down the rinds.</li>
<li>If your pet has a flea collar, you&rsquo;ll need to add 2-3 lemon mixture drops in the pet&rsquo;s flea collars, which will control the fleas. Further, you&rsquo;ll need to drop some lemon mixture on the pet&rsquo;s shoulder blades.</li>
<li>For use with pet&rsquo;s shampoo - you&rsquo;ll require 0.25 cups of the lemon treatment that&rsquo;ll mix with the cat flea shampoo or the flea shampoo for dogs and use it for bathing the pets - but avoid the eyes.</li>

<h3 id="5-apple-cider-vinegar">5.� Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>
<p>For fleas, Apple cider vinegar is an effective home remedy against the bugs besides using collars and yard flea sprays besides other natural flea remedies.
Luckily, you&rsquo;ll discover that vinegar has no fragrance, and it&rsquo;s equally friendly to the surroundings - it&rsquo;s chemical-free and natural, which means that it&rsquo;ll be safe for kids, adult humans, and pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a dog, use a single apple cider vinegar teaspoon for 40 pounds of the dog. Add this vinegar into a bowl of water and make sure to change the water after each dog wash.
Fleas like bed bugs hate vinegar, and hence they&rsquo;ll be repelled easily from the house and surrounding - you can also use the vinegar solution like a spray.
Despite that dogs and cats will love apple cider vinegar more - particularly its scent, it&rsquo;s also helpful to use white vinegar. However, cats might not love the vinegar spray
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-puppies/">flea treatment</a>
.</li>
<li>Mix equal parts of the water and vinegar ingredients into a big bowl - this is the dilution process that&rsquo;ll make the solution fit for controlling fleas.</li>
<li>However, some homeowners also tend to mix in the ingredients in the ration of 1:3 for vinegar and water.
Before spraying the vinegar for fleas control, inspect if the dog or cat has open wounds, sores, or cuts on their skins. Avoid
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-kittens/">using the flea treatment</a>
on open wounds.
Avoid spraying the pet&rsquo;s into their eyes - this may lead to pain, irritation, or reduced ability to see. It&rsquo;s your role to ensure that the flea treatment is safe and comfortable for the pets.</li>
<li>Put the vinegar solution in a spray bottle or use some cloth that you&rsquo;ll dip into the vinegar solution - for example, therub-down technique will be more appropriate for cats.</li>
<li>However, remember to clean your spraying bottle, mainly if it had previously been used to spray a different chemical to avoid adverse reactions.
Finally, within half an hour, comb the cat&rsquo;s hair to remove any of the dead or live fleas plus their eggs and larvae that&rsquo;re stuck or trapped by the sprayed vinegar.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-salt-for-fleas">6. Salt for fleas</h3>
<p>Salt for fleas (salt will kill fleas), just baking soda, will effectively kill fleas - particularly if you combine it with vacuuming. The salt will dehydrate the adult fleas and thus kill them.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, sprinkle some finely-ground table salt on surfaces like furniture and carpets. All the sprinkled salt to sit on the surfaces for about 1 to 3 days.</li>
<li>Finally, vacuum the surfaces and carpets to clean up the salt and fleas trapped or trapped by this effective home flea remedy.
Constant flea vacuuming plus salt treatment against fleas will help keep the flea infestation at bay. You can use the salt on
pet beds, carpets, and live hosts - cats and dogs to kill even flea
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-eat/">larvae</a>
.
To treat you home effectively with salt for fleas, you&rsquo;ll need to treat the upholstery, home floors, and carpets. However, ensure that you empty and clean the vacuum bags and canisters.</li>
<li>Further, salt must allow sitting on the sprinkled areas overnice or for long hours so that the fleas will be dehydrated. But note that fleas won&rsquo;t kill flea pupae in the cocoons.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Natural remedies for fleas will work just as well as chemical flea treatment, including sprays, shampoos, and flea collars. Also, flea repelling plants like Spearmint, Lavender, Chrysanthemums, and Penny Royal is equally effective.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas are
tiny insects (order Siphonaptera)
that exist parasitically (sucking blood) on hosts birds, mammals, and pets like dogs &amp; cats.
Key identifies of the fleas include their color which can vary from black, reddish-brown, or brown; visible with naked eyes but may

**But how big are fleas? Adult fleas are dark brown and will measure about 1.4 - 3.3 millimeters in body length. **
<strong>But male fleas have a shorter body (average 1 millimeter) compared to females (average 2.5 millimeters). Despite being tiny, fleas can be seen through naked eyes.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-how-big-are-fleas">Details: How Big are Fleas?</h2>
<h3 id="1-fleas-body-length">1. Fleas&rsquo; Body Length</h3>
<p>First, fleas are classified as true insects as they have 6 legs and 3 body segments (head, the thorax &amp; abdomen).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fleas have a narrow body but their body length is about 1.55 - 3.25 millimeters.�</strong>
As noted above, male fleas have a shorter body length - males have an average length of 1 millimeter or under while females have an average length of 2.5 millimeters.
Despite that fleas are tiny in length and width, you can see them with naked eyes. However, fleas can still hide animal fur or hair including
animals and pets with white fur
.</li>
<li>The length of the fleas&rsquo; body is covered with protective plates known as sclerites.</li>
<li>These sclerites work well to protect the fleas from animals bites or injuries that they may suffer while jumping.
Fleas will feed only on the blood of birds and mammals (this includes humans).</li>
<li>The fleas glands are positioned at its front end and thus the bug will look glossy.</li>
<li>The glands will secret oil or grease to create the sheen look on the flea&rsquo;s body that allows easy movement. through animal hair and fibers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compare-size-of-fleas-to-common-objects">Compare Size of Fleas to Common Objects</h3>
<ol>
<li>Poppyseed measures 1 millimeter in diameter</li>
<li>Sesame seed measure 3.5 millimeters in diameter</li>
<li>Penny&rsquo;s side measure 1.5 millimeters thick</li>
<li>A dime measure 17.9 millimeters in diameter</li>
<li>Black pepper peppercorn�measures 5 millimeters in diameter</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-fleas-head">2. Fleas&rsquo; Head</h3>
<p>The head of the fleas is narrow or elongated and thus it&rsquo;ll easily move through tiny spaces including the carpet fibers and animal hair.</p>
<ul>
<li>Males fleas have a head that is almost equal in length to its head. However, the head of the female fleas measures about double the pest&rsquo;s body length.
Fleas, unlike other insects (others come with compound eyes), have simple eyes (2 eyes) on their head.
Further, the eyes of these fleas have biconvex lenses (single) and are dark in color.</li>
<li>Its lower lip has three stylets, where the center stylet (that creates the fascicle) will be one extracting blood from the fleas&rsquo; host.
The mouth of fleas has parts that allow easy piercing of the hosts&rsquo; skin so that they suck blood.</li>
<li>Further, the fleas&rsquo; head has an antenna that allows the pest to sense various stimuli.</li>
<li>The stimuli that the fleas will sense through the sensilium (sensory organ) include temperature, vibrations, humidity, smell, and touch.</li>
<li>However, female fleas have shorter antennae but the males use their antenna for mating.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5KvNcNz9aQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5KvNcNz9aQ</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fleas-abdomen">3. Fleas&rsquo; Abdomen</h3>
<p>The fleas have an abdomen with ten segments but just eight of these are visible.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the female fleas will have an abdomen that is heavier compared to that of the female fleas.</li>
<li>Further, the abdomen of the female fleas has a rounded dorsal (backside) while that of the males is flat.
Also, the abdomen of the male fleas will be curvier on their underside and this will make it appear as if the bugs are upside down.</li>
<li>Notably, you check the gender of fleas by examining the fleas&rsquo; abdomen.
However, the abdomen of the fleas will change in size as the bug sucks blood or remains without a blood meal.</li>
<li>The ten segments of all fleas (females and males) will be overlapping prior to taking a blood meal. Thus, the bugs will look smaller compared to when its well-fed on blood.
As the flea consumes more blood, its ten abdominal segments continue to open ready to take up more blood.</li>
<li>Thus, the abdomen segments will continue expanding and make the fleas&rsquo; abdomen to become longer.
When the flea is well fed, you can inspect its last segment and see the
<a href="https://livestockvetento.tamu.edu/insectspests/fleas/">flea&rsquo;s sensilium</a>
(senses the bug&rsquo;s host) and also the genitals.</li>
<li>Fleas have a<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flea-life-cycle/">lifecycle</a>that lasts about 2-3 months but these bugs could live for even 1.5 years in different localities (varied humidity and temperature), and the presence of host blood.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-fleasthorax">3. Fleas&rsquo;�Thorax</h3>
<p>The thorax of fleas has 3 leg pairs with their hind ones being the longest.</p>
<ul>
<li>The thorax has 3 segments; the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax.
The 3 parts of the fleas&rsquo; thorax have their backsides overlapping and thus they&rsquo;re squeezing onto each other.</li>
<li>For easier movement on the host or around the carpet fiber, the joints in the thorax of the fleas are flexible enough.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-flea-eggs-visible-to-the-eye">Are Flea Eggs Visible To The Eye?</h2>
<p>Yes, flea eggs are about
0.5mm (tiny) but they&rsquo;re visible to a naked human eye - they&rsquo;re smooth and oval-shaped.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, since the eggs are white, you might not see them when on fabric that&rsquo;s light-colored.
The flea eggs are white to semi-transparent and will appear shiny and oval-shaped.
You&rsquo;ll notice that the flea&rsquo;s eggs will appear like salt grains - since they measure about a length of 0.5 mm and a width of 0.3 mm.</li>
<li>You might fail to notice the light-colored flea eggs (<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-flea-dirt/">not like flea dirt that is more dirt</a>) while they&rsquo;re stuck in carpet fibers or pet fur.
Matura fleas eggs may look a bit darker and hence they&rsquo;ll be noticeable faster. Despite that flea eggs are largely dry, they&rsquo;re laid in a wet and sticky form.</li>
<li>On the structure, fleas are highly fragile and they&rsquo;ll get crashed with light force to form a gel.
Notably, the eggs have a wall that measures just one picometer in thickness and you can view the larvae through their shell.

</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-flea-larvae-look-like">What Do Flea Larvae Look Like?</h2>
<p>Flea larvae are tiny organisms that&rsquo;ll measure about 2 to 5 millimeters in length - they have pale-colored hairs and a white-looking body.
Flea larvae largely feed on flea dirt - these are body waste from fleas - its undigested blood that&rsquo;s excreted once the fleas take their blood meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once hatches, the flea larvae will be measuring about 2 millimeters in length and thus visible with naked human eyes.</li>
<li>These organisms have no legs and will be hiding in dark locations, crevices, and also carpet fibers.</li>
<li>The larvae of fleas will be blind and they&rsquo;ll evade sunlight - they&rsquo;re negatively phototactic.
The organisms will grow to move through 3 stages; the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instars. The larvae will shed their bristles as they grow to elongate.</li>
<li>Further, as the flea larvae grow, they&rsquo;ll feed on flea feces, organic matter, and dead skin - which will make the organisms transform from translucent to become reddish-brown.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas move between hosts very fast and this makes it challenging to spot them - adult fleas measure about 1.4 - 3.3 millimeters in body length.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, with suitable and enough blood, fleas will settle on a host before the females drop off to lay eggs.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do fleas mate? If you are unfortunate enough to be suffering a flea outbreak, you may be wondering how the mate and therefore spread - to
control the fleas effectively
.
In this article, we will take a detailed look at how these pests reproduce - there are clear signs to show if fleas infest your house or yard.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Flea Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="how-do-fleas-mate-7-quick-sex-life-tips">How Do Fleas Mate? 7 Quick Sex Life Tips</h2>
<p>One of the most notable things about many
fleas
types is that they must feed before
<a href="https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/flea-control/">they mate on pets</a>
.
But the process is not as simple as this. There are certain conditions that the flea needs to mate. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some critical factors in the mating process of a flea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas that live on cats are known to perform the entirety of their essential day-to-day needs (feeding, mating, living, etc.) on their host -control the fleas in the yard.</li>
<li>It has never been observed thatfleas have mated away from their host. This is because the temperature iscritical when the fleasare breeding, and they require a warm environment to mate successfully.</li>
<li>As we mentioned, the fleas require feeding before mating can occur, and this is another reason why they always mate whilst on their host as they can mate directly after receiving a blood meal.

</ul>
<h2 id="males-and-females">Males And Females</h2>
<p>It has been noted that, in most cases,
fleas that live
on cats are predominantly female. The reason for this is that female flea tend to outlive their male counterparts, and therefore, even though there are equal numbers of males and females born, the females survive longer.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-the-male-and-female-flea">Structure Of The Male And Female Flea</h2>
<p>The male flea is the proud owner of the most complex male genitals known within the animal kingdom. The penis itself is supported by rods that allow for east entry into the female flea.
Their bodies feature a shield on the outer portion to protect the reproductive organs, and underneath this can be found a clasper which is used to attach the male to a female.
The female flea has an area used for storing the sperm of the male, but her reproductive organs are nowhere near as detailed or complex as the male.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-the-males-and-females-find-one-another">How Do The Males And Females Find One Another?</h2>
<p>Of course, to mate, the male and female fleas must locate one another, and it is thought that this is done through the release of chemicals or pheromones given off by the females.
The male is then able to use his antenna to detect these chemicals and locate the female. Once a male has located his chosen female, he will approach her with a vertical antenna, which signals that he wishes to mate.
The pair will connect initially at the head and then on the lower portion of the body. The male will use his antenna and legs to restrain the female during the mating process and will often remain like this until the entire ritual is over.
One of the most interesting points about the mating of fleas is that during the process, the female will continue to feed unless she is not interested, in which case she may kick the male and walk away.

<h2 id="fertility-of-female-fleas">Fertility Of Female Fleas</h2>
<p>Once the mating is over, it is then left to the female to lay her eggs. It is interesting to note that the more a female flea mates, the more fertile she becomes.
A virgin female can lay unfertilized eggs, which is thought to be a step in the evolution of asexual reproduction in these creatures.
The viability of eggs increases by 30% after the first mating, which is helpful information for eradicating
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-come-from/">fleas</a>
from your pet or home. The quicker you can do it, the less fertile the fleas will be, making it easier to tackle these parasites.</p>
<h2 id="how-soon-after-finding-a-host-do-fleas-mate">How Soon After Finding A Host Do Fleas Mate?</h2>
<p>If you are concerned about a flea infestation, one of the key factors to consider is how quickly mating will occur, and the bad news is that it is quite quick.
Once the fleas establish themselves on their host, it is known that mating can begin as quickly as eight hours later. The maximum time is usually around 24-34 hours. Before the fleas can begin mating, they must take a feed, which becomes their priority.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>How do fleas mate? The flea&rsquo;s mating process is somewhat complicated, and yet it is also a fascinating subject - control the bugs with
flea bombs
or foggers.
One of the most important factors to remember is that fleas can begin mating within hours of finding a host and taking a meal.
Therefore, it is essential to maximize your efforts to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-on-clothes-and-bedding/">rid your pet of fleas</a>
as soon as you find them to avoid the females becoming more fertile and producing more eggs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flea bites are a common concern, especially in households with pets or in areas where pets frequently visit. These tiny pests can cause significant discomfort, itching, and even allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Preventing flea bites requires a proactive approach to ensure your
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-humans-carry-%5Bfleas%5D(/posts/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/)-from-one-home-to-another/">home and surroundings remain flea-free</a>
. In this guide, we will explore effective strategies to avoid <a href="/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/">flea</a> bites, including what to wear, how to use flea repellents, proper laundering techniques, and essential cleaning practices.</p>
<h2 id="1-wear-long-pants-and-protective-clothing">1. Wear Long Pants and Protective Clothing</h2>
<p>One of the most effective ways to prevent flea bites is by wearing protective clothing, especially in areas known to be infested with fleas. Fleas are more prevalent during warmer months, so taking precautions when spending time outdoors or in flea-prone areas is essential.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Wear Long Pants and Long-Sleeved Shirts:**Covering your skin reduces the likelihood of flea bites. Tuck your pants into your socks to create a barrier that prevents fleas from reaching your skin.</li>
<li>**Closed-Toe Shoes:**Opt for closed-toe shoes rather than sandals to protect your feet from flea bites.</li>
<li>**Avoid Sitting on the Ground:**Fleas often inhabit grassy or sandy areas. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, and if possible, choose well-lit areas with plenty of sunlight, as fleas are less likely to be found in brightly lit spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-use-flea-repellents">2. Use Flea Repellents</h2>
<p>Flea repellents are a crucial tool in
your flea prevention
arsenal. They can be used on both your body and your surroundings to reduce the risk of flea bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Chemical Repellents:**Spraying flea repellent containing DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) or permethrin on your clothing, pet bedding, and around your home can effectively deter fleas. These chemicals work by repelling fleas and preventing them from biting, though they do not kill adult fleas.</li>
<li>**Natural Alternatives:**For those who prefer natural solutions, essential oils such as myrtle oil and thyme oil have been shown to have flea-repelling properties. However, always ensure that the oils are properly diluted and safe for use, especially if you have pets or young children in the household.</li>
<li>**Safety Precautions:**When using chemical repellents, particularly indoors, ensure the product is safe for all members of the household, including pets and young children. Always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions and consider ventilating the area after application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-launder-bedding-and-clothing-regularly">3. Launder Bedding and Clothing Regularly</h2>
<p>Fleas can easily infest your bedding and clothing, especially if they have been in contact with a flea-infested pet. Regular laundering is essential in preventing and controlling flea infestations.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Wash Bedding and Clothing:**Use hot water and soap to launder all bedding, towels, and clothing that may have come into contact with fleas. A wash cycle of at least 20 minutes at a high temperature is recommended to kill fleas and their eggs.</li>
<li>**Dry at High Heat:**After washing, dry all items on the highest heat setting. The heat from the dryer is effective in killing any remaining fleas or eggs that may have survived the wash cycle.</li>
<li>**Seal Infested Items:**If immediate laundering is not possible, seal infested items in plastic bags to prevent fleas from spreading. Store these bags in a safe location until you can properly clean the items.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-vacuum-carpets-and-furniture-thoroughly">4. Vacuum Carpets and Furniture Thoroughly</h2>
<p>Vacuuming is one of the most effective ways to control flea populations in your home. Fleas, including their eggs and larvae, can hide in carpets, upholstery, and other soft furnishings.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Vacuum Regularly:**Focus on areas where your pets spend the most time, such as carpets, rugs, and furniture. Fleas tend to congregate in these areas, making them prime targets for thorough vacuuming.</li>
<li>**Clean the Vacuum:**After<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-vacuum-for-fleas/">vacuuming</a>, clean the nozzle and bag of the vacuum cleaner to prevent any live fleas from escaping. If your vacuum has a bag, discard it in a sealed plastic bag to prevent re-infestation.</li>
<li>**Vacuum Hard Surfaces:**If you have hard floors, such as wood or tile, vacuum them as well. While fleas are less likely to infest these surfaces, they can still be present and should not be overlooked.</li>
<li>**Treat Pillows and Cushions:**Fleas can also hide in pillows and cushions. Regularly vacuum and, if possible, wash these items to prevent fleas from taking up residence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Flea bites can be a significant annoyance and health risk, but with proper precautions, you can minimize your exposure and keep your home flea-free.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing protective clothing, using effective flea repellents, regularly laundering bedding and clothing, and maintaining a clean environment through vacuuming are all critical steps in preventing flea bites.
Remember, consistency is key. Regularly implementing these practices will help ensure that fleas do not find a foothold in your home, allowing you to enjoy a comfortable, bite-free living environment.</li>

      <title>How High Can Fleas Jump</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-high-can-fleas-jump/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-high-can-fleas-jump/</guid>
      <description>Fact:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fact:
[<a href="/posts/how-long-can-fleas-live-without-a-host/">Fleas</a> (Ctenocephalides felis) don&rsquo;t have wings](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-have-wings/">https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-have-wings/</a>)
and will move by jumping using their powerful legs.</p>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-can-fleas-live-without-a-host/">Fleas can only live up to 4 days</a>
when removed from their hosts.
So, fleas jump around looking for a blood meal or move from
heat
.
So,
*how high can fleas jump? *
**Fleas can jump a maximum of **
**7 inches (18�cm) vertically and 13 inches (33�cm) horizontally (an average 40 - 99 times of the flea&rsquo;s body length) - it&rsquo;s only second to **
<strong>froghopper. Its hind-most pair of legs are significantly adapted in jumping. Here&rsquo;s how to tell if you have a flea problem.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-high-can-fleas-jump">How High Can Fleas Jump?</h2>
<p>The fleas&rsquo;s legs are long and appropriately build for jumping. The bug provides a forceful and quick jump - it wont depend on power from directly from its muscles but on the energy stored in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilin">resilin</a>
elastic protein pad. It releases the store energy fast like bow &amp; arrow.
Before the flea jump, the bug&rsquo;s muscles will contract to allow the deformation of its resilin pad, this allows storage of energy to be used later. However, the flea uses he &ldquo;catch mechanism&rdquo; that&rsquo;ll hinder premature release of energy and leg movement.
<strong>Dog fleas (Ctenocephalides Canis)</strong>
will jump more compared to cat fleas. Dog fleas will jump about 50 cm (20 inches). The average leap distance or height of 30.4 cm (12 inches) - but the jumps among cat flea and human fleas are similar.
<strong>The oriental rat fleas</strong>
(Xenopsylla Cheopis) tend to jump about 18 cm (7 inches). Further, the Desert Rodent Fleas have a jump of about 7.8 cm - 12.8 cm (3 - 5 inches). On average, the oriental rat fleas have a jump of 10.4 cm (4 inches).
**Bird, bat, &amp; mole fleas **
are some of the fleas species that don&rsquo;t jump well. These fleas have lost their body parts required to jump. Therefore, these fleas (since they don&rsquo;t jump) live in hosts occupying the underground nests and high-aerial roosts.
<strong>Cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Their flea jump height is about 33 cm (13 inches). Most of the cat fleas tend to jump about 13.2 cm (5.2 inches) about above your ankle. Further, some fleas may jump about 17 cm (6.6 inches) - while others can jump at above 60 times of their body length.
<strong>Human Flea (Pulex Irritans)</strong></li>
<li>Human fleas jump at a height and distance similar to cat fleas. Therefore, human fleas jump about 33 cm (13 inches) just like cat fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flea-anatomy--jumping-mechanism">Flea Anatomy  Jumping Mechanism</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to learn the anatomical build of the fleas&rsquo; legs to lean how these bugs jump from one host or area to another. Its legs are segmented into 4 sections� - the segments being tarsus, tibia, femur, and coxa from outwards towards the body.
The leg joints - particularly the femur is a thick joint segment of the fleas&rsquo; leg and it has a large amount of muscle and it links the trochanter to the bug&rsquo;s tibia. the fleas&rsquo; tibia is sectioned and it links femur to the fleas&rsquo; tarsi. In addition, the fleas tarsi stand furthest to the bug&rsquo;s body.
The flea&rsquo;s trochanters are noted to touch the ground when the bugs are jumping. But the tarsi of the flea is a critical part of jumping for the fleas. Notably, fleas derive their jumping power from the spectacular jumps. Its resilin contains some protein that is stretchy - to contract and extends allowing the flea to jump over distances.</p>
<h2 id="how-fast-can-fleas-jump">How Fast Can Fleas Jump?</h2>
<p>Considering the shape and size of fleas - these flat and tiny bugs measure about 1/12 -� 1/8 inches move of jump quickly and effectively over distances or between the pet&rsquo;s hairs. The hind legs, from its 6 legs, of these fleas, allow the bugs to jump quickly.
Some fleas species will jump about 150 times its body length. Further, the record jump ever recorded in fleas was a vertical jump of 4 feet.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-can-fleas-live-without-a-host/">Without a host, fleas can survive for about 100 - 150 days</a></p>
<ul>
<li>however, it must remain undisturbed to avoid wasting energy moving around or jumping.
When fleas attain adult ages and body, they&rsquo;ll be running around looking for a blood meal and later conditions
necessary undertake reproduction. Adult fleas lays about 5000+ eggs in its lifetime and the adult will live or about 2-3 months.
As noted above, fleas won&rsquo;t survive for long without a blood meal or a host - in fact its just a few days. However, with the correct humidity, blood supply, and temperatures, adults fleas will live anywhere from 1-1.5 years. Further, adults fleas will survive for long without feeding if they won&rsquo;t break off their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puparium">puparia</a>
since this would otherwise make them lose excessive energy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-fleas-jump-onto-beds">Can Fleas Jump Onto Beds?</h2>
<p>Definitely, its odd to discover fleas occupying your bed - even after washing and treating all the bedding and such stuff. Maybe the bugs did actually hitchhike your lower legs or feet and finally got into you bed? Possibly, the fleas also climbed onto your bed using the loosely hanging sheets near the ground or floor? NB: Fleas can only jump to maximum height that&rsquo;s around your ankle -
fleas have no wings and thus won&rsquo;t fly
.
If the flea problem persists, then you should consider washing all the bedding regularly than you what you do currently. Further, make sure to tuck your sheet into the bed - this makes sure that the fleas moving around he ground won&rsquo;t get a ladder/ climbing route into your bed. In addition, keenly clean and inspect you feet and socks before you jump into you bed.
The next step will be purchasing a better vacuum - maybe the one you currently have isn&rsquo;t doing it all right in removing the fleas,
flea dirt and their debris
. This will be even more helpful if your carpets have fleas as it&rsquo;ll vacuum the bugs clean. Also, I recommend you get some
cat flea treatments such as Revolution</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid lapse or delays in giving the flea treatments.
Daily cleaning and vacuuming may help kill the flea larvae, eggs,and
baby fleas</li>
<li>in addition to washing the bedding, treating the mattress and pillows. A great sign in your war against fleas is if you don&rsquo;t now notice a lump of flea dirt on the bed rails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-control-fleas">How to Control Fleas</h2>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, fleas have long legs and the hind pair is highly developed to allow them to jump very high. Vertically, fleas can jump about 18 cm (7 inches) while horizontally it can jump roughly 13 cm (33 inches). Therefore, fleas are only second in jumping height-to body length ratio to froghopper.</p>

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5734377/">need a host to survive</a>
. But how long can fleas live without a host? Well, because of their thirst for blood and parasitic nature, they depend on the host most of their time.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Fleas can survive for a period of 4-7 days without a host. But if you subject them to any longer than this, they will die. **</li>
<li><strong>Fleas have different stages of a life cycle but it is the adults that need the host more especially when laying eggs. Fleas can attach to many hosts, but their preferred hosts are the furry homes pets- cats and dogs.</strong>
If you study the life cycle of a flea, you shall get the opportunity to learn and understand about the fleas and their host.

</ul>
<h2 id="details-how-long-can-fleas-live-without-a-host">Details: How Long Can Fleas Live Without A Host?</h2>
<p>Because fleas are parasites, it is difficult to live without a host. They get their food from the host to survive and reproduce.</p>
<ul>
<li>But if you take a flea from hosts its chances of survival becomes minimal and can die. The longest they can survive without a host is 4-7 days maximum.
In fact, a female flea will not lay her first eggs until after her first blood meal. Hence they need to find a host so they quickly attach to feed and continue with the next stage of the life cycle.

<h3 id="life-cycle-of-a-flea-">**Life Cycle of a Flea� **</h3>
<p>A flea has a life span of between 60-100 days. But they can live even for a whole year even the conditions are not conducive for the egg, larvae, or pupae to rapture to the next stage.��Lets have a closer look at the different stages and their behaviors.</p>
<h3 id="eggs-">**Eggs **</h3>
<p>This is the first stage in a life cycle. A flea likes to lay its eggs on the host. Most of the preferred hosts are pets at home because their blood is nutritious and makes fleas lay more eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the pet is grooming or shaking, these eggs fall on the carpets, bedding, furniture, and any other surface
The fertilized eggs hatch in a span of 2-12 days. From the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/should-you-spray-your-yard-for-fleas/">total flea population</a>
in any house, the eggs comprise about 50-54%.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34MRKpf3rEE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34MRKpf3rEE</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="larvae-">**Larvae **</h3>
<p>This is the second stage of the life cycle. The larvae are translucent to white in color and their size range from 2mm-5mm when they are fully grown.</p>
<ul>
<li>As they mature, their color also changes to a darker color. As for larvae, they prefer dark areas in the house including under the carpets and in the crevices.</li>
<li>After hatching, the new larvae feed have a functionally developed mouth that they use to feed on debris, fleas feces, dead skin, and fur among other debris.
Fleas stay in this stage between 2-14 days as they molt their skin to turn into pupae. The larvae comprise about 35 % of the total population.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pupae-">**Pupae **</h3>
<p>This pupae flea lives in a cocoon. This cocoon is gluey and holds itself to debris, flea feces, and dust among other things to harden the cocoon for protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>This makes the larvae survive even when exposed to vacuum and other pest controls.</li>
<li>If the conditions are right, this cocoon opens up after 5-14 days into an adult flea.
Sometimes, the cocoon may be predisposed to unsuitable weather conditions which may prolong the pupae stage even to a year in the cocoon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adult-">**Adult **</h3>
<p>This is the fourth and final stage of a flea. It is at this stage that the pupa moves out of the cocoon into a full adult (male or female). The body is fully grown with all the feeding and survival adaptations. This is the feeding and the reproducing stage.</p>
<ul>
<li>At this point, the fleas is can jump into the host to start their feeding. However, it is very selective on the host and uses some signals like vibrations and exhaled carbon dioxide to detect their best hosts.</li>
<li>Their hind legs are also powerful enough to jump 150 times their own length to get to the host. As for the female, they start to lay eggs within a period of 48 hours.
All the eggs laid before mating are infertile and will not hatch. As the flea takes more of pet blood it continues to lay eggs that hatch.</li>
<li>A female can lay up 20-30 per day and up to 180 eggs in its lifespan.
However, if the environmental conditions are not good, the pupa may stay in the cocoon for up to a period of one year.�The adult fleas are not many and their population is about 5 percent.

<h2 id="how-long-do-fleas-live-with-a-host-">**How Long Do Fleas Live With A Host? **</h2>
<p>Fleas as parasites that entirely depend on the host for food. An adult flea can live for a period of 60-100 days from which it depends on the host.
In its entire period, an adult attaches to the host unless its removed through some external forces like grooming and pest control.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-fleas-feed-on-the-host"><strong>How Do Fleas Feed On The Host?</strong></h3>
<p>Fleas feed by sucking blood from their host. Their mouths are adapted to pierce through into the skin to the blood vessel where they draw the blood.
After sucking the blood, they produce an anticoagulant substance that prevents blood from clotting. This substance sometimes causes itchiness and also allergic reactions to pets and also humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas have a high preference for furry animals and pets as compared to humans. They thrive and increase rapidly when with these animals.</li>
<li>Their blood is nutritious and increases the fleas fertility as compared to that of humans.</li>
<li>When feeding, they can do it at least once every 12 hours. They can also suck blood to become gorged 15 times the size of their body.
Basically, if you have pets around your home you are more likely to have a high infestation of fleas as compared to when there are humans only.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>How long can fleas live without a host? Approximately 4-7 days
beyond which it dies
. Because fleas are parasites it is hard for them to live without a host for long.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, fleas have non-feeding stages in their cycle that do not require a host and can live on any other surface.
Fleas prefer furry host-like pets as compared to human beings. They also have adaptations that help them attach and feed on a host and for as long as they can.</li>

flea cycle in 3 months
while adult fleas have a lifespan of ~ 12 days (up to 110+ days).
Fleas will lay about 22 - 51 eggs a day, but this could vary with the prevailing temperature or if there are pesticides around and the fleas&rsquo; food - may be
flea dirt
?
<em>But how long do flea eggs take to hatch? Fleas eggs hatch within 1 (36 hours) to 10 days into larvae but this may vary with environmental conditions like humidity (over 50 %) &amp; temperature (75 to 85 degrees).�</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Once hatched into larvae, these organisms will move freely and feed on flea dirt (body waste) to grow further.�</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-how-long-do-flea-eggs-take-to-hatch">Details: How Long Do Flea Eggs Take To Hatch</h2>
<p>Adult fleas will lay their eggs once they&rsquo;ve sucked enough blood meal - pet blood. Once laid, the flea eggs will require about 1-2 weeks for them to hatch.
With a more humid and warm environment, the flea&rsquo;s eggs will hatch faster and thus their life cycle will continue better. This isn&rsquo;t the case for a dryer and cooler environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The flea&rsquo;s eggs will however survive for roughly 10 days - and thus they can&rsquo;t hatch after the 10 days are over.
With the right conditions, the fleas&rsquo; eggs may actually hatch in about 36 hours.</li>
<li>After hatching, can you recognize the difference between these flea eggs and their larvae?
However, flea larvae are bout 1/12-inch - 1/8-inch (~2 to 3 mm in length) and have a blackhead, segmented body, and yellowish-white in color.</li>
<li>The larvae are hatched while blind - and they&rsquo;ll evade any location with bright light - and thus they&rsquo;ll burrow themselves into grass, cracks, and carpets.
Further, flea larvae are about 30% of the whole population of fleas. Next, the larvae develop into 5-20 days to spin a cocoon pupa - its hard cocoon allows it to hide in fabrics and carpets.</li>
<li>Flea pupa may remain in that stage for about 1 week - 1 year; they&rsquo;ll emerge from the cocoon due to stimuli such as carbon dioxide, and the body heat of a suitable host.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-will-kill-the-flea-eggs">What Will Kill the Flea Eggs?</h2>
<p>To exterminate fleas eggs, you&rsquo;ll require to undertake a 2-stage process; which will involve
killing the adult fleas (and their eggs) on the cat
or dogs then you&rsquo;ll kill those flea eggs occupying the house.</p>
<h3 id="1-fleavacuuming"><strong>1. Flea�Vacuuming�</strong></h3>
<p>So, after you&rsquo;ve exterminated the fleas on your pet, I advise that you go on to control the bugs in the house,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">yard, or garden using some effective flea sprays</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea vacuuming has proven to be an effective technique to control fleas and their eggs.</li>
<li>I advise you to drop mothballs into that vacuum bag - and remember to dispose of that bag (after sealing) as this will prevent flea hatching inside there.
Inspect and repair the rotating brush and suction of the vacuum cleaner if it is faulty.</li>
<li>Begin the flea vacuuming with the floors, and baseboards then move to the upholstered furniture, carpets, crevices &amp; cracks.
So, with an effective vacuuming machine and using the correct techniques, you&rsquo;ll effectively remove all the flea dirt, pupae, larvae, and also adult fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-flea-control-products"><strong>2. Flea Control Products</strong></h3>
<p>So, take the cats &amp; dogs (and other pets in the household) to the veterinarian. This professional will examine the pets to check how far the flea challenge has gone and thus treat it well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since not all the flea control products will work exactly effectively, the veterinarian will assist in choosing an effective one for your pet&rsquo;s flea problem.
Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are considered some of the best you may use in killing even flea eggs - the isoxazolines are described as pet-safe.</li>
<li>Further, a few of the IGRs are noted to operate through sterilization of the female of the fleas, and hence the eggs they produce won&rsquo;t be viable.
Some of the effective flea products that have IGRs include flea sprays, spot-on skin creams, oral medications - some of these you can apply on the bedding of pets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-launder-the-clothes"><strong>3. Launder the Clothes�</strong></h3>
<p>The next step you must take is to launder the clothes and bedding as this will exterminate or also expose those fleas (and eggs) hiding in the fabrics and their seams.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, take those bedding, upholstery, and linen and launder them at the highest allowable temperature depending on the fabric.
Remember to use the hottest (temperature) cycle, bleach, and appropriate detergent - it&rsquo;ll be working even well if you can
drop the fabrics into a dyer to kill fleas
.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-diatomaceous-earth">4. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth functions well to exterminate fleas - this will work well if you sprinkle it on the pets bedding, carpets.
The US
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/degen.html#products">NPIC</a>
outlines that Diatomaceous Earth will dry out the fleas&rsquo; exoskeleton and cuticle (including their fats and oils) due to the sharp edges that will cut the outer shell.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the Diatomaceous Earth could be dangerous to the pet&rsquo;s digestive and respiratory tracts and thus you would do well to avoid sprinkling it on areas where pets lay.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-use-dawn-dish-soap">5. Use Dawn Dish Soap</h3>
<p>On whether you
can use dawn dish soap to kill fleas
, I can confirm that it&rsquo;s possible to safely exterminate these bugs using this DIY remedy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dish soap, however, doesn&rsquo;t be suitable for use on the pet&rsquo;s skin because it can strip off their natural oils - and hence it could get infections.
Further, the dish won&rsquo;t be effective to determine the adult fleas - but will be good for washing off those flea eggs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6vinegar">6.�Vinegar</h3>
<p>Vinegar will exterminate the adult fleas - and not flea eggs - and thus spraying a solution of the vinegar + water, you may be effective in repelling the fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, we&rsquo;ve noted that flea eggs will be stubborn to exterminate, and thus it&rsquo;d be helpful to get an appropriate technique to control them - flea vacuuming is one good way.
However, it&rsquo;ll help to take to the veterinarian and use their approved methods to ensure that you exterminate the whole flea life cycle in the vicinity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, how long do flea eggs take to hatch - this will be about 1 day to a0 days beyond which the fleas eggs will have died.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can control fleas using a myriad of techniques such as flea vacuuming, dawn dish soap, diatomaceous earth, laundering the fabrics, and using vinegar.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas are tiny, pesky insects that can cause discomfort to both pets and humans. While fleas are commonly associated with pets like dogs and cats, they can also infest human hosts. Understanding how long fleas can <a href="/posts/can-fleas-live-in-carpets/">live</a> on humans is important for preventing bites and controlling infestations. Lets explore the lifespan of fleas on humans and how you can deal with them effectively.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-do-fleas-live-on-humans">How Long Do Fleas Live on Humans?</h2>
<p>Fleas do not typically live on humans for long periods of time. While they may bite humans to feed on blood, they prefer to stay on the fur of animals, particularly pets. However, fleas can still be a nuisance for humans, and understanding their behavior can help in managing an infestation.</p>
<h3 id="the-flea-life-cycle">The Flea Life Cycle</h3>
<p>To better understand how long fleas live on humans, its important to first understand their life cycle. The flea life cycle consists of four stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Egg:**Fleas lay eggs on their hosts, and these eggs fall off into the environment.</li>
<li>**Larva:**The eggs hatch into larvae that feed on organic matter, including flea feces, which contain undigested blood.</li>
<li>**Pupa:**After feeding, larvae turn into pupae, where they will remain until they mature into adult fleas.</li>
<li>**Adult:**Adult fleas are the ones that feed on blood and lay eggs, continuing the cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-long-fleas-live-on-humans">How Long Fleas Live on Humans</h3>
<p>Adult fleas generally do not stay on humans for an extended period. When a flea jumps onto a human, it may stay for a short time to feed. Typically, fleas remain on humans for
<strong>a few hours to a few days</strong>
at most, depending on whether they can find a suitable environment to continue feeding. They prefer to stay on animals where they can access fur, which provides protection and warmth.
Fleas will often leave a human host once they have finished feeding. If they cannot find a pet or animal to host them, they will jump off and search for a more suitable environment.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-remove-fleas-from-humans">How to Remove Fleas from Humans</h3>
<p>If you suspect that fleas have bitten you or are infesting your body, its important to act quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Shower Immediately:**Washing with soap and water will help remove fleas from your skin.</li>
<li>**Use Flea Treatment:**Topical flea treatments or flea repellents can be applied to prevent further bites.</li>
<li>**Clean Your Environment:**Fleas may have laid eggs in your living space. Wash your bedding, clothes, and vacuum frequently to eliminate flea eggs and larvae.</li>
<li>**Check Your Pets:**If you have pets, ensure they are treated with flea prevention treatments, as they are the main source of the infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-fleas-breed-on-humans">Do Fleas Breed on Humans?</h3>
<p>No, fleas do not breed on humans. They may bite and feed, but they lay their eggs on the ground or on animal hosts. Fleas are not capable of reproducing on human skin or in human hair, and the adult fleas you encounter will eventually leave if no suitable host is available.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-flea-infestations-on-humans">Preventing Flea Infestations on Humans</h3>
<p>Preventing fleas from living on humans requires addressing the source of the infestation. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Regularly Treat Pets:**Use flea treatments or preventive medications on your pets to prevent fleas from infesting them and transferring to humans.</li>
<li>**Maintain Clean Living Spaces:**Clean your home regularly, especially areas where your pets spend a lot of time, such as their bedding or favorite lounging spots.</li>
<li>**Protective Clothing:**If you are around areas with a flea infestation, wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants can help keep fleas away from your skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fleas are not likely to live on humans for extended periods, but their bites can be annoying and uncomfortable. They prefer animal hosts but will jump onto humans to feed when necessary. By maintaining a clean environment, treating your pets, and using flea repellents, you can minimize the risk of flea infestations on humans. If you notice signs of flea bites or an infestation, take immediate action to eliminate the fleas and prevent further discomfort.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">Flea</a> eggs are one of the most important stages in the flea life cycle, and understanding how long it takes for them to hatch can help you effectively manage a flea infestation. Flea eggs typically hatch within a certain period, depending on environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of a host. This article will provide an overview of how long it takes for flea eggs to hatch and what you can do to speed up the process of eliminating fleas from your home.</p>
<h2 id="flea-egg-hatching-process">Flea Egg Hatching Process</h2>
<p>Flea eggs are laid by adult fleas, and once they are deposited, they can begin the hatching process. Under optimal conditions, flea eggs typically take about 2 to 10 days to hatch. However, the timing can vary based on environmental factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Temperature:**Warmer temperatures speed up the hatching process. Flea eggs are most likely to hatch when the temperature is between 70F to 90F (21C to 32C).</li>
<li>**Humidity:**Fleas thrive in humid conditions, and eggs are more likely to hatch quickly when the humidity is above 50%. Lower humidity levels can slow down the process or even prevent eggs from hatching.</li>
<li>**Presence of a Host:**Fleas detect vibrations and the presence of a host, which may also encourage eggs to hatch. If fleas sense a potential food source nearby, they may hatch sooner.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-the-hatching-time-matters">Why the Hatching Time Matters</h2>
<p>Understanding the hatching time of flea eggs is important for several reasons. Fleas reproduce rapidly, so its essential to prevent eggs from hatching to avoid further infestations. Taking the right preventive measures and using flea control products can help reduce the hatching cycle and prevent adult fleas from developing.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-control-flea-eggs">How to Control Flea Eggs</h2>
<p>Controlling flea eggs requires a comprehensive approach that targets the different stages of the flea life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Vacuuming:**Vacuuming regularly is an effective way to remove flea eggs, larvae, and pupae from carpets, upholstery, and other surfaces. Be sure to empty the vacuum bag or canister immediately to prevent reinfestation.</li>
<li>**Flea Control Products:**Use flea treatments such as flea sprays, powders, and treatments that target flea eggs. Many products contain insect growth regulators (IGRs) that prevent flea eggs from hatching or stop larvae from maturing into adult fleas.</li>
<li>**Washing Bedding and Fabrics:**Wash pet bedding, linens, and other fabric materials frequently in hot water to kill flea eggs and larvae. Dry these items on high heat to ensure that any remaining eggs are destroyed.</li>
<li>**Treating Pets:**Use flea treatments on your pets to prevent adult fleas from laying new eggs. Consult with your veterinarian to find the best treatment for your pet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="factors-that-influence-flea-egg-hatch-time">Factors That Influence Flea Egg Hatch Time</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the time it takes for flea eggs to hatch can be influenced by several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Egg Quality:**Flea eggs laid by healthy, well-fed adult fleas are more likely to hatch quickly. Eggs laid by malnourished fleas or under less-than-ideal conditions may take longer to hatch.</li>
<li>**Environmental Disruptions:**Any sudden changes in the environment, such as cleaning, can disrupt the flea life cycle. Flea eggs might take longer to hatch if the temperature or humidity drops unexpectedly.</li>
<li>**Stage of Flea Development:**Flea eggs will go through different stages of development before hatching, and this process can be delayed if fleas are in the pupal stage or if they are in an environment that is not conducive to hatching.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Flea eggs generally take between 2 to 10 days to hatch, but this timeline can vary depending on temperature, humidity, and the presence of a host. If youre dealing with a flea infestation, its important to take action quickly to prevent eggs from hatching and causing further problems. By using flea control products, vacuuming regularly, and washing bedding, you can help control the flea population and prevent future infestations. Always ensure your pets are treated for fleas, and consult with a veterinarian for the best approach to managing flea problems.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By breaking the flea life <a href="/posts/flea-life-cycle/">cycle</a>, you will not only prevent further growth but also terminate breeding progress from that particular stage;
i.e. eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On how long does it take to break the flea life cycle; the simple answer is about 1 to 6 months;�for the different stages, this is how long it&rsquo;ll take to break the flea cycle; egg stage break period (10-18 days), larvae stage break period (2 to 3 months), pupae stage break period (4 months.), adult stage break (5 months).�</strong>
amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best [Fleas Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
Each stage may be broken independently though the elimination time varies from one stage to another.
When breaking the flea life cycle, it is important to identify the size of the infestation,
type of infested items
(is it pets, humans, or furniture), prevailing weather conditions, and possible source of infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-break-the-flea-life-cycle">How Long Does It Take To Break the Flea Life Cycle?</h2>
<p>Select a flea termination method that is environmentally friendly and safe for both pets &amp; human beings. Remember, if you are new to the flea-breaking process; contract a professional exterminator for help.</p>
<h3 id="a-egg-stage-break-period">a. Egg Stage Break Period</h3>
<p>Upon mating, the female flea lays up to 50 eggs per day on the host - this could be your carpet, furniture, dog, cat, or rag. Eggs easily fall from the host and thus end up spreading in different places.</p>
<ul>
<li>These eggs will hatch after 6 to 14 days on average. However, this period decreases in warmer temperatures (warmth favors the hatching process).
To break the fleas life cycle at the egg stage, you need to destroy all eggs laid as soon as they appear. To do this, you can vacuum your flea-infested items or animals sufficiently -this should be done daily for 10 to 18 days.</li>
<li>Vacuuming sucks eggsfrom the host and accelerates the hatching process, which exposes tiny eggs into visible larvae.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use fleas foggers that are specifically manufactured to kill eggs. You need to spray fleas-infested areas as soon as you see fleas&rsquo; eggs (small, tiny, white, and oval-shaped).
Fumigation should be done thrice per week for 3 weeks - this method works best for outdoor fleas elimination. Ensure that the fogger selected is safe for both pets and humans.</li>
<li>Steam indoor up to temperatures above 100 degrees - at this point, no eggs can survive.</li>
<li>On average, breaking fleas&rsquo; eggs takes 14 to 30 days.
This method may not work effectively, especially when adult fleas fail to lay eggs due to lack of food - remember, an adult flea only lays eggs after a blood meal. In addition, you may fumigate the area far before eggs are laid, thus making the method ineffective.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-larvae-stage-break-period">b. Larvae Stage Break Period</h3>
<p>Upon hatching (after about 14 days or so) flea&rsquo;s eggs become larvae. These are generally tiny worms that hide deepest into the host&rsquo;s skin, hair, or furniture  usually, larvae are scared away by the light, and hence difficult to see them during the day.
The larvae stage is the largest in the flea cycle (about 58% of the population). By breaking the larvae stage, you will reduce or eliminate fleas&rsquo; population far (over half) and reduce further breeding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, flea larvae feed on &ldquo;flea dirt&rdquo; or flea excrete and dry blood on the host (if any).</li>
<li>The use of flea larvae sprays works amazingly in killing larva entirely. All you need to do is to spray larvae as soon as they appear - you need to observe the tiny worms crawling on the host.
You can steam -clean your house, furniture, rags, and pet&rsquo;s beddings thoroughly.� Soaking larvae-infested items in concentrated soapy detergent work excellently.
Flea larvae stage stays for 21 to 37 days, after which they change to pupae. Actually, you are advised to continuously undertake larvae elimination at least twice a week for 2 to 3 months at most in order to break the entire link.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-pupae-stage-break-period">c. Pupae Stage Break Period</h3>
<p>The flea pupae stage takes about 2 to 3 weeks to mature into an adult. However, it may take even 6 months while still in its cocoon until it finds a live host - recall that flea feeds on blood and hence needs to get a host for meal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though the flea pupa stage is not pronounced as compared to the later ones, this stage is the most cumbersome to break. Why because, most methods tend to fail in killing the live pupae while its still in the cocoon.</li>
<li>By using foggers or sprays, the chemical may fail to penetrate the cocoon layer, thus leaving the pupae alive.
On the other hand, vacuuming will just suck the pupa from the host, while the spinning action may not kill the live pupae as it is in the case of flea eggs.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the pupa (upon changing to adult) can stay in its cocoon for over 5 months without food, thus evading any surface killing action undertaken.</li>
<li>Indeed, the best method for breaking the flea pupa stage is steaming or room heating - you can heat chamber/room with flea pupa infestation to temperatures above 100 degrees - high temperatures kill pupa sufficiently.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can soak pet&rsquo;s beddings, infested items, and rags in steam at 100 degrees for a super killing effect. This method can be done once a week for about 4 months.</li>
<li>NB: Always be keen once you eliminate flea pupa since most play dead but later rise to life.
Normally, you should
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-the-house-fast/">vacuum your home or furniture thoroughly</a>
after steam cleaning - helps pick up dead and live pupae too. The vacuumed waste should be burnt sufficiently during disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-adult-stage-break-period">d. Adult Stage Break Period</h3>
<p>The adult flea plays a vital role in the propagation of the flea life cycle - reproduction. Actually, it&rsquo;s the adult fleas that mate and lay eggs that bring forth a new generation.</p>
<ul>
<li>By breaking the flea adult stage, you will be focusing on the root cause of flea infestation, which is often overlooked.
Adult fleas are highly visible since they move by jumping on their host. They account for about 2% of the entire population. Adult fleas can live for 6 to 12 months, especially when there is plenty of blood meal.</li>
<li>The use of adult flea foggers works sufficiently in breaking the cycle  cuticle disintegration. Actually, the chemical in the fogger kills the live adult flea, thus preventing future infestation.
Using borax powder over flea-infested items also kills them. However, this power should not be used on pets as it may cause discomfort.
Superheated steam (above 100 degrees) kills adult fleas completely. You can opt to soak fleas infested items in soapy water too - the fleas are suffocated to death.
The process of breaking the adult flea life cycle should be undertaken weekly for about 5 months  case of large flea infestation. Keen monitoring should also be carried out after the breaking period to assess any future re-infestation.

<h3 id="e-entire-life-cycle-break-period">e. Entire Life Cycle Break Period</h3>
<p>At times, it may not be possible to eliminate a particular stage of the flea&rsquo;s life cycle. Therefore, it&rsquo;s recommended to have a suitable alternative that breaks its entire stages.
Killing the whole flea life cycle (eggs, larvae, pupae, and adult) guarantees safety and security to both pets and human inhabitants. In fact, such an option works amazingly for a large flea population since the reproduction is continuous, thus making it difficult to separate flea life cycle stages while they are still on their host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Superheated steam is the best option when it comes to killing the entire flea life cycle - the method kills eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults instantly on contact. You will not find any life flea since high heat levels eliminate any chance of flea survival.
The vacuuming method is just sufficient enough in eliminating the entire flea life cycle  sucks and spins. However, upon vacuuming, the sucked fleas plus larvae and eggs should be burnt sufficiently during disposal - this reduces the chances of live flea escaping.
Currently, we have commercial foggers and sprays that are specially manufactured to eliminate the entire flea life cycle. Such products can be used as well. However, you must be keen on the labels that ascertain required properties and safety accrued to areas you intend to use upon.
By the fact that a single flea can lay over 15 times in a year (over 2000 eggs); then, going for a method that would kill the entire life cycle is highly recommendable. Generally, it will take 1 to 6 months to break the entire flea life cycle and 4 months on average.

<h2 id="which-factors-affect-the-flea-life-cycle">Which Factors Affect the Flea Life Cycle?</h2>
<p>Flea&rsquo;s life cycle is affected primarily by some of the following factors:</p>
<h3 id="1-temperature">1. Temperature</h3>
<p>Low temperature (below 50 degrees) inactivates the flea&rsquo;s normal life. Actually, fleas become less active and tend to remain deep underneath the host&rsquo;s skin or infested items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrary, warm temperatures favor fleas infestation - they tend to reproduce more and even become extra active on the surface.
However, too much temperature (above 100 degrees) denatures the active enzymes in the flea body, thus leading to death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-foodmeal">2. Food/meal</h3>
<p>Food (blood meal) is critical to any flea as it determines how many days it lives. As highlighted back in this article, upon changing into an adult, the pupae remain in its cocoon until it finds a host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, the host is meant to provide blood meals.
Fleas will visit your room just to suck your blood for food. Flea infestation in pet&rsquo;s beddings basically is just a waiting room for blood-sucking - as soon as your pet sleeps on it; then, fleas begin to bite and suck the blood.
Without food, fleas will vacate or die eventually.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-hostshelter">3. Host/Shelter</h3>
<p>Fleas look for shelter in any host - this could be your furniture, rug, clothes, pet, or carpet. All fleas want is somewhere they can hide temporarily, as they look for their blood meal in the vicinity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas have a tendency of sucking blood and retreating to the hideouts - this is a trick used by bedbugs too.</li>
<li>Your pet beddings or hair will shield fleas sufficiently such that most of the time you may never see them with your naked eyes.
The shelter is key and plays a great role in fleas&rsquo; life only when it&rsquo;s located near the source of food. Otherwise, they will relocate or die out of starvation with time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-humidity">4. Humidity</h3>
<p>Too much much water content in fleas&rsquo; shelters inhibits their life and survival. Usually, they get drown and die with time.
Eggs laid on the wet or moist ground fail to hatch, while larvae die of extremely humid conditions.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-tell-if-you-have-fleas-in-your-place">How to Tell if You Have Fleas in Your Place</h2>
<p>Below are ways to tell if you have fleas infestation in your place:</p>
<h3 id="a-red-bites-and-inflammation">a. Red bites and Inflammation</h3>
<p>Once you find red bites on your skin or small inflammation, the chance is that you were attacked by fleas. Unlike bedbugs, flea bites form reddish swell or inflammation.
Moreover, the bites are scattered around a particular area</p>
<h3 id="b-dried-blood-stains">b. Dried Blood Stains</h3>
<p>When bitten by fleas, the bloodstain dries on the skin surfaces and forms a reddish scar. At times, you will find a broken bleeding skin that was just mild, especially when you wake up in the morning.</p>
<h3 id="c-continuous-scratch-by-pets">c. Continuous Scratch by Pets</h3>
<p>Flea&rsquo;s bites leave an itching sensation. Usually, youll tend to scratch your skin as soon as you get bitten by a flea.
If you pay close attention to your pet (a dog or a cat), it tends to scratch itself intermittently at different points as soon as it gets bitten. The scratching may last for one minute or so, but not specific.</p>
<h3 id="d-live-jumping-flea">d. Live Jumping Flea</h3>
<p>If you take a keen observation on flea-infested items, you will literally find live fleas jump. The jump could be even a foot wide, depending on where it wants to land.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often, fleas jump from the host when they detect danger - perhaps when there is scratching or disturbance. Some jumps are short and continuous.
You need to intentionally disturb the flea hideouts and make keen observations using your eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e-flea-dirt">e. Flea Dirt</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Flea dirt&rsquo; is actually the excrete that&rsquo;s left behind on their host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, you will see blood life stains or dried blood, which when touched detach easily from the skin surface.
For large flea population (especially on pets), the infested area tend to appear reddish - for the case of dogs, it&rsquo;s around the neck region and ears. The flea dirt may settle on swollen flea bites too.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-flea-in-your-home">How to Prevent Flea in Your Home</h2>
<p>The following are preventive ways of curbing flea infestation in your home:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cleaning/washing all pets beddings, carpets, and rags in hot water (with soap) -plus dawn dish soap</li>
<li>All furniture and pets beddings, as well as cloths, should be vacuumed often and inspected against fleas</li>
<li>Usingfleas preventive foggersis recommended in a kennel where necessary</li>
<li>Fumigate your house often with flea repellant and dispose of dirty items  flea hideouts</li>
<li>Trim bushes and grass in your home to standard height within your home</li>
<li>Always get a flea profession to carry out flea inspection</li>
<li>Frequently take your pets for veterinarian attention  check if they are infested with fleas</li>
<li>Wash all fleas infested items at high temperature - kills entire flea life cycle</li>
<li>Often, vacuum your furniture, carpets, pet beddings, and other items to remove any flea attractants in your home.</li>
<li>Avoid mixing yourpets with others from outside they may be infected</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on how long does it take to break the flea life cycle, the direct answer is 1 to 6 months. However, this period may vary (either decrease or prolong) depending on the stage at which you decide to break the flea life cycle. Flea&rsquo;s life cycle breaking process will not only curb further growth but also inhibit breeding progress sufficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, a flea has four stages in its life cycle, i.e. eggs, larvae, pupae, and adult. You can opt to break flea at a specific stage depending on the termination method you select.</li>
<li>Though each stage may be broken independently, the elimination time needed may vary from one stage to another. In addition, opting for a method that kills the entire flea life cycle would be the best choice.
When undertaking fleas&rsquo; life cycle breaking process, it&rsquo;s wise if you identify the size of the infestation, type of infested items (is it pets, human, or furniture), prevailing weather conditions, and possible source of infestation. More so, go for the flea termination method that&rsquo;s environmentally friendly and safe for both humans &amp; pets.</li>

<dd>does my dog have fleas? Or is it just unfounded fear?
Since I acquired my dog pet: my fluffy king, I have had numerous challenges. Some of them include feed selection,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-dogs/">flea medication selection</a>
, and safety.
However, none of the above challenges with my dog has been
disturbing as seeing fleas

<h2 id="how-to-check-for-fleas-7-steps-with-pictures">How to Check for Fleas? 7 Steps (with Pictures)</h2>
<p>To check for dog fleas on your pet, you will require the following tools; a
flea�comb
,
soaped water
, and a white kitchen�paper.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-conduct-a-visual-check-on-your-dog"><strong>Step #1: Conduct a visual check on your dog</strong></h3>
<p>Despite that flea are small in body size, it is possible to catch a bug&rsquo;s glimpse
when jumping
from one place to another. You might not see it on the first day you check, but if you are keen enough, you will finally set an eye on some of them.
The fleas are brown and appear fat when they have sucked blood from you or your pets. They will
also jump rapidly
to avoid being caught or escape harsh conditions such as water, chemicals, and hot objects.
However, if you see your dog scratching, it is time you should already consider the best flea control techniques.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-flea-comb-youth-dog"><strong>Step #2: Flea Comb youth dog</strong></h3>
<p>Upon careful consideration, you can order a
flea comb
to undertake this exercise. Run the
flea comb
through the dogs fur or coat.
Ensure to put
adequate pressure on the flea comb
to touch the dogs skin smoothly. Check if the flea comb has picked some adult fleas or flea�dirt�(flea droppings or fleas).�Drown any fleas that you catch using soapy water.
Flea droppings are mainly comma-shaped, and when placed on the wet kitchen paper, they leave a red ring, signifying blood from the flea.

<strong>Next, some details on the flea life cycle �</strong>
This will help you understand why fleas have always come back and how you can wittingly get ahead of the coming fleas generation.
<strong>The flea life cycle is divided into four stages:</strong>
<strong>- Eggs:</strong>
One adult
flea can lay about 40 eggs
each day. Female
fleas lay eggs
24-36 hours after they take the first blood meal (flea bite). The eggs are visible to a naked eye and look pearly white, and are oval.
<strong>- Larvae</strong>
the larvae stage lasts from 5-12 days. Fleas have 3 larval stages.
<strong>- Pupa</strong>
Flea has 4 pupa stages: This is a highly protect phase of the fleas and may last up to 210 days.
<strong>- Pre-emergent adults</strong>
This stage is also referred to as the waiting stage. Notably, fleas in this stage emerge as adults if stimulated by heat, carbon dioxide, pressure, and vibration.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-target-the-entire-flea-life-cycle">**Step #3: **<strong>Target the Entire Flea Life Cycle</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe youll require using a combination of
flea treatment
options to eliminate the bugs from your home.
To effectively control the fleas, youll need to keep your dog indoors for 2 weeks after treating him, the kernel, and his bedding. However, you can still walk with him but avoid the lawns to avoid re-infestation.
After treating the
dog and house for fleas
, continue vacuuming the floors. Vacuuming will help eject the
flea eggs and larvae
from their cocoons and thus be reached by the insecticide.

<p>Dog fleas are small brown insects that attack dogs and cats, and other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite being small in body size, dog fleas can be seen using naked eyes. Also,fleas jump and hop from one hostto another with their strong legs.</li>
<li>Therefore, I must have been getting it wrong as the flea treatments only provided short-lived solutions.</li>
<li>Over the years, I have learned the need to have the right information about fleas&rsquo;signs and symptomson my dog and the useful products for controlling the bugs.</li>
<li>**Surely:�**You would like to learn from my experience; rather than yours! I have learned how to manage my cat and the pest that affects it the hard way.</li>
<li>Therefore, read on to learn the various signs, symptoms,recommended treatments, and safety precautions to take while considering fleas on your dog.
<strong>So, how do you free your dog from fleas?�</strong>
After a careful analysis of expert veterinary information combined with the vast experience with dealing with my dogs, in this guide,
<strong>I will aim to answer the following questions:�</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-do-fleas-keep-coming-back">Why do fleas keep coming back?</h1>
<p>Fleas thrive excellently in warm summer months and wet spring months but may appear at any time. However, after the flea appears in your residence, getting rid of them will be a daunting task.
While you start on the journey to fight fleas in your residence and on your dog, fleas have a particular advantage that makes them very hardy. Here the particular flea advantages:
<strong>Biological advantages</strong>
Flea has very back legs with significant muscle powers. The powerful legs enable the pest to jump about 1 foot vertically and 4-5 feet horizontally. These biological features allow the flea to navigate from one host to another and hide from different insect control mechanisms.
<strong>Advanced and long life cycle</strong>
Female
fleas lay many eggs
, about 30 eggs, in a day, and thus have a high reproduction rate. The eggs are also tiny and can thus hide on your dog or in cracks, crevices, and carpets. The eggs&rsquo; lightweight allows the dog to carry them around your house and fall off in different locations in your residence.
Flea eggs hatch within
one week, which could delay waiting for the right conditions. After hatching, the eggs turn into larvae.
The
flea larvae
create cocoons, and they move into them to grow into pupae, which takes about 1 week. However, fleas in the cocoon can survive for 6 months if they are not favorable to become adults. Also, a female flea can survive for about 1.5 years.
<strong>Fleas have good hiding</strong>
abilities.
For each flea that you spot in your facility, there could be other hundreds hiding in different locations such as under carpets and cracks. The
fleas that are hiding
could be in different developmental stages: larvae, eggs, and cocoons.
Therefore, it would be helpful to use products such as the
best fogger for fleas
in your home when there is a major infestation.
A flea can survive without feeding.
**Surprisingly! **
Fleas are capable of surviving for a long time without feeding. For example, after one blood feeding, the flea can survive for one month.
Various insect controlling chemicals such as
sprays
and foggers are good at fighting adult fleas. However, I recommend that you use
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A755Q3O/?tag=p-policy-20">natural pest control concentrate</a>
to kill fleas in all their developmental stages.</p>
<h2 id="prevent-flea-re-infestation-on-your-dog">Prevent flea re-infestation on your dog?</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-control-fleas-outside-the-house"><strong>Step #1: Control Fleas outside the house</strong></h3>
<p>Do you have a lawn outside your house? That should be your first concern while you are aiming to
prevent flea infestation
on your dog. Lawns form an excellent residence for fleas, their eggs, and larvae.
Fleas love living
in the grass, and from there, they can hop and jump onto any animal, including you and your dog, that passes on the lawn.
Therefore, you should cut the grass short to enable heat from the sun to get to the roots. Such a condition would make the fleas uncomfortable, and thus fleas would not hide there.
Also, you can sprinkle
Diatomaceous Earth
(DE) on the lawn. The
Diatomaceous Earth
would break the fleas skins, absorb its moisture and thus kill them. Further, sprinkle the powder in the pets house and around your house.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-treat-you-dog-to-fleas"><strong>Step #2: Treat you Dog to fleas</strong></h3>
<p>After tackling the fleas from outside your house, it is now time to
kill or prevent any fleas
that would like to make your dog their host.
There are many products available to
treat fleas on your dog and cats
. Ensure to read online buyer reviews and talk to your vet to learn the best practices
for flea
prevention and control.
Despite that you might consider
cats and dogs
as almost equals, it is critical to note that some dog flea treatment chemicals can harm your cat. Therefore, please consult with your vet, read label instructions, and adhere to them!</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-flea-treat-my-indoor-dogs"><strong>Do I Need To Flea Treat My Indoor Dogs?</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the that your pets are always indoors, fleas will attack it like any other roaming pet. Notably, fleas, like any other insects, will jump into your dogs kernel at any time, and thus, you need to take safety control measures.
Many wild animals such as foxes, squirrels, and even rats may
carry fleas
. Also, wild and outdoor cats carry fleas, and when they pass near your homestead, they
drop the fleas
, their eggs, and larvae. Then, the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/">fleas jump onto any human</a>
being or animal to reach your indoor dog.
If there are some critters in your house, then they can carry fleas to the indoor dog. Despite that you may not set eyes on the mice, they could drop the fleas and their eggs in the house. The eggs would hatch and attach themselves to another host, the indoor cat or dog.

<p>But, what color are flea eggs on a cat? Well, flea eggs have a rounded oval shape. If freshly deposited,
flea eggs
will look translucent white but change to pearl-like and opaque with time. Experts consider
flea eggs as dandruff
flakes, salt grains, and tiny pearls shaped.</p>
<h3 id="1-bathe-the-cat-with-a-flea-shampoo">1. Bathe the cat with a flea shampoo</h3>
<p>The kittens under 12 weeks old use ordinary
dish soap
to clean them up of any debris, fleas, and flea eggs.
However, mature cats, use cat
flea shampoo
to undertake the same role, mainly because adult cats can withstand insecticides and smell.
Cat flea shampoo has insecticides that will kill the adult frees and break their life cycle to stop them from further egg-laying. In this early bathing process, some
flea eggs will be washed
off the�cats fur.</p>
<h3 id="2-brush-the-cats-fur-using-aflea-comb">2. Brush the cat&rsquo;s fur using aFlea comb</h3>
<p>Next, take the special
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-combs-for-dogs/">flea comb</a>
. The flea comb must be designed to create closely spaced tines to comb the small fleas and any cat flea eggs present.
Therefore, upon running the
flea combs
a few times in the cat&rsquo;s fur, youll notice some back fleas and some rice-looking flea eggs coming off.
Ensure that the combing process is thorough on the cats chest and neck since fleas love the area - try

<h3 id="3-give-oral-cat-flea-preventative">3. Give oral cat flea preventative</h3>
<p>Also, cover the flea comb with some petroleum jelly so that the flea eggs and small fleas can stick to it.
To clean off the fleas and their eggs, ensure that dip the comb into soapy water or some
rubbing alcohol
which also will suffocate and kill them.</p>

Borax is highly toxic to fleas
and other bugs when inhaled or ingested. It works by dehydrating the bugs, larvae, and eggs, resulting in their ultimate death.

<p>Fleas will reproduce at a quick rate and after laying eggs the growth of the population will be very fast.
But you can remove fleas from your bed without hiring an exterminator -
even during winter
. Here are the steps you must take.</p>
<h3 id="1-verify-that-its-fleas">1. Verify that its Fleas</h3>
<p>Correct identification is a critical step while controlling pests including fleas.
So you have to respond to this question &ldquo;are these pests on my bed really fleas?&rdquo;
In summary here are the signs that will show the presence of fleas in your bed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Live Adult fleas</li>
<li><a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-flea-eggs-on-cats/">Flea</a> skin</li>
<li>Flea larvae</li>
<li>Flea eggs</li>
<li>Flea bite marks</li>
<li>Flea dirt</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="a-live-adult-fleas">a. Live Adult fleas</h4>
<p>Adult fleas will be visible to your naked eyes and will bite humans - they aren&rsquo;t microscopic or too tiny like the
dust mites
.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you can easily spot the fleas on your bed provided the eyes aren&rsquo;t too weak.
On physical appearance, fleas measure about 0.3 inches and they are reddish-brown or brown in color.
One distinguishing feature between fleas and bed bugs is that fleas can jump high thanks to their long hind legs which are visible.</li>
<li>Bed bugs luck the hind legs and they&rsquo;re also flat and oval-shaped.
You can check for fleas on the headboard, bed frame, or under pillows and mattresses.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-flea-skin">b. Flea skin</h4>
<p>Flea larvae will shed skin (twice) during the molting or growth process as they graduate to become pupae.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you see some flea skin on your bed it is enough to sign that there are larvae and adult fleas around.
But the flea skin casings (exuviae) will be seen easily using some magnifying glass.</li>
<li>The skins casings (when viewed using a magnifying glass) will appear like some soft white tube that is soft.
You can check for the flea skin on the bed frame headboard and under the mattress.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c-flea-larvae">c. Flea larvae</h4>
<p>Flea larvae may be challenging to spot because they are microscopic, measuring about 2 mm to 5 mm.</p>
<ul>
<li>The tiny worms will have an off-white color and some hairy bristles.
The flea larvae will be hiding most of the time (in cracks and gaps) since they don&rsquo;t crawl regularly on the bed.
But the worms will come out occasionally to
eat flea dirt
. They won&rsquo;t live on or bite humans.
The flea larvae will molt through different stages to become pupae (cocooned fleas).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="d-flea-eggs">d. Flea Eggs</h4>
<p>Without a magnifying glass, it will also be challenging to see flea eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>But these eggs will look like some salt grains measuring about 0.55 mm -quite tiny.
The flea eggs will have an oval shape - a feature that will help appreciate them from salt grains.
Qualify any grains that you find on the bed as flea eggs then they must be off-white, oval, and soft.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e-flea-bite-marks">e. Flea Bite Marks</h4>
<p>The presence of flea bite marks on a human who was sleeping on a bed can signify the presence of these pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Characteristic features of the flea bite marks are that they are red, tiny, and random on the human skin and tend to itch.
On comparing
flea bites vs bed bug bites
; bed bug bites will be spread all over the human body but flea bites are mainly found on the lower extremities (part) of humans.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll find flea bite marks on knee bends, uncles, and lower body
Flea bite marks are also comparatively smaller compared to the marks of bed bug bites.
Bed bug bites will look like some form of swelling while flea bites will appear like pimples or acne.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-dont-allow-pets-on-the-bed">2. Dont Allow Pets on the Bed</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fond of allowing pets including cats and dogs to sleep next to you in the bed, it&rsquo;s time you either flea-treat animals or keep them off your sleeping area.
Cats and dogs (if not properly flea-treated) will drop fleas and their eggs on your bed.
The pests will be hiding in the pet&rsquo;s hair or fur and will drop off once the animal is resting or sleeping on the bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notable signs of these fleas on your bed will include the presence of flea dirt or just flea poop.</li>
<li>If you sprinkle the flea dirt with some water when laid on some white fabric they will return reddish brown.
If you notice fleas bites on your body after you&rsquo;ve slept next to your pet, then it is clear you must reject the enemy from the bed until it is treated.
You should flea-treat the cat or dog to avoid the emergence of a massive flea infestation.
Products I can recommend include;</li>
<li>Thetick and flea collars for dogswill offer protection to the dog for about 6 months.</li>
<li>Flea cleaning shampoowill also be appropriate to increase the protection for humans and pets against fleas.
You should retreat the pet, your home, and the yard to ensure your spaces won&rsquo;t hold fleas and they won&rsquo;t end up in your bed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-wash-all-the-bedding">3. Wash all the bedding</h3>
<p>Next, wash both your bedding and your pets and don&rsquo;t forget the clothes.
I recommend that you wash the bedding in cold water (plus some liquid detergent) first before washing them with hot water.
Another chemical that you can use with the washing water is bleach - this will kill flea eggs and adult fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add some of this bleach into the washing machine before rotating it at high speeds.
Washing the washable bedding materials will help dislodge the flea larvae eggs and adult fleas.
I also recommend that you launder the area rug, pillows, sofa throws and pets bedding using the highest temperature allowable for the materials.
Finally allow the bedding materials that can&rsquo;t be placed in the dryer to dry in the sun outside.
Other items that you must wash at temperatures over 95 degrees Fahrenheit include comforters, blankets, pillowcases, and sheets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-vacuum-the-mattress">4. Vacuum the Mattress</h3>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, you should vacuum the mattress to remove fleas from the bed. But ensure to check that your mattress can be vacuumed and its average drying time.</p>
<ul>
<li>After vacuum cleaning the mattress, don&rsquo;t sleep on it within 6 hours.
Flea eggs will be hiding inside the mattress seams since I don&rsquo;t stick on various offices including the fur of the pet.</li>
<li>This allows the flea eggs to fall off easily from the pet&rsquo;s fur and land on the bed, the carpets, or bed cushions.</li>
<li>Search activities can promote the development of a new and massive flea infestation.
So you should clean the mattress to prevent the advancement of the flea cycle. So, repeatedly vacuum the whole surface of the mattress to help remove the flea larvae, flea eggs, and adult fleas.
The last and the most important part of vacuuming the mattress will be disposing of the vacuum bag correctly to avoid reinfestation of the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-de-flea-the-bed-and-mattress-fully">5. De-Flea The Bed and Mattress Fully</h3>
<p>After vacuuming the mattress and washing the bedding fully, can fleas could still escape and hide in cushions and carpeting waiting to jump back in your bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, experts recommend that you fully deflea the bed area and the mattress.
First, avoid using boric acid because it could be toxic to humans who will be sleeping on that bed.
Below are effective and safe flea killers that you can use around the bed area.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Diatomaceous Earth (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas/">food grade DE</a>
) will kill fleas by breaking their exoskeleton to dehydrate the pests.
Luckily, DE is effective yet non-toxic and so it will help remove that free infestation in just a few days.</li>
<li>The next technique is to de-flea the mattress completely by using quality mattress encasement.
I recommend that you use a
mattress encasement
continuously until there are no more signs of fleas.</li>
<li>Use a quality flea spray such as the Vet&rsquo;s home spray to exterminate the pest.

<ul>

<p>Vacuuming Carpet[/caption]</p>
<h2 id="disinfect-the-items-on-the-carpet">Disinfect the Items On the Carpet</h2>
<p>Gather all the cushions, pet bedding, and other fabrics that are lying on or near the carpet -
with or without a host
. Wash thoroughly and dry them off at the highest setting. The fleas that are hidden in the items will get killed from the heat of the washer and dryer.</p>
<p>In case you cant wash an item, properly vacuum it. Dont forget to vacuum the underside of the furniture.�Remove the cushions from the upholstered furniture, wash and dry the covers at the highest setting and vacuum all of it.</p>
<p>Put in some extra effort and steam clean it  the heat helps to kill the fleas as at any stage of their life as they cant endure temperatures over 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The dormant flea pupae also wake up because of the heat, making it easier to kill them.</p>
<p>Do this and you can get flea free carpets- Almost 95% of the flea infestation resides in the carpets; hence disinfecting the carpet when theyre in their developing stage is necessary to permanently get rid of them.</p>

<h2 id="disinfecting-the-carpet">Disinfecting the Carpet</h2>
<h3 id="method-1-vacuuming">Method 1: Vacuuming</h3>
<p>Your vacuum cleaner is the most important tool when it comes to getting rid of fleas in carpet. Its not only the simplest but also the best method to disinfect the carpet of fleas.</p>
<p>The vacuum is powerful enough to suck up adult fleas, their eggs, larvae and most of the pupae as well. Vacuuming not only eliminates the adult fleas but fleas from all stages of their life.</p>
<p>It also sucks up the disgusting pre-digested blood feces that appear like coarse ground black pepper.</p>
<p>Moreover, the vibrations the vacuum cleaner creates can cause flea pupae to come out of their cocoon, making it easy for the vacuum cleaner to suck them up.</p>
<p>Cocoons are hard to kill or eliminate as theyre insecticide resistant and usually attached to the base of the carpet fibers. Bringing them out is the most effective method when dealing with them.�When vacuuming, make sure you cover every inch of the carpet in the room.</p>
<p>Spend some more time and effort on the corners, or dark, humid parts of the room and areas where your pet spends time. Make sure you empty out the vacuum bags outside of your home, to prevent them from sneaking back. Do this each day for at least 2 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="method-2-steaming">Method 2: Steaming</h3>
<p>Like we mentioned before, fleas cannot bear temperatures above 95 degrees. Steam can kill the fleas hiding in the carpet or at least cause dormant flea pupae to leave their cocoons, making them vulnerable and an easy kill.</p>
<p>If youve got little ones around and are looking for non-toxic cleaning methods, steaming can eliminate fleas and sanitize the carpet in a natural way.</p>
<p>You can get buy or rent a home steam cleaner or hire a professional cleaning service. The steamer creates strong hot steam that can be used over unholstered furniture and carpets. Continue vacuuming to capture the new born fleas that emerge after the steam cleaning.</p>
<h3 id="method-3-use-different-flea-killers">Method 3: Use Different Flea Killers</h3>
<p>You have plenty of options to choose from which you can use to eliminate fleas in carpet. Your choice depends on whether you want to opt for a natural or chemical method.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Also, on how extreme the infestation is or the sensitivity of your pets.�These are some of the options you have at hand,</dt>
<dt><strong>1. Baking soda and salt</strong></dt>
<dd>Its a natural and safe way to deal with light to medium infestations. Sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda and salt on the carpet and leave it for 24 hours. Check on the situation to see if most of the fleas are killed, after which you can vacuum them up. If you dont see a lot of progress, let it stay for about a week.
<strong>2. Diatomaceous earth</strong></dd>
<dd>Other than severe infestation, this method will work in all the situations. Get hold of food-grade diatomaceous as it is natural and safe.</dd>
<dt>Scatter a thin layer of it over the carpet, with high concentration in your pets favorite hangout spots and beneath furniture. Let is rest for a good 4 to 5 day period and then vacuum it all up.</dt>
<dt><strong>3. Natural flea spray</strong></dt>
<dt>:The spray is also a safe and natural way to deal with light to medium infestations. Spray the flea treatment on your carpet and let it do its work. Vacuum it once the spray has dried off.</dt>
<dt><strong>4. Insecticides</strong></dt>
<dd>These are packed with chemicals and come in different levels of toxicity. Insecticides work best when youre dealing with severe infestations. Adulticides are specially made to kill adult fleas but wont work for others.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you want to wipe out the infestation, you must kill fleas from all stages of life. So, get an insecticide that has both adulticide and insect growth regulators in it. A combination of these will kill the adult fleas and the larvae as well.</p>
<p>Although boric acid works well against fleas in carpets, it can be toxic for your pets and cause discoloration, so its best to not consider it as an option.
**5. Lemon Spray: **
You can use lemon as a natural home remedy against fleas.�In order to eliminate fleas from your home, you need to make a citrus spray which can be sprayed over the infested furniture and carpet.</p>
<p>Just add thin slices of a lemon to a small quantity of water and bring it to boil.</p>
<p>Allow the citrus solution to rest overnight and place it in a spray bottle. Spray this solution all over the infested areas in your house. Make sure that you only dampen the carpet and not soak it with the solution. Vacuum up the residue after a few days.
<strong>6. Fogging:</strong>
This technique is the most effective way to get rid of fleas quickly. The fog manages to reach even the tiniest of cracks and crevices, wiping out the infestation completely.</p>
<p>Professional pest controllers use this method in case of severe infestations. It needs to be carried out more than once. The downside of this method is that the fog is extremely poisonous, and you will have to vacate the house for a few hours along with your family and pets.</p>
<p>Ensure that food items and utensils are kept covered. Close all the windows and doors and put off the smoke alarms momentarily. Once the process is over, open the windows and door and let it ventilate for a couple of hours before you step in. Along with fleas youll find other dead pests as well.</p>
<h2 id="surveying-the-situation">Surveying the Situation</h2>
<p>Carrying out any of these methods can help you to successfully eliminate fleas in carpet. Leave out flea traps on the carpet so you can keep check on the situation.</p>
<p>Itll help you measure the rate at which the flea infestation is getting destroyed as youll be able to see the number of victims the traps have collected every day.</p>
<p>Its quite simple, as you only have to place them on the carpet and keep a regular check and obviously replace them.�Make your own flea trap by mixing dish soap with water in a bowl.</p>

<p>You need to continue spraying the carpet with a natural flea repellent, in places such as beneath the furniture, areas where your pets love to stay, and dark and damp places.</p>
<p>Make sure you not only disinfect the carpet, but the yards, and your pets as well.</p>
<p>Another easy way is to keep specific plants at home which repel these biting pests. There are a few plants that contain certain chemicals, oils and compounds that fleas seem to hate and would not like to come close to.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step---how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-the-house-fast">Step by Step - How to Get Rid Of Fleas in the House Fast</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-use-flea-traps">Step 1: Use <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-flea-eggs-on-cats/">Flea</a> traps</h3>
<p>Flea traps offer an easy method to remove fleas from your home. They contain a chemical that attracts insects, which then die on their sticky surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common type of trap is &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; as it has glue on one side or both sides for catching the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be used easily anywhere at all-around your home - under furniture, behind appliances like washing machines and dishwashers, along baseboards, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Place these near where you find them to have the highest concentration (like carpets).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may also place them next to animal habitats such as couches, pet beds/crates if they&rsquo;re present in your home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a DIY flea trap, you&rsquo;ll require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Night lights</li>
<li>Dinner plates or Bowls</li>
<li>Dishwashing liquid</li>
<li>Warm water
To make a DIY flea trap, fill bowls with warm water mixed with dishwashing liquid and place a candle at the center of the bowl.</li>
</ul>
<p>Position the dinner plate or bowl on some wood and turn on the Night Light. Fleas will jump towards the night light and be stuck in the liquid soap. So, dispose of those traps which have done their work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYKOkaZN9cU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYKOkaZN9cU</a></p>
<p>Flea traps are essentially heat scares with a light bulb turned on, so that the fleas can be attracted to them.</p>
<p>This DIY flea trap takes less than a minute to make and is perfect for minor infestations. All thats needed are dish detergent, water, and an LED lightbulb (non-heat emitting).</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the basic or bowl&rsquo;s edge is shallow to allow easy jumping for the fleas.</li>
<li>Also, position the flea trap near the floor to allow easy access by the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-use-flea-sprays">Step 2: Use Flea Sprays</h3>
<p>You can
apply flea sprays for homes
such as the Vets-Best Spray on pet&rsquo;s bedding - pillows, blankets, couches, rugs, and carpets to exterminate fleas &amp; flea eggs on contact.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, avoid spraying on sensitive pet areas such as around their face - use abrush or flea comb instead.
What many people don&rsquo;t know is that most flea sprays are also topically applied to any areas of concern such as furniture where they might reside during non-active hours.</li>
<li>Fleas become active at certain times of the day so spraying outdoors and inside while there&rsquo;s activity should do the trick for now!
You may not need to use many different products, but it will depend on how severe your infestation is!</li>
<li>If unsure of any product&rsquo;s toxicity or if there are children or pets in the home, please contact a vet before using.
Flea treatment is tricky for pets. All the eggs, which will hatch soon after they are laid, need to be killed at the same time as the adult fleas.</li>
<li>So, use a flea spray + flea tablets to ensure that any future infestation is dealt with immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-use-flea-tablets">Step 3: Use Flea Tablets</h3>
<p>Flea tablets�such as the
Novartis Capstar are fed on cats
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-dogs/">dogs</a>
to remove fleas with fast results - exterminating the bugs in about 30 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea tablets are used in combination with a good flea shampoo.
The flea tablet helps to kill the eggs and larvae of the insect on contact, while the shampoo helps remove live fleas that may be stuck on your pets skin or fur.</li>
<li>The best way to tell if an animal has been bitten by a tick is through its behavior �- such as lethargy, having decreased appetite, not grooming properly (or dong it excessively), etc.
Flea tablets work well for dogs especially because they can get very dirty at times and hard to wash off effectively enough without some assistance from medication like this!</li>
<li>But flea tablets won&rsquo;t exterminate flea eggs, pupae, and larvae - plus they&rsquo;ll only be effective for 24 hours and thus require re-treatment after this time.
Flea tablets will work best when your pet is visiting areas with a high risk of fleas like pet parks, pet hotels, grooming salons, or vet clinics. But it would help to combine flea tablets + flea sprays.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-flea-foggers">Step 4: Flea Foggers</h3>
<p>In contrast to sprays and powders, which can reach only a small area at one time, fogging (e.g. with Hot Shot No-Mess) kills any visible insects in the room or house where it is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>IGR fogging also has the benefit of killing off any eggs before they ever hatch.
For safety, you&rsquo;ll require to cover up dishes, utensils, and food plus seal off the doors and windows for an average of 2 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long does it take a fogger to kill fleas? Foggers are not the quickest method of killing fleas, but they do not take long.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fogger pesticide must absorb into the body before it can take effect enough to cause death.
NB: Flea-treat the pet before taking it back to the house treated with flea foggers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-vacuuming-for-fleas">Step 5: Vacuuming for Fleas</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too uncomfortable with fogging your house,
vacuuming can work
to a certain degree as well.</p>
<p>When we say vacuum, what we mean is a hard floor cleaner with one of those disposable bags (never use a bagless vacuum).</p>
<p>Vacuum all areas where bugs might hide: under furniture, rugs, bedding/curtains, etc., but remember never put anything down the tube; only suck up debris or dust on top of surfaces with no gaps underneath.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, discard the contents of a crevice tool and clean any nooks you can find.
If you have a vacuum with strong enough suction and covering as much space as required, the eggs will be sucked up. Use it on floorboard (crevices or cracks), beds, furniture, and curtains.
**NB: **
*1) Feed your pet (cat or dog) a flea tablet. 2) Vacuum the house to find and kill fleas and dog hair before you start spraying. *</li>
<li>The flea tablet will remove the adult fleas while the flea spray will exterminate the flea eggs.
The vacuum bag needs to be kept outside the house and detached carefully until it can be discarded in a sealed bag, an incinerator, or by other means.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-6-hire-flea-exterminators">Step 6: Hire Flea Exterminators</h3>
<p>A flea exterminator will come to your home and spray, fog, or steam the entire house.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas are small enough that they can easily move through cracks in floors, walls, and furniture.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why many people do not realize they have flea infestations until it starts causing problems like allergic reactions on a child&rsquo;s skin or intense scratching from an animal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some signs of a flea problem include live fleas found near sleeping areas; larvae (immature stages) frequently seen around pet bedding such as dog beds, cat litter boxes, bird cages; fecal pellets - tiny black spots near floor baseboards under furniture where pets sleep or rest their heads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exterminator will use a vacuum to remove any adult fleas from your carpets and furniture. They will also fog, or steam the entire house including inside walls with insecticide.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When they are finished, you should notice that there is little evidence of flea activity in your home. This means less itching for everyone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flea infestations can be controlled by using preventative measures such as monthly spot treatments on pets and vacuuming daily to keep them out of our homes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-prevent-fleas-in-your-home">How to Prevent Fleas in your Home</h2>
<p>Preventing fleas is one of the most important ways to take better care of your family and pets. To help you avoid an infestation altogether, read my helpful tips below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean and groom the cats and dogs properly: Ensure that the pets skin and coat are clean and dry before treatment with a product, which helps to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction.</li>
<li>Apply monthly treatments on pets: Spot treatments should be applied from neck to tail at least monthly. This will help prevent fleas from jumping onto your dog or cat when they come in contact with other flea-infested animals or people.</li>
<li>Vacuum daily and wash bedding weekly: Flea eggs hatch within two weeks sovacuuming around the homeis essential for removing any potential breeding ground! Be sure to also vacuum furniture such as couches if possible. It&rsquo;s also important to wash bed sheets weekly in hot water - this kills off any larvae and their eggs.</li>
<li>Yard: Fleas will likely appear on the pet and in your home but they can also live outside year-round if there are no flea treatments applied to this space. Keep grass mowed short, remove any clutter or potential sources of food for the insects such as fallen leaves, pine needles, or other debris that may accumulate near yards where pets spend time outdoors.</li>
<li>Flea collar: These collars work by releasing a chemical called cyphenothrin into an animal&rsquo;s skin when it is worn around its neck. This kills off adult fleas that jump onto them so they don&rsquo;t have access to biting the dog - perfect for houses with outdoor dogs!</li>
<li>Outdoor Insecticides: If you&rsquo;re having trouble with your pet, wash your sheets at least twice a week.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion on how to get rid of fleas in the house fast, there are a number of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, you can use vacuum cleaners to suck up fleas and their eggs from carpets or other areas in your house where they might be nesting.</li>
<li>You can spray surfaces with natural flea repellents, like lavender or rosemary. You could also use a steam cleaner to clean up your house quickly and efficiently, without using chemicals that might be harmful to you or the environment.</li>
<li>Flea-treat the pets in your house and make sure to vacuum or steam clean often.</li>
<li>Finally, in some cases, it may not be practical to get rid of all the fleas at home yourself because of how many there are - so consult professionals who know how best to kill them in order to help make sure they don&rsquo;t come back!
The best way is probably to try out various methods until you find one that works for your household because everyone has different living habits which contribute to how easy or difficult it will be to get rid of these pests.</li>

<h2 id="step-by-step---how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-the-house-forever">Step-by-Step - How to Get Rid Of Fleas in the House Forever</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-flea-treat-the-dog">Step 1: Flea-Treat the Dog</h3>
<p>Fleas are tiny, wingless insects that live in the fur of animals like dogs and cats. One of the best ways to rid your dog of fleas is with flea shampoo.</p>
<ul>
<li>After a bath, take the time to work down his or her legs and under their armpits at which point you will have rinsed away any fleas that are left behind.
Rinse the pet to flash down the fleas into the drain - maybe it&rsquo;ll require another washing - also check these
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//">drain cleaners</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>For your dogs safety, it is necessary for you to either apply Advantage or Frontline flea prevention between the pet&rsquo;s shoulder blades.</p>
<p>You may need to reapply for this monthly product for three months, in order to keep fleas under control in the house and yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common way to treat a dog with flea-infested is by using topical treatments such as fipronil, permethrin, or selamectin
After applying the treatment, it will take around 24 hours for all of the fleas on your pet&rsquo;s body to die. However, this does not mean they&rsquo;re gone forever!</li>
<li>The fleas may return after some time has passed if you don&rsquo;t maintain regular housecleaning routines which include vacuuming carpets regularly and washing bedding weekly.
Remove and flea-treat all bedding from your dog&rsquo;s crate or kennel as well as furniture items that have come into contact with them (couches, chairs).</li>
<li>This includes blankets of any kind including pillows and stuffed animals.
Anything left may carry live eggs which could hatch before being noticed later when new laundry comes out to air dry.
Vacuum carpets thoroughly
at least twice using a vacuum cleaner with a beater bar attachment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sprinkle borax every two feet on the carpet and let it sit for 12-24 hours to kill any remaining flea eggs that may have been missed in your first vacuuming session.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum up all of the borax after 24 hours have passed, or when you leave the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-flea-treat-the-yard">Step 2: Flea-treat the Yard</h3>
<p>If you have a yard, the environment your Flea-Treat the Dog lives in can be an infestation point. The best thing to do is get out there and Flea-treat it!</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re going to need some water, a hose or garden sprayer, dish soap (optional), cayenne pepper, and baking soda. More importantly than anything else - patience.
Flea-treat the yard. Experts recommend using flea and flea-eggs to control pesticides to treat your lawn and common areas. Spray where the dog walks, and at any other places, it frequents outside.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a yard free of harmful fleas, homeowners have many other treatment options.</p>
<p>Wondercide will kill fleas and other household pests (ants, spiders, and cockroaches) in your yard, but you need to apply it more than once every few months.</p>
<p>Wondercide is a safe and effective insect repellent that can be applied as needed. It has numerous uses, such as for flea-treating the yard, or preventing pests at home.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-flea-treat-the-house">Step 3: Flea-treat the House</h3>
<p>First, you ask, how do I get rid of fleas in my house fast?</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure your home is clean and vacuum all carpets, pet hair, and upholstery.</li>
<li>Treat fleas with a preventative product or liquid insecticide. Be sure the treated areas are not over-saturated so as to avoid the risk of fire hazards.</li>
<li>Remove reservoir hosts from your yard (grasses, leaves) which serve as food sources for flea larvae - and the wholeflea life stages.
If you want a long-term solution to killing fleas, then its best to use pesticides inside your home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum your house thoroughly before going on to the next step - vacuum all crevices and corners.</p>
<p>Once you have vacuumed the carpet, be sure to throw out your vacuum bag.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pets must be removed from the premises for at least 2 - 3 hours before and during house and yard treatment.
Steam clean the pet beds, upholstery, and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/getting-rid-of-fleas-in-the-carpet/">carpets.</a>
Do the laundry. Wash all bedding in hot water and dry on high heat for at least 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Vacuum or sweep floors, including under furniture. Throw out any vacuum bag contents as fleas could survive in them for up to a year if they get stuck inside it
Clean your pet&rsquo;s bowls, litter box, food dishes with soapy dish detergent and rinse well- then scrub clean with a bleach solution of one tablespoon bleach per quart of warm water (or use commercial products designed to kill flea larvae).</li>
<li>Immediately throw away stuffed animals that cannot be washed because their stuffing can harbor flea eggs and pupae alive; seal cracks where pets might have been living or hiding indoors such as along baseboards; Launder infrequently used bedding and other household fabrics in hot water.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-use-flea-igrs-and-flea-bombs">Step 4: Use Flea IGRs and Flea Bombs</h3>
<p>Spray the flea pesticide in the house. Once youve applied the pesticide, it&rsquo;s time to deploy one or more flea bombs in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective pest control for every room of the house and garage is a must. You can place them on newspapers or rolls of paper towels to make cleanup easy after their detonation!
How to use Flea bombs:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the flea bomb in a safe space where pets and children are not likely to get into it, such as on top of a dresser or under furniture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep people and animals out of the room for 4 hours after setting off the flea bomb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pets can re-enter 4 hours later but should be monitored closely during this time period because they may have been exposed to harmful chemicals from the fog created by using a flea bomb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply liquidflea killers with IGRson crevices, cracks, and carpet - this will hinder flea larvae development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, you can sprayflea-killing powderssuch as Fleabusters that&rsquo;ll fully cut down the flea life cycle in 4 - 6 weeks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave windows open so that air is able to circulate without any obstruction throughout your home afterward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an air purifier if possible; this will help remove any lingering chemical residue left behind by the bombs which could cause respiratory issues with dogs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To rid your house of fleas, you will need to vacuum the floors and shampoo the carpets. Repeating these tasks monthly for 3 months is necessary in order to fully eradicate the pests from your home.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-diatomaceous-earth-and-borax-for-fleas">Step 5: Diatomaceous earth and borax for fleas</h3>
<p>No one likes fleas. They are annoying and spread diseases from person to pet, animal to animal, sometimes even across the country but diatomaceous earth and borax can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Especially in hot climates like Florida, where I live with my family during the summers, we&rsquo;re constantly combating them as they seem to come out of nowhere when you least expect it.
Diatomaceous earth is a natural product made up of fossilized remains of diatoms - microscopic algae-like organisms found on our planet since prehistoric times (it&rsquo;s also known as DAP).</li>
<li>It can be purchased at feed stores or online for use against pests such as bedbugs and most types of roaches. One application will kill all bugs present on contact alone; no need for any other pesticide or chemical.
Borax is also a natural mineral, mined from the earth in compounds that make it safe for use around pets and children.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s commonly used as an insecticide because roaches are especially susceptible to its toxic properties - meaning one application typically takes care of all types of pest bugs at once without any need for follow-up applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>The big takeaway: Diatomaceous earth and borax can be combined together to combat fleas with ease!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems that you were looking for how to get rid of fleas in the house forever! Well, there are many ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea-treating the pets is another technique to make sure that little fleas don&rsquo;t come into the house.</li>
<li>Flea-treat the lawn or yard with insecticide to kill the fleas and their larvae.</li>
<li>You can also sprinkle the borax powder into carpets, cracks, upholstery, or other areas where it&rsquo;s possible that eggs may be laid.</li>
<li>Another great idea is to vacuum all carpeting at least once per week because vacuuming removes most adult fleas from carpets as well as their larvae which hatch out of the pupae.</li>
<li>You can also use sprays or foggers that will go into every nook and cranny of your home, killing adult fleas as well as larva in a matter of hours.
If these steps are not enough, call a professional! They will know how to get rid of fleas in the house forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, I hope you found what you are looking for and happy cleaning! Remember: borax powder, vacuum, and sprays or foggers will get rid of fleas in the house.</p>

may live on
clothing
(dirty areas) for ~ 24 hours. But the critters cause <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-flea-eggs-on-cats/">flea</a> bites, which many people are allergic to, and cause
skin infections or blisters (pus-filled).

<h3 id="1-dawn-dish-soap-for-killing-fleas">1. Dawn Dish Soap for Killing fleas</h3>
<p>Do fleas die in water? Generally, flea eggs and adult fleas won&rsquo;t kill fleas - just like most insects eggs will survive underwater for days.�Just taking your pet for some swim won&rsquo;t kill fleas effectively.
But cleaning the pet
using dawn dish soap
mixture - the soap helps break the water&rsquo;s surface tension - enabling the tiny fleas to sink and drown. Place a lamp near the water to attract fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dawn will kill the bugs within five minutes - and thus you&rsquo;ll be ready to rinse the clothes and bedding. For your pet, you may use a handheld showerhead or a cup of water to rinse the dawn soap.
Further, if you thoroughly wet and lather the pet&rsquo;s fur with dawn soap
andflea comb
, you&rsquo;ll drown most of the files eggs. The soap mixture will destroy the bug&rsquo;s
exoskeletons leading to drowning.
<strong>Wash all clothes &amp; bedding for 10 minutes ( in cold water):�</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undertake routine washing and dry clothes and bedding. If there are clothes that can&rsquo;t be washed but can be dried, then you&rsquo;ll need to put them in the dryer and run it on a hot cycle for about 30 minutes - which willkill the fleastoo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flea eggs and adultswill not die easilywhen immersed in water. Fleaswill survive in waterfor about seven days. Further, fleas will only drown in water after 24 hours when submerged as they sit on the water and not break water&rsquo;s surface tension. Fleas have cuticles that are covered with wax, and hence its skin is non-wettable with water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>However</strong>: Dish soap drops have surfactants that reduce water&rsquo;s surface tension and hence make the flea sink in water and drown. Therefore, washing the fabric with your detergent for ~ 10 minutes would make adult fleas drown<strong>but not the pre-adult fleas</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flea eggs + larvae in your bedding and clothes will require the use of more rigorous laundry methods: This drives us to tactic #2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemDY5em-Cg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemDY5em-Cg</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2max-washing-machine-settings-soap">2.�Max Washing Machine Settings**+ Soap�**</h3>
<p>Using a washing machine with water + soap will help remove fleas from your bedding and clothes. The water turbulence and heat plus that laundry detergent helps in exterminating the fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fleas in all the life stages are either exterminated during the washing process, or they&rsquo;ll eventually end up in your drainage and sewer.
Also, any of the fleas or other insects that&rsquo;ll remain in the initial stages of the washing will be killed by the machine&rsquo;s or water turbulence and the heat.
All you have to do is wash the clothing.�The challenge is getting the right ingredients/ temperature and transporting the clothing and bedding to the laundry area (without dropping some fleas), either in your home or elsewhere.
<strong>Wash Clothing and bedding in Hot Water:�</strong></li>
<li>Depending on the type of fabric: Cotton, Silk, Wool, etc&hellip;�Wash the clothes in a washing machine or just hot water in a basin.</li>
<li>However, including a detergent (the mild-type) to the hot water. Check thesevacuums for fleas.</li>
<li>Adult fleas are exterminated at temperatures surpassing 35 C (95F) and when it is under 13C (55.4F). Also,Flea larvaewill die in their cocoon at a temperature of over 35 C.</li>
<li>The mechanical action and the hot water in the washing machine would definitely dislodge the fleas from the clothes and beddings and send them down the drain. The flea adults, eggs, larvae, and pupae would not survive through the laundering &amp; drying process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-clean-with-bleach-water">3. Clean with Bleach Water</h3>
<p>You can efficiently end the flea cycle on your bedding and clothes using bleach - you&rsquo;ll exterminate both fleas and also adult fleas. Fleas jump off the get to the dark, moist, and warm places.
You&rsquo;ll find fleas hiding in the house where pets sleep and live. So, you&rsquo;ll also need to bleach-clean the pet carrier and crates, floors, couches, and bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the bleach and clean your nonporous surfaces like floors and crates or carriers - water plus bleach - put this in your spray bottle or also use some cleaning rag or paper towel.
Wipe the surfaces upon applying the bleach water - you may through the fabrics into your washer with bleach - as opposed to just using the regular detergent.
Check the bleach bottle instructions to know the amount to use on your bedding and clothes - depending on the load. Also, use bleach that&rsquo;s color-safe to protect all colored fabrics.</li>
<li>For safety, ensure pets and humans (including kids) won&rsquo;t ingest the bleach as it&rsquo;s harmful.</li>
<li>Vets recommend keeping kids and pets away from bleach-treated surfaces, bedding, and clothes for a minimum of three hours.
But use bleach only on fabrics that can withstand it, but ensure it is well diluted. Mix water (16 gallons) and chlorine bleach (1 cup) - this will disinfect and kill fleas in clothes.</li>
<li>For bedding, fabrics, and clothes that won&rsquo;t be bleach-safe, use phenolic disinfectants, pine oil, or different antimicrobial detergents.</li>
<li>Remember to wash the fabrics and clothes at maximum temperature, wash cycle, and water setting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-quarantine--flea-treat-the-pets">4. Quarantine &amp; Flea Treat the Pets</h3>
<p>Most fleas (~
<em>90% of fleas</em>
) fleas (whole life cycle) in shady areas, carpet, clothing, and fabric, furniture, plus pet fur.
So, practice persistence and vigilance but use a
flea fogger
if you have a massive flea infestation. So, ensure to groom and examine the cats and dogs for fleas.</p>

ticks
following every walk you make. For ticks, check the pet&rsquo;s ears, neck, and paws and undertake flea-treatment when you&rsquo;re traveling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-flea-clean-the-yard">5. Flea-Clean the Yard</h3>

After doing the landscaping, undertake processes that&rsquo;ll dissuade wildlife and feral pets from getting into the yard - as this may allow them to drop fleas.
While at it, control the entry of feral cats, raccoons, and
Chipmunks
, Opossums. Also, don&rsquo;t leave feeding bowls used by cats and dogs in the yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim the high shrubs and trees that may allow the wild animals to crawl into the attic. Also, seal the under decks, sheds, garages, and crawl spaces - try<a href="https://pets.webmd.com/flea-tick-control-15/default.htm">flea and tick killers</a>.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When fleas jump onto your bed they&rsquo;ll make your sleep comfortable and queen inflict flea bites that are painful.</p>
<p>So, you ask, how to keep fleas off me while I sleep? In brief, cover your skin with long-sleeve and clothing (pants and socks), and treat the gear and clothing with 0.5% permethrin-containing flea control products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other precautions you may take includevacuuming the carpetsand upholstered furniture, laundering the bedding and clothing
Lets dig in!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-how-to-keep-fleas-off-me-while-i-sleep">Details: How to Keep Fleas off Me While I Sleep</h2>
<p>It can be challenging to control the biting tendencies of fleas and they&rsquo;re spread in the house especially when they get onto bedding or bed.</p>
<h3 id="1-wear-long-pants-and-sock">1. Wear Long Pants and Sock</h3>
<p>Wearing long socks and pants (long trousers), and putting on closed shoes will protect you from flea bites since this pest
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-bite-through-clothes/">won&rsquo;t bite through most fabrics &amp; clothing</a></p>
<ul>
<li>the please will be kept off your feet, lower legs, and skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t bite through thin fabrics socks jeans and various clothing.</p>
<p>However, the pets can bite through snug-fitting and thin clothing like yoga pants pantyhose, and tights.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the fleas can&rsquo;t get to your skin directly, they will move under the clothes to start their biting spree.
The bugs love to bite and suck blood from the covered areas of your skin since they will go unnoticed for long.</li>
<li>When disturbed in their blood-sucking mission, fleas will move under the seams of your clothing and hide there for up to 1 day but will come out to feed periodically.
What place are only able to jump about 7 inches to 8 inches which will be around your knee.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, once they land on you there b and feed without wondering or excessive movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore flea bites will largely be found on the lower legs, calves, ankles, and feet
But fleas can occasionally be found on the upper body of humans such as the pubic area, waist, and upper legs especially if the person was sitting on the ground.</li>
<li>Fleas may also bite any exposed skin area on the wrist but it&rsquo;s unlikely that way they will bite the human scalp or face.
The best clothes that will help you stop flea bites ingrown closed-toe shoes, long pants, and socks.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQHF4eZfmYc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQHF4eZfmYc</a></p>
<h3 id="2-spraying-a-flea-repellent-for-humans">2. Spraying a Flea Repellent for Humans</h3>
<p>Next, you can stop flies from landing on your clothes by spraying some suitable flea repellent such as 0.5% permethrin.</p>
<p>Permethrin will repel a broad range of insects especially when in low concentrations.</p>
<p>The chemical insecticide will be ironed into the fibers of your clothing and thus it will be easy to wash or wet.</p>
<ul>
<li>After flea-treating the fabric or clothes using 0.5% permethrin, they will actively repel the bugs (pests and insects) for 6 launderings or about 6 weeks
Further, when sleeping or strolling in outdoor spaces, you can repair the fleas by using some spray that has DEET as the active ingredient.</li>
</ul>
<p>The flea repellent for humans that I recommend from Amazon include sprays, bracelets, SALLYEANDER No-Bite-Me.</p>
<ul>
<li>The natural repellent for flies that you can use includes essential oils that you may apply on your skin - I recommend myrtle oil and thyme oil since they give better results than DEET and permethrin
The 3M Ultrathon flea repellent will repel insects including fleas for about 12 hours and has to be excellent for your long sleeping hours.</li>
<li>The product has a low DEET level compared to other flea repelling products in the market</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s designed for tropics and jungles to repel pests including creepy crawlies and thus itll easily prevent insect bites in the house and on your bed while youre sleeping.</li>
<li>Also, its usage will be economical since just a little of the 3M Ultrathon will go for a while for you to repel the fleas for more sleep nights.
The Avon Skin-So-Soft is another lotion that&rsquo;s suitable for repelling fleas from humans. The company has included Picaridin ingredients in the flea repellent to improve its insect repelling ability.</li>
<li>The Picaridin ingredient will be safer than DEET, it lasts longer and has low odor levels. Also, it won&rsquo;t irritate the human eyes or skin and doesn&rsquo;t feel sticky when applied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-wash-or-launder-clothes-and-bedding-for-fleas">3. Wash or Launder Clothes and Bedding for Fleas</h3>
<p>I recommend you launder the clothes and bedding in the washing machine at hot temperatures to kill fleas.</p>
<p>A temperature setting of about 140 degrees Fahrenheit in the washing machine will help kill the flea eggs and the adult fleas.</p>
<p>However, you must keep the fabrics and bedding inside the washing machine at that temperature for about 10 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, put the bedding and clothes in a dryer at high temperatures to complete the flea-killing mission.
Fleas may also take refuge in your shoes and thus you may carry them around wherever you go.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should spray some insecticide inside the shoes to kill even the fleas that will jump from your pets into the shoes well they are playing.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you suspect that there are fleas in the bed, you should wash the bedding using hot water and also don&rsquo;t forget to wash the mattress pads, pillows, blankets, and sheets.
Also, flea-treat the house because some flea eggs and adult fleas might be hiding in carpets or crevices &amp; cracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will the dryer sheets kill or repel fleas? Well, the dryer is an excellent tool to exterminate fleas. Its inner Chambers will have high temperatures that will kill fleas on fabrics, stuffed animals, clothes, and bedding.</p>

<h3 id="4-bathe-and-flea-treat-the-pet">4. Bathe and Flea-Treat the Pet</h3>
<p>If you regularly sleep with your pet such as a cat or dog on your bed it&rsquo;s important that you bathe and flea-treat the animals well.</p>
<p>Pets that have fleas on their bodies will significantly contribute to the occurrence of fleas on your bed - the bugs might eventually bite you.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fleas will hide in the pet&rsquo;s body, hair, or fur before jumping onto different surfaces in the house and beginning their colony after laying many eggs.
So bathe the pets using soapy and warm water and also

to remove those fleas that are entangled in the pet hair.</li>
</ul>
<p>The soapy water that is warm will drown the flea eggs and kill the adult fleas. So bathe the pets regularly to ensure that the bugs are exterminated in
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flea-life-cycle/">their initial growth stages</a>
.</p>
<p>But can I sleep on a bed that has fleas? Well yes, you can because please love warm environments and the bed is such an area.</p>
<p>Father the adult fleas will get comfortable after sucking blood, hide in the mattress, will lay eggs, and drop their body waste - which will be food for their larvae.</p>
<ul>

      <description>Let&amp;#39;s discuss what kills flea eggs in your yard or in</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss what kills flea eggs in your yard or in
indoor spaces
. Honestly, there aren&rsquo;t many things that&rsquo;ll kill flea eggs� - they&rsquo;re supper hardy.
<a href="/posts/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">Fleas</a> will jump off from the cats and dogs to lays their eggs on pet bedding or even house carpeting. Any unattended fleas eggs will hatch to a major <a href="/posts/what-kills-fleas-in-the-yard-naturally/">flea</a> infestation within a month.
<em>In summary, here&rsquo;s how to kill flea eggs; vacuuming carpets, rugs and floors will remove the flea eggs dropped by your cats or dogs.�Vacuuming will clean up flea larvae and their food (flea dirt). In addition, vacuuming makes the fleas to emerge from the insecticide-resistant cocoons - exposing them to treatment.��</em></p>
<h2 id="details-how-to-kill-flea-eggs">Details: How to Kill Flea Eggs?</h2>
<p>Flea eggs are translucent, oval-shaped objected that measure about 0.5 mm (0.02 inches). Females fleas lay average of 40 eggs daily in your yard or home - they&rsquo;ll
hatch within 2 weeks into larvae
.</p>
<h3 id="1-vacuum-carpets-rugs-and-floors"><strong>1. Vacuum Carpets, Rugs and Floors�</strong></h3>
<p>The surest way to control fleas eggs and adult fleas is vacuuming your rugs and carpeted areas - maintain a tidy and clean home. The
flea vacuum
machine will ruck all the flea eggs, cocoons, and larvae.
Flea eggs tend to hatch in 2 to 3 days after they&rsquo;re laid. Therefore, the vacuuming daily will allow extermination of the eggs and thus prevent�them from hatching a new flea generation.
Also, lifting your carpet nap during the vacuuming process ensures that the insecticides will penetrate deeper into the fibers of your carpets where eggs and larvae hide.
In addition, you must vacuum the couches and carpets using a water-based vacuum as it&rsquo;ll remove flea eggs plus
flea dirt
. Therefore, removing flea dirt will deny the flea larvae some of their food.
Thoroughly vacuum places that your cats and dogs sleep and rest. Further, vacuum the throw rugs, beds, cushions, under furniture, and room edges. Finally, seal and dispose your vacuum bag into the outdoor garbage can.</p>
<h3 id="2-spray-igr-prodcuts-like-frontline-plus-has-s-methoprene">2. Spray IGR Prodcuts like Frontline Plus (Has S Methoprene)</h3>
<p>Get a flea control product that has an
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/ptype/igr.html">Insect Growth Regulator (IGR)</a>
such as S Methoprene and pyriproxyfen that&rsquo;ll help kill the fleas eggs and flea larvae. Consult veterinarian first to ensure the product is safe for your pets, their bedding, and carpeting in the house.
Not many product will kill and prevent flea eggs. However, you&rsquo;ll succeed if you prevent the flea eggs from hatching. I recommend you use Frontline Plus as it contains and IGR - S Methoprene.
The S Methoprene will hinder the flea from eggs and equally prevent the fleas eggs from hatching. Therefore, this will definitely break down the flea life cycle.
Frontline Plus is an excellent flea control product because it&rsquo;ll exterminate both adult fleas (5 percent of flea population), larvae and flea eggs.
IGRs may be applied on your cats or dogs as food additives, tablets, or sprays - this may be monthly or any other approved regular cycle. For example, products with Lufenuron may be given like an injection, food additive, or pill.
Further, Sentinel has lufenuron that&rsquo;ll also prevent infestation and growth of heart-worms. These will highly helpful for your indoor pets.
However, with these IGR products, you&rsquo;ll need to wait for 4 to 6 weeks for notable decline in fleas. This is because IGRs will only kill flea larvae, flea eggs and not adults fleas.
PT Ultracide is another favorable product for controlling flea eggs. The aerosol will kill the fleas immediately - has a quick kill effect - which also deterring the formation of new larvae, flea eggs and adults. Luckily, it has a long (7 months) residue effect.</p>
<h3 id="3-launder-at-140f--dry-bedding-and-clothes">3. L*aunder (at 140F) &amp; Dry *Bedding and Clothes</h3>
<p>Dryer heat will kill the flea eggs and larvae plus adults in your clothes, curtains and bedding. Launder fabrics at 140F for ~ 10 minutes before drying them at the highest temperature setting in your dryer - consider the fabric material too.
Washing your bedding and clothes with hot water will help kill the fleas and their eggs. Further, an effective washing machine helps dislodge the flea eggs and thus exterminate a flea offspring. Ensure you add some soap in the washing soap.
Fleas won&rsquo;t survive the heat in your dryer. The bugs will die at
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7288833">temperatures that go over 35C (95F)</a>
. Further, flea larvae and fleas eggs die at temperatures over 38C (100.4F).
Despite that some of the flea eggs could still hatch at 35C, the temperature won&rsquo;t allow the larvae to mature. But about a third of the larvae population could still develop to spin their cocoons and molt - but all will die in their cocoon.</p>
<h3 id="4-boric-acid-insecticide-powder">4. Boric Acid Insecticide Powder</h3>
<p>Despite that spraying fleas, their larvae and eggs comes second to vacuuming in terms effectiveness, using insecticides powders can also work great in exterminating the flea eggs.
Flea powders are less toxic compared sprays but they won&rsquo;t cause an instant killing effect on the eggs. But the powders function well will carpets. The flea powders have boric acid that&rsquo;s deadly to fleas but safe to humans and pets.
Boric acid plus the included sodium salts will kill fleas and their eggs. They&rsquo;ll abrade the creature&rsquo;s exoskeletons or act like stomach poison to kill the fleas. Further, boric acid will also kill ants, termites, and roaches.</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase boric acid that&rsquo;s EPA-registered. Flea larvae that&rsquo;ll be scavenging for a meal around the carpet will feed on the boric acid.</li>
<li>Boric acid will penetrate the carpet fibers, upholstered furniture, crevices and cracks. However, avoid using boric acid powder in the outdoor spaces as it won&rsquo;t be effective against fleas when it gets wet.</li>
<li>Caution: Don&rsquo;t apply the boric acid directly on your cats, dogs or any other pets. Also, if possible, you can use<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-flea-collars-work/">flea collars against cats and dogs</a>.</li>
<li>Pay special attention, when applying the powder, to your pet&rsquo;s sleeping areas including under beds or chairs. But vacuum the concrete, tile or hardwood floors for best results against flea eggs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The� main control method for flea eggs definitely vacuuming, followed by using IGR sprays, laundering and drying, and finally boric acid powder.
However, be sure that flea eggs hatch within a very short time - about 2 weeks. So, be quick and precise in controlling the flea eggs.</p>

on your dogs fur.
But, I know you might have used flea control chemicals such as NexGard, Advantage, flea collars,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-%5Bfleas%5D(/posts/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/)/">flea bombs</a>
, Frontline,
dog flea shampoo
, etc.
Chemicals aside, today we discuss step by step process to control fleas on your dog naturally.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Fleas Killers on Dogs&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-4-quick-steps">How to Kill Fleas on Dogs Naturally (4 Quick Steps)</h2>
<h3 id="1-flea-combing">1. Flea combing</h3>
<p>To ease the scratching and itching caused by flea, flea combs will weed out fleas of all sizes from your dogs fur. A flea comb has finely spaced teeth/ tines to physically trap and eject the flea &ldquo;dirt,&rdquo; fleas, larvae, and flea eggs. Luckily, the
flea combing process leaves your dog
well-groomed, too, and happy.
Use the
flea comb
when your dogs fur is not tangled, thick, and extended to increase effectiveness and reduce pain. Remove the fur tangles by brushing using a regular
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OIOB90E/?tag=p-policy-20">pet comb or brush</a>
as it has widely-spaced tines.
Mix
dish soap
with hot water in a deep bucket (half full)  thus, fleas wont jump out quickly. While combing, youll use the liquid to rinse your
flea comb
and hold the fleas combed from the dog&rsquo;s fur.
Position white clothing or a newspaper under your bucket and dog. This will hold the
flea dirt
, fleas, and eggs thatll be dropping off.
Start the
flea combing process
with the dogs head, neck, and shoulders, and finally to the back and tail.
Comb gently and slowly in the direction where the dogs fur is growing. This will remove the dead hair, flea dirt, eggs, and adult fleas. Frequently push the flea comb to the soapy water as itll be filling with fur, fleas, and debris.
Next, comb the dogs belly, sides, chest, and back. The last portion will be to comb the tail, paws, and legs. Repeat the combing all over the dogs body to catch any flea that could have escaped.
Finally, after completing the flea combing process, allow the soapy water to remain in the bucket for about 15 minutes to drown the fleas. Ultimately, dispose of the clothing, newspaper, and bucket water that you used to flea comb. Also,
vacuum the whole room where you
were cleaning the dog.</p>
<h3 id="2-use-apple-cider-vinegar---bathing-and-drinking">2. Use Apple Cider vinegar - Bathing and Drinking</h3>
<dl>
<dt>First things first:</dt>
<dt>apple cider vinegar</dt>
<dt>(ACV) will not kill fleas but will create an unfriendly atmosphere (both taste and smell) that will repel the fleas from your dog. According to the FDA, apple cider vinegar has antibacterial and antioxidant features.</dt>
<dt>The</dt>
<dt>essential oil</dt>
<dt>from Alaskan yellow cedar causes lethal effects on the fleas. So much with the description; to</dt>
<dt>control fleas</dt>
<dt>for your dog using ACV, use sleeping mats (cedar-filled), cedar oil, and cedar spray or shampoo.</dt>
<dt><strong>Caution</strong></dt>
<dd>Do not pour the Apple cedar vinegar on your dogs skin as itll irritate the areas with broken skin. On the contract, use the ACV on the dogs spray, baths, and drinking water. However, contact your vet for direction on how ACV is appropriate for your dog, depending on its body weight.
For baths, pour the Apple cedar vinegar onto the dogs bathing water to prevent or treat any flea infestation.
For drinking, add a teaspoon of the apple cider vinegar (fermented) to a bowl of water (
<em>quarter-liter</em>
) and give the dog to drink. The treatment will make the dogs skin to become acidic and hence repel fleas and ticks.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="3-use-borax-powder">3. Use borax powder</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Borax, named Sodium Tetraborate or Disodium Tetraborate, is a direct natural mineral (looks like table salt) like a complex boron compound combined with sodium elements.</dt>
<dt>In its powdered form, borax is regularly employed in many cleaning agents. My readers tell me that theyve found borax, like me, to be less-smelly, less-toxic, and more</dt>
<dt>effective in flea control</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt>Borax will kill fleas</dt>
<dt>by incising the bugs exoskeleton and dehydrating their body hence killing them. Despite that, borax is great in killing flea larvae, too; it does not</dt>
<dt>eliminate flea eggs on cats and dogs</dt>
<dt>but�can be</dt>
<dt>mixed to create a spray for yard flea spray</dt>
<dt>.</dt>
<dt><strong>Caution</strong></dt>
<dd>Borax containing substances must not be used near pregnant women. Further,
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/boricgen.html">keep borax away from food substances</a>
and cats, leading to poisoning and breathing problems, respectively. Also, do not use borax on wet carpets, and it can discolor them and destroy their fiber.
Apply borax on an area that has humidity being more significant than 50 percent. Further, review the warning area of the borax wrapping.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Now, sprinkle the borax powder in the sections having
fleas such as the Kernel and even the carpet
.</li>
<li>Use a rigid broom or brush to brush the carpet. The process will help you get the borax to the areas that the
fleas are hiding, significantly below the rug
and the dark sections.</li>
<li>Wait for about 1-2 days or longer after sprinkling the borax powder. Finally, vacuum the treated areas to remove the borax, flea, and flea debris.
<strong>Note</strong>
: Dont use borax to treat your dog. However, check these articles on

<p>Well, not anymore!</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to show you how best to tell if your cat has fleas (these size-sized bugs) so that they can start feeling their fur again!</p>
<p>Cats can be prone to fleas, a common pest that if left untreated could inflict furry cats and
dogs
with severe problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats can get fleas from contact with other animals, picking them from the yard, or even by being in your home if you have an existing<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/cat-fleas"><strong>cat fleas</strong></a>population.</li>
<li>If left untreated, these pesky insects can cause discomfort and skin problems for your feline friend!
So, what are the signs&hellip;.again? Let&rsquo;s get started!
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Treatment for Cat Fleas&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatarethese-cat-fleas">What<em>Are</em>these Cat Fleas?</h2>
<p>Cat fleas, also known as Ctenocephalides felis - parasitic insects, are a type of insect that feeds on the blood of cats as their host.</p>
<p>Cat fleas rarely come off the cat without being taken care of as they can
die without a host
.</p>
<p>In order to reproduce, adult cat fleas need a large amount of blood from a host like a cat or a dog. Fleas have four different stages during
their life cycle-life-cycle/)
:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eggs,</li>
<li>Larva,</li>
<li>Pupa, and</li>
<li>Adult.
A cat flea can hatch about 2,000 eggs
<a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/fleas-source-torment-your-cat"><strong>in her lifetime</strong></a>
. - which rapidly increases their population.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-tell-a-flea-on-your-cat">How do I tell a Flea on your Cat?</h2>
<p>Fleas are reddish-brown bugs that mainly live on cats - which lets them hide as they move through the host&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>Cat fleas are
<a href="https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/occas/catflea.htm"><strong>tiny</strong></a>
and will measure roughly 1/8-inch - they cannot fly or jump and they have no wings.</p>
<p>Fleas live in places like hair, between toes, and in the fur around the neck. Unfortunately, without the use of a magnifying lens or a microscope, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to see these fleas on the cat.</p>
<ul>
<li>But cats with light-colored hair (or fur) will be easier to examine for fleas and flea bites.
Gently brush along the sides of your cat to show a specific location area of its skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fleas will first appear like specks caught in your pet&rsquo;s fur - or some
specks of flea dirt
.</p>
<p>The small black specks (
flea dirt
) on your cat can be indicative of fleas. Also, bite marks (Red spots) can also denote a flea infestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas are most active and will reproduce best at a temperature of 35C &amp; relative humidity of 70%.
Houses and pets in regions where the temperature falls below this for more than 40 hours every month won&rsquo;t have much flea activity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-how-to-tell-if-your-cat-has-fleas">Details: How To Tell If Your Cat Has Fleas?</h2>
<p>In order to produce eggs, fleas only need to take a single full-blood drink from their host - cat or dog.</p>
<p>Female fleas can lay as many as 30-50 eggs a day by the time they reach maturity.</p>
<p>Therefore, to control this massive reproduction, you must be vigilant about infestation symptoms.�Below is a video describing what you should look for if you suspect your cat has fleas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc15EPS6iUk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc15EPS6iUk</a></p>
<h3 id="sign-1---anemia-and-itchy-bites">Sign 1 - Anemia and Itchy Bites</h3>
<p>Fleas are highly irritating, and many pets have little tolerance when it comes to biting at their fur in order to relieve the itch.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your cat or dog is scratching itself excessively or licking its coat for a long time, it may have fleas on them.
If your cat has anemia, it may be because of flea infestation. The
<a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/34727/Vet_FHT_1990_Fall.pdf?sequence=1"><strong>anemia signs in your cat</strong></a>
include;</li>
<li>Loss of energy,</li>
<li>A low appetite</li>
<li>Consistent loss of hair on the body</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Pale gums
If these signs appear, call your vet right away because fleas can carry many life-threatening organisms, such as tapeworms and ear mites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-2---restless-behavior">Sign 2 - Restless Behavior</h3>
<p>If your feline friend is excessively scratching and biting on the skin, it could be a sign of flea bites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats shake their head from side to side in distress if they feel that fleas are on their fur and you may have also noticed the cat grooming itself excessively.
If you observe your cat acting restless most of the time, it might be because they have fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-3---bite-marks-ad-huge-hair-loss">Sign 3 - Bite Marks ad Huge Hair Loss</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re noticing hairless patches of skin where there should be fur - that&rsquo;s another sign that something&rsquo;s been chewing away at it like a hungry rodent!</p>
<p>You might also notice an itchy red rash beneath the pets tail as well as near the groin area. It could be hard to determine whether this affects other areas so just watch your furry friend closely during grooming sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Examine your cats ears for signs of dirt, blood, redness, or scratching. These can all be signs of fleas.
If your cat&rsquo;s skin is red and bumpy, particularly on the base of their tail, the groin, or belly, they may have fleas - especially with excessive scratching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some cat owners may notice hair loss on the hindquarters, in addition to black patches of skin and scabs.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The first thing to do is</dt>
<dt><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-comb-for-cats/">buy a flea comb</a></dt>
<dd>youll want a densely jointed comb with closely set teeth, which are designed to pick out even the small insects.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>One tactic that can help with spotting fleas in cats is to put a white towel or paper near the animal and comb through his fur.</li>
<li>Also, keep a bowl of soapy water handy as you comb your cat to douse any live fleas that might be picked up.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-4---excessive-grooming">Sign 4 - Excessive Grooming</h3>
<p>Cats are for the most part independent and can take care of themselves; they need to look stylish, and because it makes them feel good too.</p>
<p>The grooming process involves licking, scratching, and even biting - these are necessary and fulfilling. But fleas will bite the cat and cause agitation, which in turn leads to excessive grooming.</p>
<p>Also, if the cats keep moving around the house and are particularly aggressive with their humans or other animals in the home; preferring to be alone.</p>
<p>These small, dark-brown, jumping creatures are very common during the spring and summer seasons. These dirt bugs may be your cat&rsquo;s worst enemy!</p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms, it&rsquo;s best that you schedule a veterinary appointment for remedies, especially if your cat is scratching excessively.</p>
<ul>
<li>And remember - cats can carry flea eggs on their fur so keep an eye out as well! If left untreated; they could pass them onto other animals (or humans) in the home too.</li>
<li>Some solutions include topical ointments like Hartz Kitten Guard, Frontline Plus, Advantage Multi or Advant</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-5---flea-dirt-or-flea-droppings">Sign 5 - Flea Dirt or Flea Droppings</h3>
<p>Flea dirt, which is made up of digested blood from the animal&rsquo;s last meal, can be differentiated from fleas or dirt by sprinkling it with water while it is lying on the white paper towel.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the dirt turns<a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/hospital/animal-health-topics/dermatology-fact-sheets">reddish-brown or red when wet</a>, it could be because the flea has passed digested blood out and deposited it on the cat.
Flea dropping (flea dirt) are black grains of feces, sometimes with a brownish tint, you&rsquo;ll find in your
*bedroom or the *
pet&rsquo;s bedding.</li>
<li>Signs of flea dirt on the cat&rsquo;s fur can be visible with a black light. The small particles show up as white or yellowish-white spots against dark areas, such as near the tail and between the toes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-6---environmental-cues">Sign 6 - Environmental Cues</h3>
<p>Next, look in the places where he or she spends a lot of time such as beds, couches, and carpets. You&rsquo;re checking for black specks (flea dirt) and fleas too.</p>
<p>Check the areas where your cat likes to sleep, such as on top of the refrigerator, kitchen cabinets, and window sills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, you can wear white socks and now walk all over the house - especially places that your cat frequents.</li>
<li>Fleas and/or flea dirt will most likely be picked up (if present) on a white sock.
You can also use some &ldquo;light traps&rdquo; to detect fleas in the home. Use a dawn soap solution in a bow and a light nearby to
attract and drown the fleas
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion:</h2>
<p>If your cat is scratching more than usual but you&rsquo;ve treated them for fleas, it&rsquo;s time to chat with your vet.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found the fleas in your house, it&rsquo;s time to get rid of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many products available that will kill adult and larval stages, including insecticides (sprays or powders),<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">oral medications for cats</a>, sprays that work on carpets/upholstery only, and a fogger type spray.
Before using any of these treatments be sure to read instructions carefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be safe!</p>

<p>Well, the vet says it&rsquo;s if you notice your dog scratching, shaking their head, biting themselves, and then scratching some more.�But how do you know for sure?</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ll tackle this question: how to tell if your dog has fleas?</p>
<ul>
<li>**Dogs with fleas will usually have at least one of the following: excessive scratching or licking; black specks around the base of their tail, head, ears, or paws; an irritated red skin rash. **

<h2 id="what-are-dog-fleas-comparison-with-cats-fleas">What are Dog Fleas? Comparison with Cats Fleas?</h2>
<p>Dog fleas are ectoparasites - they inhabit and live outside their host&rsquo;s body on the fur. They&rsquo;re roughly 1/8 inch long, thin, reddish-brown.
<em>Are dog fleas visible to the human eye?</em>
It can be difficult to spot dog fleas on a dog&rsquo;s fur (they&rsquo;re 1/8 inch long) with the human eye. Though it may seem easier on light-colored fur, or if you use a microscope or magnifying glass.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogs frequently have parasites. One type, known as dog fleas, lives, feeds, and reproducing on the blood of its hosts.

.
*In summary: *
Cat fleas and dog fleas species are different and they mainly inhabit and live on cats and dogs respectively.</li>
<li>But without the use of laboratory equipment, it can be difficult to tell these two species apart.
Since Cat fleas suck blood from many mammals (
<a href="https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/HYG-2081-11"><strong>plus on dogs too</strong></a>
), they&rsquo;re a more prevalent species compared to dog fleas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do dog fleas bite humans? Generally no; but it can happen if your dog has a massive infestation or if you have a pet that is not house-trained to mainly keep to its dog bed.</p>
<p>If your dog has signs of being infested with parasites, there are medications available for the treatment of canine flea infections from veterinarians or online retailers like Amazon.</p>

<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve cleaned up the dog and
flea-treated the yard
, but they&rsquo;re still scratching - a sign that it still has fleas.</p>
<p>Well, dogs will pick up fleas in different ways. Your dog could have picked up fleas from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking on dirt or grass with an infested animal nearby.</li>
<li>Sharing a bed, carpet, or furniture that has flea eggs near the surface of it.</li>
<li>Licking and interacting with other dogs or<a href="https://schoolipm.ifas.ufl.edu/newtp5.htm">flea-infested animals</a>such as rodents, ferrets,squirrels,opossums, andraccoons.</li>
<li>Going to a flea-infested place such as the dog park or grooming salon.</li>
<li>Licking their paws from contact with flea-infested items in your home, like carpets, bedding, furniture fabric, carpeting,
Dogs might also be attacked by fleas outside the home, on the street, in the backyard, or even on the porch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the fleas can find their way onto your dog from your trip abroad - through lagguage, and if they are left untreated then pets will become infested with them in no time at all.</p>

How to Treat Fleas in the Yard</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-signs-that-my-dog-has-fleas">What Are The Signs That My Dog Has Fleas?</h2>
<p>Fleas are scary tiny bloodthirsty bugs that will literally drink more than their weight in blood. They&rsquo;ll be a life threat (after causing anemia) to your sickly/ old dogs and even puppies.</p>
<p>Fleas will leave tiny bites all over your dog&rsquo;s body that are hard to see and also cause restlessness and allergic reactions.</p>
<p>This is a list of the signs you should look out for to know that your dog has a flea infestation.</p>
<h3 id="sign-1---restlessness-in-the-dog">Sign 1 - Restlessness in the Dog</h3>
<p>The constant flea bites and possible allergic reactions from the parasite&rsquo;s saliva often cause dogs to appear irritated and restless.</p>
<p>If the dog is flea-infested, it will likely keep licking, biting, and scratching itself in order to relieve itself of the discomfort.</p>
<p>Signs that show the dog has been scratching itself to relieve skin irritation will typically have hair loss in patches, composed of bald spots with &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; underneath them, usually found at a dog&rsquo;s lower back end.</p>
<p>This type of infestation can make your pet start to smell bad as well because it won&rsquo;t be able to clean itself properly due to all those irritating bugs biting away.</p>
<ul>
<li>This means you should take precautions such asusing flea shampooor sprays to get rid of these bloodthirsty pests before they do any more damage!
A person might notice the dog chewing and scratching the body area in an effort to ease that discomfort from the fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-2---flea-dirt-and-flea-eggs">Sign 2 - Flea Dirt and Flea Eggs</h3>
<p>Inspect the dog&rsquo;s fur and skin - if you notice specks like black pepper (finely ground), then this is flea &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; (flea droppings) that denotes a flea infestation.</p>
<p>When you see tiny black dots on the dog or on your carpet, it&rsquo;s probably not pepper. It could be flea dirt or eggs.</p>
<p>Dog fleas lay eggs (20 - 50 eggs daily) and produce this waste while feeding. Flea eggs are white and oval-shaped.</p>
<ul>
<li>To confirm if it&rsquo;s flea dirt use some white paper towel to drop the dirt collected from<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-combs-for-dogs/">the dog&rsquo;s grooming</a></li>
<li>Next, sprinkle that dirt with some water and check its color change. If anything like red or reddish-brown emerges then the dirt is flea droppings or flea dirt.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-3---anemia---pale-gums">Sign 3 - Anemia - Pale Gums</h3>
<p>Fleas will suck massive amounts of blood from the canines (dogs) and this could lead to
<a href="https://muschealth.org/medical-services/ddc/patients/symptoms-and-conditions/anemia"><strong>anemia</strong></a>
in the puppies or the sickly dogs.</p>
<p>As fleas are heavy blook suckers, when they&rsquo;re in an area with more than just a couple of them, your dog&rsquo;s blood can get dangerously low.</p>
<p>The gums are usually pale in appearance and the dog will have a hard time breathing due to low levels of hemoglobin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiSRHPxDsOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiSRHPxDsOs</a></p>
<p>Anemia is when there are not enough red blood cells. The hemoglobin in blood is a protein molecule inside the red blood cells that moves oxygen to all parts of your body.</p>
<p>There are three causes of anemia</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood loss</li>
<li>Destruction of red blood cells also called hemolytic anemia</li>
<li>Insufficient production of red blood cells also called aplastic anemia
Dogs mainly get anemia from blood loss. The symptoms of anemia in your dog can include</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Elevated heart rate and Rapid breathing</li>
<li>Pale mucous membranes which is usually the gum color.</li>
<li>Sometimes the tongue can become pale pink to white</li>
<li>A loss of appetite</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-4---hair-loss-and-allergic-reactions">Sign 4 - Hair Loss and Allergic Reactions</h3>
<p>Dogs that are allergic to the flea&rsquo;s saliva may experience severe itching, hair loss, and red sores.</p>
<p>Allergic dermatitis caused by flea bites will mainly develop among older dogs or younger puppies.</p>
<p>The flea allergies are found on the dog&rsquo;s hindquarters - those may be skin rashes or hair loss patches found on the dog&rsquo;s tail or its back legs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The allergic reaction to flea saliva is hypersensitivity and can be seen in many dogs.
Signs that your dog has fleas include sores caused by scratching as well as excessive licking at these areas mentioned above.</li>
<li>Dogs who have been bitten by fleas may start itching excessively around their rear end while other symptoms for this condition are redness about the anus region and hair loss around the genital area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sign-5---tapeworms-in-the-dog-feces">Sign 5 - Tapeworms in the Dog Feces</h3>
<p>Tapeworms may appear in your dog&rsquo;s fecal matter as tiny white segments or rice-like pieces.</p>
<p>Dogs get the tapeworms after swallowing fleas that have tapeworm eggs in their feces.</p>
<p>The worst type is a &ldquo;dogal&rdquo; tapeworm that enters through an infected flea bite on its skin then travels to where it becomes embedded within muscle tissue next to his spinal column.</p>
<p>Fleas can carry tapeworms, which your dog may ingest as it scratches its itchy skin.</p>
<p>The tapeworms will grow in the dog&rsquo;s intestines, shedding tapeworm eggs into the dog&rsquo;s feces.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see little white droppings that look like rice then you can be certain that there is a problem with this type of parasite too.
Dog owners should also watch out for red bumps on the skin (called dermatitis).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-that-flea-comb-to-catch-fleas">Use that Flea Comb to Catch Fleas</h2>
<p>Many pet owners have had a stressful experience with fleas and it&rsquo;s not the feeling you want to repeat! Use your flea comb to catch fleas!</p>
<p>Dog fleas can be difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Start at the head of your dog and run a flea comb through the hair in the direction of hair growth, then dump them into soapy water.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find flea combs quickly and easily at your local pet store.
Fleas like to hide in a variety of locations, including the base of the tail, the base of the ear, around the neck and groin area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flea combs can be used to catch fleas and prevent them from jumping onto your furniture or home.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, my roommate&rsquo;s dog has been scratching a lot. I bought some flea medicine today - just in case this is an issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>But while waiting for it to arrive, I wanted to see if there were any fleas on him first.</li>
<li>We did not have a lint brush or comb lying around, so instead of washing his fur with shampoo and then inspecting him like vet advised we foamed his coat up first and then combed an area of skin followed by another area of skin nearby.</li>
<li>Our goal was to rinse him repeatedly throughout until no more soap was coming out and also catch any flea beings that were hitching a ride on our pup!</li>
<li>**We got them! **</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on how to tell if your dog has fleas; check the following signs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Signs of scratching or biting at themselves constantly</li>
<li>You find flea dirt around your pup&rsquo;s paws or fur</li>
<li>They start licking and chewing excessively</li>
<li>Extremely short hair all over, especially near ears and eyes</li>
<li>Pale skin in certain areas from lack of circulation during times when it was warm enough
We hope that this post was helpful and will help you determine if your dog has fleas!</li>

<p>Fleas in your yard can be a nuisance, as they breed fast and thrive there; thanks to the
<a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/ipm/uploads/files/Fleas.pdf">humid or warm environments</a>
. They may hitchhike your pets (
or rarely humans
) to get into your home.</p>
<p>Keeping them out of the yard is a good first step to preventing and or eradicating an infestation because they&rsquo;re difficult bugs;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas, with the right conditions, can live up for as much as two years.</li>
<li>Fleas can lay about 50 eggs daily and an average of 2000 eggs in a lifetime.</li>
<li>Spotting fleas in the yard can be challenging, as the narrow-bodied, wingless, and reddish-brown bugs are only average 1/8 inches long.

</ul>
<p>How do you confirm if there are fleas in the yard? Well, if you suspect there are fleas in your yard, find out for sure by wearing a pair of white long socks and walking around the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas like to hide, so you should examine a look at your socks (for fleas) after walked around in the yard.</li>
<li>Remember to seal the socks in a plastic bag and dispose of the package.
<strong>Some tips on how to treat the backyard and keep fleas off your lawn or yard include:�</strong></li>

<h2 id="step-by-step-how-to-treat-fleas-in-the-yard">Step By Step: How to Treat Fleas in the Yard</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-use-yard-flea-pesticide"><strong>Step 1: Use Yard Flea Pesticide</strong></h3>
<p>Fleas are mainly attracted to moist, dark areas so you&rsquo;ll need to use a pesticide like Wondercide yard flea spray, which will kill off the fleas., mosquitoes, and ticks.</p>
<p>Wondercide yard flea spray is a safe and effective pesticide; it&rsquo;s perfect for the lawn as it can be used on anything from fleas to ticks, eliminating any unwanted pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a flea problem in the yard of my old house and it was so bad that I had to leave my cat at a friend&rsquo;s house for nearly a whole month, despite having aflea collarand is onBayer Advantage II.</li>
<li>I had trouble finding an effective solution to flea infestations in my yard. Always waking up covered with them, I tried many products before finally settling on Wondercide flea spray.
Once I sprayed this pesticide on my lawn, there were no more pesky fleas giving me bites! Even better, it smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
<li>Use pesticides during the day when it&rsquo;s not too hot or cold outside and there is no precipitation in the forecast</li>
<li>Spray as close to the ground as possible- this will keep your pet from walking through it before they can get back into their house afterward!</li>
<li>Be careful of using chemicals on ornamentals; if you do spray an area where plants grow make sure you&rsquo;re spraying at least a few meters away from them.</li>
<li>Keep children out of treated areas until dry (at least 24 hrs)

</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-create-a-flea-barrier-">**Step 2: Create a Flea Barrier **</h3>
<p>One way to get rid of fleas in your yard is by building a flea barrier.</p>
<p>Clear the area surrounding your house of plants, brush, and leaf litter to make it less inviting to fleas.�Cover the area with a layer of sand or gravel.</p>
<p>Once that dries, apply water to it and cover it with fresh mulch - this will create an impenetrable barrier for fleas!�Related:

<strong>Mulching with cedar</strong>
In order to make your yard less inviting for fleas and ticks, apply cedar mulch wherever pets like to rest such as the patio, porch, deck, hedge, and other play areas.</p>
<p>This will keep fleas from being attracted to your yard because cedar is known for its anti-flea and tick properties.</p>
<p>Ceramic tiles or stones are an option if you want a different look in the area, but be sure that they&rsquo;re sealed properly so that no moisture can get into them.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-mow-the-lawn-high-">**Step 3: Mow the Lawn High **</h3>
<p>Mow the lawn high to deter fleas. Mowing high won&rsquo;t eradicate your fleas, but it will reduce their numbers by providing less food and a harsher environment for them.</p>
<p>Long grass provides a refuge for fleas, while short grass (under 2 inches) is unattractive to other bugs that eat the fleas such as ants and spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting off tall grass prevents adults from laying eggs on blades of grass. Pulling up leafy weeds like dandelions also discourages adult flea infestation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mowing high will likely leave you with an unmanageable pile of clippings and is not recommended for small yards or low-traffic areas.</p>
<p>The following are some tips for how to mow your lawn correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cut at least two inches above ground level so as not to leave any long pieces or clumps behind; these act as).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mow the lawn high, dethatch and treat with insecticide (optional). Maintain a healthy yard by not letting the grass grow too long.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-dethatchthe-yard">**Step 4: **Dethatch�the Yard</h3>
<p>Dethatching will help to kill fleas in the yard - keep the thatch at under half-inch or lower.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea larvae hatch in the moist soil and congregate near blades of grass.
The adult fleas will lay eggs on these blades, making them a breeding ground for future infestation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dethatching or simply mowing overgrown lawns to a height of two inches can prevent this from happening by eliminating long pieces of grass where adults may lay their eggs.</p>
<p>Taller weeds like dandelions should be pulled up as well if you haven&rsquo;t already done so within the past year; it also discourages adult flea infestation.</p>
<p>But keep your yard tidy and healthy by not letting the grass grow too long: cut at least two inches above ground level when dethatching before treating with insecticide (optional).</p>
<p>Maintain an attractive, insect-free yard by keeping grass short and healthy.�A good way to discourage fleas is to keep the lawn tidy, but not too overgrown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dethatching will help destroy larvae in moist soil so they can&rsquo;t congregate near blades of grass where adults may lay eggs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-dont-overwater-the-yard">**Step 5: **Don&rsquo;t Overwater the Yard</h3>
<p>Dont overwater the yard or garden - this will help to control fleas. Reducing irrigation excessively will help combat their reproduction cycle - keep the watering at a maximum of 1-inch of water weekly.</p>
<p>It also discourages adult flea infestation.</p>
<p>It can be hard to avoid wetting the grass when you&rsquo;re trying to take care of your lawn, but this is a mistake. To control fleas, make sure not to water your yard too often.</p>
<p>Allow the sunrays to bit the ground</p>
<p>Allow sunshine to shine on the yard by pruning shrubs and trees. Further, cut the thick canopies and low branches of your trees.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will allow the sun to reach the ground and kill any eggs or larvae that may be in these areas, as well as dry out their hiding spots.
The insecticide sprays and
flea collars
may be helpful on your pets, but they are not the only way to control this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important that you regularly wash your pet with a medicated shampoo, or
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-shampoo-for-dogs/">give them regular baths</a>
if they live indoors. Your yard will stay cleaner and more comfortable for both humans and pets.</p>
<h3 id="step-6remove-yard-debris">**Step 6:**Remove Yard Debris</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clear all clutter that might house fleas or their larvae like lumber piles under decks or furniture outside of the home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, remove Yard Debris from under porches and decks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flea larvae may also be present near ground level where there are cracks, crevices, unsealed foundations with dirt piled up underneath.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for dark areas that appear moist or have an accumulation of debris such as leaves or grass clippings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This area is a good breeding ground for parasites so clean it out if you spot any signs of infestation by picking up anything within several feet around them and disposing of offsite (garbage bags can contain flea eggs and larvae).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The more you understand about these pests, the better equipped you&rsquo;ll be to keep them from becoming a problem in your yard.</p>
<p>If left untreated, they could cause problems for years to come.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-chase-wildlife"><strong>Step 7: Chase Wildlife</strong></h3>
<p>Chase and control wildlife from getting into your yard - including deer, rabbits, skunks, feral cats, and squirrels to control fleas. Clean up brush piles and remove fallen branches.</p>
<p>Wild animals can carry fleas, ticks, and other parasites.</p>
<p>Keep children&rsquo;s play areas clean of leaves to discourage nesting animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Call animal control if the problem is severe; you can also hire a professional pest management company for help with difficult cases involving large numbers.
To control your dog&rsquo;s fleas, control or chase various wild animals including:</li>
<li>Skunks</li>
<li>Deer</li>
<li>Rabbits</li>
<li>Feral cats</li>
<li>Squirrels</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-8-treat-dogs--cats-for-fleas-">**Step 8: Treat Dogs &amp; Cats for Fleas **</h3>
<p>Fleas are not only a concern for your pet - they can also be in the environment.</p>
<p>Flea larvae develop on floors, walls, and furniture and pets will readily pick them up when crawling around indoors or out.</p>
<p>To control fleas as well as other pests, use an insecticide labeled for application outdoors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pyrethrin (which kills insects by attacking their nervous systems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permethrins (which affects the central nervous system of the target pest). You may need to reapply after rainstorms. Always read instructions and follow safety precautions before applying any pesticide!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you apply chemicals outside make sure to cover children&rsquo;s toys with plastic bags so that animals cannot get into these items afterward.</p>
<p>If you live in an area where fleas must be controlled year-round, consider using a monthly indoor/outdoor pest control product that contains methoprene (such as Precor) to kill the eggs and larvae; this is especially important for yards near play areas or pet enclosures.</p>
<p>Treat pets by applying topical insecticide products containing fipronil, and pyrethrins according to package directions on dogs every two weeks during periods of high risk such as summer months when flea populations peak.</p>
<p>Consult with your veterinarian if you&rsquo;re not sure what type of product like flea shampoo would work best for your dog or cat&rsquo;s coat type or other special needs.</p>
<h3 id="step-9-vacuum-furniture-and-carpets-">**Step 9: Vacuum furniture and Carpets **</h3>
<p>In order to make sure you won&rsquo;t have fleas in your yard,
vacuum up any furniture that has been left outside
and also vacuum the carpets.</p>
<p>Vacuuming carpets not only makes them look great but also ensures that all those fleas aren&rsquo;t going anywhere!</p>
<p>Be thorough with this part as well, starting at one end of the room or floor space then working across, and finally back again until every inch was covered thoroughly.</p>
<p>If you have any furniture on the floor that contains cushions or fabrics, you will need to remove them and vacuum these areas as well.</p>
<p>Steps for Vacuuming Furniture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a sturdy area in your home where all of the furniture can be placed once it is cleaned.</li>
<li>Place a sheet over the area so there won&rsquo;t be any fleas flying around.</li>
<li>Make sure not to mix anything with different materials together and use plastic bags if necessary to avoid getting dirt from one item mixed into another when being brought inside.</li>
<li>If possible, move other items out of this room such as toys, clothes, etc., before vacuuming begins so they don&rsquo;t get dusty while doing their work! When complete with Vacuum Car</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-11-wash-pet-bedding-clothes-and-linens">Step 11: Wash Pet Bedding, Clothes, and Linens</h3>
<p>Pets are wonderful companions and diligent housekeepers, but their fur isn&rsquo;t 100% convenient.</p>
<p>You may need to wash your clothes, bedding, and linens (with�hot, &amp; soapy water) more often when pets live with you!</p>
<p>To clean pet bedding, clothes, and linens:
*Step One *</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gather materials needed for the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All-purpose detergent (or laundry soap), a large bucket or washing machine, water with hot water heater set at 40 degrees Celsius (~104 Fahrenheit) or higher, fabric softener if desired (&amp; dryer sheets will help too!), an old toothbrush to scrub stains out of fabric, rubber gloves for cleaning fur off clothing &amp; furniture.
*Step Two *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill up your container or washer with enough clean warm wash water that you can agitate soiled items in it without them getting stuck on the sides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add detergent according to its instructions (usually about two tablespoons). Let this mixture soak into any heavy soil areas to loosen them up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add clothes or linens and gently agitate in the water one at a time, getting as much of the soap solution on each item before placing it into your washing machine (or back into the bucket).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rinse items thoroughly with clean warm wash water &amp; add more detergent if needed.
<em>Step Three</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill your dryer drum (to
<em>kill fleas</em>
) with enough clean tumble dry clothes that you can easily move fabric around without stuff getting caught on metal parts inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dry until all fabrics are completely dried out - this will take about 18 hours for large loads &amp; only takes a few hours when drying smaller loads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to dry fabric in the sun when possible, and use a fan if it&rsquo;s not sunny outside! Sunlight helps kill bacteria on fabrics that may be left behind from washing them for too many days in a row.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-12-apply-borax-for-fleas">Step 12: Apply Borax For Fleas</h3>
<p>For fleas, Borax can be used in many ways. One way is to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/borax-flea-killer/">sprinkle it around the yard</a>
which will kill any adult fleas.</p>
<p>Borax can also be used as a carpet and area treatment. Just sprinkle it on the carpets or wherever you see fleas in your home.</p>
<p>You should not use Borax on pets, but if they get into contact with Borax residue then have them bathed right away to avoid any irritation.</p>
<p>Borax is toxic for humans and animals, so be careful when using it.</p>
<p>It is also toxic to fish and other aquatic life, so if you have a pond or are near water then make sure not to use Borax in those areas.</p>
<p>If used appropriately - Borax can be an excellent way of dealing with fleas on your property without harming the environment around you.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On how to treat fleas in the yard;</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear clutter, remove places throughout the yard under which fleas can hide and lay eggs, vacuum floors and furniture, use borax, evict wildlife (critters like squirrels), wash clothing and pet bedding, flea-treat pets, and let the sunshine in by doing tree pruning or removing low branches around play areas or patios.
Go over any large outdoor area with an insecticide sprayer that contains pyrethrins mixed with water according to package directions for best results.</li>

<dt>Here&rsquo;s�how to use a flea comb.�Hey, today I am here on my garage table with my dog Jake. I&rsquo;ll demonstrate how to use a</dt>
<dt>flea comb</dt>
<dt>on your cat or dog. You&rsquo;ll not use chemicals, and thus it&rsquo;s a non-toxic process.</dt>
<dt><strong>Note</strong></dt>
<dd>first, fleas live in the house (not on pets) - so, they&rsquo;ll temporarily jump on pets or
pet owners
. I recommend inspecting your pets if you find the pet starts frequently scratching, losing hair, or restless than usual.
<em>If you need a short answer, place your cat/dog on a white or light-colored towel. Comb through your pet&rsquo;s hair slowly - start at the nip of the neck and work your way down. Make sure to cover the base of the back and the neck area. Finally, clean and vacuum the spaces you&rsquo;ve used for flea combing.�</em>

<h2 id="how-to-use-a-flea-comb-step-by-step">How to Use a Flea Comb (Step by Step)</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-take-a-half-full-bowl-or-bucket-with-hot-soapy-water">Step 1: Take a Half-full Bowl or Bucket with Hot Soapy Water</h3>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to put a half-filled bowl or bucket with hot soapy water. The
hot-soapy water will drown or kill fleas
that you&rsquo;ll remove from the cat or dog. The logic of having a hall-filled but equally deep bucket so that the fleas won&rsquo;t jump out and escape.</p>
<h4 id="--suspend-a-lightbulb">- Suspend a Lightbulb</h4>
<p>Have a light bulb as fleas are attracted to light. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to suspend a light source (like an electric bulb) over the table where you&rsquo;ll be placing the pet.</p>
<h4 id="--place-the-pet-on-a-light-colored-towel">- Place the pet on a Light-colored towel</h4>
<p>Spread a white or light-colored towel that will enable you to easily see the fleas and flea dirt,
flea eggs
that you&rsquo;ll remove from the cat or dog.
After each stroke, inspect the comb for live fleas and
flea dirt
. Any live fleas should be placed in a bowl of soapy water. If you&rsquo;re not sure any dirt found on your comb is actually from fleas, you can place it on the soapy water - if it turns red, this is a
sign that its flea dirt
.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkWCcSNJVCA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkWCcSNJVCA</a></p>
<h3 id="step-2-run-the-flea-comb-through-the-hair---head-towards-its-tail">Step 2: Run the flea comb through the hair - &ldquo;head towards its tail.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Now, run the flea comb
through your pet&rsquo;s hair
. However, begin the combing process from the pet&rsquo;s head and slowly move to its tail.
Fleas are mainly on the groin area, around the pet&rsquo;s neck area, around leg folds, and the tail&rsquo;s base. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to have thorough combing on the pet&rsquo;s underside, near the pet&rsquo;s rump, and on its neck.
Next, as you complete any flea combing stroke, analyze the flea comb to check whether it has fleas or flea dirt on it. If you notice any of them, but the flea comb into the bowl or bucket containing the hot-soapy
water - this will drown or kill
the fleas and their eggs.
Finally, after completing the first combing process, relax for about 5 minutes to allow the remaining fleas to move around (to hidden places like the ground and legs).
Fleas try to hide around the pet
, and hence the second combing will help you get the fleas that could have escaped the first combing. Now, flea combs your cat or dog again to
remove the remaining fleas and their eggs
.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-clean-the-flea-combing-area-and-vacuum-the-room">Step 3: Clean the flea combing area and vacuum the room.</h3>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve cleaned your pet, it&rsquo;s time to clean the flea combing area. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to dump the soapy water you&rsquo;d put in the bowl or bucket and which now has fleas, fleas eggs, and flea dirt.
Next, you&rsquo;ll need to clean and vacuum the area or room where you were conducting the combing. Further, if your house or rooms is flea-infested massively, remember to use the
best flea bombs
.
However, if you were combing outside, you&rsquo;ll have to
flea spray your yard
or use a hose to down the fleas that might have dropped there. Finally, repeat the combing process on your dog after 1 week to
eliminate a massive flea infestation
.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-a-flea-comb">When to Use a Flea Comb?</h2>
<dl>
<dt>A flea comb is a pet care device with fine tines or teeth, which we&rsquo;ll use to find and</dt>
<dt>remove fleas from cats</dt>
<dt>, dogs, or rabbits. But why not use your regular human hair combs? - you ask. Well,</dt>
<dt>flea combs</dt>
<dt>are special as their closely spaced times will remove fleas, eggs, and flea dirt more effectively.</dt>
<dt><strong>So, when should use a flea comb:�</strong></dt>
<dt><strong>1. To�Find flea dirt:</strong></dt>
<dt>Flea dirt is the bug&rsquo;s feces, and if found on your pet&rsquo;s fur - that&rsquo;s a sign that the pet has fleas.</dt>
<dt><strong>2. To�Remove adult fleas</strong></dt>
<dd>Flea combing will stick the adult fleas on the comb&rsquo;s finely spaced tines.
<strong>3. Remove flea dirt and eggs</strong>
from adult pets and small pets with sensitive skin - and thus cannot use chemical-based flea control methods.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="howoften-to-flea-comb-your-pet">How�Often to Flea Comb your pet?</h2>
<p>Well, this depends on where your pet sleeps and how close it gets to you and your family members. Therefore, if you tend to have the cat or
dog on your couch or bed
, you should use flea comb more regularly.
Further, if you&rsquo;re near a place with forest, large amounts of grass, and trees, then you&rsquo;ll need a daily flea combing routine until you can no longer see fleas during combing.
But, normally, you&rsquo;d need to comb your
cat or dog
once or twice per week - for protection and�proactive flea management. However, if you&rsquo;ll be using other flea control methods such as�Advantage, you&rsquo;ll have to reduce flea combing frequency.</p>
<h2 id="any-consideration-when-flea-combing-your-cat">Any consideration when flea combing your cat?</h2>
<p>Not all flea combs will work for your cat. Notably, a good flea comb teeth must be 0.155 mm between each other and have about� 10 teeth for every 8 mm. A litmus test is to hold up the flea comb to the light - if you see the light, then the flea comb will not catch the feline fleas.
<strong>1.</strong>
Interestingly, flea combing
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-collar-for-cats/">and collar</a>
allows you to socialize the kitten or cat through Mutual Grooming - which is all fun. However, if your cat is uncomfortable (shows resistance and fighting) with flea combing, consider using alternative flea control methods.
<strong>2.</strong>
Avoid sensitive areas on your cat - When flea combing, note the sensitive area that may cause discomfort and fear on your feline friend. For example, if the case skin is bruised or broken by
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-bite-humans/">flea bites</a>
or anything else - be gentle in flea combing or treat the cat using soothing creams before flea combing or brushing.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-anelectronic-flea-comb">What about an�Electronic Flea Comb?</h2>
<p>Unlike your manual flea combs, manufacturers of the
Electric Flea Comb
claim that their device can go deep into the pet&rsquo;s hair, search for the fleas, kill them upon contact, and eject them from the pet&rsquo;s coat.
Notably, the electric flea combs will release some charge into the pet&rsquo;s coat, which will
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">kill the fleas</a>
on contact. Further, the electric flea comb will be appropriate for furs of any length and pets of all ages.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">Vet&rsquo;s Best Flea Spray</a>
will leave no stains even in places that the pets eat, play, sleep or live.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, you&rsquo;ll need to test a small area like on pant legs or shoes before you undertake full-blown spraying.
Now, point the spray nozzle in any direction in your Yard or lawn to spray. However, ensure that you flea-spray the yard area evenly and avoid forming a puddle.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Flea Spray for Yard&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4mJPb_z0fo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4mJPb_z0fo</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considerations-in-yard-flea-spray">Considerations in Yard Flea Spray</h2>
<h3 id="1-ease-of-use-and-duration">1. Ease-of-use and Duration:</h3>
<p>The flea sprays for yards we&rsquo;ve reviewed can be used with a garden sprayer. Some even come with a very handy hose applicator. Most of the products we&rsquo;ve reviewed last 3-4 weeks.
<em>How long does the spray last?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The longer the duration, the less frequently you&rsquo;ll need to spray your Yard. Most flea yard sprays last 3-4 weeks, despite what the product labels may claim. Cheaper sprays will wash away in the rain.
<em>Where can it be used?</em></li>
<li>Check whether the spray can be used on lawns, flowers, shrubs, and sidewalks. While it&rsquo;s hard to find sprays that can be safely used on vegetable patches, you want to make sure that most of your Yard is covered. Some sprays can even be used indoors, giving you great value for money.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-coverage-and-whether-it-only-kills-adult-fleas">2. Coverage and Whether it only kills adult <a href="/posts/how-to-treat-fleas-in-the-yard/">fleas</a>:</h3>
<p>Is it suitable for small or large yards? Some yard sprays are very effective in killing adult fleas quickly on contact. However, these probably won&rsquo;t kill the eggs and larvae. This means you&rsquo;ll need to spray again after the insects have hatched and grown.
<em>How much area does the spray cover?</em>
-If you have a small yard, then a lower capacity will do. But for larger yards, you either want to buy a higher capacity spray or end up getting multiple bottles. So it&rsquo;s essential to check the coverage.
<em>Is the yard spray valid for the entire <a href="/posts/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/">flea</a> life cycle?</em>
This is probably the most important thing for you to consider when choosing a flea spray for your Yard. If you&rsquo;re looking for a cheap, quick solution, then get a yard spray that only kills adult fleas.</p>
<h2 id="biospot-active-care-yard--garden-flea-spray"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R9F4KO/?tag=p-policy-20">BioSpot Active Care Yard &amp; Garden Flea Spray</a></h2>
<p>[amazon box=&ldquo;B001R9F4KO&rdquo; template=&ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;]
BioSpot Active Care contains 2.5% Permethrin and will control fleas and cover your Yard for about four weeks - this is what is denoted as ongoing care against fleas and other harmful insects.
Long residue effect - it&rsquo;s one of the longer-lasting yard fleas sprays available.
You can spray the BioSpot Active Care formula on the lawn, trees, roses, and flowers without damaging them. It&rsquo;ll cover your Yard against a variety of insects, including fleas,
gnats
, and mosquitoes.
This is one of the best yard sprays for adult flea control. BioSpot Active Care Yard &amp; Garden Spray is effective in killing fleas and keeping them away from your pets.
This means you don&rsquo;t have to spray as often and still enjoy the benefits of remaining flea-free.
It does contain some pretty toxic ingredients, so be very careful in letting pets near the sprayed area until completely dry. However, this is the price you pay for a powerful, potent solution. It&rsquo;s Long-lasting and Fast-acting.
You can apply on building foundations up to a height of about 3 feet. For the outdoor spaces, you can use on the Yard, doors, windows, porches, patios, driveways, and sidewalks.
However, don&rsquo;t apply on drains and sewers or gutters as such water will eventually drain to aquatic habitats, water bodies, storm drains, and sewers.
<em>Another related product is the NyGuard Insect Growth Regulator</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is probably the best solution for large yards, covering over 52,000 square feet.
Nygard also disrupts the entire flea life cycle, making it highly effective. It Disrupts the entire flea life cycle, is Long-lasting, Great for large yards, and Can also be used indoors.
The Good:</li>
<li>Has a long residue effect - covers your Yard actively for about four weeks</li>
<li>It covers your Yard against fleas, Grasshoppers, ticks, Millipedes, flies, Leafminers, mosquitoes, Bagworms, Japanese beetles, and gnats.</li>
<li>Safe to use even on roses, turf, flowers, shrubs, vegetation, trees, and lawns.
The Bad:</li>
<li>Toxic to your aquatic organisms including invertebrates and fish</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>However, as we&rsquo;ve shown in our guide, the most effective sprays are those that kill flea eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults.</p>
<ul>
<li>While these are more expensive, they are your best solution for long-lasting results.</li>

      <title>What Attracts Fleas</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas will pose a hazard (health) to both pets and humans. So, ensure to
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">flea-treat your cats</a>
&amp; dogs -� to avoid that massive infestation.
<strong>But what attracts fleas? As they find a host, cat fleas are mainly attracted by thermal and visual stimuli (heat &amp; light). Others include C02 &amp; exhaled breath from humans, movement, darkness, food, and warmth.�</strong>
<strong>Attraction Cues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Host size &amp; color, time of day, carbon dioxide, physical contact, warmth, gravity, host odor, air currents, and light movement.�</em>
Related:
Do Fleas Suck Blood</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-attracts-fleas">Details: What Attracts Fleas?</h2>
<p>When it emerges from its
cocoon
, adult fleas will begin sucking blood for survival - avoiding starvation will require feeding within a week.
Cat fleas will largely be attracted by thermal and visual cues. But combining various stimuli will enhance the accuracy of how the fleas detect their hosts.</p>
<h3 id="1phototaxis-light">1.�Phototaxis (Light)</h3>
<p>Light will attract those adult fleas - this will mainly be the green-yellow light with wavelengths of 500 to 530 nm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning the lights on or off quickly makes the fleas perceive such actions as a shadow from some possible host in the surrounding.</li>
<li>Thus, intermittent light will attract the fleas for about 8 times more compared to using continuous light.
Notably, when positioned in dark places, over 90% of all fleas will start moving to areas with light within 1 hour.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="aintermittent-light">a.�Intermittent Light</h4>
<p>The light attraction for fleas will be better when the source of light is briefly &amp; quickly interrupted within like 5-10 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>As noted above, the light interruption seems to mimic some shadow that would be produced by some potential host when its passes by the bug.
Thus, fleas will tend to quickly jump towards the side that had observed shadow.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-trap/">Flea traps</a>
that employ intermittent lighting will be effective in attracting and capturing more fleas compared to the use of lighting that is constant.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-color-of-light">b. Color of Light</h4>
<p>Fleas, especially cat fleas, will be attracted to different color wavelengths - for example, most fleas will get attracted by light at wavelengths of 300 to 600 nanometers (nm).
However, generally, fleas will get attracted by the light colors that have wavelengths of 500 to 530 nm, this is what we call green-yellow in color.</p>
<ul>
<li>The light that has a green-yellow color will attract over 100% more fleas compared to the standard light.
You can improve the performance of your various fleas traps by outfitting them using some green-yellow filter.
However, some colors such as green and blue filters won&rsquo;t be as effective in attracting fleas and will have a comparable effect to that of standard light.</li>
<li>Finally, other color filters (compared to standard light) will give better outcomes in attracting fleas; such colors include medium blue, yellow, magenta, and red.
It&rsquo;s vital to note that fleas won&rsquo;t easily see lights with wavelengths that are over 630 nm including red light.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-host-odor-odortaxis">2. Host Odor (Odortaxis)</h3>
<p>Different flea hosts have an odor that&rsquo;ll attract fleas - this is because the primary host provided them with shelter plus food (that critical blood meal).</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, some flea species will be attracted by some host odors and not others.
But it&rsquo;s not clear whether cat fleas will be practically be attracted to cat body odor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-movement-moving-objects-attract-fleas">3. Movement moving objects attract fleas</h3>
<p>Fleas won&rsquo;t be attached to stationary and inanimate items.
For instance, a recent study reported that over 75% of fleas were attracted by a black (moving) target.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, in the same experiment, just under 20% of the fleas got attracted to the object in its stationary form.
Further, another study reported that stationary (and warm) objects make the fleas jump with the presence of other stimuli like air currents.</li>
<li>Fleas will produce about 20 eggs in the pet&rsquo;s hair - these eggs tend to fall off onto some furniture, floors, and carpets.</li>
<li>While in such locations, the fleas and their larvae hide in the dark locations and shadows as they eat<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-flea-dirt/">flea dirt (undigested blood)</a>.
The shadows and fabric or carpet fibers will hide the fleas as they develop into pupae &amp; as they spin those silky cocoons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-air-currents-air-movement-anemotaxis">4. Air Currents/ Air movement (Anemotaxis)</h3>
<p>Air Currents won&rsquo;t attract fleas on their own - this is to say that your fan causing air movements of fast air currents won&rsquo;t attract those cat fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>But when coupled with various factors, air movements or currents will attract fleas.
But air currents coming in short bursts will cause flea jumping, although there is no relationship with fleas&rsquo; attraction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-gravity-geotaxis">5. Gravity (Geotaxis)</h3>
<p>Considering gravity, fleas will be negatively gravitactic (geotactic), and thus it&rsquo;ll be moving anti-gravity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The baby fleas will climb onto small items - they&rsquo;ll remain on top and also wait for any animal that&rsquo;s passing by.
In your
apartments
, check the carpet fibers as this will be where you&rsquo;ll find the adult fleas.</li>
<li>When in the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">outdoor spaces</a>, fleas will climb onto some shrubs or vegetation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-are-fleas-attracted-to-co2">6. Are fleas attracted to CO2?</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide
will also attract bugs like bed bugs
and fleas - CO2 is that gas that warm-blooded animals breathe out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, fleas could actually prefer hiking on some individuals as opposed to others in your house.</li>
<li>This is because some people will give off mo0re CO2 in comparison to others - and thus such individuals will be flea-infested more.
Fleas, especially cat fleas, will leap around more when there is a higher CO2 amount.</li>
<li>Besides, CO2 produced by humans tends to attract fleas more - this might down that humidity and warmth could increase the level of fleas&rsquo; response.
Further, a recent flea study shows that the bugs&rsquo; activity &amp; jumping as they&rsquo;re receiving CO2 in short bursts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7warmth-thermotaxis">7.�Warmth (Thermotaxis)</h3>
<p>The activity of fleas in your spaces will reduce when there is an
increase om heat</p>
<ul>
<li>a positive response on the thermotactic conditions.</li>
<li>Notably, the fleas will jump all over via casual directions especially when you place some warm item in the bugs&rsquo; environment.
Fleas will get attracted by warm temperatures since it mimics the presence of a possible host - due to their body warmth.</li>
<li>The temperature target will be around 40C (104F) - including objects and animals.
But you&rsquo;ll also experience some flea attraction around a temperature of 50C (122F) - and thus it&rsquo;s clear that fleas might not easily discriminate against various hosts.</li>
<li>Despite that fleas may orient towards some heated item, the bugs will require additional stimuli including factors like air or current movement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-host-size--surface-color">8. Host Size &amp; Surface Color</h3>
<p>Fleas won&rsquo;t get attracted to hosts with small bodies. Hosts like
rodents and moles
won&rsquo;t largely attract fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>A recent study employed such a target to determine the suitability of small hosts to fleas.</li>
<li>Thye used targets that have diameters as follows 20, 13, &amp; 8 centimeters - the fleas&rsquo; responsiveness to the targets was noted as 44%, 43%, &amp; 21% respectively.
On surface colors, fleas&rsquo; attraction was analyzed considering colors including white, yellow, black, blue, and red. The outcome was that blue and red are highly attractive and white is the least.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on the question &ldquo;what attracts fleas&rdquo;, fleas will be attracted to thermal and visual stimuli - like warmer places and hosts - I would say temperatures around
65 degrees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fleas seekwarmth from locations such as the pet&rsquo;s nestling and fur, or even their skin.
Other stimuli that&rsquo;ll attract fleas are C02 &amp; exhaled breath from humans, movement, darkness, food, and warmth. Further factors include
<em>air currents, light movement, and host size &amp; color.</em></li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleas can be a nightmare for pet owners and homeowners alike. These tiny, blood-sucking insects can cause discomfort to pets and humans, leading to itching, irritation, and even serious health problems. If youre dealing with a <a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">flea</a> infestation, youll want to know what can kill fleas instantly to provide relief. In this article, well discuss effective solutions to eradicate fleas quickly and safely.</p>
<h2 id="1-flea-shampoos-for-pets">1. Flea Shampoos for Pets</h2>
<p>One of the quickest ways to kill fleas on pets is by using a flea shampoo designed for this purpose. These shampoos typically contain ingredients like pyrethrins, permethrin, or insect growth regulators (IGRs) that kill fleas on contact and offer long-lasting protection. Always follow the instructions carefully, as some flea shampoos may not be safe for certain animals, such as cats.</p>
<h2 id="2-flea-sprays">2. Flea Sprays</h2>
<p>Flea sprays are an excellent choice for treating both pets and the environment. Many sprays are formulated with ingredients like permethrin or imidacloprid, which kill fleas instantly. These sprays can be applied directly to your pets fur or used to treat your home and yard. Be sure to read the label for safety precautions, especially if you have young children or other pets in the household.</p>
<h2 id="3-diatomaceous-earth">3. Diatomaceous Earth</h2>
<p>Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural substance that can be used to kill fleas. Its a fine powder made from the fossilized remains of diatoms, which have sharp edges that can puncture the exoskeletons of fleas, causing them to dehydrate and die. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth around your home, paying special attention to areas where fleas are likely to hide, such as pet bedding and carpets. Leave it for a few hours or overnight, then vacuum it up.</p>
<h2 id="4-flea-bombs-or-foggers">4. Flea Bombs or Foggers</h2>
<p>If you have a severe flea infestation, flea bombs or foggers can be highly effective at killing fleas instantly. These products release insecticides into the air, which settle on surfaces and kill fleas. However, flea bombs should be used with caution, as they contain potent chemicals and may require the evacuation of the home during application. Follow all safety guidelines and ensure your pets and family members are out of the house while the bomb is in use.</p>
<h2 id="5-vacuuming-and-steam-cleaning">5. Vacuuming and Steam Cleaning</h2>
<p>Vacuuming your home regularly is one of the most effective ways to get rid of fleas. Vacuuming removes adult fleas, eggs, and larvae from carpets, furniture, and cracks in the floor. For an even more effective approach, use a steam cleaner, which can kill fleas at all stages of their life cycle, including eggs and larvae. Steam cleaning your carpets and furniture can instantly kill fleas and is safe for both pets and humans.</p>
<h2 id="6-salt">6. Salt</h2>
<p>Salt is another natural remedy that can be used to kill fleas. Sprinkle salt generously on carpets, rugs, and other areas where fleas are likely to be hiding. The salt dehydrates the fleas, causing them to die. After a few hours, vacuum up the salt and fleas. This method is best for areas that are infested with fleas, but it may take a little longer to see results compared to other treatments.</p>
<h2 id="7-lemon-and-vinegar-solution">7. Lemon and Vinegar Solution</h2>
<p>Lemon and vinegar are two common household ingredients that can be used to kill fleas naturally. Mix equal parts of lemon juice and white vinegar in a spray bottle, then spray the solution onto your pets fur or around your home. The acidity of the solution disrupts the fleas nervous systems, leading to their death. Be sure to avoid getting the solution in your pets eyes or on broken skin.</p>
<h2 id="8-flea-collars">8. Flea Collars</h2>
<p>Flea collars are another popular option for killing fleas instantly. These collars are infused with insecticides that kill fleas on contact. Flea collars are especially useful for pets that spend a lot of time outdoors. While flea collars can be effective, its important to ensure that you purchase one that is specifically designed for your pet and follow the manufacturers instructions carefully.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many ways to kill fleas instantly, whether youre dealing with an infestation in your home or on your pets. From flea shampoos and sprays to natural remedies like diatomaceous earth and vinegar, theres an effective solution for every situation. Remember to treat both your pets and your home to ensure that fleas are completely eradicated. With the right approach, you can eliminate fleas and restore comfort to your living environment.</p>

<h3 id="1-adult-fleas---and-flea-dirt">1. Adult Fleas - and Flea Dirt</h3>
<p>Adult fleas arise from their pupae and start finding a favorable host and start taking their blood meal from the cats, dogs, or even human beings.
Fleas may live
under carpets or bedding - including cat and dog bedding. Further,
fleas could also drop
some larvae, eggs, pupae, and their waste or poop.
You&rsquo;ll notice some waste that&rsquo;s reddish-black, which they leave on the bedding. Smearing the debris will make it turn rusty or reddish - proving that you genuinely have a flea infestation.
Examine the
cat or dog&rsquo;s
sleeping towel, rug, or bed - do you notice some &ldquo;pepper or salt grain&rdquo; looking objects? Then, these are flea larvae (salt grain&quot;) while the pepper is
flea dirt
.
For a massive flea infestation, you should use flea foggers or hire some professional exterminators to kill adults, larvae, and baby fleas hiding under furniture and
carpets</p>
<ul>
<li>further practice
regular vacuuming
.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-flea-eggs">2. Flea Eggs</h3>
<p>Adult fleas (that&rsquo;s the female fleas) lay about 27 eggs in 24 hours.
Fleas eggs
are off-white, smooth, and also dry - they&rsquo;ll stay mainly in the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s bedding.
So, briefly,
fleas eggs
have a soft shell plus some flexible-Chorio. They measure about 0.5 mm by 0.25 mm in length &amp; width, respectively. Fleas eggs have a shape described as r
<em>ounded-oval.�</em>
Fleas eggs are slippery and will slide on the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s skin and fur. You&rsquo;ll find eggs on the bedding of pets -
fleas don&rsquo;t stay on humans
.
Flea eggs
have a length of 0.05 millimeters - the tiny bugs may be difficult to see with your naked eyes.
Female
fleas lay their eggs
once they take a blood meal. In particular,
cat flea
will have a whitish or translucent-oval dots or sometimes dirt. They&rsquo;ll hatch within two days to 14 days - to become
flea Larva
.</p>
<h3 id="3-flea-pupae">3. Flea Pupae</h3>
<p>Flea larvae have a silky cocoon that allowing better camouflaging with their surroundings. The outer shell is irregular, crusty, and lumpy.
The larvae will molt (within three days to even one year) to become flea pupae - mainly once they sense carbon dioxide or vibrations from a pet host or humans.
The development of the flea pupae will start at the 3rd &amp; 4th larvae insta. They&rsquo;ll spin cocoons from upholstery fabrics, furniture, carpets, dust, lint, and
human hair
.
The eyeless and legless pupa molts into a being that&rsquo;ll easily detect any warm-blooded animals. Also, it&rsquo;ll move fast and jumping very high onto the animal for a blood meal.
Further, using IGR like Precor and Archer won&rsquo;t
kill the flea
pupae that are fully developed. However,
IGRs will kill flea larvae and flea eggs
.
The pupal casing or cocoon provides the necessary protection against the environment&rsquo;s harsh forces until when the conditions are favorable, like a host coming nearby.</p>
<h3 id="4-flea-larvae">4. Flea Larvae</h3>
<p>Flea larvae, once developed, will come
out of the flea eggs. They&rsquo;ll measure from 3 mm to 5 mm in length. The semi-transparent to white-colored worm-like larvae will become darker as they grow.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-eat/">Flea larvae mainly eat flea dirt</a></p>
<ul>
<li>which makes them darken during growth. They&rsquo;ll be on this stage for four days to 3 weeks - when they molt through 3 instars.
You&rsquo;ll not mainly find
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-dog-fleas-transfer-to-humans/">flea larvae on cats and dogs</a>
, which makes flea treatment challenging, particularly when finding the baby fleas.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On what do baby fleas look like? - flea larvae or known as baby fleas, are tiny and whitish wormlike creatures that measure under -inches.
Check for pepper- (flea feces )and &ldquo;salt&rdquo; (flea larvae) like objects around towel, rugs, or cat and dog bedding - check on furniture and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-carpet-powder/">carpeting for effective control of adult and baby fleas</a>
.
Baby fleas will have no legs and also have a tiny head. They don&rsquo;t require a host - and thus won&rsquo;t suck your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s blood for survival.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/are-fleas-attracted-to-heat/">Flea</a> cocoons are protective casings that fleas create during their pupal stage. The cocoon is an essential part of the flea lifecycle and serves as a safe environment for the flea to develop into an adult. Flea cocoons are not always easy to spot, but understanding what they look like can help you manage flea infestations more effectively.</p>
<h2 id="appearance-of-flea-cocoons">Appearance of Flea Cocoons</h2>
<p>Flea cocoons are typically small, oval, and covered with debris such as dirt, dust, and pet hair. This camouflage helps protect the cocoon from predators and environmental elements. The actual cocoon is usually translucent or pale in color, with a sticky outer layer that allows it to adhere to surrounding surfaces.
The size of a flea cocoon can vary, but they are generally around 0.5 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a pinhead. The cocoon can look like a tiny, silk-like sac that blends in with the surroundings, making it difficult to spot with the naked eye. It often appears as a small, off-white or light brown speck.</p>
<h2 id="lifecycle-of-fleas-and-the-role-of-the-cocoon">Lifecycle of Fleas and the Role of the Cocoon</h2>
<p>Flea larvae hatch from eggs and immediately begin feeding on organic material, such as flea feces, dead skin cells, and hair. Once the larvae are ready to pupate, they spin a protective cocoon around themselves. The cocoon is designed to shelter the flea as it undergoes metamorphosis into an adult flea.
The cocoon also serves another purposeit is highly resistant to environmental conditions, such as heat, cold, and chemicals. This makes it difficult to eliminate flea cocoons using typical household cleaning methods. Fleas can remain dormant in their cocoons for weeks or even months until environmental conditions are favorable for them to emerge.</p>
<h2 id="flea-cocoon-lifespan-and-emergence">Flea Cocoon Lifespan and Emergence</h2>
<p>The length of time a flea remains in its cocoon depends on several factors, including temperature, humidity, and the availability of a host. In optimal conditions, fleas may emerge from their cocoons within a few days to a week. However, if conditions are not ideal, fleas can remain dormant inside their cocoons for much longer, sometimes even several months. This is why flea infestations can reoccur after apparent eradication.
Fleas rely on environmental cues, such as vibrations, heat, and carbon dioxide, to trigger their emergence from the cocoon. These signals indicate the presence of a potential host nearby, prompting the adult flea to hatch and begin seeking out a host for blood feeding.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-deal-with-flea-cocoons">How to Deal with Flea Cocoons</h2>
<p>Dealing with flea cocoons can be challenging, as they are resistant to many forms of treatment. However, there are several steps you can take to manage flea infestations:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Vacuuming:**Regular vacuuming is one of the most effective ways to remove flea cocoons, larvae, and eggs from your home. Be sure to vacuum carpets, upholstery, and areas where pets spend time. Dispose of the vacuum bag immediately after use to prevent re-infestation.</li>
<li>**Flea treatments:**Use flea treatments for your pets, such as topical spot-on treatments or oral medications. These treatments can kill adult fleas and prevent new fleas from hatching.</li>
<li>**Insect growth regulators (IGRs):**IGRs are chemicals that interfere with the flea life cycle, preventing flea larvae from developing into adult fleas. These can be applied to your home to break the flea lifecycle and help reduce the number of cocoons.</li>
<li>**Flea bomb or fogger:**A flea bomb or fogger can be used to treat large areas, especially when flea cocoons are widespread. However, be sure to follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions carefully to avoid exposure to harmful chemicals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Flea cocoons are small, oval-shaped protective cases that are often difficult to see with the naked eye due to their camouflaged appearance. These cocoons play a crucial role in the flea life cycle, providing a safe haven for fleas as they develop into adults. Understanding the characteristics and lifespan of flea cocoons can help you better manage flea infestations and prevent re-infestation in your home.</p>

*In summary, <a href="/posts/flea-eggs-vs-dandruff/">fleas</a> eggs are tiny specs (0.5 lengths by 0.25 mm width), rounded-oval shape, with a flexible-chorion and softshell. *

[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Flea Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="flea-eggs---what-do-flea-eggs-look-like">Flea Eggs - What Do Flea Eggs Look Like?</h2>
<h3 id="1-size---how-big-is-flea-eggs">1. Size - How big is Flea Eggs?</h3>
<p>Flea eggs, particularly
cat flea eggs
, measure about 0.25 millimeters in width and 0.5 millimeters in length. Despite that, you can see the eggs with your unaided human eye - particularly when in clusters, these creatures are tiny in body size.
In the house,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flea-eggs-vs-dandruff/">flea eggs will be found</a>
in pets&rsquo; visits, feed, sleep, and rest. Also, the immature fleas will grow inside carpets - use
flea carpet powder to control
.
You can control
adult fleas
using
powders
,
dawn dish soap
. Below are additional pointers for flea eggs that may be in your house (or
fleas human hair
), yard, or on the pet.
Flea eggs are microscopic creatures thatll look like the grain of salt. Notably, a single grain of salt dropped on some of the ground may be difficult to notice or find. They are microscopic and thus will only be seen when theyre in clusters.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0W5eeUqcQQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0W5eeUqcQQ</a></p>
<h3 id="2color---what-color-are-flea-eggs">2.�Color - What Color Are Flea Eggs?</h3>
<p>Flea eggs are off-white because of their flexible-chorion and soft shell  it may mistake the flea egg for a grain of salt
of dirt while on the ground.
The oval-shaped eggs may also be mistaken for the color of human dry skin thats whitish and rough due to lack of oiling. However, the identity of the fleas eggs may only be fully verified with a microscope.
For this process, youll position the flea eggs on some dark paper before looking at it through a magnifying glass or microscope lens. Notice whether the object is oval-shaped, plus characteristically off-white or white  if so, this could be flea eggs.</p>
<h3 id="3-shape">3. Shape</h3>
<p>Flea eggs take the shape of an oval but elongate object that also has two rounded ends. Further, the viable flea eggs will have its surface being smooth and lacks indentations.
However, the insecticide-sprayed or non-viable flea eggs look collapsed and dimpled. Despite that, youll find the eggs dry. Theyre at first sticky and wet when laid.
So,
flea eggs are oval and clear
(off -white) tiny specs in the shape and size of sand or salt grains. However, the eggs mainly exist in the 20s as a cluster and will mostly be seen in the pets sleeping area and rarely on the cats or dogs fur.
**But, can you see flea eggs? **
<em>Fleas eggs can be seen with the naked human eye, but they&rsquo;re significantly small. Therefore, it would help to look around when you suspect a flea infestation in your space.</em>
However, if you&rsquo;re inspecting the pet&rsquo;s fur, or bedding, or thick carpet, it would be challenging to see the flea eggs with your naked eggs - so use a magnifying glass.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-fleas-lay-eggs">Where Do Fleas Lay Eggs?</h2>
<h3 id="1-pet-hosts---cats-and-dogs">1. Pet Hosts - Cat&rsquo;s and Dogs</h3>
<p>In summary, fleas mainly lay their eggs directly on their host - including pets like the
dog&rsquo;s hip area and the cat&rsquo;s
neck area. Also, adult fleas are mostly permanent ectoparasites
on their hosts
.
You&rsquo;ll mainly find the flea eggs on regions that are generally less groomed - mainly when you don&rsquo;t
use the cat flea comb
frequently.</p>
<h3 id="2-falling-off-their-host">2. Falling off their Host</h3>
<p>Generally, dry flea eggs are not sticky, and thus they&rsquo;ll easily fall off from the host&rsquo;s fur and body even before you embark on grooming your pet.
Notably, about 58 percent of the
cat flea
eggs will have fallen off from the pets (cats and dogs) in 2 hours after they&rsquo;re laid. Over 3/4 of the flea eggs will have fallen off within 8 hours.
However, if the
pet&rsquo;s hair
is long or isn&rsquo;t well-groomed, some flea eggs will remain hidden in the thick fiber - mainly if the hair is dirty and dense.
Further, the
flea bites cause server irritation and scratching</p>
<ul>
<li>this process makes it easier for the dirt and eggs to fall off from the cats or dogs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-outdoors-and-indoor-environment">a. Outdoors and Indoor Environment</h4>
<p>The eggs that are dislodged from the host will fall into either the
outdoor and indoor
environment. Notably, these eggs will fall off where the pets will be sleeping or walking into.
Therefore, the movement of the host will influence the spaces where the eggs will be distributed. But most of them will be lying around the feeding, resting, and sleeping areas of the pets.</p>
<h4 id="bhumid-and-warm-micro-climate">b.�Humid and Warm Micro-climate</h4>
<p>Under unfavorable humidity and temperature, fleas eggs tend to desiccate very fast. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll mainly find viable and live eggs around areas with humid and warm micro-climates.
The RH should be anywhere above 50%, while the �Ambient temperature needs to be in the range of 11C to 39C to enable the eggs&rsquo; survival.</p>
<h3 id="3-carpeted-rooms">3. Carpeted Rooms</h3>
<p>The fleas will thus be clustered and hidden in the
carpet
. So, below are the areas where flea eggs lay their eggs in the house, apartment, or yard.
The carpet canopy will protect the
flea larvae
and eggs from insecticides, vacuuming, airflow, and sunlight while also holding food for the flea larvae.
The eggs will mainly incubate in upholstery, cushions, pet bedding, floor-board cracks, rugs, and carpeting. However, they may also incubate on wooden floors or carpeted areas.</p>
<h3 id="4-yard-and-lawns">4. Yard and Lawns</h3>
<p>It is critical to note that fleas rarely survive the harsh and sun-flooded outdoor spaces. Further, suitable places for the eggs to survive need shade and wind-shaded plus an RH of over 46%.
Flea eggs incubation zones in the yard include crawl spaces, gardens,
flower beds
, cat shelters, and dog houses. These places must be devoid of hot sun rays and excessive wind.</p>
<h2 id="flea-eggs-vs-flea-dirt">Flea Eggs vs. Flea Dirt</h2>
<p>Flea dirt is an outcome of significant flea infestations, making it confused for clustered flea eggs. However, flea dirt will crumble readily, and it is dark-colored.
You can
differentiate flea dirt by placing
the &ldquo;dirt drops&rdquo; on some white canvas, adding some water drops, and checking if it&rsquo;ll turn reddish - this is a sign of digested host blood.
So, compared to rec, moving flea eggs, it&rsquo;s easy to clean up flea dirt - simply
vacuuming the clothes
, bedding, and carpets. However, flea eggs would require insecticides like
foggers for fleas
.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-for-flea-eggs-to-hatch">How Long Does It Take for Flea Eggs to Hatch?</h2>
<p>Flea eggs will hatch in 1 week (from 2 days) to 2 weeks - with the right
environmental conditions are the correct
relative humidity and temperature. Flea eggs are roughly half of the whole adult flea population.
Notably, with high humidity and warmer temperatures, the flea eggs would hatch faster. They&rsquo;ll quickly progress to other
life stages
, including larvae, flea pupa, and adult fleas.
The eggs will be found in batches - on batch having 20 eggs clustered together. Notably, each adult female eggs will lay about 40 eggs each day to more than 1,200 eggs in its lifetime.
After hatching, the eggs grow into
larvae that&rsquo;ll eat flea
dirt. The larvae will develop their cocoon in 1-3 weeks so that it now grows to its pupae stage.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-kill-flea-eggs">How to Kill Flea Eggs</h2>
<h3 id="1-washing-or-laundering">1. Washing or Laundering</h3>
<p>Washing or laundering the pet&rsquo;s
bedding and blankets
using hot water helps exterminate the flea eggs. Further, you&rsquo;ll need to wash all the stuffed animals and pet toys.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to wash up the bedding and clothes since pets will drop their eggs there once the eggs shell becomes dry or when you use a
flea comb
.
Washing machines can hence assist in
killing the flea infestation
. However, I would also recommend using dawn dish soap plus the hot water.
Finally, kill the flea eggs by bathing the cat or dog with some
flea killing shampoo
plus warm water. The shampoo contains insecticides and Insect growth regulators that&rsquo;ll kill adult,
baby
, and flea eggs.</p>
<h3 id="2-vacuuming">2. Vacuuming</h3>
<p>Vacuuming will
kill flea eggs
and the larvae, too - equally by keeping your home tidy and clean. Also, you must vacuum under rugs and carpeted areas.
Vacuuming on the hidden areas allows a quicker sucking on flea cocoons, larvae, and eggs. Equally, flea frequently hates disruption by blowers or vibrations and hence will prevent flea growth.
Vacuuming will suck up the eggs in carpets and other fabrics. This will be incredibly helpful for indoor pets, spending most of their time on furniture, bed, or couch.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aKUWodbSQE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aKUWodbSQE</a></p>
<h3 id="3-grooming-with-flea-combs">3. Grooming with Flea Combs</h3>
<p>Flea combs for cats
or dogs will help eject the eggs (or their clusters) from the pet&rsquo;s fur. Therefore, ensure you run the combs thoroughly in the pet&rsquo;s fur without injuring their skin.
On the flip side,
flea combs
must not be used on the pet when they&rsquo;re in the yard - and if so, you&rsquo;ll need later to use an effective flea spray for the yard.
Insecticides must contain IGRs (Insect Growth Regulators) as they&rsquo;ll help cut short the reproduction of the bugs. This prevents the fleas in each stage from progressing to their next life cycle stage.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Flea eggs
live in some limited places
. Notably, the bugs will only move from the regular hosts when the host dies.
The eggs won&rsquo;t stick on the fur and hence will fall off within an hour. Vacuum, launder the pet bedding, use effective insect growth regulators.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-flea-eggs-look-like-on-a-cat">What Do Flea Eggs Look Like On A Cat?</h2>
<p>What do flea eggs look like to the human eye? Because cats are furry pets, you need to be keen when it comes to identifying fleas and their eggs. This is also applicable to dogs too.
These pets are the biggest carriers and breeders of fleas in our homes and any effort to control fleas is a big win for eliminating fleas in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your cat has pale fur, it may be hard to spot these flea eggs because of their translucent to a whitish color.</li>
<li>All other colors of fur make it easy to deal with fleas. Though they are small, it is easy to spot the grain inside the fur. Their shape varies from oval to round shape and looks inflated when healthy.
In some cases, you may also find some eggs with purple or dark brown color. This is common if you had earlier tried using some insecticides that inhibit growth.
In any case, if you had tried using pesticides and flea shampoos to eliminate this flea, the eggs look different. They may change color and also look deflated and dried out with no sign of life.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-spot-fleas-eggs-in-cats-and-dogs">How to Spot Fleas Eggs in Cats and Dogs</h2>
<p>Flea eggs on bed sheets - First, you can use a flea comb and a clean white piece of paper on your cat or dog.
The comb is for scouring through the fur while the white and dark-colored paper is for checking out the fleas and their eggs - you can
also use flea drops
.</p>
<ul>
<li>What I like about the flea comb is that it exposes and removes all the fleas and exposing them.</li>
<li>In the case of fleas, it is so easy to sense the danger and jump off.</li>
<li>For this to be effective and bear good results, you have to get the comb through to the skin and gently pull it up to remove them.
The comb is also good for separating the fur making it possible to see through into the skin and spot the eggs and fleas hiding under the fur.</li>
<li>It also helps you to see any flea bites on the pet&rsquo;s skin which is a clear indication of flea attack on your It is made with fine-tooth that makes it very effective to remove fleas, eggs, and any other dirt.</li>
<li>Secondly, you can check for flea eggs through flea dirt. If there are fleas, it is most definitely that there will also be eggs and dirt. You can find some of this dirt at the base of the fur.
Whether its through separating the fur or combing the dirt off, this will clearly indicate the presence of fleas and eggs on your furry pet.
What do flea eggs look like on furniture? This dirt looks similar to black specks which easily melt when exposed to sunlight. This is because this diet is made up of blood sucked from the hosts.</li>
<li>Thirdly, the presence of dandruff and dead skin on the fur could also mean there are flea and eggs on your cat.</li>
<li>Fleas are a major cause of dry skin, flakes, and dandruff. If this is the case with your cat or dog, you need to get the comb and check out for the fleas and their eggs.
Unlike eggs, dandruff and dead skin come in different shapes and sizes. Their colors may almost be similar to that of flea eggs have a defined shape. Related:

<h2 id="can-you-see-flea-eggs-on-a-cat">Can You See Flea Eggs On A Cat?</h2>
<p>There are particular places in your pet where fleas like to hide. These are also the same place that they lay their eggs and reproduce.</p>
<ul>
<li>The funny thing with fleas is that once they attach to one host, they hardly leave unless there are some external disturbances.</li>
<li>If your pet is a cat, fleas prefer to hide between the shoulders and also on the backside of the neck.</li>
<li>That way the cat is not able to disrupt them when grooming. If by chance they are disrupted, they jump off the host and return when it is safe for them. They have enough time to live on the host and reproduce till they die.
When the eggs are laid on the fur, they partially hang on the fur before they dry and fall off to the carpet, couch, and other surroundings. 70-80 % of eggs fall off from your pet and hatch on the ground before they can later look for a new host to continue with the other part of the flea life cycle.
What kills flea eggs on cats? When pests are grooming, most eggs fall. The itchiness from the bites also causes the eggs to fall.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-eggs-do-fleas-lay">How Many Eggs Do Fleas Lay?</h2>
<p>Where do fleas lay eggs? Fleas reproduce by laying eggs. When a female matures, it starts to lay eggs even if they are not fertilized. After mating, the female lays eggs that are fertile that hatch into fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>A female flea can lay an average of 20-30 eggs in a day and an average of about 180 eggs per week when all the conditions are right.</li>
<li>A flea has a life span of 60-100 days. With good feeding, fleas increase their fertility rate and can even lay up to 45 eggs in a day.
Their fertility is greatly enhanced by pet blood while human blood is less nutritious.� This means that if there are no pets at home, the fleas lay fewer eggs translating to a smaller population of fleas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>What do flea eggs look like on a cat? Flea eggs are small and shiny with their color ranging from translucent to a whitish color.</p>
<ul>
<li>These eggs are laid in the fur of the pets in your homes like cats and dogs. Fleaswill hide behind the neck, on the shoulders, and at the base of the tail to avoid disruption from the pets and humans.</li>
<li>Fleas are more fertile and lay more eggs when they suck blood from cats and dogs than when they suck human blood. They are capable of laying up to 45 eggs in a day and 180 eggs in a week.
Pets are a good host for fleas and their blood is very nutritious to increase the rate at which they lay eggs. If you have to
effectively control them
, better start with the pets-cats and dogs.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flea eggs are generally oval-shaped and off-white in color with their chorion soft shell - they will appear like some salt grain, sand, or dry skin. However, what do flea eggs look like on a dog?
<strong>In summary, Yes and NO - flea eggs are light in color and tiny and may thus prove difficult to see while on your dog with a naked eye. However, flea eggs are smooth and oval with a white color, which may hinder their visibility on the dog&rsquo;s fur just like while on some light-colored fabric.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-what-do-flea-eggs-look-like-on-a-dog">Details: What Do Flea Eggs Look Like on a Dog?</h2>
<p><a href="/posts/flea-eggs-vs-dandruff/">Fleas</a> will definitely hurt your dogs as they&rsquo;ll bite and suck blood from your pet. Fleas bites might also prove life-threatening.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite that <a href="/posts/how-long-do-flea-eggs-take-to-hatch/">flea</a> eggs will be challenging to detect on your dog&rsquo;s fur, you must know how to identify and control these bugs.</li>
<li>Proper and timely control of the flea eggs on or around your dog will helpdisrupt that elusive flea cycle- and thus you&rsquo;ll make the dog and other pets safe.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-check-specs-that-resemble-tiny-salt-and-dandruff">1. Check Specs that Resemble Tiny salt and dandruff</h3>
<p>To identify the fleas on your dogs, you should check for specs that resemble some tiny salt or dandruff. This must be especially be done during summer - during the warm climates as fleas will love the warmth.</p>
<ul>
<li>After every blood meal, the female fleas can lay about 4-8 eggs on your dog.
So, I recommend checking the dog&rsquo;s tail and stomach for some flea eggs. Also, if there are no flea eggs around these areas, check too in the pet&rsquo;s sleeping places.</li>
<li>Notably, for a dog bed that is dark, you&rsquo;ll get it easier to notice or see the flea eggs since they&rsquo;re light-colored -check if you can notice some tiny white specs.
In case the dog already has adult fleas distrubi9ng it, you&rsquo;ll notice that the pet will be scratching its skin and fur regularly. However, the coaching actions may contribute to further spreading of the flea eggs in other areas of the dog and the surrounding.</li>
<li>In addition, flea eggs tend to hatch within 2 weeks, and thus if your dog already has these creatures, you&rsquo;ll need to flea treat the house anddog too - maybe use flea shampoos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-use-a-flea-comb">2. Use a flea comb</h3>
<p>You can use some flea combs such as the
Safari Dog Flea Comb
will assist you to get between the dog&rsquo;s hair strands and thus remove those specs that could be flea eggs.
With the flea comb, you can easily remove and identify those flea feces (flea dirt) and be able to now differentiate them from flea eggs through the water-paper test.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a pet parent, you must be able to spot those flea eggs on the dog and its sleeping locations such as dog beds - you can use some magnifying glass to help you easily identify those flea eggs on the dog.
As noted above, ensure to inspect the dog&rsquo;s tail and stomach for flea eggs. But be sure to observe where the dog is scratching itself first.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="various-indications-on-dogs-for-flea-eggs">Various Indications on Dogs for Flea eggs</h2>
<p>While the adult flea eggs will be simple to identify, the flea eggs might prove more challenging to notice on your dog - they&rsquo;re microscopic measuring about a length of 0.5 mm.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may mistake the flea eggs for sand or dry skin - but alsoflea dirtcould point to the presence of adult fleas in the surrounding.
So, to differentiate fleas from other things, you may need to position the speck you found on some paper and use your magnifying glass to check if the object has that oval shape that characterizes flea eggs.
Flea dirt or flea feces can also help know if you have fleas and their eggs around your dog - so check for spots that appear like flea dirt.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, simply drop a few water drops into that paper with the speck and check for any color change to red- blood color since flea dirt is practically undigested blood from fleas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that flea larvae will appear like tiny maggots that&rsquo;ll grow to pupae with their cocoon - the pupae will occupy their cocoons for about 1 week annually.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-dogs-get-those-flea-eggs">How Do Dogs Get Those Flea Eggs?</h2>
<p>Dogs may pick fleas
from different locations including carpets and even from other pets. So, when the dog is effectively attacked by fleas it&rsquo;ll drop flea eggs and adult fleas as it moves on its trail.
Further, even when the dog is mainly indoors, you could still get some outdoor flea infestation - which implies that critical care is required.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can prevent fleas eggs from getting onto your dog by cutting that flea cycle early enough. So, if the aim is to remove flea eggs from your pet, ensure you control fleas early in time before they land on the dog.
Further, you&rsquo;ll notice that flea eggs will tend to hatch faster when the climate is warmer - and thus this is when you must input extra flea-control measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce the spread of fleas while reducing the risk of future infestations, ensure to keep home cleanliness - especially on the carpets of the dog&rsquo;s sleeping areas as they may host adult fleas on even the flea eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would recommend using pet vacuums in cleaning the home areas since these tools will suck up most of the flea eggs lying around.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-flea-eggs-from-your-dogs">How to Remove Flea Eggs From your Dogs</h2>
<p>To remove flea eggs from your dogs, you&rsquo;ll require flea-treatment methods such as flea shampoos, flea collars, or e
ven oral treatments such as Capstar.
Most of the flea-treatment methods available will equally kill those flea eggs or hinder them from hatching.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, you&rsquo;ll easily break the flea cycle to control the bugs from your dog and also the surroundings such as the house and carpet fibers.
Flea vacuuming will also remove flea eggs plus pupae, larvae, and adult fleas. Equally, you can use tick and flea sprays for the house to control flea eggs and ticks in the home and environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas will lay their eggs around the dog&rsquo;s hips and fur - but since the eggs are not sticky they&rsquo;ll
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-lay-eggs/">fall off from the pet into carpeting</a>
or the dog&rsquo;s resting areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea eggs will look like tiny specs on the dog&rsquo;s body - and they could be invisible in most cases since they&rsquo;re small-sized and will be seen using some microscope.</li>

      <description>What do flea larvae eat?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do flea <a href="/posts/what-do-flea-larvae-look-like/">larvae</a> eat?
<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/pest/flea.html">Flea larvae</a>
(35% of the flea population) are the second phase of the <a href="/posts/where-do-flea-larvae-live/">fleas</a>&rsquo; life cycle.
<strong>The short answer is</strong>
<em>flea larvae feed primarily on flea dirt, which is�(1) adult fleas&rsquo;�feces (or undigested blood) &amp; (2) conspecific (or nonviable) eggs - this is unlike other holometabolous larvae.�</em></p>
<h2 id="what-do-flea-larvae-eat">What Do Flea Larvae Eat?</h2>
<p>These tiny
baby fleas
will quickly feel running vacuum, footsteps, and vibrations, after which they&rsquo;ll act dead.
As hematophagous obligate epiphytes, flea larva doesnt require a host to survive or grow.</p>
<h3 id="1fecesfromadult-fleas">1.<strong>Feces</strong>from<strong>Adult Fleas��</strong></h3>
<p>Cat
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-look-like/">flea larvae</a>
have mandibles to chew solid organic matter but won&rsquo;t bite on either cats or dogs.
As highlighted above, flea larvae primarily feed on flea dirt  which is feces (or pre-digested and dried blood) from adult fleas.</p>
<p><strong>Undigested cat or dog blood�</strong>
The blood may have originated from various hosts such as cats and dogs or human beings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, a large quantity of the ingested bloodcomes out in feces undigested ready to give the flealarvae the required nutrients.</li>
<li>Flea larvae wont grow appropriately if they dont feed on flea dirt.
Despite that the
flea&rsquo;s eggs
are laid wet on the host&rsquo;s hair coat, they&rsquo;ll dry out, and over 70% of them will fall off in about 8 hours.
<strong>Hemoglobin with Protein and Iron�</strong>
The blood in flea dirt has a varied amount of hemoglobin essential for flea larvae&rsquo;s growth.</li>
<li>Specifically, Hemoglobin contains 85-89% proteins (from the host&rsquo;s blood protein) that aid larvae&rsquo;s evolution.
Further, Hemoglobin�intensifies�sclerotization and larvae growth due to its high 45-79% iron (from the host&rsquo;s blood iron) content.
<strong>Coils &amp;�spherules (Coils have 32% extra proteins)�</strong>
Feces in the coil shape have� 32% additional proteins than the spherule&rsquo;s form of flea feces.</li>
<li>However, the key to note is that coil-shaped flea feces are mainly ejected by fleas about two weeks old, while the spherule-shaped wastes are from the newly developed flea adults.
Therefore, younger flea larvae will favor the spherule-shaped feces since they are softer and smaller, while those in their elder days will take the coil-shaped feces since it has 32% additional proteins.
<strong>Females Fleas produce more Feces.</strong>
Adult fleas (particularly females) will suck blood about 13.6 �l of host blood, which is significantly higher than their male counterparts (that suck about 5 �l - 6.97 �l�of host blood).</li>
<li>Therefore, female fleas will generate more massive feces, which plays a more significant role in parenting and feeding their larvae.
Also, female Fleas feed on more blood to balance their body metabolism to allow higher egg production.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2non-viable-or-conspecific-flea-eggs">2.�Non-viable or Conspecific flea Eggs</h3>
<p>Besides, undigested host blood, fleas will also feed on non-viable (or conspecific) eggs.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12510898/">recent Hsu MHin recent research</a>concluded that�non-viable flea eggs contributed to the proper development of more than� 90% of the flea larvae into adults.</li>
<li>But who many such eggs would one larva require.
Scientific evidence varies with the larvae eating from 7 - 20 dead &amp; non-viable
flea eggs
per flea larvae.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-scavenging-andcannibalism"><strong>3. Scavenging and�Cannibalism�</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Scavenging�</strong>
Flea larvae�mainly live
in bedding or the nest where they turn around to scavenge for food in the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are worm-looking or legless with their mandibles that will be feeding on flea dirt.</li>
<li>Flea larvae will move around (up to 90 cm) in search of food.
But, they&rsquo;ll be within�16 cm around the flea nest if flea dirt is readily available in that habitat or hatching area. However, flea larvae have a higher probability of dying if they don&rsquo;t get food in three days.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cannibalistic Tendencies? Finally, flea larvae will also cannibalize (or eat one of their own) larvae that are either injured or weakly.
Further, some larva may also eat different�naked pupae or the larval�casings that have been shed.</p>

<p>It is often much more comfortable recognizing an adult
flea or even a flea egg
, but identifying flea larvae might be a little more complicated.
Before we begin to learn how to spot flea larvae, let&rsquo;s take a brief look at their
life cycle
. Read also;

.
<em>The Life Cycle of a Flea</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The first stage is the egg; these are small whitish objects around the size of a grain of salt and are notoriously difficult to notice.</li>
<li>Next comes the larvae stage, which we will look at in more depth throughout this article.</li>
<li>The third stage is the pupa when the flea enters into a cocoon and lies dormant for some time.</li>
<li>Finally, the adult flea emerges, and this is what most people are familiar with.
The Flea Larvae
If you think you might have spotted
flea larvae around your home
, there are certain things to look out for, such as;</li>
<li>A tiny worm-like creature is measuring between 2mm and 5mm in length.</li>
<li>The creature will have a whitish color to it.</li>
<li>It will be covered in tiny hairs, which are very light in color.
The flea larvae are known to feed on the flea dust, which is essentially the waste product left behind from the adult fleas, and so you might notice these creatures around areas where flea dust is present.

</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-flea-larvae-hide-out">Where Do Flea Larvae Hide Out?</h2>
<p>The most popular
place for the flea
larvae is near the host animal, so you will often find them either on the animal itself or in areas where the animal is regularly present, such as its bed.
To the naked eye, you might notice tiny little C-shaped objects-these are the flea larvae. If you can spot them at this stage of their development, you are much more likely to tackle the flea problem as a whole.
If you kill them at this stage, this will stop them from hiding in nooks and crannies during the pupa stage, which is known to be much more challenging to tackle.

First and foremost, fleas are transmitters of a wide spectrum of diseases to both humans and animals. Some of these include the following;
1.
<strong>Murine Typhus</strong>
This disease is mainly transmitted from rats and cats through
flea bites
. It is important to remember that when
fleas bite
, they also defecate simultaneously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea fecal matter contains a bacterium known as Rickettsia typhi, which is then transmitted from flea feces to the bite wound. Symptoms can range from fever and headaches to nausea and generalized body aches.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.
<strong>Mycoplasma haemofelis</strong>
is another common disease affecting the cat population that can be transmitted via flea bites.
When this bacteria enters your feline friend&rsquo;s blood system, it causes symptoms such as anemia and fever. The bacteria can also be transmitted to humans. People with suppressed immune systems are more prone to Mycoplasma haemofelis.
3.
<strong>Cat Scratch Disease</strong>
This disease, as the name suggests, mainly affects cats. It is caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae. The disease is so prevalent that it is believed to affect close to 40 percent of all cats during the course of their lives.
4.
<strong>Tapeworms</strong>
Tapeworms are among the most common parasitic worms that affect both pets and humans.
Usually, pets expose themselves to tapeworms by seamlessly swallowing an infected flea during their normal grooming exercise.
However, cats will easily get tapeworms by eating infected mice. These worms cause nausea, vomiting, and inflammation of the intestines.</p>
<h2 id="how-big-can-fleas-get">How Big Can Fleas Get?</h2>
<p>Adult flea measures between 1.5 and 3.2 mm long. Females are generally larger than males, especially around their abdomen. They can measure up to 2.5 mm long. If they can find a reliable host, female fleas will only take 48 hours to achieve their maximum size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, females will not reproduce before getting any blood meal. However, as soon as they get their first meal, they will only take between 36 and 48 hours to lay their first eggs.</li>
<li>Female fleas living on animals often lay their eggs right on the animals fur. They normally average 50 eggs per day. However, these eggs are not usually attached firmly to the animals body, so when the animal begins to move, they fall off, and thats where the flea menace begins.</li>
<li>Flea eggsare characterized by white color and are as small as sand grain. The eggs hatch very fast. With moderate weather conditions, they take about a week and a half. But if the conditions are more favorable such as in warm temperatures and high humidity, these eggs could hatch in days.
From the egg stage comes the larvae stage. The flea
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-look-like/">larva is usually white with pale hair</a>
and measures  inch in length. In most areas infested by fleas, the larvae usually constitute a third of the entire flea population.
They are relatively more difficult to spot. This is because, being photophobic, they tend to bury themselves underneath fabric and carpets. Flea larvae live on flea dirt and conspecific eggs for a period between 5 and 20 days before they can begin spinning their cocoons.
When that happens, you know they are ripe for the next stage in flea development  the pupae. Flea pupae resemble the adult in various ways, as this is the last stage of the insect&rsquo;s development.
The pupae will start white, then turn yellow and finally, brown. Flea pupae spend most of their time in their cocoons. Thats where they will stay until they detect a potential host&rsquo;s presence, then hop out and assume their new home, usually for the rest of their lives.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detect-fleas-in-your-home">Detect Fleas in Your Home</h2>
<p>In most cases,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-fleas-stay-on-humans/">fleas will settle for pets as opposed to humans</a>
as hosts. Well, there is really no difference because the agony experienced in either case is nearly the same. Flea-infested dogs will experience constant hair loss.
But even before you notice a few furs missing from your pets coat, you will surely not miss the little dark spots moving around in his fur.
Thats the surest sign your pet is infested. You might also want to look out for flea droppings that are black in color or their eggs that range between white and transparent. Also, check if the pet has reddened and irritating patches on its skin and excessively scratches or licks the skin.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-hide/">Fleas are not very difficult to spot</a>
, especially when they are fully grown. These jumping parasites are known to be frenzy feeders, so when they find a host in you, be prepared for endless days of itching and scratching.
You need not prepare for all that when you can
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef602">take preventive measures</a>
to keep these insects at bay.</p>

      <description>**What is flea dirt? **</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**What is flea dirt? **
Flea dirt (flea poop or flea frass) is the round black pepper or dandruff-looking specs made up of undigested and dried blood (dropped by fleas) after sucking blood from cats, dogs, or
humans-repellent-for-humans/)
.
You can find flea dirt when
combing
or running fingers against the grain of your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s hair.�Flea dirt is mainly found around your cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s
groin
area, the tails, or between their hind legs.
Ultimately, flea larvae will feed on the flea dirt -
<em>remember its blood anyway</em>
. But most fleas must be controlled from their hiding places in the
house
or the
yard
.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Fleas Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-is-flea-dirt-flea-dirts-color-shape-and-size">What Is Flea Dirt? Flea Dirt&rsquo;s Color, Shape, and Size</h2>
<p>Fleas will
poop either in their hiding place
or on cats and dogs. The dried-up blood (in the form of excreta) will produce oddly-shaped black, brown, or reddish specs - which we now referer to as flea dirt. Most homeowners confuse flea dirt (a collection of the flea poop) with black dandruff.
The flea dirt will look like (1)�Specks of grit or Ground pepper, (2) Black dandruff or Tiny black flakes, (3) Black or reddish specks.
<strong>Coils or�Spherules�</strong>
Flea poop mainly takes two shapes -�Coils or Spherules. First, coils will be about 0.84 mm in length - and thus, their largest mostly go lengthwise.
But, the Spherules will mainly grow into a round shape of about 0.08 mm to 0.24 mm. The flea adults will first take the form of spherules but turn into coils in their next two weeks.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-check-forflea-dirtflea-dirt-test">How to Check for�flea dirt/�flea dirt test?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to stop fleas and flea dirt on the belly of either your
cat or dog
. The stomach mainly has the fur or hair that is less thick and has the lightest shade of color. Also, you may find
flea dirt on your dog&rsquo;s
or cat&rsquo;s sleeping areas and bedding.
If you&rsquo;ve found flea dirt on your pest, then this could be a good indicator that you&rsquo;ve succeeded in
identifying the presence of fleas
. Further, the specs will turn your wet towel into spots of red or brown.</p>
<ol>
<li>But, you can
easily discern�flea
dirt by placing any of the black specs or clumps on a white and wet towel.</li>
<li>If the towel becomes reddish or brown, then that points to the presence of flea dirt - which, as noted earlier, is merely undigested blood in flea poop.</li>
<li>Also, check the pet&rsquo;s sleeping areas and bedding</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-worry-about-flea-dirt">Why worry about Flea Dirt?</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
Fleas will suck about 5 �l to 6.97 �l of blood each day to fill up their gut. However, female fleas will suck an event larger blood capacity (13.6 �l of blood).
Therefore, controlling flea dirt (and fleas too) would ensure that you reduce the amount of blood sucked from cats,
dogs, or human beings
.
<strong>2.</strong>
Flea dirt is &ldquo;dirty&rdquo;
on your pets and humans
as it leaves the feces to spread all over. For example,
fleas will excrete about�8-10 feces drops
in their 2-3 minutes of feeding.
Each day, an adult will drop feces with a weight of about 0.636-0.860 mg (with female females excreting more wastes - about 0.8473 mg).
<strong>3.</strong>
Fleas find it less energy-consuming to feed on the pet and human blood. Fleas are generally considered to be capillary (vessel ) feeders - which allows faster feeding.
Vessel feeding implies that the bugs will take advantage of the pet&rsquo;s blood pressure and thus take in the blood faster. Further, the bugs have�anticoagulant saliva and adequately�adapted mouthparts for better blood sucking - and losing a limited amount of energy.
**4. **
Flea dirt is not just waste for the flea but will also feed flea larvae and promote the development of a major flea infestation. But why? Flea dirt is
appropriate to flea larvae
as it requires them to spend a very minimal amount of energy.
It provides
flea larvae
with proteins and iron that are required for sclerotization and body development. Therefore, that&rsquo;s why females take more massive blood amounts to feed their larvae -with proteins, iron, and even vitamin B.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-flea-dirt">How to Get Rid of Flea Dirt?</h2>
<p>Well, besides
killing the fleas
, you&rsquo;d love to get rid of the flea dirt. The simple steps are
shampooing your dog
and cats to wash away the flea dirt.
But this is no guarantee that the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-come-from/">flea dist won&rsquo;t come</a>
back to haunt you.
But, the best way to rid your pets of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">this�flea dirt is by killing</a>
the fleas both in and around the house.
For your cats and dogs, I would recommend using various
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-puppies/">flea treatment</a>
methods such as�Capstar Flea Killer,�oral pills,�Frontline for the cats, or�Advantage II for your Dogs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using pesticide sprays, among other
<a href="https://extension.tennessee.edu/publications/Documents/PB1596.pdf">chemical flea control methods</a>
, is considered the best way to control <a href="/posts/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/">fleas</a> in every Yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>But other home remedies are equally effective for someone who would like to try a DIY approach.
So,
what kills fleas in the yard naturally?
So, check the below home remedies:
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best <a href="/posts/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/">Flea</a> Spray for Yard&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth">1. Diatomaceous earth</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous Earth (DE) for fleas
has silica shards that&rsquo;ll cut through the fleas&rsquo; waxy exoskeleton causing dehydration and eventual death of the bugs and the flea larvae.
Luckily, the Food-grade DE will be safe to use around human beings and animals. Avoid the DE that&rsquo;s used in charcoal filters or swimming pools.
The razor-sharp edges of the crushed Diatomaceous Earth will kill the fleas through dehydration. However, ensure to wear kitchen or garden gloves to avoid drying the hands.
The next step will be sprinkling DE on soft furniture, dog beds, and carpet. Allow DE to settle and do its magic for about three days.
Vacuum the surfaces thoroughly to kill fleas
, their eggs, and also larvae.</p>
<h3 id="2-dawn-dish-soap">2. Dawn Dish soap</h3>
<p>Dawn dish soap
is an excellent non-chemical solution to kill fleas. It damages the exoskeletons of fleas and thus kills them.
It&rsquo;ll break the waxy layer in the bug&rsquo;s respiratory system allowing water to enter and, therefore, suffocation.
Further, the dawn dish soap reduces the surface tension in water and thus causing the fleas to drown after sinking - and thus functions as a surfactant.</p>
<h3 id="3-fine-salt">3. Fine salt</h3>
<p>Next,
sea salt or household salt will kill fleas
if it is finely ground. You&rsquo;ll simply need to sprinkle the fine salt on the infested areas such as furniture or carpets - allow 12 to 48 hours.
Sprinkling the finely-ground salt and spraying some water over it makes a recipe for killing fleas. You can use this process in pens of poultry, hogs, or horses.
Also, as the saltwater continues drying, it&rsquo;ll absorb water and moisture from the surroundings and thus kill the bugs through desiccation.</p>
<h2 id="whether-it-uses-natural-or-chemical-ingredients">Whether it uses natural or chemical ingredients?</h2>
<p>Generally,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/">flea sprays for yards</a>
that contain chemicals are more effective. But there are a few good, non-toxic solutions available too.
Remember: always follow all instructions carefully. Not onl
y is this important for safety reasons, but it will also ensure you get the best results.
<em>Is it safe to use around your pets?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Always read the ingredi
ents, instructions, and warning labels carefully. Some sprays are made with natural ingredients and may be safe to use around your pets.
With other sprays, you&rsquo;ll need to remove your pet first before spraying and also wait until it dries completely before bringing pets back into the Yard.
Whether it&rsquo;s also effective before the adult stage:�For the best results, you want to use sprays that get to the source of the problem: flea eggs, larvae, and pupae.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-fleas-infest-my-yard">Can Fleas Infest My Yard?</h2>
<p>Definitely, Yes! Fleas will readily infest and multiply in your yards or lawns as they have a favorable environment. But you can effectively cut down on the number and frequency of flea attacks in the Yard by trimming vegetation, tree branches, and grass.
Trimming the excessive foliage will cut down on the available dark areas that you&rsquo;ll see in your garden or lawn. This significantly cuts down on the favorable shady conditions needed by fleas larvae to survive. In the short term, I recommend using chemical flea treatment as some may not exterminate the flea larvae and eggs.
Therefore, for long-term control of these bugs, you&rsquo;ll need to consider various
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef602">methods of bug control</a>
that are readily available.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-will-fleas-live-in-my-yard">How Long will Fleas Live in my Yard?</h2>
<p><a href="https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/insects/flea.html">Adult Fleas and different pests</a>
will mainly be lying on the underside, neck, and back of dogs and cats.
However, in cases of massive flea attacks, you may find the bugs lying or jumping around your bedroom, on the carpet, or the pet&rsquo;s bedding.
However, the fleas must be coming from another area before they land on your way to the house. This is the place where we consider the Yard as the breeding and feeding ground for the bugs.
The Yard provides a shady, humid, and moist environment that is favorable for the breeding and growth of fleas.
This will be even better if there are tall grasses or woodpiles lying around the Yard. Check the public parks and dog houses for evidence of flea infestations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These chemical sprays are more expensive but far more effective. On the flip side, these sprays are less toxic to adult fleas  so you&rsquo;ll either have to wait longer (8-10 days) before they die, or combine with other showers for faster results.</p>

?</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ve detailed the answer to this question. There are many flea-killing products like medicated drops, shampoos, repellents, and sprays - but they take time to work.
<strong>But what kills fleas on contact? Well, rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) will kill adult fleas on contact - it&rsquo;s best applied on flea-infested bedding or yard. Also,</strong>
<strong>�dawn dish soap kills flea eggs (via suffocation); thus, they won&rsquo;t reproduce, infest, or hatch.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>*NB: Large % of alcohol may be toxic to your pets and other animals - particularly if ingested but it may also be absorbed via the skin. *Related:Where do Fleas Come From?
If you&rsquo;re curious how fleas (and their eggs) look, well
see this article
that outlines the images and pictures of fleas.</li>
</ul>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Bets Fleas Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-what-kills-fleas-on-contact---rubbing-alcohol">Details: What Kills Fleas on Contact? - Rubbing alcohol?</h2>
<p>Isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) is popular as a disinfectant or germ-killing product.
But as a pet owner, you&rsquo;ll better love rubbing alcohol for its flea-killing ability - kills fleas on contact to finish that
flea infestation in your house - fast
.</p>
<p>But should I use rubbing alcohol on my pet? Well, plucking the fleas from the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s fur and dropping them into a rubbing alcohol bowl will kill the bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, washing the pet with some soapy hot water would still kill the fleas (and their eggs) but it won&rsquo;t endanger the health of your pet or the home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="danger1-rubbing-alcohol-isopropyl-alcohol-may-be-toxic-to-pets">Danger1: Rubbing alcohol (Isopropyl alcohol) May be Toxic to pets</h2>
<p>Avoid pouring the rubbing alcohol on the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s skin in an effort to examine the fleas as it can be toxic.�Isopropyl alcohol will be toxic to the pets if absorbed into their skins in large amounts.</p>
<p>However, it is critical to realize that some commercial flea killers also have a little percentage of alcohol. Therefore, over-spraying with such alcohol-
containing products may lead to pet poisoning too.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e83meDz9Kjc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e83meDz9Kjc</a>
In addition, ingesting the rubbing alcohol could also be toxic to the cat or dog. You&rsquo;ll not the poisoning within 1/2 an hour after ingesting - under5take emergency treatment to avoid fatal outcomes.
The
<a href="https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/top-10-animal-toxins-2017">ASPCA</a>
outlines that from 2016, accidental swallowing of cleaning products ranked top 10 among the pet toxins reported. But how would you know that the cat or dog (pet) ingested rubbing alcohol?</p>
<ul>
<li>Stumbling</li>
<li>Shaking</li>
<li>Shortness of Breath</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Disorientation
Therefore, if your pet has any or most of these signs, it&rsquo;s highly likely they&rsquo;ve ingested rubbing alcohol, and so you should contact your veterinarian or
<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control">APSCA</a>
for an emergency pet assessment and treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="danger-2-pure-rubbing-alcohol-is-very-flammable">Danger 2: Pure Rubbing Alcohol is Very flammable</h2>
<p>In its pure form, rubbing alcohol (or isopropyl) is not just toxic to pets but is
also very flammable - if there is an open fire flame, sparks, or heat. This is especially when sprayed on fabrics, pet bedding, and furnishings.
The fire hazard will increase if there are
open flames, fireplaces, incense burners, cigarettes, or candles around the pure isopropyl. The vapor and fumes from the
alcohol may reach the flame - but may dry fast too.
For example, some
home flea spra
y that contains isopropanol or isopropyl alcohol requires that you adhere to usage guidelines. Some of them include using the insecticide in a non-occupied space.</p>
<p>While rubbing alcohol will control fleas from your home. It&rsquo;s critical to act fast since fleas may transmit diseases and organisms like tapeworm and heartworm or typhus and plague to pets and humans.</p>
<h2 id="5-alternative-flea-treatment-methods">5 Alternative Flea-Treatment Methods?</h2>
<p>Therefore, if the rubbing alcohol isn&rsquo;t safe for the situation or it&rsquo;s not available for flea treatment, here are the 5 alternative methods to rid your pet or home of these bugs.</p>
<h3 id="method-1-wash-pets-with-flea-shampoo">Method 1: Wash Pets with Flea Shampoo</h3>
<p>First, most pet parents consider
dish soap for fleas control
as its readily available. Dawn dish soap suffocates (or drowns) the fleas by reducing the surface tension of water.
But flea shampoo for
dogs
or
cats
contains flea-killing ingredients like dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and permethrin or IGRs ( such as methoprene or pyriproxyfen) that&rsquo;ll be lethal to adults fleas, and eggs + larvae respectively.</p>
<p>Further, washing pets with dish soap may be less effective as you&rsquo;ll require massive pet scrubbing using a flea comb. Besides, you must read the flea-shampoo usage instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember don&rsquo;t use do shampoomust neverbe used in washing the cats while you must also avoid using a shampoo meant for adult pets on puppies and kittens.
So, ensure to talk to the pet veterinarian while considering using the flea-treatment products available online or on Amazon - use
<a href="https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/getting-rid-fleas-kittens-and-puppies">age-appropriate flea killers</a>
. Use the recommended treatment since over-treatment may be toxic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, combing the pet&rsquo;s hair or fur helps remove dead skin and adult fleas for better health. Comb keenly around the pet&rsquo;s backside, belly., and neck as these are areas that fleas gather and hide.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re combing the pets for fleas, place a bowl with soapy and warm water nearby where you&rsquo;ll be dipping the flea comb - this will remove and drown the bugs from the comb.</p>
<h3 id="method-2-install-flea-traps"><strong>Method 2: Install Flea Traps</strong></h3>
<p>You can also combine the flea shampoo, dish soap with a flea trap for better effectiveness. The traps may be
light or glue traps that use light or lovely scents to lure the fleas to be electrocuted or caught.
So, where should you put or position the flea trap? Well, place the flea trap near your bed or pet bed and bedding as this is where fleas frequent. But avoid placing flea traps near
flammable objects, drapery, or walls.
But, do they really work? How effective are the flea traps?�Well, flea traps will attract and help reduce massive flea
infestations but the fleas may still move
jump onto another host like dogs or cats
.
The veterinarians will recommend pet-appropriate flea killers for your cat or dog. For instance, some of the insecticides might not be appropriate (
<a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/fact-sheet-pet-owners-and-veterinarians-about-potential-adverse-events-associated-isoxazoline-flea">causing adverse effects</a>
) on the health of pregnant animals, or small
dogs.</p>
<p>Re-application within approved intervals will work great. Ensure to read the product instructions particularly of the isoxazoline class as they may cause neurological reactions and seizures. Some of the products in this class are
Revolution Plus,
Simparica,
Nexgard,
Credelio, and
Bravecto.
The products approved for
kittens and
puppies include
Lufenuron (killing eggs preventing their maturing) and the
Nitenpyram (great for little pets that&rsquo;s under 2 pounds). Using such age-appropriate pesticides will reduce the chances of damaging the pet&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<h2 id="what-kills-fleas-on-contact-in-yard">What Kills Fleas on Contact in Yard?</h2>
<h3 id="1-pyrethrin-based-and-igr-sprays">1. Pyrethrin-Based and IGR Sprays</h3>
<p>Chemical treatments that have pyrethrin will exterminate the adult fleas in your yard. Equally important is that you exterminate the
other flea stages
including the pupal, larval, and eggs of the fleas.</p>
<p>For this, I recommend using the IGRs (Insect growth regulators) like methoprene and pyriproxyfen as they&rsquo;ll exterminate the larval flea stages preventing these bugs from maturing into adults.</p>
<p>Therefore, combining the pyrethrin-based and IGR sprays to flea-treat your yard will help control the bugs in a fast way. For these efforts in the yard, the target also the doghouses as these are areas that the dogs and other pets will frequent.</p>
<p>Related:
Removing Fleas in the Carpet</p>
<h3 id="2-diatomaceous-earth">2. Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
<p>DE or Diatomaceous earth will naturally exterminate the yard fleas without using harmful toxins - fossilized algae (fine dust) referred to as diatoms.
Therefore, DE is safe for your pets and mammals as it&rsquo;s a natural pesticide for
flea treatment - a great alternative for rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>To use
diatomaceous earth in treating fleas in your yard, undertake the application during a calm day. But first, dampen the
plants, flowers, and grass
using some
garden hose to allow DE to stick.
But how long will the
diatomaceous earth
take to kill those fleas? Well, after getting contact with the DE, fleas tend to die within just 4 hours but I would say to leave the powder for 48 hours for better outcomes.</p>
<p>DE is a
non-toxic, effective, and safe flea killer that you can apply on your lawn but you must adhere to the outline precautions.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on the question of &ldquo;What Kills Fleas on Contact?&rdquo;, I recommend using rubbing alcohol, flea-shampoo, and IGR foggers to exterminate flea larvae, eggs, and adult fleas.</p>
<p>Further, washing pets with dish soap can help suffocate (or drown) some of the adult fleas while flea traps can assist in reducing the flea population. Alternative me5thods include using diatomaceous earth as it&rsquo;ll kill fleas in many stages.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<li>**So, in your home, you&rsquo;ll find flea larvae (and over�**80% of the fleas) growing incarpet fibers.</li>
<li><strong>You&rsquo;ll also get fleas larvae around the pet&rsquo;s resting areas - including around dog houses, holstered furniture, floorboard cracks, and pet bedding.�</strong>

<h2 id="requirements-for-the-flea-larvae-to-thrive">Requirements for the Flea Larvae to Thrive?</h2>
<p>The habitat requirements for the flea larvae to thrive - not that these won&rsquo;t be widespread for the flea larvae. These worm-like creatures will require some unique substrates to allow better hatching and maturing.
You&rsquo;ll find such appropriate habitats either outdoors or indoors - but from the eggs in the flea population - just a few will get to the adult stage.
<strong>1. Food</strong>
Flea larvae mainly from the cat fleas don&rsquo;t live like parasites on hosts such as cats and dogs - they&rsquo;re considered
free-living
. But they&rsquo;ll hunt for food in the surroundings with their random foraging habits.
But the worm-like bugs will largely feed on dried feces (waste) dropped by adult fleas. The larvae will also eat younger larvae and flea eggs - but they won&rsquo;t eat organic debris from hosts like cats.
On food-seeking, flea larvae will move around the areas that have food. For instance, they&rsquo;ll move to an area with food (about 90 cm) after they hatch in one without - beating starvation - which can happen in 3 days.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH2KblmOlFo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH2KblmOlFo</a>
<strong>2. Darkness</strong>
Dark areas will be lovely for the flea larvae to thrive. These creatures tend to die when sun-exposed or if they&rsquo;re kept in open locations - this is because there will be low RH and it&rsquo;s hot.
The worm-like creatures tend to escape sunlight by
burrowing deep into clutter, yard leaves
, (or sand), or moving to the shaded places - this is to avoid light.
<strong>3. Ambient Temperature</strong>
Consider the ambient temperatures where the flea larvae will be as it&rsquo;ll affect how the bugs will survive. Their survival will be diminished at temperatures over 95F (35C) and under 55.4F (13C).
Flea larvae will survive best at ambient temperatures of between 27C - 32C (89.6F) and 80.6F. On the extremes low, flea larvae will take around 15C with the ideal temperature being between 25C to 30C.
<strong>4. Relative Humidity</strong>
On relative humidity, flea larvae will die when it&rsquo;s relatively low as the dry conditions cause fast desiccation. So, I note that these bugs require 50% to 95% relative humidity (RH) to survive.
Ideally, fleas require a 75 to 92% RH for great survival but some researchers report that a 60% RH on the lower side can work while 80% RH is also suitable on the higher end.
For relative humidity that&rsquo;s more than 75%, the flea larvae will take in high amounts of water from the surroundings and thus they&rsquo;ll become healthier and larger.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the flea larvae won&rsquo;t live when the relative humidity goes above 95%. But the larvae will also survive at12% RH - dry air provided there is a moist substrate with 1% to 20% soil moisture. &rsquo;
<strong>5. Micro-climates and Micro-habitats</strong>
As noted earlier, fleas larvae will thrive best in protected micro-habitats such as dark and cool areas. This is due to the stable temperature and humidity (great micro-climates) that are moderate.
On larvae movement, the baby fleas are super mobile but lack appendages, feet, or legs - they move through squeezing and relaxing the skin muscles while they&rsquo;re on some dry area.
For distance, flea larvae will move under 15 centimeters to about 46 centimeters on the carpet once it has hatched. But when they move from eggs to growing into a cocoon, the larvae move around 20 centimeters.</li>
<li>But compared to the first instar, the second instar are able to move further - but either way, none of the flea larvae stages will go beyond the eclosion point.
On stimuli, flea larvae will move away from light - considered as negatively phototactic but will move with gravity - described as positively geotactic.
Further, the worm-like creatures are thigmotactic and positively hygrotactic meaning that they react positively to physical contact and high humidity respectively. They&rsquo;ll avoid pet and pedestrian traffic.

</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-flea-larvae-live">Where Do Flea Larvae Live?</h2>
<p><strong>1. Around the House�</strong>
Flea larvae will hide around the house in those protected areas especially under the rugs, and carpet fibers. They may also hide on hardwood floors - in the crevices and cracks.
You won&rsquo;t find the flea larvae on areas with linoleum floors or tiled floors. However, you may find baby bugs under furniture, upholstery, cushions, dirt-floor basements, rugs, and pet bedding.
Around the house, flea larvae will hide around dense shrubs and ground cover where the relative humidity is over 45% always. You&rsquo;ll find them under organic debris like�the soil, leaves, branches, grass.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, notice that the organisms won&rsquo;t go deeper than few millimeters or go deep in places that have soil moisture of more than 7 percent - they&rsquo;ll drown when the soil moisture is over 20 percent.
<strong>2. In the Yard</strong>
Other locations that the larvae will live include the yard or lawns. But the bugs rarely get suitable habitats in the outdoor spaces.
For example, recent research found that just about 4% of flea-infested homes have bugs in outdoor spaces. Such outdoor habits need to have wind protection, a shade, and high humidity for fleas to live comfortably.
So, in the outdoor spaces, you won&rsquo;t find flea larvae around the yard grass, and under trees since these areas have low RH (Relative Humidity).</li>
<li>But fleas and flea larvae will die most duringlate winterand survive best during early fall - times when they&rsquo;ll massively attack your pets.
If the
habitat allows
flea dirt
and eggs to exist, then flea larvae will also survive. The bits from fleas will trigger scratching and irritation - processes that dislodge the flea dirt and flea eggs.
Further, fleas won&rsquo;t survive in a location that has poor drainage, sprinklers, and heavy rainfall, as they&rsquo;ll eventually drown and also wash the flea dirt.
<strong>3. Carpeting�</strong>
Flea larvae (including over 50% of fleas) will burrow into the carpet fibers.</li>
<li>The carpet fibers will protect the bugs from the direct sunlight or desiccating air flow that may kill them.
Carpets that are made to accumulate some dirt at their base will build up food for the flea larvae. The location has moderate ambient temperature and relative humidity - great for fleas.
Further, the carpet offers a canopy to protect the bugs and their larvae from being
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-house-carpets/">exterminated by insecticides</a>
or also mechanical damage such as vacuuming.
The carpets will also hold some organic debris - keeping the larvae food safe and hidden. Also, the bugs tend to coil themselves when they notice disturbances.
<strong>4. Other Rooms</strong>
Further, you may find the immature flea larvae around the carpeted rooms, living rooms, and bedrooms - especially areas that your pets rest.
As they move around the rooms, they&rsquo;ll drop many eggs as they jump to the ground or off the furniture. Check the pet furniture and bedding - or near the human&rsquo;s bed.</li>
<li>Also, inspect outdoor areas that have under structures, animal burrows, crawl spaces, flower beds, pet shelters, and dog houses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on &lsquo;where do flea larvae live?&rsquo;, well, flea larvae will live near places with flea hosts (cats &amp; dogs), and flea dirt, and organic debris including carpets, pet bedding, and the house.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/">Fleas</a> are remarkably adaptable parasites that can survive in numerous environments beyond their preferred animal hosts. While they commonly live and feed on warm-blooded animals like dogs and cats, these persistent pests have evolved to thrive in various household settings. Understanding where fleas live is the first step toward effective control.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within homes, fleas frequently establish populations in carpets where the dense fibers provide ideal protection for eggs and developing larvae. The warm, humid environment created by foot traffic and indoor heating creates perfect breeding conditions.
Bedding and mattresses also serve as prime <a href="/posts/best-flea-carpet-powder/">flea</a> habitats, offering both warmth from
sleeping humans and pets
along with easy access to blood meals. Upholstered furniture similarly provides shelter and proximity to hosts, while clothing and shoes can transport fleas throughout the home. Even tiny cracks in flooring can harbor fleas between feedings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-fleas-come-from">Where do Fleas Come From?</h2>
<p>Fleas require very specific environmental conditions to survive and reproduce successfully. They thrive in humid, shaded locations and cannot tolerate direct sunlight, which quickly dehydrates and kills them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy rainfall can drown developing larvae, while extreme heat desiccates eggs and adults. These vulnerabilities explain why fleas seek protected microhabitats both indoors and outdoors.
Outdoor flea habitats include lawns, gardens, and soil, particularly in moist, shaded areas under shrubs or debris. Fleas can live in grass and dirt, especially where leaf litter or organic matter accumulates to protect developing pupae.</li>
<li>Wildlife and stray animals contribute significantly to outdoor flea populations, with rodents like mice and rats serving as particularly effective carriers that can introduce fleas into homes.
Even homes without pets can experience flea infestations through several routes. Used furniture or carpets may harbor flea eggs that hatch after being brought inside. Rodents entering homes often carry fleas with them. Human activity can transport fleas on shoes or clothing after walking through infested areas. In multi-unit housing, fleas may migrate from neighboring units or remain from previous tenants&rsquo; pets.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common question is:
<strong>&ldquo;Do fleas live in grass or dirt?&rdquo;</strong>
The answer is yesfleas can reside in outdoor areas like lawns, gardens, and soil, especially if the environment is moist and shaded.
It isnt uncommon to deal with a flea infestation even if you dont have pets. If you recently moved into an apartment, the previous owners pets couldve had them.
Fleas also live/travel on rodents, like mice. At this point, youre probably wondering.
<strong>Harmful Chemicals:�</strong>
Youll want to check if the flea control product has any harmful chemicals in it. You dont want your pets or kids ingesting any pesticides, as that can result in sickness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything with harmful chemicals should be thoroughly checked and understood before buying so that you know when and where to apply it.
<strong>Treatment vs. Prevention:�</strong>
Basically,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/does-the-dryer-kill-fleas/">killing fleas</a>
or keeping them away. Flea treatment is used to deal with a flea infestation that you already have. So this includes sprays and traps. Prevention will keep you from getting an infestation to begin with.</li>
<li>Ideally, if you do have a flea infestation, youll want to use a mixture of both: Treatment to kill the fleas and prevention to keep them from coming back.</li>
<li>**Duration:�**This is an important one because you dont want to guess how long a product will protect you.
While long duration on a product is generally good, sometimes those repellents usefulness fades over time. You want to stay on top of keeping up with your preventative measures once their duration has ended.
<strong>Indoors vs. Outdoors:�</strong>
This is very important when it comes to deciding which products to use. As a general rule of thumb, outdoor products will need to be handled more carefully, as they generally will include pesticides. Be more aware of how youre applying them and where.

</ul>
<p>Fleas are formidable pests, but with the
<strong>right knowledge and tools</strong>
, you can eliminate them for good. Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treat pets AND your home</strong> Fleas only spend part of their life on animals.</li>
<li><strong>Combine treatments</strong> Use sprays, preventatives, and cleaning for best results.</li>
<li><strong>Stay vigilant</strong> Reapply treatments as needed to prevent reinfestation.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where do fleas hide? - this article presents my quick and detailed response. The information will assist homeowners to
track down the fleas and exterminate them
.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In brief; fleas hide on clothes, in the yard (around pet&rsquo;s feeding places), on furniture, under leaf piles, in beds &amp; mattresses, cracks &amp; crevices, on the carpet, and on pets.�</strong>
But how will fleas get to jump *(up to 33 cm) onto pets and humans? Well, the bugs detect movement, vibrations, and breath to know when humans and pets are around.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-fleas-hide-top-7-fleas-hiding-spots">Where Do Fleas Hide? Top 7 Fleas&rsquo; Hiding Spots</h2>
<p>As those flea eggs begin to hatch and their larvae emerging, this flea stage will be about 35% of that
flea population in your household</p>
<ul>
<li>to remove those fleas from the home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-on-furniture---do-fleas-hide-on-furniture">1. On Furniture - Do fleas Hide on furniture?</h2>
<p>Adult fleas will lay roughly
500 eggs in total - with their reproduction cycle taking about 2 weeks while these immature stages may hide on
furniture and beds.</p>
<ul>
<li>But how long may the fleas survive on the couch or furniture? Well, when starved and without water (such as on the couch) it&rsquo;ll die with5 to 8 days.
When the dogs &amp; cats land on your room furniture (armchairs, and sofas) or bed, they may drop those fleas eggs with these locations allowing them to pupate easily.
So, as you seek to control these fleas, you&rsquo;ll need to inspect the bugs favourite hiding spots including the upholstered sofa, crevices &amp; cracks.</li>
<li>Therefore, flea steamers and vacuums will be an excellent solution for controlling the fleas - but ensure you get to those crevices &amp; cracks on the furniture.
Alternative methods to control the fleas on that furniture include using a repellent
scent -
water in a spray bottle +
cedar oil (5 drops) +
lavender oil (5 drops)
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-in-beds---do-fleas-hide-in-beds">2. In Beds - Do fleas Hide in Beds?</h2>
<p>Yes, fleas will hide and live in beds &amp; bedding - but how do they get there? Well, the fleas on the beds mainly climb up to take a single blood meal or get dropped by pets sleeping on your bed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainly you&rsquo;ll find the fleas on the mattress, pillowcases, and between sheets.</li>
<li>But with limited washing or bedding change (for long), the immature fleas could develop into adults and become a massive bug infestation.
The signs that your bed is infested with fleas include; finding oval-shaped, dark, and small spots on your light-coloured bedding plus your pets scratching frequently.
<strong>Removal</strong>
Fleas and their babies won&rsquo;t survive in intense heat - and thus machine-washing the bedding - including sheets, pillowcases, and blankets at extreme heat.</li>
<li>Vacuum clean these pieces -including on the carpets or rugsthat could have some eggs and adult fleas. Finally, dispose of that vacuum filters and bags - prevents re-infestation.
So, if your pets including dogs &amp; cats tend to jump on your/ or your kids&rsquo; bed, then you could have some
flea eggs or adult fleas that fall off onto the bed
and start maturing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-onpets--do-fleas-hide-inpets">3. OnPets- Do fleas Hide inPets?</h2>
<p>Thus, to effectively control the fleas and their larval stages, you&rsquo;ll require to check where these bugs hide and live.</p>
<ul>
<li>While the bugs are biting you, they&rsquo;ll inject saliva to prevent detection.</li>
<li>But the flea larvae are hatched blind - and they&rsquo;ll search for warm, dark while avoiding light - so they&rsquo;ll burrow on those bedding,furniture, and carpet.</li>
<li>The flea larvae will seek places that suitable foods like organic and faecal matter, these materials will be thefood for the flea larvae.
There are a number of flea species that&rsquo;ll land on various pests such as human fleas, cats (cat fleas), dogs (dog fleas), rabbits, and various mammals.</li>
<li>The adult fleas tend to dwell mainly on the pet&rsquo;s coat - they&rsquo;ll use their strong legs for gripping onto the animal&rsquo;s fur.</li>
<li>Therefore, the fleas will lurk around that food source (pet&rsquo;s blood) since they have lower reproduction and survival rates away from the animals.</li>
<li>Notable, female fleas will have lower egg production (of viable eggs) when they lack that blood supply from their favourite hosts.
<strong>Removal�</strong>
To remove the fleas from your pets, you can use a myriad of flea treatment methods depending on the growth stage of the bugs and the pet under consideration.</li>
<li>For, example, check this comprehensive guide on the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/">ultimate flea treatment for cats</a>.
Further, you must know that the adult flea population is usually under 10% and hence you must place to get rid of the other flea stages appropriately.</li>
<li>This will include killing the flea larvae and eggs to prevent further population growth.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll mainly find the fleas under the pet&rsquo;s tail, back of its neck, on the belly plus other areas with dense fur.
For the areas that you keep the pet food, you&rsquo;ll also require thorough flea-killing to prevent rapid growth and reproduction.</li>
<li>So, the fleas will have camped around the fleas&rsquo; feeding area with the aim of jumping onto your pets to suck that blood meal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-in-crevices--cracks--do-fleas-hide-increvices--cracks">3. In Crevices &amp; Cracks�- Do fleas Hide in�Crevices &amp; Cracks?</h2>
<p>Well, YES, fleas can hide in bedding, carpets, crevices, and cracks - they&rsquo;ll use debris, dirt, and saliva to spin their cocoon to allow them to be camouflaged easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fleas (<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-fleas-look-like/">including flea larvae and eggs</a>) may hide in<em>crevices</em>&amp; cracks of your upholstered sofa - to control these you&rsquo;d require to use a steamer or vacuum.</li>
<li>The fleas (<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-fleas-look-like/">including flea larvae and eggs</a>) may hide in<em>crevices</em>&amp; cracks of your upholstered sofa - to control these you&rsquo;d require to use a steamer or vacuum.
Further, the fleas can hide in crevices and cracks of those hardwood floors of various furniture and baseboards. Notably, various flea treatments like insecticides don&rsquo;t get deep down there.</li>
<li>Alternative flea-control techniques will include using steamers, vacuums, anddryers at high temperatureswill exterminate the bugs.
Further, fleas may live under your carpets &amp; rugs in both your apartment or house. They&rsquo;ll even lay their eggs, and if viable, they&rsquo;ll hatch into larvae.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas will be a major nuisance to you and other homeowners due to the
<a href="https://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/fleas">cat fleas</a>
being dark-coloured and having a tiny body size (4mm length) allowing them to hide in those odd locations.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a home- and pet owner, flea infestations are a real nuisance to
humans-live-on-humans/)
, cats, and dogs - including
baby fleas
. But where do fleas lay eggs? Knowing the hideouts will help us to easily break the flea&rsquo;s life cycle.
Definitely, of the 2,000 flea species,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_flea">dog fleas</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_flea">cat flea</a>
(Ctenocephalides felis) are the most common on furry mammals, birds, dogs, and cats.
<strong>Fleas lay their eggs on hosts such as cats (around the neck) or dogs (around their hips). The flea eggs are non-stick and thus will�fall off from the pet&rsquo;s fur. They&rsquo;ll accumulate�on the upholstery, between floorboards, carpets, and on the pet&rsquo;s bedding and will hatch into larvae. But to break the flea cycle, you should use spot-on or oral treatments.�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>But what do flea eggs look like? Flea eggs are tiny oval-shaped specs (size of rice or salt grain) measuring ~ 0.5 mm. They are off-white,translucent, or bright white -unlike dandruff that&rsquo;s irregular-shaped.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Vacuuming fleas with bagless vacuums&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-where-do-fleas-lay-eggs">Details: Where Do Fleas Lay Eggs?</h2>
<p>Cats fleas will adopt and live long on their hosts such as dogs and cats - and they
rarely leave
unless the host dies. Otherwise, they&rsquo;ll eat, mate and finally lay their eggs on the dogs and cats - the
fleas will live a few months without a host
.
The fleas will hide on the cat&rsquo;s collar, neck, hindquarters, and
dorsal area
. When freshly laid, the fleas&rsquo; eggs will be sticky, wet, and smooth with that oval (rounded) shape but will dry fast as fall off the host.</p>
<h3 id="1-pet"><strong>1. Pet&rsquo;s and their bedding�</strong></h3>
<p>Flea treatments will kill flea larvae, immature flea, and adult fleas in the pet&rsquo;s environment. Flea-treat all the pets and small mammals including guinea pigs, hamsters, pet rabbits that are in your household.
But, flea dirt will appear like black pepper flecks - they&rsquo;re actually flea waste - they&rsquo;ll clump readily and stick on the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s skin or fur. Also, you&rsquo;ll get flea eggs around their main food source - that&rsquo;s your cat and dog.</p>
<p>Science tells us that fleas don&rsquo;t reproduce or produce eggs from consuming a human blood diet. Therefore, the bugs may bite humans but still won&rsquo;t hide in your hair - but you may find them in the pet&rsquo;s fur within 36 - 48 hours.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that flea eggs will be anything similar to the ping pong balls, they&rsquo;ll roll between floorboards, carpets, and also on the cat&rsquo;s or dog&rsquo;s fur - they&rsquo;ll hide in these locations up to when they hatch.</p>
<ul>
<li>But will flea eggs fall off fast? Well, this will depend on the length of the pet&rsquo;s fur and the activity status (severity) of that infestation. However, most flea eggs tend to fall off the pet&rsquo;s fur in just a few days.
With flea bites, your pet will itch or scratch the body naturally and thus the flea eggs will be shed faster. Normally, flea eggs will be lying around the areas that your pet rests or sleeps - this includes the pet&rsquo;s bed or on the carpets.</li>
<li>During the warmer weather, the pets will move into the backwoods and backyards - as do the fleas. This weather will make the flea eggs (and larvae) hatch or molt to the next stage (in just weeks) - which makes controlling challenging.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6vMqrhltxQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6vMqrhltxQ</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-rugs-and-carpets"><strong>2. Rugs and Carpets�</strong></h3>
<p>First, yes flea eggs can be found on rugs,
floorboard gaps,
carpet fibers, and
bedding. These eggs will be roughly 0.5 mm in length (quite tiny), white and oval - thus they might be difficult to see when on rough materials and surfaces.
But either way, check for signs of flea eggs on your rugs and carpeting. The tiny oval objects will get deep into the fibers of the carpeting since they&rsquo;re small. Female fleas may equally lay the eggs directly on the carpets -which may also hatch while there.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, to notice the flea eggs, simply run your hand on the rug or carpet fibers checking for adult fleas or their eggs.
However, if it&rsquo;s challenging to notice any of the bugs, try the white socks trick - wear white socks and round around the carpeted places and shuffle your feet.
The adult fleas, if there are any, tend to hop into the socks. Feet shuffling over the carpeted areas will entice and attract the fleas to jump onto the socks.</li>
<li>The heat generated from feet shuffling tends to attract the bugs. To identify the fleas take a flashlight and point it to the white socks. Check for some brown or black specks on the white socks - these are flea or flea eggs.
Also, check for flea dirt - which is the fecal matter from fleas looking like black pepper or dirt. So, check the carpeting or floor - or the pet&rsquo;s sleeping areas. Scan the crates, pet bedding for flea dirt and fleas.
Examine the upholstered furniture and couches where your pets tend to love and so will drop their fecal matter.
You may examine if the specs you find are really flea dirt by dropping them into some water basin - see if they turn reddish (this is confirmatory).

<h3 id="3-lawn-and-yard">**3. Lawn and **Yard</h3>
<p>Fleas and their eggs will effectively thrive in humid and warm weather - and under these conditions will lay about 50 eggs daily. Thus, the yard and lawn will play an excellent breeding area for fleas and their babies - they&rsquo;ll hitch your pets and
also humans
.
Notably, flea &amp; flea eggs won&rsquo;t be a small problem as each female of these bugs will lay roughly 50 eggs daily - and these bugs can live even for 2 years with the correct conditions - after hatching they&rsquo;ll bite to cause rashes and sores.
The 1/6-inch long, wingless, reddish-brown, and tiny fleas could be difficult to spot on the yard or lawn - you can also use the white socks trick - wear them and move around the lawn and areas that pets rest or sleep.
To treat the yard or lawn for fleas by using Scotts Turf Builder for grass control that tends to hide and feed the bugs. Use �Ortho Home Defense to create a flea barrier in the yard or around the house</p>
<ul>
<li>while cutting plantings, brush, and leaf litter to 6 to 18 inches.</li>
<li>So mow the yard or yard appropriate for the grass type - notably very long grass will provide a hiding place for fleas. But ensure it&rsquo;s not overly short ( (under 2 inches) to avoid attractingother bugs like ants and spiders.
Remove all the thatch where fleas, larvae, and eggs may finding hiding spaces. Ensure to maintain a thatch layer of just under 1/2 inch.</li>
<li>Further, don&rsquo;t over-water your yard or lawns - you&rsquo;ll require just about 1-inch of water each week on the yard - including from rainfall or irrigation</li>
<li>Next, mulch your porch, deck, and hedge using cedar as its smell will tend to repel the fleas - creating a barrier on your patios and various play areas.
Undertake shrub and tree pruning to allow the sun and light to shine on most areas of the yard. Allow more light by pruning the thick canopies and low branches. Also, clear the yard clutter and evict the wildlife including skunks, feral cats, and
squirrels
.
Further, treat your flea-infested pets using medication and
flea shampoo (like for cats)</li>
<li>consult the pet vet. Remove the trash bin and garbage bag - plus vacuum the furniture and carpeting - finally remove that vacuum bag.</li>
<li>You cancontrol the bugs and their eggsin your yard using Nematodes (microscopic worms) as they&rsquo;ll eat the flea larvae and eggs. But the worms won&rsquo;t harm your gardens, grass, pets, and humans - you can buy the Nematodes from various stores.

<h2 id="how-fast-do-the-eggs-fall">How Fast do the Eggs Fall</h2>
<p>Researchers have reported that over half of the flea eggs will fall off from the pet in just 2 hours after getting laid. Over 65-percent of the eggs will have dropped from the cat in 4 hours.
About 70-percent of the flea eggs will be dislodged from the pet&rsquo;s fur within 8 hours. Only under 3-percent of the flea eggs will be left on the host with over 27-percent eaten while grooming.
Thus, the rate of falling of the flea eggs will vary on the movement and grooming habits of the pets plus their fur length. With a dirty and dense hair coat, the eggs may be lodged with the fur.
The fleas will bite and inject their saliva into the wounds - which
results in some irritation
, and scratching and this may enhance the dropping (or dislodging) of flea eggs.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-eggs-fall">Where Do Eggs Fall?</h2>
<p>Once dislodged, the flea eggs will drop off in areas like outdoors or indoors. They&rsquo;ll drop on places that the bug hosts such as dogs and cats will access.
The fleas&rsquo; host behavior and movement patterns will determine how the eggs will be dispersed. The eggs will be dispersed mainly in the home and places that pets feed, rest, or sleep.
The eggs will be deposited mainly around the resting and sleeping areas since
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-flea-eggs-take-to-hatch/">egg shedding and oviposition</a>
is high
during night hours
as the dogs &amp; cats rest.
Further, the cats will be grooming, resting, and sleeping themselves for a long time� - around 13-percent during the day. But they&rsquo;ll share the sleeping and resting areas with different cats.</p>
<ul>
<li>But flea larvae won&rsquo;t travel far from the bug&rsquo;s laying location and pet&rsquo;s sleeping area - and they&rsquo;ll die when<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/">exposed to high or lower temperatures</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appropriate-habitats-for-flea-eggs">Appropriate Habitats for Flea Eggs</h2>
<p>The best habitat conditions for flea eggs to exist and develop effectively - and thus the incubation areas for eggs won&rsquo;t be in many areas of the house.</p>
<h3 id="1-temperature-and-humidity">1. Temperature and Humidity</h3>
<p>Fleas will die from desiccation - but to hatch and develop effectively, the eggs need to be on substrates that have correct humidity and warmth.</p>
<ul>
<li>The appropriate temperature for the flea eggs is between 10 - 38C (50.4 - 100.4F) and relative humidity of between 50% to 92% RH - notably, they&rsquo;ll desiccate at under 50% RH.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-feeding-on-flea-dirt-fecal-blood">2. Feeding on Flea Dirt (Fecal Blood)</h3>
<p>Fleas will survive effectively when they take flea dirt - which is fecal blood for adult fleas. With no food (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-flea-dirt/">blood or flea dirt</a>
), the flea larvae will die in just 3 after hatching.</p>
<ul>
<li>The basic food source for fleas is flea dirt - the adult fleas will equally die.
Thus the flea eggs will develop fully once they are in the right habitat plus there must be enough fecal blood - and this is because the fecal blood doesn&rsquo;t fall easily as the flea eggs. It&rsquo;ll fall off in the pet-grooming times and tend to mainly fall around areas that the pets rest and sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Compared to flea eggs from
other bugs, flea eggs will hatch within 1 - 12 days to become larvae - they&rsquo;ll fall off from the flea host (dog or cat) to the ground as they&rsquo;re not sticky.
So,�where do fleas lay eggs? Well, check the carpeted areas, indoor &amp; outdoor spaces that pets (dogs &amp; cats) rest and sleep.</p>

<p>Where do fleas live?�Often-times,
fleas
will cause a scare in your home and
yard - but you can control these bugs
. Equally important is that fleas will be challenging to track them down and maintain too.
<em>In Summary, fleas are mainly ectoparasites &amp; live on pet hosts where they&rsquo;ll suck blood, fleas mate, and ultimately lay eggs. They&rsquo;ll live on the pet hosts and wildlife up-to when they&rsquo;re brushed off, fall off or die.�</em>

<h2 id="1-where-do-fleas-live-on-dogs-and-cats">1. Where Do Fleas Live on Dogs and Cats?</h2>
<p>Fleas (both
<em>Ctenocephalides canis and Ctenocephalides felis</em>
) are parasitic bugs that mainly live, feed, and mate off dogs and cats - besides humans when their favorite hosts are not available.
Other hosting wildlife include animals like badgers, opossums, weasels, and raccoons, and moles - check these
durable mole traps
. Further, rabbit fleas and rat fleas may spread bubonic plague.
Fleas will live
on dogs and cats - particularly on their belly, neck, and lower back regions - the locations will be hard to reach during self-grooming and thus a haven for the bugs.
So, for dogs and cats, that&rsquo;s flea-infested, you&rsquo;ll need to groom them regularly and thoroughly
using electric flea combs
or just the regular
flea combs for cats
.
Fleas will also live in dogs and cat&rsquo;s houses, and thus, you&rsquo;ll require to flea treat the pet&rsquo;s home besides treating the pet using -
best flea treatment for cats
.
Further, treat the lawn and other surroundings to ensure that the bugs won&rsquo;t reproduce more outdoor spaces. Read also,

<h2 id="2-where-dofleas-live-in-the-house">2. Where DoFleas Live in the House?</h2>
<p>Adult fleas will live and flourish in moist, warm, and dark areas of your house - also read,
diatomaceous earth for fleas on cats
.
However, flea eggs lack the glue-like substance found and hence will fall off on the house floor,

<ul>
<li>here&rsquo;re the best
flea powders for carpet
.
<strong>Bed</strong></li>
<li>Can
fleas live
in the bed? Yes, fleas will live under the comfort of the warm environment created in the bed by sheets and duvets. Further, adult female fleas may lay eggs inside the mattress and deposit some
flea dirt
that&rsquo;ll be
eaten by flea larvae
.
Only the larval and
eggs stages of the fleas
will be living in the house. So,
vacuum thoroughly to kill fleas
and wash the pet&rsquo;s bedding with hot water to prevent the eggs and larvae from growing further.
Beds will provide an excellent
hiding space for fleas
. Most pet owners may not adequately take care of their beds, but you can
purchase the best dog beds</li>
<li>as this will allow the dog to sleep on their own.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to clean the pet bedding for the pest-infested pets, plus check the crevices and cracks that&rsquo;ll be around your house.

<h2 id="3-where-do-fleaslive-in-carpet">3. Where Do FleasLive in Carpet?</h2>
<p><strong>Carpet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How long will
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-on-clothes/">fleas live</a>
on the carpet? Once
flea eggs are laid.
, they&rsquo;ll fall onto the carpet. With the right humidity (high is best) - the eggs will hatch within two days - 2 weeks.
Cats and
dogs are the ways that fleas
will move around the house and yard.
Fleas and their eggs will drop
on the rugs or carpets&rsquo; fibers - where they&rsquo;ll hide, feed, and grow.
Once the eggs hatch, you&rsquo;ll notice that the flea larvae are blind and will hide into the darker and deeper sides of the furniture or carpet - hence you&rsquo;ll require regular house inspection and cleaning.
The fleas hiding in the carpet fibers will eat food debris plus other organic matter. The flea pupae will emerge in the next 1-3 weeks - with the unfavorable condition, and thee pupae will remain in their cocoons even up to several years.
But flea pupae are enclosed in cocoons and have a glue-like substance allowing them to stick on walls, furniture, or carpet. Thus, cocoons won&rsquo;t be removed by vacuuming or sweeping.
Also,
flea pupae will only come
out of their cocoons when they sense high amounts of carbon dioxide, vibrations, or body heat - these alert them that their potential host (cats or dogs) is near.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-where-fleas-live-in-yard">4. Where Fleas Live in Yard?</h2>
<p><em>Fleas originate from wildlife and hide in the protected and shady outdoors spaces - particularly under leaf and grass piles - leaving flea eggs and flea larvae. Adult fleas will jump onto humans and pets to get into the indoor spaces.�</em>
Do fleas live in the grass? The
bugs will hide and live
in tall grass or some wood piles in your yard. So, ensure you
flea treat the yard using the spray
.
So, you&rsquo;ll mainly find fleas hiding in the dark, moist, and humid areas of the yard as they suck human blood or eat other organic waste.
These yard areas will include moist regions, outdoor furniture (check rugs and cushions), garage or shed, food debris, woodpiles, weeds -
effective weed killers
and shrubs, and tall grass.</p>
<h2 id="5-can-fleas-live-on-humans"><strong>5. Can Fleas Live On Humans?�</strong></h2>
<p>The regular
cat and dog fleas prefer pets
(cats or dogs) since they&rsquo;ll hide in their furry coat. Compared to pets,
human bodies are hairless, and hence fleas
won&rsquo;t attach and hide quickly.
Regardless of a massive flea infestation in the home, it&rsquo;s possible to avoid
flea bites
by controlling or killing adults, pupae, larvae, and flea eggs.
Flea may live on the pet&rsquo;s body for days since they provide a suitable blood meal. But
fleas will bite the human&rsquo;s
lower extremities, particularly the ankles and ankles - bites may lead to allergies.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s clear that
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-fleas-live-in-human-hair/">fleas will live</a>
on pet hosts, in the house (carpet or mattress) and the yard, besides wildlife. I recommend you use the integrated flea
control method
.
This will include using yard sprays,
flea foggers
, carpet powders,
in-home sprays
,
flea collars for cats
, and topical flea drops, plus other
home remedies for fleas

      <description>The legs of fleas have strong claws and proboscis (tiny needles) that&amp;#39;ll help the pest bite the skin of the hosts such as cats,</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legs of <a href="/posts/can-fleas-bite-through-clothes/">fleas</a> have strong claws and proboscis (tiny needles) that&rsquo;ll help the pest bite the skin of the hosts such as cats,
dogs
, and even humans.
**Why do <a href="/posts/do-fleas-bite-humans/">flea</a> bites itch? Well, fleas will bite humans and pets where they&rsquo;ll secrete some saliva into the blood - which the host&rsquo;s body and blood take as an allergen. **
<strong>The immune system will send histamine to counter the allergen (flea saliva) and thus the chemical triggers itching and swelling.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-why-do-flea-bites-itch">Details: Why Do Flea Bites Itch?</h2>
<p>The flea saliva will be taken like an allergen triggering your immune systems to release histamine that will irritate your skin and trigger itching.
But how will flea bites appear on humans? You&rsquo;ll notice the flea bites are discolored, small bumps that could be in the form of a cluster or line.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flea bites will likely be on the human ankles, calves, and feet. So, rarely will the flea bites be found above the human knees unless the person is lying down or sitting down.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="itching--scratching---how-else-can-you-identify-flea-bites">Itching &amp; Scratching - How Else Can you Identify Flea bites</h2>
<p>Fleas bites are unlike other insect bites - I&rsquo;ve noted above that they&rsquo;ll be discolored (small) bumps on your skin that&rsquo;ll be itchy, and may trigger scratching.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, you may see come discolored rings that could develop around the flea bite area.</li>
<li>However, flea bites won&rsquo;t cause swelling like other insects bites such as by mosquitoes.
Also, the location and pattern of the flea bites will be unique compared to other insects - the flea bites appear in a cluster or on some straight line.</li>
<li>On location, flea bites largely appear on the human ankles, calves, and feet - below your knees.
Thus, I would recommend you inspect for flea on the pets including cats &amp; dogs. Check if the pers are restless or scratching - this could be indicators of flea bites.

</ul>
<h2 id="flea-bites-wont-stop-itching-what-should-i-do">Flea Bites Won&rsquo;t Stop itching; What Should I do?</h2>
<p>First, I must say that it isn&rsquo;t advisable to see those flea bite areas. This could lead to skin breakage and may trigger further infection.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, if you break the skin, I advise you to clean the area using some soap &amp; water and finally cover the bite area using a bandage.
Further, a doctor can help in easing the pain or itching caused by flea bites.</li>
<li>Despite that flea bites will raim just a number of days. You may use home remedies and OTC products to help in stopping the itching.
Although some DIY fleabites treatment options could work well, you should counsel the healthcare professionals prior to using such products to avoid allergic reactions.
<strong>1. Hydrocortisone</strong></li>
<li>The corticosteroid Hydrocortisone when mixed with some anesthetic will help relieve the pain from flea bites.</li>
<li>Also, the Hydrocortisone combination will relieve the swelling. I advise you to apply that combination on the flea bite like an ointment or cream.
<strong>2. Antihistamines</strong></li>
<li>An antihistamine, as noted earlier, will help ease the pain caused by flea bites.</li>
<li>The immune systems will release the histamine chemical (which causes itching) once it reaches an allergen - the flea saliva is taken like an allergen by the immune system.</li>
<li>Thus, the antihistamine drug or pill will counter the histamine (once applied on the flea bite).
<strong>3. Chamomile tea</strong></li>
<li>Using some chamomile flowers that are dried will have flavonoids and terpenoids that will work as a natural antihistamine or antioxidant.</li>
<li>Further, a DIY technique that you can use is to add the tea bag (with chamomile) into some water.</li>
<li>Allow that teabag to settle for about 20 minutes up to the right color (gold-brown).</li>
<li>Next, get that teabag out of the water and squeeze all the water from that teabag.</li>
<li>Finally, press that tea bag onto the flea bite allowing about 10 minutes before wiping the flea bite clean.
<strong>3. Ice</strong></li>
<li>Presing ice packs on a flea bite (or any skin locations) will cut the blood volume that flows to that location. This reduced blood will reduce itchiness, swelling, inflammation, and pain.</li>
<li>You should cover that ice pack with a light towel before placing it on the flea bite for about 10 minutes - this will provide excellent relief.
Use the ice pack or some towel-wrapped frozen vegetables wrapped to help ease the skin numbness, relieve swelling, and soothe your skin irritation.
<strong>4. Oatmeal -�</strong>
Oat flakes and oatmeal have long been used for soothing itching, rashes, and skin irritation - and it&rsquo;ll be helpful with flea bites.</li>
<li>You can use a number of products that contact oat flakes or oatmeal; these include products like shampoo, body wash, and lotion.
Otherwise, for oatmeal, mix some warm water with 1-2 tablespoons of the oatmeal before soaking your lower legs or feet in that solution for about fifteen minutes.</li>
<li>Also, you may grind the oatmeal into some colloidal oatmeal (fine powder) using some appropriate food processor such as a blender.</li>
<li>Then create some sticky (thick) oatmeal mixed with water and the colloidal oatmeal.</li>
<li>Finally, cover the flea bites using the colloidal oatmeal mixture - and allow about ten minutes before wiping off that oatmeal mixture from the flea bite.
<strong>5. Aloe vera</strong>
-�Aloe vera is widely used as a DIY treatment for sunburns but it&rsquo;s also an important remedy to treat flea bites.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll simply apply the alow vera gel onto the flea bite to ease the discomfort, itchiness, and redness.
The succulent Aloe vera gel has salicylic acid - this is what will reduce pain and itchiness when applied on the flea bite.
<strong>6.�Honey</strong></li>
<li>Honey is also a popular product in DIY remedies and it has antimicrobial properties that will help ease pain and itching.</li>
<li>The catalase enzyme in the hone will help ease the pain and skin inflammation.
I recommend using unprocessed honey onto the flea bite - and you may put some bandage on the flea bite as not doing it may cause messy stickiness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preventing-fleas-bites">Preventing Fleas Bites</h2>
<p>You can stop flea bites on
both humans and pets
using a combination of techniques. But first, you may examine the fur on your pet&rsquo;s belly, back, neck, and ears.
<strong>1. Vacuum</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flea vacuuming your space will help clean the fabric furniture, rugs, and carpets besides removing the favorable conditions for the living of fleas.</li>
<li>However, don&rsquo;t hesitate to seal &amp; dispose of that dirty vacuum bag as this could be carrying manyflea eggs, adult flea, or even flea larvae.
<strong>2. Wash Pet bedding</strong></li>
<li>Next, you can prevent flea bites by cleaning the spaces that act as their rearing ground - this includes the pet bedding.</li>
<li>Thus, the fleas will be cleaned from the bed bedding and thus won&rsquo;t bite pets or get to you or other pets that they can bite.</li>
<li>Ensure that the pet bedding is adequately cleaned and dried using the heat setting being at its highest - disposing of the allowable temperature for the fabric.
**3. Flea Shampoo **</li>
<li>Further, you can flea comb your pets including brushing the fleas&rsquo; fur as this helps remove fleas.</li>
<li>Also, use someflea shampoo on your petsbut avoid the mouth &amp; eyes.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fleas will be attracted to your spaces (and bite you or your pets) by a number of factors such as vibrations, movement, breathing (CO2 - carbon dioxide), and body heat.</p>
