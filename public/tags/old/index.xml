      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The allure of a forgotten packet of seeds, tucked away from a previous <a href="/posts/how-to-quickly-space-seeds-in-your-garden/">gardening</a> season, can be strong. Perhaps it&rsquo;s a cherished heirloom variety, a particularly successful crop from years past, or simply a desire to avoid waste. While the promise of new life lies dormant within each tiny seed, time is often an unforgiving enemy. As seeds age, their viability � their ability to germinate and grow into healthy plants � gradually diminishes. Planting <a href="/posts/best-4-wheeler-for-12-year-old/">old</a>, non-viable seeds can lead to wasted effort, disappointing germination rates, and ultimately, unproductive garden beds.</p>
<p>So, how do you distinguish between a still-vibrant seed and one that has lost its spark? The answer lies in a combination of understanding the factors that affect seed longevity and performing simple tests to gauge their viability. This guide will walk you through practical methods, from basic visual inspections to the more reliable germination test, empowering you to make informed decisions about your seed stash. By learning how to assess your old seeds, you can save time, maximize your planting success, and ensure that every seed you sow has the best possible chance of flourishing into a bountiful harvest.</p>
<h2 id="why-seed-viability-matters">Why Seed Viability Matters</h2>
<p>Seed viability is the measure of a seed&rsquo;s ability to germinate and produce a normal, healthy seedling under favorable conditions. It&rsquo;s not just a theoretical concept; it has significant practical implications for gardeners. Planting non-viable or low-viability seeds can lead to a host of frustrating problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Poor or Erratic Germination:</strong> If a significant percentage of your seeds are no longer viable, you&rsquo;ll experience low germination rates. This means many of your planting spots will remain empty, resulting in sparse beds or requiring tedious re-seeding. Even if some seeds do sprout, the germination might be spread out over a long period, leading to an uneven stand of plants.</li>
<li><strong>Weak or Stunted Seedlings:</strong> Even if an old seed manages to germinate, the resulting seedling might be weak, spindly, or slow-growing. This is because the seed&rsquo;s stored energy reserves, which fuel initial growth, degrade over time. These weak seedlings are more susceptible to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses, and may never develop into robust, productive plants.</li>
<li><strong>Wasted Time and Resources:</strong> Every empty space in your garden, every re-sowing, every struggling plant represents wasted time, effort, and resources (soil, water, fertilizer). It delays your harvest and can throw off your garden planning. Knowing your seeds are viable upfront allows you to plant with confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Inaccurate Planning:</strong> Garden planning relies on predicting the number of plants you&rsquo;ll have. If your germination rate is low due to non-viable seeds, your plant count will be off, affecting spacing, yield estimates, and even companion planting strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Disease:</strong> Old, compromised seeds can sometimes carry dormant pathogens that might become active under germination conditions, potentially introducing diseases to your soil or other healthy seedlings.</li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, assessing seed viability is a crucial step in ensuring gardening success. It allows you to maximize your efforts, achieve better yields, and avoid the disappointment that comes from planting seeds that simply aren&rsquo;t going to grow.</p>
<h2 id="factors-affecting-seed-longevity">Factors Affecting Seed Longevity</h2>
<p>While all seeds eventually lose viability over time, how quickly this happens depends on several key factors, primarily related to the seed species and, more significantly, its storage conditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Seed Species:</strong> Different plant species have inherently different lifespans for their seeds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-lived Seeds (1-3 years):</strong> Examples include parsnips, onions, corn, parsley, spinach, and salvia. These seeds quickly lose their vigor even under ideal conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Medium-lived Seeds (3-5 years):</strong> This category includes many common vegetables like beans, carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, peas, radishes, and tomatoes.</li>
<li><strong>Long-lived Seeds (5+ years, some much longer):</strong> Certain seeds, especially those with hard coats, can remain viable for many years if stored correctly. Examples include brassicas (cabbage, broccoli), squash, melons, sunflowers, and many flower seeds.
It&rsquo;s always a good idea to research the typical longevity of the specific seed variety you have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage Conditions:</strong> This is the most crucial factor within your control. Seeds are living organisms in a dormant state, and their longevity is maximized by mimicking their natural dormant environment. The three main enemies of seed viability are heat, humidity, and light.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Seeds should be stored in a cool, consistent temperature. The ideal range is often cited as 32-40�F (0-4�C), but cooler room temperatures (below 70�F or 21�C) are better than warm. Fluctuating temperatures are particularly detrimental.</li>
<li><strong>Humidity/Moisture:</strong> This is perhaps the biggest killer of seed viability. Moisture activates metabolic processes within the seed, depleting its stored energy and potentially leading to mold or premature germination. Seeds should be stored in a very dry environment. A relative humidity of 20-30% is ideal.</li>
<li><strong>Light:</strong> While not as critical as temperature and humidity, direct light can also degrade seed viability over time. Store seeds in dark containers or in a dark location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seed Quality at Harvest:</strong> Seeds that were properly matured on the plant, harvested correctly, and thoroughly dried before storage will naturally have higher initial viability and therefore a longer shelf life. Immature or improperly dried seeds will have a very short lifespan regardless of storage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding these factors, particularly the importance of cool, dry, and dark storage, you can significantly extend the usable life of your seed collection and increase your chances of successful germination when planting.</p>
<h2 id="visual-inspection-the-first-clue">Visual Inspection: The First Clue</h2>
<p>Before diving into more involved tests, a simple visual inspection can often provide the first clue about a seed&rsquo;s potential viability. While not definitive, it can help you quickly discard seeds that are clearly beyond hope.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what to look for during a visual inspection:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mold or Fungal Growth:</strong> Any visible signs of mold, mildew, or fungal threads on the seeds themselves or inside the seed packet indicate that the seeds have been exposed to excessive moisture and are highly unlikely to be viable. This is a clear sign to discard them immediately, as they could also introduce pathogens to your soil.</li>
<li><strong>Discoloration:</strong> Healthy seeds generally have a consistent, natural color for their species. If seeds are discolored (e.g., dark spots, unusually pale, or a dull, faded appearance), it can indicate deterioration, fungal contamination, or improper drying.</li>
<li><strong>Shriveled or Shrivelled Appearance:</strong> Seeds that look shriveled, overly wrinkled, or collapsed often suggest they were improperly dried, lost too much moisture, or were simply never fully developed. Healthy seeds should look plump and robust for their type.</li>
<li><strong>Pest Damage:</strong> Look for tiny holes, chew marks, or the presence of insect fragments (like weevils or beetle larvae). If pests have gotten into your seed stash, they&rsquo;ve likely consumed the internal embryo or cotyledons, rendering the seeds non-viable.</li>
<li><strong>Softness or Brittleness:</strong> Healthy seeds should feel firm to the touch. If they are unusually soft or crumbly when gently squeezed (for larger seeds), it indicates internal decay. Conversely, if they are excessively brittle and shatter easily, it might indicate they&rsquo;ve become too dry and damaged, though this is less common.</li>
<li><strong>Unpleasant Odor:</strong> A musty, moldy, or rancid smell coming from the seed packet is a strong indicator of moisture damage and fungal activity. Healthy seeds should have a very subtle, earthy, or neutral smell.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive Dust or Debris:</strong> While some natural dust is normal, an excessive amount of fine, powdery dust can sometimes indicate seeds that have broken down or been attacked by very tiny pests.</li>
</ol>
<p>While a visual inspection can help you quickly eliminate obviously compromised seeds, it cannot confirm viability. A visually perfect-looking seed might still have lost its ability to germinate. Therefore, for seeds that pass the visual test but whose age is questionable, further testing is recommended.</p>
<h2 id="the-float-test-a-quick-but-imperfect-check">The Float Test: A Quick (But Imperfect) Check</h2>
<p>The float test is a simple and rapid method that can provide a preliminary indication of seed viability, particularly for larger seeds. It&rsquo;s based on the principle that viable seeds are dense and full, while non-viable seeds are often hollow, damaged, or dried out, making them lighter and more buoyant.</p>
<p><strong>How to Perform the Float Test:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gather Materials:</strong> You&rsquo;ll need a clear glass or bowl and room temperature water.</li>
<li><strong>Add Seeds:</strong> Place a small handful of the seeds you want to test into the water. Avoid overcrowding the bowl.</li>
<li><strong>Observe:</strong> Allow the seeds to sit in the water for 15-30 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Interpret Results:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sinkers:</strong> Seeds that sink to the bottom are generally considered viable. They are dense, indicating a healthy embryo and sufficient stored food reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Floaters:</strong> Seeds that float on the surface are likely non-viable. They may be hollow, damaged by pests, or have lost their internal structure due to deterioration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Limitations of the Float Test:</strong></p>
<p>While quick and easy, the float test is <strong>not foolproof</strong> and should be considered a preliminary screening, especially for seeds where high germination rates are crucial.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>False Negatives:</strong> Some viable seeds, particularly those with very light or corky outer coatings, might naturally float even if they are perfectly healthy. Examples include celery seeds or some types of grass seeds.</li>
<li><strong>False Positives:</strong> Conversely, some non-viable seeds might absorb enough water to sink, giving a false impression of viability.</li>
<li><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t Test Vigor:</strong> The float test only assesses density; it doesn&rsquo;t tell you how strong or vigorous the resulting seedling will be. A weak but dense seed might still sink.</li>
</ul>
<p>For critical planting or when you need a high degree of confidence in germination, always follow up a float test with a more reliable germination test. However, as a quick way to thin out obviously dead seeds from a large batch, the float test can be quite useful.</p>
<h2 id="the-germination-test-the-most-reliable-method">The Germination Test: The Most Reliable Method</h2>
<p>When you need to know for sure if your old seeds are still good, a germination test is the most accurate and reliable method. It directly assesses the seed&rsquo;s ability to sprout under ideal conditions. There are two primary ways to conduct this test: the paper towel method (best for most seeds) and the soil method.</p>
<h3 id="paper-towel-method-most-common">Paper Towel Method (Most Common)</h3>
<p>This method is quick, uses minimal space, and allows you to easily observe the germination process.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Select Your Seeds:</strong> Choose 10-20 seeds from the batch you want to test. If you have a very large batch, take samples from different parts of the container to get a representative idea.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare the Paper Towel:</strong> Dampen a paper towel (or coffee filter, or a piece of cheesecloth) thoroughly with water, then gently wring out any excess so it&rsquo;s moist but not dripping.</li>
<li><strong>Arrange Seeds:</strong> Spread the selected seeds evenly on one half of the damp paper towel. Ensure they are not touching each other.</li>
<li><strong>Fold and Roll:</strong> Fold the other half of the paper towel over the seeds, then gently roll or fold the towel into a loose cylinder or square.</li>
<li><strong>Place in Bag:</strong> Place the folded paper towel into a clear plastic bag (a zip-top bag works well) or a shallow, covered container. This creates a mini-greenhouse effect, maintaining humidity.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Warmth:</strong> Place the bag/container in a warm location, ideally between 65-75�F (18-24�C), which is optimal for most seed germination. Avoid direct sunlight which can dry out the towel.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Check the paper towel every 1-2 days. Keep it consistently moist (mist with water if drying out). Look for signs of germination: the emergence of tiny white roots (radicles) and possibly small shoots.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="soil-method">Soil Method</h3>
<p>This method is more natural and shows how seeds perform in a planting medium, though it&rsquo;s slower to observe.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Select Seeds:</strong> Again, choose 10-20 seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare Medium:</strong> Fill a small tray or pot with sterile seed-starting mix. Lightly moisten the mix.</li>
<li><strong>Sow Seeds:</strong> Plant the seeds at the depth recommended for their species (or lightly cover them if no depth is specified). Space them out to avoid overcrowding.</li>
<li><strong>Cover and Warm:</strong> Cover the tray with plastic wrap or a clear dome to maintain humidity. Place in a warm location, as with the paper towel method.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist (but not soggy). Check daily for emerging seedlings.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="interpreting-germination-test-results">Interpreting Germination Test Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Germination Time:</strong> Note how long it takes for the seeds to sprout. Compare this to the typical germination time listed on the seed packet or for the species. Slow or erratic germination can indicate declining viability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Percentage:</strong> Count how many seeds germinate out of your sample size.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>90-100%:</strong> Excellent viability. Plant as usual.</li>
<li><strong>70-89%:</strong> Good viability. You might plant a few extra seeds to compensate for the slightly lower rate.</li>
<li><strong>50-69%:</strong> Moderate viability. Plant at least twice as many seeds as you normally would. Consider whether it&rsquo;s worth the effort for the number of plants you need.</li>
<li><strong>Below 50%:</strong> Low viability. These seeds are generally not worth planting. It&rsquo;s time to acquire fresh seeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vigor:</strong> Observe the strength of the germinated seedlings. Are they robust and growing well, or do they look weak and spindly? Weak seedlings often indicate reduced vigor in older seeds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the test, if using the paper towel method, you can gently transplant viable seedlings into potting mix if you wish to grow them. The germination test provides the clearest picture of your old seeds&rsquo; potential, allowing you to plant with confidence or discard with certainty.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-discard-seeds-and-why">When to Discard Seeds (and Why)</h2>
<p>Even with the best storage conditions and a strong desire to avoid waste, there comes a point when seeds are no longer viable enough to warrant planting. Knowing when to discard them can save you significant time, effort, and disappointment.</p>
<p>You should generally discard seeds if:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>They Fail the Germination Test (Below 50%):</strong> If less than half of your tested seeds germinate, the effort required to plant and nurture them will likely outweigh the meager results. You&rsquo;ll end up with sparse plantings, weak seedlings, and a frustrating gardening experience. It&rsquo;s simply more efficient to start with fresh, highly viable seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Signs of Mold or Pest Infestation:</strong> As observed in the visual inspection, any visible mold or signs of insect damage (holes, tiny larvae) are clear indicators that the seeds are compromised. Not only are they unlikely to germinate, but they can also introduce diseases or pests to your garden.</li>
<li><strong>They are Known to Be Short-Lived:</strong> For notoriously short-lived seeds like parsnip, onion, leek, or salsify (typically viable for 1-2 years), if they are beyond their expected lifespan, even a float test might be misleading. Unless you have a particularly well-stored batch and get a high germination rate from a test, it&rsquo;s often best to replace them annually.</li>
<li><strong>You Have Limited Garden Space/Time:</strong> If your gardening space is small and precious, or your time is limited, you cannot afford to waste it on seeds with questionable viability. Prioritize using fresh, high-quality seeds to ensure maximum yield and success from your efforts.</li>
<li><strong>They Are Very Old (Beyond Reasonable Lifespan):</strong> While exceptional cases exist, most vegetable and flower seeds will not remain viable beyond 5-10 years, even with perfect storage. Seeds from reputable seed companies often have a &ldquo;packed for&rdquo; date; if you&rsquo;re many years past this, especially for common varieties, it&rsquo;s often more practical to buy new.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why Discarding is Important:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saves Time and Effort:</strong> You avoid preparing soil, sowing, watering, and waiting for seeds that will never sprout.</li>
<li><strong>Ensures Better Yields:</strong> Fresh, viable seeds lead to higher germination rates and stronger, more productive plants.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces Frustration:</strong> A garden full of thriving seedlings is far more enjoyable than one with patchy, struggling plants.</li>
<li><strong>Prevents Spread of Issues:</strong> Discarding moldy or pest-infested seeds prevents potential contamination of your garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of it as weeding out the weak links. While it might feel wasteful, discarding non-viable seeds is a proactive step that ultimately leads to greater gardening success and efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-storing-seeds-to-maximize-longevity">Tips for Storing Seeds to Maximize Longevity</h2>
<p>Preventing the rapid decline of seed viability is far more effective than trying to resuscitate old seeds. Proper storage is paramount to extending the life of your seed collection. Remember the three key enemies of seed viability: heat, humidity, and light.</p>
<p>Here�s how to store your seeds to maximize their longevity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep Them Cool:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideal:</strong> A refrigerator (especially a dedicated seed refrigerator, or a drawer that isn&rsquo;t opened constantly) is excellent, ideally at temperatures between 32-40�F (0-4�C).</li>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> A cool, dry basement, an unheated closet, or an interior cupboard away from heat sources (like ovens, heaters, or direct sunlight) are good alternatives if a refrigerator isn&rsquo;t feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Garages, sheds, or attics are generally too prone to extreme temperature fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep Them Dry:</strong> This is arguably the most critical factor. Moisture activates the seed&rsquo;s metabolic processes, depleting its energy reserves.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Airtight Containers:</strong> Store seeds in airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption. This can include:
<ul>
<li>Glass jars with tight-fitting lids.</li>
<li>Plastic containers with sealing lids.</li>
<li>Mylar bags (especially for long-term storage).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desiccants:</strong> To ensure maximum dryness, consider adding a desiccant (moisture-absorbing material) to your airtight container, especially if you live in a humid climate.
<ul>
<li><strong>Silica Gel Packets:</strong> Reusable packets often found in new products. Reactivate them by baking in a low oven.</li>
<li><strong>Powdered Milk:</strong> Place a small amount of powdered milk in a tissue or paper towel pouch and tuck it into the container. Replace every 6 months.</li>
<li><strong>Rice:</strong> A small bag of rice can also absorb some moisture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Seeds are Dry Before Storage:</strong> If you&rsquo;re harvesting your own seeds, make absolutely sure they are thoroughly dry before sealing them in containers. Spread them on a screen or paper in a dry, airy place for several days or weeks until they snap when bent (not bend).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep Them Dark:</strong> Light can also degrade seed viability over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Store airtight containers in a dark place, such as a cupboard, drawer, or opaque container.</li>
<li>If using clear containers (like glass jars), place them inside a dark box or bag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Label Thoroughly:</strong> While not directly affecting longevity, clear labeling is essential for organization and knowing what you have. Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant name (variety)</li>
<li>Date harvested or &ldquo;packed for&rdquo; date</li>
<li>Source (if not your own)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Separate by Type (Optional):</strong> Some gardeners prefer to store short-lived seeds separately from long-lived ones for easier rotation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By adopting these simple but effective storage practices, you can significantly extend the viable life of your seeds, ensuring a ready supply for successful gardening seasons to come.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-giving-your-seeds-the-best-chance">Conclusion: Giving Your Seeds the Best Chance</h2>
<p>The tiny seed represents immense potential � a dormant life waiting for the right conditions to burst forth. While the passage of time inevitably diminishes this potential, you hold considerable power to influence its longevity and ensure its success. Understanding how seeds age, recognizing the subtle clues of decline through visual inspection, and, most critically, employing the reliable germination test are invaluable skills for any gardener.</p>
<p>By proactively assessing the viability of your old seed packets, you transform a gamble into an informed decision. You avoid the frustration of empty rows and weak seedlings, channeling your precious gardening time and resources into seeds that truly have a fighting chance. Furthermore, by implementing proper storage techniques � keeping your seeds cool, dry, and dark � you can significantly extend their usable life, minimizing waste and maximizing your investment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, determining if old seeds are still good for planting is more than just a practical chore; it&rsquo;s an act of horticultural stewardship. It&rsquo;s about respecting the life within each seed and giving it the very best opportunity to fulfill its promise, leading to a more productive, beautiful, and rewarding garden for you to cherish.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-cleaning-the-can-and-the-lid">Step 1: Cleaning the Can and the Lid</h3>
<p>There are several steps that you will need to involve on that old paint to make it useful again.
Before you can start cleaning the rim and the lid, you need to first lay old newspapers or drop cloth to avoid any spillage that may occur in the process.
Once done, place the paint on the laid material and remove any form of dirt or dust that may have accumulated on the can.
You can use a screwdriver or a flat-blade to remove any dried paint and rust from around the rim.

<h3 id="step-4-vigorous-mixing-of-paint">Step 4: Vigorous Mixing Of Paint</h3>
<p>After confirming the paint is okay, you are advised to subject it to a more vigorous mixing that will go a long way towards making it usable.
In this case, you can subject the paint to a variable speed drill. Initially, set the drill at a low speed and gradually increase its speed as you go about stirring.
Dont forget to ensure the drill circulates around the perimeter and also touches on the bottom of the can for proper mixing.
Once done, you will only need to run the drill for about 10-15 minutes and the paint is ready. You can then proceed to test your paint.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-testing-the-paint-on-a-board">Step 5: Testing the Paint on a Board</h3>
<p>In this step, consistency is our priority. You need a clipboard to do a test and some application material (a paint or a roller).
At this point, if the paint runs smoothly, congratulations! You have conquered and the old paint is good for reuse.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-tell-if-paint-is-reusable">How Do You Tell If Paint Is Reusable</h2>
<p>Most paint can last for years and still be reused but that doesnt mean it cannot get worse.
For your paint to get bad, it entirely depends on a number of issues. These factors include the type of paint, location, weather conditions, and storage conditions too (open or sealed).
Some paints go bad and develop molds and foul smell and reusing them can be problematic</p>
<h3 id="a-properly-sealed-paints">a. Properly Sealed Paints</h3>
<p>If you are fond of covering your paints, there is a high probability that that paint could still be reused.
However, that is not possible for all the paints and especially those that are packaged with plastic cans. Their lids are not tight enough and could let air in and make the paint go bad.
The only challenge with sealed paints is a separation which is likely to occur but that doesnt mean you cannot reuse it.
All you need is to use a painted rod and stir it thoroughly. If you find your paint has developed lumps, it is evident that the paint has gone bad and no longer reusable.

<h3 id="b-open-and-exposed-paint">b. Open and exposed Paint</h3>
<p>If you leave your paint open, you expose them to a lot of factors that may render them useless.
However, this depends on some circumstances like temperature levels (direct sun or ice) and also the kind of paint.
No paint is strong enough to withstand prolonged exposure to temperatures below 50F and temperatures above 72 F and still be reusable.
Such temperatures completely alter the chemical composition of any paint whether oil or water-based and the best you can do is throw them away.
If your paint was sealed but got exposed to air, there are chances that you can reuse it.
By chance, you may find this paint has formed a layer that can always be removed by thoroughly stirring and bring it back to life.
In some instances, you may find the whole paint has dried, it is as good as dead and hard to reuse it again.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-differentiate-good-and-bad-paint">How to Differentiate Good and Bad Paint</h2>
<p>If you cant distinguish between a good and a bad paint, here is a very simple way to tell the difference.
First, you can open the can and smell it. If the paint is bad, it will have a very staunch smell. This is a clear indication that that paint should be thrown away.
Secondly, try to stir the paint with a stirrer. If the paint is good, it will stir gently and the paint will liquefy and you can try it out by painting on a board to the teat on its consistency.
To some extent, the spoilt paints may develop molds and mildew which is a clear indication that the paint is bad and beyond repair.
Caution:�In some instances, the paint may have some lumps and some clever bunch may try to use a filter mechanism to get off the lumps and reuse the paint.
Once the paint has developed the lumps, its done, it&rsquo;s dead and there is nothing you can do about it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the whole process of how to make old paint usable again, the most critical process is the vigorous mixing. It carries the cream of the whole process.

NB: This process does not have any effect on the altercation of the color of your old paint.</p>
