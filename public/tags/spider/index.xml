<h3 id="understanding-spider-infestations">Understanding Spider Infestations</h3>
<p>Spiders are often found in yards and homes due to two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Floating Baby Spiders:**After hatching, baby spiders can travel long distances by floating on air currents, potentially ending up in your home or yard. This makes complete eradication challenging.</li>
<li>**&ldquo;Your House Is Theirs&rdquo; Principle:**Spiders often establish their territory within your home, creating webs and laying eggs. This behavior makes them difficult to eliminate entirely.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="best-outdoor-and-indoor-pesticides">Best Outdoor and Indoor Pesticides</h3>
<p><strong>Outdoor Pesticides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for products with long-term residual effects and strong sticking power. Cyfluthrin and Permethrin-based pesticides are effective for outdoor use and remain active for up to 90 days.
<strong>Indoor Pesticides:</strong></li>
<li>Choose low-odor, water-based products to avoid respiratory issues. Gentrol IGR is effective for preventing spider eggs from hatching and is ideal for indoor use.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably there are thousand ways you can kill you can kill a <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-antennae/">spider</a> in your yard or house.</p>
<p>But definitely, most of us know crushing it with a blunt object - the Hulk smash&quot; technique. But,
<strong>can you drown a spider?�</strong>
<strong>The simple answer is, No, you cannot drown a spider - as stated by Real Science - but they&rsquo;ll die if submerged in sewer. Spiders have a very low oxygen intake due to their low metabolic rate and thus drowning may take 1-3 hours.�</strong>
<strong>But water spider or diving-bell spider can live fully under water. Spider breathe through book lungs or web gills and remain under water for over 24 hours.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-can-you-drown-a-spider-flush-water-death">Details: Can You Drown a Spider? Flush Water Death?</h2>
<p>Just like human beings, spiders also drink water and this is why you might find them around water sources such as shower or bath stalls. Also, can the spider drawn in the ocean if its swept by any random sunbather.
Spiders spending time around the shower or bath stalls may end up being flashed down the drain when you&rsquo;re bathing.�So, if you&rsquo;re wondering if spiders can actually drown when you flash them them down the drain - relax we get into the details. Can they crawl or climb back fighting for its life.

[/caption]
The truth is: According to the
<a href="http://www.americanarachnology.org/">American Arachnological Society</a>
, any spider that&rsquo;s flushed will only drown within 1-3 hours since they have low oxygen intake dude to their low metabolic rate.
Some spider species sick as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_bell_spider">diving bell spider</a>
won&rsquo;t drown easily anyway because �they&rsquo;ll create underwater webs which allow gaseous exchange.�The webs enable the spider to rise above the water surface once daily -� prevents it from being
washed away the drain
.
Therefore, when trying to kill the spiders you should know that
some spiders aren&rsquo;t even venomous
but will prey on household pests such as mosquitoes. For example, some spiders
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mosquito-assassin-spiders-could-help-fight-malaria/">kill malaria-carrying mosquitos</a>
that may cause

<h2 id="alternative-ways-to-control-spiders">Alternative Ways to Control Spiders</h2>
<p>Spiders are crawly, creepy arachnids that have 8 legs that tend terrify kids and adults equally. This is particularly so when one finds themselves attached when in an empty apartment.
You might see some black and white spots on the floor - which will mean you&rsquo;ll have to kill the spiders with any way possible. So, below are some of the methods you can use to kill the arachnids.
However, researchers caution against
<a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/779681/Scientists-spiders-eat-tonnes-insects-bugs-creepy-crawlies">squashing spiders - they keep a natural ecosystem</a>
. So, to deal with the arachnids in your boat, house or yard, you&rsquo;ll need to counter the spiders intelligently.</p>
<h3 id="1-use-lady-bugs">1. Use Lady Bugs</h3>
<p>You definitely won&rsquo;t like the ladybugs running around the floor spaces. So, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the ladybugs around the garden walls to keep the spiders and other small insects.
Further, the ladybugs will prey and eat the insects that&rsquo;ll attract the spiders - which means that that spiders will have limited food sources available around the house and thus they&rsquo;ll relocate.
Thus putting the ladybugs around your house won&rsquo;t kill the spiders but will keep them off your house&rsquo;s perimeter. It&rsquo;ll equally work excellently when there many flowers and bushes that are near the windowsills or house foundation.

<h3 id="2-use-a-spider-spray-natural">2. Use a Spider Spray (Natural)</h3>
<p>Next up is using a natural spray for the spiders. You&rsquo;ll need to make the spray using natural ingredients and then spray it around the home&rsquo;s damp areas or bathroom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply, pour a single cup of the natural apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>Pour 1 cup of pepper</li>
<li>Pour 1 teaspoon of oil</li>
<li>Pour 1 teaspoon of dish soap (the liquid type)</li>
<li>Mix everything in one spray bottle and spray once, and respray after 3-5 days.
Further, you&rsquo;ll need to spray the insecticide on the outer side of your house along the doors, windowsills, and windows to prevent the spiders from entering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-peppermint-oil"><strong>3. Peppermint Oil</strong></h3>
<p>Peppermint oil is hated by many pests including spiders and
bed bugs
. Notably, the oil has a very harsh smell - particularly for small arachnids and insects like
<a href="https://www.tipsbulletin.com/how-to-keep-yellow-jackets-away/">yellow jackets</a>
and wasps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a plastic bottle and pour some water (for dilution) with the peppermint oil so that it won&rsquo;t irritate your pets and the human skin.</li>
<li>Next, take the bottle and spray around the house, yard, and perimeter to repel the spiders.</li>
<li>Alternatively, soak some cotton balls in the peppermint oil-water mixture and position them in places you think spiders might be using to get into your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-de-clutter-your-spaces">4. De-clutter your Spaces</h3>
<p>Definitely, spiders - like insects too - like clutter and they&rsquo;ll camp behind dirty furniture and big boxes. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the home free from clutter and ensure its always clean.
Remember to dust and clean up the walls once each week while also putting away the packages and boxes. This will discourage the spiders from creating their web around - but also clean up any other cobwebs you see around.
Further, clean up your house&rsquo;s exteriors and slash up the bushes and vegetation that&rsquo;s on the house perimeter. This will remove any possible hiding places and make the space spider-free.</p>
<h3 id="5-citrus-peels">5. Citrus Peels</h3>
<p>Citrus, comparable mint leaves, contain acetic acid which insects and spiders loathe. Spiders hate citrus just like grapefruits, oranges, and lemons.
I would say that you can purchase citrus oils scents or simply save on some leftover peels after you&rsquo;ve eaten the fruit. These will repel the spiders away from your house and yard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the citrus peels and rub them on bookshelves, baseboards, window sills, and doorways.</li>
<li>For the essential citrus oil, simply some water with the oil in the bottle ready for spraying around your house and perimeter.</li>
<li>However, for the citrus peels always replace these one in 1-2 days to ensure that the citrus smell is always active to repel the spiders from your house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-spray-cedar-oil">7. Spray Cedar Oil</h3>
<p>Just like Citrus, spiders hate the cedar wood smell and will move so far from near it. So, simply lay down cedar mulch near your house and its perimeter to repel the spiders.
However, always get high quality cedar wood or cedar oil to ensure that the harsh smell won&rsquo;t die down so fast before it fully repels the spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>For cedar essential oil, simply mix the oil with some water and finally spray the mixture on your house&rsquo;s exterior and perimeter.</li>
<li>Also, you may position natural cedar in the house to repel the spiders. Luckily, its a natural solution that won&rsquo;t be toxic or harm pets and humans.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-use-tobacco">8. Use Tobacco</h3>
<p>Tobacco is hated by many insects and arachnids like spiders too. Luckily, tobaccos is readily available in most places and its equally cheap compared to
commercial spider fogger
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply get a tobacco leaf in your local store or shops and spread them on routes where you suspects spider use to get into the house.</li>
<li>Alternatively, crash the leaves and soak them in some water inn a spray bottle. Finally, spray the tobacco-water mixture around the house and perimeter.</li>
<li>Finally, you may create some tobacco balls. For this metods, you&rsquo;ll need to mix water, flour and tobacco leaves to create spider-repellent balls.</li>
<li>Caution - for homes with pets and kids, only using tobacco spray and leaves might be hazardous to these your sensitive animals and loved ones respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-use-borax">9. Use Borax</h3>
<p>Finally, borax is the last alternative repellent your can use against spiders. Definitely,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/borax-for-ants-outside/">borax is popularly used in repelling ants</a>
but it&rsquo;ll also be effective against spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the borax powder and sprinkle it on the routes and areas you suspect will be used by spiders or where they may make their webs.</li>
<li>In addition, you can sprinkle the powder along the doors, or between the storm windows and window.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve tackled the question - &ldquo;can you drown a spider?&rdquo; The response is that its impossible to easily drown spiders since they have low oxygen intake and equally low metabolic rate. This means that some spiders may even survive under water for 1-3 hours.
Equally surprising is that some spiders like water spider or diving-bell spider will use their book lungs or web gills for respiration�when they&rsquo;re under water. Therefore, these spider will�survive for longer (over 24 hours) without coming to the water surface.
I&rsquo;ve outlined alternative methods you can use to repel spiders from your house - as opposed to killing them since these arachnids assist in maintaining a

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bed bug infestation in your spaces may be
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4080563/">challenging to control</a>
; you&rsquo;ll require professional help and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-vacuum-for-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-cockroaches-eat-bed-bugs/)/">top-quality bedbug control equipment</a>
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/">natural bed bug predators</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the ban of DDT and other synthetic pesticides some 40 years ago, bed bugs have been noted to make a major comeback.
The technique chosen may have different side effects and effectiveness. So, below I&rsquo;ve discussed the issue of &ldquo;do spiders eat bed bugs?&rdquo;
<strong>In summary, YES, most spiders (especially the Cobweb <a href="/posts/spider-bite-vs-bed-bug-bite/">spider</a> and Philodromid crab spider species) will eat bed bugs and all the insects that get trapped in their webs.�</strong>
<em>So, let&rsquo;s check the details!�</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs-what-spider-species">Do Spiders Eat Bed Bugs? What Spider Species?</h2>
<p>Well, maybe you should not get worried when you find that spider around the house - as they may actually help you not just control flies but also bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Philodromid and cobweb spider species are the two main species that are known to trap and eat bed bugs; these spider species are common all over America.
Despite that spiders will feed on bed bugs, it&rsquo;s impossible for these creatures to feast on all the bed bugs (in all life stages such as the
Baby Bed Bugs
).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-will-philodromid-crab-spidersfeed-onbed-bugs">1. Will Philodromid Crab Spiders�Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>The Philodromid crab spiders may be physically and in features similar to the crab (both front and rear); this is a very common spider species both in America and all over the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Philodromid (Thanatus flavidus) spider will mainly inhabit the outdoors but may sometimes get into the house.
These spiders will get into the house with the mission of hunting and eating those small insects including bed bugs. However, the phildromids will not employ webs to trap the bed bugs.</li>
<li>So, how do they catch the bed bugs? Well, the phildromids move faster than bed bugs and thus they&rsquo;ll hunt them down, inject some venom into their body and eat them.
The Philodromids are distributed all over the globe including Canada, North America, Asia, South America, Europe, and even Africa.
Since these spiders will take residence in the wild and the house, they&rsquo;ll hunt those many insects and flies by injecting venom into their bodies.</li>
<li>When the Philodromids aren&rsquo;t indoors (which is most of the time), these spiders will hide under grass and undergrowth in your garden or yard</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-will-cobweb-spiderfeed-onbed-bugs">2. Will Cobweb spider�Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>The Cobweb spiders will also be helpful in feeding on the bed bugs around your house; at least that&rsquo;s a positive use for the spiders that you fear.</p>
<ul>
<li>These Cobweb spiders will create their webs on the house corners and they&rsquo;ll use the structures to trap the various insects including bed bugs.
However, there are some cobweb spiders that are poisonous and hence we might not want their services in eating bed bugs around our houses.
Thus, I advise you get a professional spider or pest exterminator to check the type of cobweb spiders that are in your residence, yards, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-willjumping-spidersfeed-onbed-bugs">3. Will**Jumping Spiders�**Feed on�Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>There are over 600o jumping spider species globally. The food they take includes crawling insects - both those that live outdoors or even indoors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, if the spiders are in the indoor spaces, they&rsquo;ll also feed on bed bugs among other insects.
If the jumping spiders are living in the outdoor spaces, they will feed on flies, grasshoppers among other insects.
The jumping spiders will mainly Hunt in the daytime since they have a great sense of sight.</li>
<li>These spiders can be found in those unique house corners where it will be difficult for one to notice them easily.
The jumping spiders may be considered to be slow spiders. Thus, they will eye their prey such as the bedbugs from a distance and jump to eat them.</li>
<li>The jumping spiders may even jump up to 30 times their body length and thus the witch many of the insects.
An interesting point that you will note is that the jumping spiders may also Hunt other spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-will-cellar-spiders-feed-on-bed-bugs">4. Will Cellar Spiders Feed on Bed Bugs?</h3>
<p>So on the question of whether cellar spiders will feed on bedbugs, I am happy to note that these spiders, like other spiders above, will also eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>On their body structure, the cellar spiders look like the harvestman (<a href="https://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html">Daddy-Long-Legs</a>) but they have venom and also create webs.
To know whether you have them in your house you need to check any of their carcasses that may be on webs.
However, the cellar spiders will not chew bed bugs. They will simply inject venom into the body of the bedbugs and swallow them whole.</li>
<li>The bedbugs among other insects will be digested by the digestive juices that are found in the cellar spiders.</li>
<li>However, the cellar spiders and their webs sometimes get out of hand and you might need to control them.
For this, I recommend that you contact your local pest exterminators or get some certified technicians that will control
both the webs and the spiders
.
But most of the time you might not need to control this by the cellar spiders.</li>
<li>This is because these spiders will help you also control other insects including mosquitos, flies, or moths in the garage shed, yard, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-avoid-spiders-in-controlling-bed-bugs">Why Avoid Spiders in Controlling Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>In this section, I will outline reasons why you should avoid using spiders in controlling bed bugs in your spaces.
<strong>1. Spiders Feed on Many Insects</strong>
We&rsquo;ve noted that spiders can act as great natural predators to eat those spiders that are in your spaces.
However, it is also clear that spiders may not effectively reduce the whole bed bug population.
This is because spiders will not just feed on bedbugs but will consume a range of insects to satisfy their dietary needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, as you wait for the spiders to feed on their whole bed bug population, they will be elsewhere feeding on other insects.
Thus, the spiders will not significantly reduce bed bugs in your house.
<strong>2. Spiders are Feared�</strong>
The next issue in using spiders to control bed bugs is that spiders are generally feared by most homeowners.</li>
<li>So, it will be unimaginable that you&rsquo;ll keep so many spiders to control bed bugs in the house.</li>
<li>Finally, after controlling the bedbugs, you could have a major spider problem in your spaces.
Therefore, most of us will avoid spiders due to fear and also avoid creating a spider&rsquo;s problem in the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the spiders could also frighten those in your house as they&rsquo;ll generally hide around the coaches, sofa sets, and near your bed.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re not confident enough to be seeing spiders roaming around you may need to avoid them in controlling bed bugs.
<strong>3. Spider Webs are Unsightly�</strong>
Finally, you may notice that spider webs may make your spaces look unsightly and shaggy.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, most of us hate the job of removing the spider webs from various corners of our houses.
Therefore, if you hate the site and the work that comes with spider webs, you might need to exterminate them instead of using them as natural predators for the bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-other-predators-for-bed-bugs">Any Other Predators for Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>As an expert, I have to note that there are other natural predators that you can use to control spiders.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, you must take into consideration that some of these predators may also the household pests.
First, I have to note that pets such as cats and dogs will only eat bed bugs by accident.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-lizards">1. Lizards</h3>
<p>Lizards such as geckos are notable predators that can eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike spiders, lizards are considered harmless and cute but may also eat most insects including bed bugs.</li>
<li>However, if you&rsquo;re not keeping the results as pets, you may need to check the lizard population as too many may be unpleasant.
A key disadvantage with the lizards, just like with spiders, is that you might need to keep too many of them, and finally, they&rsquo;re not removing the whole bed bug population.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-cockroaches"><strong>2. Cockroaches</strong></h3>
<p>Some cockroach species, such as the German and the American (which are very common) are known to eat bed bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, spiders including the Oriental and the brown-banded species will eat many insects.</li>
<li>However, just like with the other natural predators, cockroaches have their large share of problems while controlling bed bugs.
For example, cockroaches will reproduce fast and hence leave you with another pest control issue.
Alternatively, you may need to use techniques and an appropriate pace that will control both the bedbugs and the cockroaches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-pharaoh-ants">3. Pharaoh Ants</h3>
<p>Ant experts have concluded that the pharaoh ants are an appropriate species that we can use to target and control bed bugs.
One unique benefit is that ants may be used as a giveaway and hence they&rsquo;ll draw the experts to locations that bed bugs could be hiding.
Pharaoh ants are a major natural predator for bed bugs. Other species of arms that you can use include their fire ants and the Argentine ants.
However, a disappointing fact with these predators including ants is that they won&rsquo;t be effective to remove bed bugs.
These animals will mainly feast on bed bugs especially when the population is high but they won&rsquo;t make a major difference in controlling the bed bug population.
So, the major advantage is that you can use the bed bugs to pinpoint locations that bed bugs have burrowed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion�</strong></h2>
<p>In conclusion, spiders are considered as natural predators for bed bugs but using them may prove inefficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, the method could make you neglect professional help that can help reduce the bed bug population rapidly.</li>
<li>Also, bed bugs are creative creatures that will hide even in small crevices and cracks to stay off predators.
In fact, you might need a very large population of spiders to significantly reduce the bug bed bugs in your house.
Therefore, instead of using spiders to control bed bugs, using
professional spiders exterminators
may be the best option.</li>

      <title>Do Spiders Have Antennae</title>

      <description>Spiders are fascinating creatures, often mistaken for insects due to their small size and presence in many of the same environments.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders are fascinating creatures, often mistaken for insects due to their small size and presence in many of the same environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, their anatomy differs significantly, leading to some common misconceptions, particularly around whether spiders have antennae.
This article explores whether spiders have
<em><strong>antennae</strong></em>
, their unique sensory systems, and how they differ from other arthropods, particularly insects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-have-antennae">Do Spiders Have Antennae?</h2>
<p>The short answer is
<strong>no, spiders do not have antennae</strong>
. While spiders and insects are both arthropods, they belong to different classes: spiders are arachnids, and insects are classified as
<a href="http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/">hexapods</a>
. One key difference between these two groups is their body structure, including their sensory organs.</p>
<p>Antennae are absent in spiders. Instead, they have other sensory systems that help them navigate their environment and detect prey. These features work differently from insect antennae but serve similar functions.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-antennae-what-are-they">Understanding Antennae: What Are They?</h2>
<p>Antennae are sensory organs found in many arthropods, including insects and crustaceans. They play a crucial role in detecting chemical signals, vibrations, and environmental stimuli such as temperature and humidity. Insects rely on their antennae to navigate their surroundings, find food, communicate, and detect potential mates.</p>
<p>Antennae are typically long, segmented appendages located on the heads of insects. They come in various shapes and sizes depending on the species and serve functions like smelling, sensing air currents, or detecting vibrations. Given their importance to insect life, its natural to wonder if spiders share this feature.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-sensory-system-the-role-of-pedipalps-and-hair-like-structures">Spiders Sensory System: The Role of Pedipalps and Hair-like Structures</h2>
<p>Instead of antennae, spiders have evolved other sensory adaptations that help them perceive their surroundings and hunt effectively.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pedipalps</strong>: Located near a <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s mouth, pedipalps are small, leg-like appendages that play a significant role in sensing, manipulating prey, and in mating for males. Though not as long or prominent as insect <a href="/posts/do-fleas-have-antennae/">antennae</a>, pedipalps are highly sensitive and help spiders detect chemical signals, such as those from potential prey.</li>
<li><strong>Sensory Hairs (Setae)</strong>: Spiders are covered in tiny hairs called<em>setae</em>, which are highly sensitive to touch, air currents, and vibrations. These hairs allow spiders to detect even slight movements in their environment, helping them sense prey caught in their webs or an approaching predator.</li>
<li><strong>Trichobothria</strong>: Spiders have long, specialized hairs called trichobothria, which are exceptionally sensitive to vibrations in the air. These hairs help spiders detect the movement of nearby prey or predators, allowing them to react even when the source is not in direct contact.</li>
<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: While insects rely heavily on their antennae for sensory input, spiders often use their eyes to a greater degree. Most spiders have eight eyes, though the number and arrangement can vary by species. Some spiders, like jumping spiders, have excellent vision, which they use to hunt and ambush prey.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="differences-between-spiders-and-insects">Differences Between Spiders and Insects</h2>
<p>Though spiders and insects are both arthropods, there are significant anatomical and behavioral differences between them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Body Structure</strong>: Insects have three body segments (head, thorax, abdomen) and six legs, while spiders have two segments (<a href="https://bijlmakers.com/spiders/spider-bodyparts/#cephalothorax">cephalothorax</a>and abdomen) and eight legs.</li>
<li><strong>Sensory Organs</strong>: Insects have antennae that serve as primary sensory organs. Spiders lack antennae and instead use pedipalps, sensory hairs, and their keen eyesight for sensory input.</li>
<li><strong>Breathing Systems</strong>: Spiders breathe through structures called book lungs, while insects use a network of tubes called tracheae to transport oxygen.</li>
<li><strong>Life Cycle</strong>: Insects typically undergo metamorphosis, transitioning through stages such as egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Spiders do not undergo such transformations; they hatch as miniature versions of adults and grow through molting.</li>

<h2 id="how-spiders-navigate-without-antennae">How Spiders Navigate Without Antennae</h2>
<p>Despite lacking antennae, spiders are highly adept at navigating their environments. They rely on their pedipalps, sensory hairs, and excellent vision to hunt and detect threats. Web-building spiders, for instance, use vibrations in their webs to sense when prey has been caught.</p>
<p>For non-web-building spiders, like wolf spiders or jumping spiders, trichobothria and setae provide detailed information about their surroundings. These sensory adaptations allow them to hunt effectively, ambushing prey or avoiding predators.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, spiders do not have antennae like insects do. Instead, they rely on other sensory organs, such as pedipalps, sensory hairs, and eyes, to interact with their environment.</p>
<p>These adaptations allow spiders to hunt, detect threats, and navigate effectively without the need for antennae. Though spiders and insects share some similarities as arthropods, their anatomy and sensory systems differ significantly, making spiders unique and highly skilled predators in their ecosystems.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your regular spiders are small-bodied insects. So, its not out of the ordinary to imagine how small their bones would be, if they have any at all.</p>
<p>In fact some bigger creatures like lobsters, crab, snails, worms and shrimps have no bones.
<em>So, do spiders have bones?</em>
<strong>Well, spiders don&rsquo;t have bones - and like other arthropods. However, they have an �endoskeleton plus an exoskeleton (external skeleton) that provides primary support for the arachnid&rsquo;s muscles. Its exoskeleton has cuticles plus joints on their surfaces to enable easy movement.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-bones-exoskeleton">Details: Do Spiders Have Bones?? Exoskeleton?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s cuticle is composed of 4 layers (like other arthropods) unlike insects that have 3 cuticle layers. However, the cuticles are all made off chitin fibers plus protein.
But, don&rsquo;t be mistaken, the spider still has a small internal skeleton - that&rsquo;s has, however, no bones in it.�The spider&rsquo;s endoskeleton has collagen and a couple of plates which won&rsquo;t articulate like bones do for the skeleton in vertebrates.
Compared to humans and other animal species -these ones have an endoskeleton that acts like a support structure that&rsquo;s created from bones.
The endoskeleton offers support to its organs like
lungs
,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-brains/">brain</a>
,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-hearts/">heart</a>
and maintain the animals size and shape.</p>
<h2 id="exoskeletons-offer-spiders-body-support">Exoskeletons offer Spiders Body Support</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, spiders have an exoskeleton as compared to having an internal skeleton created from bones. So, what&rsquo;s these exoskeletons and what makes it up?
The arthropod&rsquo;s exoskeleton is made from chitin- which covers its body outer surface to offer support, protection, and structure. Thus, the exoskeleton will be shed (through molting) as the spider grows and develops. So, below is a�tarantula shedding her exoskelton:�</p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-benefit-from-theexoskeletons">How Spiders Benefit from the�Exoskeletons</h2>
<p>Compared to endoskeletons, exoskeletons will provide more protection because it covers the whole spider&rsquo;s body while the bones would only be located internally.
Also, exoskeletons enable the spider&rsquo;s muscles to achieve more leverage for movement, lifting, or picking objects - this is better than in the animals with endoskeletons.
Therefore, the exoskeletons will give the spider more power and straight than other animals of the same size but having an endoskeletons.

<h2 id="how-spiders-move">How Spiders Move</h2>
<p>The segments of the exoskeleton in the arthropod are joined using joints to allow it to move up and down. Therefore, the muscles that are attached to the exoskeleton tend to contract allowing the spider to move its legs inward.
However, the spider lacks muscles that would otherwise extend its legs back (outward) to their default position. Therefore, the creature use its blood and other bodily fluids to push the legs outward.
Whenever the spider loses excessive bodily fluid, it&rsquo;ll lack the required pressure (
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/hydraulic.htm">hydraulic)</a>
for moving its legs outwards. You&rsquo;ll notice the spider lying on its back and its legs in a curled up position.</p>
<h2 id="howspiders-molt">**How�****Spiders **<strong>Molt�</strong></h2>
<p>Spiders will move from one point to another through muscle contraction - these will be attached to the exoskeleton on the outer part of the arthropod.
The spider&rsquo;s exoskeleton is composed of different cuticle layers - that are made from chitin (polysaccharide) and
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/cell3.htm">proteins</a>
. This allows the cuticle structure to be layered like a
<a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question154.htm">plywood</a>
grain.
Therefore, the cuticle structure is very strong for protection while also preventing the spider from losing fluids excessively and drying out. This would in turn prevent effective movement in the arthropod.
But the cuticle won&rsquo;t grow like the human tissue or bones (endoskeleton) and thus it must be shed off as the spider continues to develop and grow. But spider molting mainly happen when the spider is in its younger years - but other may molt all its life.</p>
<ol>
<li>When time is ready, the spider&rsquo;s body (directed by its hormones) will absorb a part of its cuticle layer (particularly the lower layer) in its exoskeleton.</li>
<li>In addition, the spider&rsquo;s body will also start generating a new cuticle layer to create another exoskeleton. So, the emerging exoskeleton will be folded slightly to allow it to expand when the spider sheds off the old exoskeleton.</li>
<li>The spider will inject a molting fluid at the areas separating the new and old exoskeleton. The fluid allows easy separation of the two exoskeletons by create a gap between them.</li>
<li>Next, the spider bust out to shed its old exoskeleton. To achive this, the animals tend to raise the heart rate and thus pumping more blood (hemolymph) into its cephalothorax from their abdomen.</li>
<li>Therfeore the hemolymph&rsquo;s pressure forced the older exoskeleton to crack while the spider continues to flex their muscle to make its old exoskeleton to molt.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Invertebrates and vertebrates follow the Hallers Rule when considering the body size and brain comparison. For example, the ant&rsquo;s brain makes up 15% of its body mass. But, the difference is considerably bigger in spiders -m as outline din this
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467803911000727"><em>Arthropod Structure &amp; Development study</em></a>
.
Spiders are tiny arachnids that seem to be very intelligent for their small sized-body in web-weaving (some being even below 1 millimeter in body length). You can control them using
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-spider-spray-for-indoors/">spider sprays</a>
of
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-spiders/">spider foggers</a>
.
<strong>But, do spiders have brains? Well, technically, spiders have no brains in the manner anatomy defines &ldquo;brains&rdquo;. However, the arachnids have neural/ nerve cell clusters filling up many spaces in the spider&rsquo;s cephalothorax. Notably, the&quot;brains&quot; of some spiders like Jumping spiders tend to extend down in their legs.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-brains">Details: Do Spiders Have Brains??</h2>
<p>It would require a big brain for the small spiders to have such magnificent web-weaving prowess and weave webs that are even bigger than the arachnids.
A recent
<a href="http://www.stri.si.edu/english/scientific_staff/staff_scientist/scientist.php?id=10">spider brain study</a>
by Bill Eberhard analyzed 9 species of spiders across 6 web-weaving groups. The outcomes of the study was that the spider&rsquo;s body was inversely proportional to its brain size. Thus, smaller spiders have relatively larger brains.</p>
<p>In addition, for various spiders, their central nervous system occupied about 80% of their body spaces - it may also fill up the arachnid&rsquo;s legs as shown below. Check
<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110603-spiders-spare-legs-webs-science-animals/">how spiders evolved its spare legs</a>
.</p>
<p>Further, the body of the spider, like
*Leucauge mariana, *
filled with its brain continue to grow and develop up to when it becomes an adult.
You&rsquo;ll notice that some of the immature and tiny spiders tend to have a bulging and deformed body due to having an excess spider brain.
However, the adult spiders won&rsquo;t have a bulge. This is because its brain cell will still remain relatively small. The brain cell will have nucleus containing all the genes of the spider - which occupy space.
Further, the axons and nerve fiber diameters can&rsquo;t be reduced - even for the young spiders, since if they&rsquo;re overly thin it&rsquo;ll affect the flow of ions carrying nerve signals. Therefore, additional space would be given to the spider&rsquo;s nervous system.</p>
<h2 id="too-much-spider-brain-for-a-small-body">Too Much Spider Brain for a Small Body?</h2>
<p>Definitely, you won&rsquo;t consider that the spider&rsquo;s brain tends to take up too much body space at the disadvantage of other of its organs. This aspect is yet to be examined scientifically.
However, by examining the spiders physically, you&rsquo;d notice that the animals are definitely making a trade off to have a big brain spread even all over its legs.
A example of this is the Phidippus clarus spider that has been seen to have its digestive system (particularly of the adult jumping spider) is positioned in the animal&rsquo;s cephalothorax (the body and head cavity).
However, for the baby Phidippus clarus, the cephalothorax is fully filled with the brain and thus the young one now tends to have its digestive system being less developed.

<h2 id="how-heavy-is-the-spiders-brain">How Heavy is the Spider&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brain&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>The Hallers rule states that as an animal&rsquo;s body size reduces, the more its proportion of its body taken by its body increases. For example, 2-3% of the human&rsquo;s body mass is composed of the brain.
Further, scientifically, the tiny animal brains take up 15% of the creatures biomass - however, some spiders tend to be much smaller comparatively.
However, brain cells also need high amounts of energy. Thus, the spiders will be converting most of the food they take up into brain power.
From a Costa Rica and Panama study on the spider&rsquo;s brain extension, researchers resolved that the Nephila clavipes had a weight that&rsquo;s a 400,000 multiple of� the small spiders.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-large-spider-brains-help-in-spinning-webs">How Do Large Spider Brains Help In Spinning Webs?</h2>
<p>Its a key presumption that spiders require a large brain to create to super complicated webs. This is relatively true to some extend but not for all the spider species.
For example, the kleptoparasitic spiders have eveolved and are unable to spin their webs and so they steal such webs from other spiders. However, these kleptoparasitic spiders do not have a smaller brain compared to other spiders.
On the other hand, the researcher noted that the spiders require to be smart to become stealthy and sneaky - and thus this shows why the kleptoparasitic and other stealing spiders have a big brain too just like the web-weaving spiders.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For along time, scientific evidence considered that spiders are dominated by touch and sight. But the characteristics of these arachnids can be both terrifying and impressive.</p>
<p>**So, do spiders have ears? Spiders don&rsquo;t have ears or eardrums but jumping spiders can hear **
**sounds even from 5 meters away. **
<strong>A recent�study show that spiders�have tiny sensitive hairs to detect sound.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-ears">Details: Do Spiders Have Ears?</h2>
<p>According to the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/13/spiders-dont-have-ears-but-they-can-still-hear-you-coming">Paul Shamble research</a>
, their study showed that spiders have acute hearing senses. These insects, despite lacking ears and eardrums, will hear sounds from far distances.
Definitely, the research notes that the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s eardrums are small but its sensitive leg hairs will help the insect to detect sounds. Current research shows spiders will hear humans clap and talk in 5 meters.

<h2 id="spiders-legs-are-sensitive-to-sound-waves">Spider&rsquo;s Legs Are Sensitive To Sound Waves</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">Past knowledge</a>
suggested that the hairs on the spiders legs are sensitive to sound waves plus other airborne vibrations - but they said this was limited to sounds only near the spider&rsquo;s body length.
Definitely, most researchers had not realized that the spiders would also interpret the sound waves to a neural activity - this implies that the arachnids could actually hear the sound waves not just sensing even when the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-sleep/">spiders are resting</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="deeper-recording-than-just-visual-information">Deeper Recording than Just Visual Information</h2>
<p>The study conducted on
<em>hidippus audax (jumping spiders)</em>
where the researcher were doing neural brains recordings for the spiders analyzing their processes of processing visual data.
However, Menda conducted an analysis deeper into the spider&rsquo;s brain as
<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/log/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">outlined in this study</a></p>
<ul>
<li>this was unlike their norm in the previous research on the spider&rsquo;s visuals.
When Menda was moving from the spiders, the chair did some squeaking in the laboratory floor. The spider&rsquo;s neurons fired with the chair squeaking - they could hear a &lsquo;pop&rsquo; sound. Again the neural recordings fired again.
To clarify their discovery, the researchers did clap as they moved away from the spider to check when the neurons firing would stop. But the neurons firing continued up to 5 meters from the spider.
<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/log/post/that-spider-in-the-corner-can-hear-you-from-across-the-room">Menda</a>
reported that the accidental discovery had just enabled the researchers to begin a new journey into testing the spider&rsquo;s hearing capability.

<h2 id="testing-spiders-hair-using-water-droplets">Testing Spiders Hair using Water Droplets</h2>
<p>Menda and team went on to determine the spider&rsquo;s hearing capability by placing some droplets of water on the insects legs - the main was to reduce the vibrations that would happen on the hairs.
But the spider&rsquo;s auditory neurons could no fire - which would mean the arachnid could not hear. Tests showed spiders were sensitive to sounds at low frequencies (80 Hz -130 Hz) like for wasps&rsquo; wing-beats.
However, even with their slight haring, spiders won&rsquo;t hear like human do - this is because their brain process such information in a different way.
The researchers are now examining if spider species like fishing spiders and wolf spider show similar reaction on sound waves - as shown in

<p>When fear comes - particularly when attached by spiders, you&rsquo;ll definitely scream but can the arachnids hear you? However, first, vibrations and visuals, are more pronounced.
Previously, researchers thought that spiders could only hear sounds and noises that are just around the insects body. Spiders will smell, taste but will sense vibrations (on hearing) via tiny holes nand hairs all over its body.
Some spiders species such as Phidippus audax and jumping spider do hear noises and sounds that are up to 5 meters away from the spider.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiders, being over 48,000� species, are an essential section of the earth ecosystem. These arthropods possess the
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33989-9_2">open circulatory system</a>
that is, they lack &ldquo;true blood&rdquo; or veins to transport it. But, do spiders have hearts?</p>
<p><strong>The simple **
<strong>answer</strong>
** is, Yes, spiders have 1 tube-like heart in its abdomen with one artery that carry hemolymph (spiders blood) and ostia (one-way valve) on its sides. However, the spider&rsquo;s heart has no capillaries.�</strong>
<strong>Spiders have the open circulatory system. The animal&rsquo;s heart thus pumps the hemolymph into the sinuses and body cavity soaking its organs and tissues to give them hormones, nutrients, and oxygen.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-hearts">Details: Do Spiders Have Hearts??</h2>
<p>Spiders have the open circulatory system, which is different from that in mammals that have the closed circulatory system. The spiders has 1 heart that&rsquo;s a muscular tube pumping the hemolymph into the open circuit.
The spider&rsquo;s bodies like the
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=OCypCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=Spiders+Have+Hearts&amp;ots=kd5ld9canM&amp;sig=BTTnLEI9RYd9m76MSBHlSGRYGIo">Brown recluse</a>
will be filled with the arthropod&rsquo;s haemolymph that&rsquo;s pumped via arteries into the sinuses (openings) that surround various internal organs. The arthropod&rsquo;s blood would diffuse into the� individual cells and later collected into the spider&rsquo;s heart.
Related:
Do Spiders Have Brains?</p>
<p>Therefore, the spiders won&rsquo;t have definite veins that&rsquo;ll transport the arthropod&rsquo;s Haemocyanin (blood) in the body. The Haemolymph has haemocyanin as opposed to the mammalian Haemolymph .
Haemocyanin has copper molecules compared to hemoglobin that contains iron molecules - the spider&rsquo;s blood have a blue coloration.
But Haemolymph carry more oxygen - actually 17 times more than Haemocyanin. In addition, Haemocyanin has no cells like those in mammalia blood.</p>
<h2 id="human-blood-cells-vs-spider-blood-cells">Human Blood Cells Vs Spider Blood Cells</h2>
<h2 id="bloodcirculationin-spiders">BloodCirculationin Spiders</h2>
<p>The heart of the spider is situated in abdomen, not� cephalothorax, which is on the upper section. This is also evident in other species having a abdominal cuticle that&rsquo;s pale-colored. Check the
best spider spray for indoors
to control the athropods.
Also, its enclosed by a membrane that&rsquo;s thin just like the pericardium around the mammalian heart. The spider&rsquo;s heart will pump the haemolymph via the pedicel then to its cephalothorax through the anterior aorta (large artery).
To guarantee that the blood flows in one-way, the spider&rsquo;s heart has simple valves. Also, the spider has a 30 to 200 heart rate (beats in every minute) varying with level of activity or species.</p>
<ol>
<li>Negative pressure is what will allow the spider&rsquo;s haemolymph to return in its heart - this particularly occurs when the heart relaxes in between the beats.</li>
<li>But the haemolymph that&rsquo;s pump[ed into the spiders cephalothorax is moved via unique channels though pedicel whenver the blood pressure is high in its cephalothorax compared to that in the abdomen.</li>
<li>Further, the haemolymph would collect in the lacunae prior to diffusing into the lamellae of the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-lungs/">book lungs</a>and taken up via the heart&rsquo;s tissue spaces� getting in through the ostia (tiny holes).</li>
<li>The secondary�haemolymph pumping is great since there exists cephalothorax muscles that&rsquo;ll expand and compress to allow easy movement of the spider&rsquo;s legs.</li>
<li>Every cephalothorax compression makes the haemolymph that has lost oxygen back via the pedicle moving towards the book lungs for gas exchange and finally getting back to the spider&rsquo;s heart.</li>
<li>However, researchers noted that when the spider moves its legs vigorously, its<a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:871756">heart rate will increase</a>due to a rise in pressure of the haemolymph in the spider&rsquo;s cephalothorax that increase fluid flow into the abdomen.</li>
<li>This on the other hand reduces the flow of haemolymph into the cephalothorax from the abdomen through the spider&rsquo;s anterior aorta. This, therefore, makes the heart rate to slow down as a compensation mechanism.

</ol>
<h2 id="what-makes-up-the-spider-haemolymph">What Makes up the Spider Haemolymph?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s haemolymph is pale blue in colour since it doen&rsquo;t have haemoglobin (iron molecules containing) in the human blood is the red color matter.
However, the haemolymph contain haemocyanin that carry oxygen and contain copper - making it look blue in color.
But the haemolymph is almost similar to the human lymph which tends to diffuse via the human tissues and finally returns to your circulatory system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Haemolymph cells will help carry oxygen around the spider&rsquo;s body. However, cells also assist in reducing bleeding (just like the mammalian thrombocytes) due to tiny injuries like losing a leg - this encourages faster healing. However, losing a abdomen may be fatal to the spider.</li>
<li>The blood cells in the spider&rsquo;s haemolymph is created in the walls of your arthropods heart - her&rsquo;e you&rsquo;ll find the prohaemocytes cells.

However., for spiders having 1 pair of the book lungs, its considered that the second one evolved into a tracheae system (fine tubes) looking like the bronchial and trachea systems in human lungs. To control the arthropods, use
spider foggers.
But these will be kept open using the chitin as opposed to cartilage in humans. However, they have 1 0r 2 spiracles (openings) that are positioned in abdomen&rsquo;s under-side between the spider&rsquo;s book lungs and spinnerets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012814043700025X">Spiders</a>
(in the Arachnida class) are feared by humans for their poisonous bites. However, most spiders are quite harmless - denoting their great diverse family of 38,000 known species.</p>
<p>Arachnids that closely resemble spiders include mites, ticks, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion">scorpions</a>
. We know that
spiders don&rsquo;t &ldquo;sleep
&ldquo;,
have no bones
, plus have a
long tubular and masculine heart
. But, do spiders have lungs?
<strong>The short answer is, YES, spiders have either 1 or 2 pairs of book lungs. The arachnids breathe through their book lungs or trachea - these are the very narrow tubes laid all through the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>&rsquo;s body.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-lungs">Details: Do Spiders Have Lungs??</h2>
<p>Spiders have either 1 or 2 &ldquo;book lungs&rdquo; pairs for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_organ">respiration</a>
. These kind of lungs look like
book pages as they have
hollow,
soft, and
thin plates that flap to the air via small openings on abdomen of spider.
The spider&rsquo;s blood (the
Hemolymph
) pass across the lung plate&rsquo;s
inner surface to allow exchange of
oxygen with
carbon dioxide between the spider and its
atmosphere.
The spider&rsquo;s book lungs offers the
big surface area to allow appropriate
gas exchange. Some
tarantulas have surface area of the book lungs being about a
square
27.6 inches (
70 cm
).
The
opening slips in the book lungs tend to
contract and expand but won&rsquo;t close completely. However, during intense spider activity, the slits on the
book lung will open fully.</p>
<h2 id="how-book-lungs-promote-spiders-respiration">How Book Lungs Promote Spider&rsquo;s Respiration</h2>
<p>The book lungs are located in the open-ventral abdominal atrium (the air-filled cavity) and is linked to the environment via the small slits on the side of the abdomen.
The spider&rsquo;s book lung plates - in their unfolded form - contain hemolymph. The folds work to increase the surface area of the lungs and the air it&rsquo;ll contact - allowing better gas exchanged. But most spider species won&rsquo;t require movement of plates to allow effective respiration.
However, some spiders may lack the book lungs but still undertake gaseous exchange through the thin walls in the abdominal cavity and the

Definitely, the spider&rsquo;s trachea seems to have developed from its book lungs since it has super elongated chambers. Thus, other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnid">arachnids</a>
like harvestmen (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiliones">Opiliones</a>

will do gassoue exchange via tracheae or even just the body surfaces.
Arachnids without book lungs are called apulmonate arachnids and they include

<p>For the
<a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Invertebrates/Horseshoe-Crab">horseshoe crabs</a>
(in males and females), you&rsquo;ll notice book gills similar to what is in spiders. Researchers opine that book lungs developed from the
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467803915000353">book gills</a></p>
<ul>
<li>but you&rsquo;ll find these externally.
The genital operculum is the front flap� but it has no gills. Notably, the flap-like book gills seem to have developmned from legs and they allow respiration when the animal is under water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-spiders-breathe-underwater">How Do Spiders Breathe Underwater?</h2>
<p>Some spiders like Scuba spider use their web like gills to breather when they&rsquo;re under water. Others like the Argyroneta aquatica will breathe via fine�abdomenal hairs to bubbles floating on the water surface.
Some diving-bell spider use their web like a gill for breathing - particularly when they get under water. For example,
<a href="http://www.activetouch.de/index.php?id=38">Stefan Hetz</a>
and
<a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/roger.seymour">Roger Seymour</a>
conducted a study using 12 spiders to note that the spiders used their web like their gill when they&rsquo;re under water.
The web is silk like and will enable oxygen to move from the environment near the ware and get to the spider while also allowing carbon dioxide to get back to the environment.
Seymour reported that the diving-bell spiders could survive for over 24 hours under water. Therefore, these arachnids will easily hide from their prey and predators.</p>
<h2 id="how-sea-spiders-breathe-without-gills-orlungs">How Sea Spiders Breathe Without� Gills or�Lungs</h2>
<p>Many strange creatures exist in the cold Antarctic depths  particularly under the Antarctic ice. Giant sea spiders are the strangest of them all. Definitely, the Antarctic spider species will grow very big while the normal sea spiders are usually small in size.
In addition, these Antarctic spiders have even more strange internal organs. For example, youll find a section of their guts and even all their genitals in their legs. Further, they have a very weak
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-hearts/">heart</a>
and thus it cant pump its blood (hemolymph) in its body.
Therefore, the spiders will only pump the hemolymph via their guts movement as opposed to just relying on their heart for pumping the blood. Definitely, there are additional queries on these spiders but on how the undertake gaseous exchange is a critical issue.
While at it, lobsters, crabs and fish use gills for gaseous exchanges. In this, water will flow over the gills to absorb the available oxygen. However, worms on land or at sea will generally absorb the oxygen via their skin.
However, for sea spiders  they lack lungs or gills while their skin is just
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-bones/">the exoskeleton  but no internal bones</a>
which is thick to allow oxygen absorption. �However, the sea spiders have many pores what they use for respiration.</p>

<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/trapdoor-spiders-australia-africa">for flying across oceans</a>
on long strands of silk  without wings!
<em><strong>Well, what about winged spiders? Do these exist? No, not really. There are no known species of <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> with fully developed wings capable of powered flight in any way comparable to that of insects or birds.�</strong></em>
<em><strong>However there is one genus (Palystes) whose females possess wing-like projections called apomoses which cover their reproductive organs and sometimes also extend beyond them. These structures serve only as protective covers and are not used for flight.�</strong></em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spider Killers&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-have-wings">Details: Do Spiders Have Wings?</h2>
<p>Most insects have wings, but spiders dont. There are winged species of jumping spider (Salticidae) but these do not have wings in any way comparable to that of insects or birds and so they can&rsquo;t fly either.
The jumping spiders&rsquo; wings are actually a very thin layer of chitin, which is the substance that covers their exoskeleton.
The spider&rsquo;s thorax and head comprise what would be called the cephalothorax in other arthropods (such as crustaceans) and thus wings can&rsquo;t be incorporated into the body plan
Some spiders, called &ldquo;ballooners,&rdquo; use the earth&rsquo;s electric field as it would a compass to lift their bodies into the air on long strands of silk - but they&rsquo;re often attracted by light sources which can cause them to fly into flower-like structures or be trapped in clothing!
The spider can then use this silk to trap particles in the surrounding atmosphere for it to float on. This is a form of transportation known as &ldquo;ballooning.&rdquo;

<h2 id="do-spiders-glide">Do spiders glide?</h2>
<p>Spiders like arboreal tarantulas are excellent jumping�- known to glide from tree to tree - and they might grow glider wings over million�of years.
Also,
<em>Selenops change their whole</em>
body into some airfoil and they&rsquo;ll glide for a long time.
Gliding is a great way for spiders (and other arthropods) to escape from predators, and it&rsquo;s also a good means of transportation if they need go long distances!
Some spiders can even use
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">changes in wind currents</a>
or tree branches like stepping stones across gaps too wide for jumping.

<h3 id="how-spider-silk-help-in-flight">How Spider Silk help in flight?</h3>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s silk is the strongest known natural material. It&rsquo;s stronger in some ways than steel and Kevlar, yet it&rsquo;s light as a feather!
Spiders can make silk straight from liquid to solid by spinning out of their mouths or rear ends. The spider makes its own glue when needed, just like you might use Elmers glue from a jar.
Spider silk is made mostly of protein. The spider spins the silk using tiny spigots on its abdomen called spinnerets. Through ballooning, a spider will use the silk�to make voyage cross-ocean journeys!
A few spiders have been found that live in the snowy mountains of Alaska.
Its not surprising they are able to survive so far north, because some species balloon as high as 15 miles into the atmosphere with just their silk and then float back down on air currents.

<h3 id="why-wont-spiders-fly">Why Won&rsquo;t Spiders Fly?</h3>
<p>Spiders�show varied behaviors�and lifestyles compared to other insects. For example, while many insects can use their wings to fly and some spiders do ballooning behavior.
A spiders body is covered in tiny hairs called setae that are too small for the human eye to see. These setae help them sense when they touch something or even if a potential predator has touched or grabbed them!
Some spiders are active during the day and others at night. Some can live on trees, some in sand dunes, or even high up near mountain peaks where it is cold enough to snow!

<h3 id="what-if-spiders-had-wings">What If Spiders Had Wings?</h3>
<p>If spiders had wings, they could fly from one place to another. Unlike other insects that can only use their wings for limited periods of time, a spiders setae would allow it to stay in the air all day long!
If�the spiders could fly, they would be able to find mates much more easily. They could also escape from predators!
But humans would be able to find them much more easily around the house and spaces, so it would not be as safe (they&rsquo;d be nightmare bugs).
The spiders would feed on many pests - comparable to bats, but wouldn&rsquo;t be able to clean up the mess like bats.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do Spiders Have Wings? Well, they don&rsquo;t have wings, b
ut can spiders fly? Yes! Some spiders use the earth&rsquo;s electric field as it would a compass to lift their bodies into the air on long strands of silk - this is called ballooning.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Spiders Pee? Animals, unlike plants, must all &ldquo;urinate&rdquo; despite undertaking the process in different ways. Urinating allow removal of unwanted salts, nitrogen, and also maintain water balance in their bodies.</p>
<p>In humans, the urination process starts in the kidney while the bladder stores the urine (nitrogenous urea waste plus water) in liquid form before its ejected.
**So, do spiders pee? The short answer is, NO, spiders don&rsquo;t urinate like humans. But spiders poop-pee uric acid (from malpighian tubules akin to kidneys) that is semi-solid and won&rsquo;t dissolve in water. **
<strong>Simply, spiders won&rsquo;t deposit urine and feces separately like humans. Spiders release the waste in a combined form (feces plus urine) through the anus.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-do-spiders-pee-urinate-7-spider-faqs">Details: Do Spiders Pee? Urinate? 7 Spider FAQs</h2>
<p>Spiders have malpighian tubules (comparable to mammalian kidneys) that&rsquo;ll remove the nitrogenous waste in form of uric acid. The malpighian tubules will drain into the stercoral pocket (a pouch in its digestive tract).
However, unlike human urine, the uric acid is near-solid and won&rsquo;t dissolve in water. Spiders pee-poop that&rsquo;s semi-solid help them avoid losing water through their urine.
In the stercoral pocket, the uric acid is mixed with solid waste coming from the spiders digestive tract to form the semi-solid poop-pee that come out combined through the anus.</p>
<h2 id="conserves-water-with-uric-acid">Conserves Water with Uric Acid</h2>
<p>Insects and spiders will change their nitrogenous waste into uric acid - which is an insoluble and contains minimal water - as a water conservation method for the spider.
Comparatively, flying insects and birds produce dry &lsquo;urine&rsquo;that has uric acid since they avoiding a bladder with water helps them cut their weight.

<h2 id="do-spiders-drink-water">Do Spiders Drink Water?</h2>
<p>Simple answer is, YES, spiders drink water. While in the wild environment, the spiders will drink from droplets on the ground of vegetation. Further, they can drink from evening or morning dew that&rsquo;s hanging on the spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>However, for the caged spiders, you should offer them fresh water using objects like small dish, damp sponge or bottle cap including for the tarantulas species. The Tarantulas will also drink the droplets of water gathered on foliage or leaves around them.
Despite that spiders do drink water must not make you think that the arachnids live in drains. For a spider that&rsquo;s inside the house, the best water sources is water droplets from shower or tap , sink edges, or plugholes.
Definitely,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spiders can&rsquo;t drown</a>
but may remain trapped in the bath or sink due to being too steep or slippery. The whistling spider species creates a silk layer for their long burrow to ensure it remains humid and hydrated.
Raindrops dew can also provide a water sources for some spider species. Garden spider, wolf spider and wolf spider tend to get water from drinking the morning dew. They&rsquo;ll take the water from dew via mound (silk-covered) at the door of their hideout.
Some spider species also drink nectar from the garden plants particularly when there are limited water sources such as rain, dew or tap water. Spider species like the whip spider use their pincers to suck water from sources like dew or nectar flowers.</p>
<h2 id="some-spiders-dont-drink-water">Some Spiders Don&rsquo;t Drink Water</h2>
<p>The red back and black widow (
while they&rsquo;re not all venomous
), interestingly, don&rsquo;t drink water like humans or other spiders. These spiders get most of their required body fluids from sucking their prey.
These are comparable to mammals such as the koalathat don&rsquo;t drink water but derive their fluids from eating eucalyptus (smooth-barked) among other plan leaves.

poop and pee is mixed together</p>
<ul>
<li>through their malpighian tubules to eliminate the nitrogenous waste. So, its fact that spiders don&rsquo;t generate urine but will have the near-solid uric acid.</li>

that are unwanted indoors.
The spider&rsquo;s pee-poop is small light brown, cream, or white colored that will appear like round drops. On size, these droppings measure around 1/16 - 1/8 an inch in diameter. Further, the spider&rsquo;s poop mainly contains guanine - just like in the DNA.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us fear spiders (unless it&rsquo;s a pet <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a>) because
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">their spider bites are largely poisonous</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if any homeowner sees some insect poop around the house, they worry that they could have spiders around.
<strong>But, do spiders poop? Yes, after feeding and digestion happen, spiders will poop to release their body&rsquo;s waste. The spider poop will be the size of a pinhead (thick liquid) and they have a gray, black, brown, or white color.�</strong></li>
<li>After drying, the spider poop may stain the surface, the floor, and the walls.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-spiders-poop-spider-droppings-and-feces">Do Spiders Poop? Spider Droppings and Feces</h2>
<p>As summarized above, spiders will poop� (just like other animals) after eating their popular food; which is the tiny insects. The poop they release is simply body waste.</p>
<ul>
<li>But spiders feed on tiny insects and they don&rsquo;t poop as often as large animals like mammals - which means that you might not catch the spiders in action releasing their body waste.
The metabolic rate of spiders (like the
tarantula
) is quite slow and thus they&rsquo;re able to feed on the tiny insects but will defecate a few times in a given time.</li>
<li>Some of these spider species may feed just once a month and thus with a slow metabolic rate, they&rsquo;ll require less eating and thus lesser pooping.
On structure and size, spider poop is comparable to bird poop - but on color, it&rsquo;s white (when wet) but will turn to light-brown or cream after drying.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-the-shape-size-and-color-of-spider-poop">What&rsquo;s the Shape, Size, and Color of Spider Poop?</h2>
<p>As noted above, spider poop will look something close to the shape, size, and color of the bird&rsquo;s poop - but smaller in size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiders&rsquo; poop will have black stains but whitish in color when it&rsquo;s wet - white liquid.
The spider poop stains are anything around 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch in their diameter. However, once dried, the spider poop will turn black, light brown, or grey.</li>
<li>However, the shape, size, and color of the spider poop will be different depending on the spider species.
For context, some spider species that are large-sized such as the tarantula produce poop that is large - the poop is also less viscous but very water - and hence it tends to dry faster.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="locations-to-check-forspider-poop">Locations to check for<strong>Spider Poop�</strong></h2>
<p>So, which exact locations will you find the spider poop around the house or in the yard?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, note that you&rsquo;ll mainly find the spider poop around the areas that the spiders will frequent.
Notably, the spiders will make their webs and poop around places that have less traffic such as the corners of the garage, ceiling, under the sink, cabinets, garage, and house.</li>
<li>You can also find the spider pop on surfaces such as skirting boards, windowsills, floors, and walls.
The Tarantulas poop will mainly be dropped on walls and glass in their boxed enclosure.</li>
<li>However, the arboreal tarantulas will love to drop their waste in places such as an enclosure door�while other species like the water bowls.
Because these places have less traffic, the spider will settle in the locations so that their insect traps won&rsquo;t be disturbed. Thus, you&rsquo;re likely to get more spider poop here.
Spider poop is largely liquid and viscous in nature since it&rsquo;s made up of spider poop mixed with its pee - which is actually uric acid.</li>
<li>However, spider webs will be created from silk - which is largely protein-based and produced from the silk glands of the spider.
Compared to the spider poo that&rsquo;s mainly undigested food materials that are released from the spider&rsquo;s anus, spider silk is released from the spinnerets that are also around the insect&rsquo;s anus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-times-willspiders-poop">How Many Times Will<strong>Spiders Poop?�</strong></h2>
<p>Spiders have different rates and times of releasing their poop depending on the species. Some species that can show the difference in pooping are the jumping spider and the tarantula.</p>
<ul>
<li>As outlined, spiders with slow metabolism rates will definitely excrete less often and thus you&rsquo;ll find less spider poop in their hiding areas.
For example, there are spider species that&rsquo;ll poop once a day or even in a month - this may vary with the spider&rsquo;s health, their living conditions, and availability of small insects for their food.</li>
<li>Another fun fact is that spider may use their poop to keep off their predators - mainly because the spider poop has a pungent smell that wades off other animals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-safe-is-spider-poop-toxic">How Safe is Spider Poop? Toxic?</h2>
<p>Bites from some common spiders tend to be venomous mainly due to the antimicrobials in their blood and venom but are spider poop toxic? Well, simply stated spider poop is never toxic.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, most animal droppings could be dangerous as they may carry parasites, viruses, and bacteria but<a href="https://www.illinoispoisoncenter.org/my-child-ate-poop">spider poop is classified as less toxic</a>.
But it has
<a href="https://www.pctonline.com/article/pct1013-spider-poop/">been reported that</a>
poop from the Black Widow may bring pathogenic bacteria if it is eaten by flies.</li>
<li>Despite that spider ear insects like flies, most of their poop is non-toxic.</li>
<li>Otherwise, they would transmit pathogens such as Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, or Salmonella spp.
Notably, the antimicrobial cap[abilities that are normally in the venom of a spider are often removed by the poop&rsquo;s bacterias.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-clean-or-remove-the-spider-poop"><strong>How to Clean or Remove the Spider Poop�</strong></h2>
<p>To clean the spider droppings, you&rsquo;ll require just some paper towel, cloth, and some water.</p>
<ul>
<li>But it&rsquo;s best you clean the spider poop very soon because delay may make it leave some yellow stain on the fabric.
But if the spider poop leaves a prominent yellow stain, you can remove it with some aggressive stain cleaners or removers.</li>
<li>The poop from tarantulas spiders could be challenging to clean largely because their droppings may be cluttered.
I suggest you use some long tweezers or tongs to hold the clothe or wet tissue that has been dipped into some water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Further, the spider poop will also be dropped tother with a bolus - I can describe this as the web and part of the flesh of the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/">tiny insects like bed bugs</a>
that the spider ate.</p>

go into non-action up-to 6 months without a meal (by reducing energy use). But the spider will spring into action when a prey appears.</p>
<p><strong>But do spiders sleep? Spiders don&rsquo;t sleep like humans but have circadian rhythms - rest &amp; activity cycles. Spiders lack eyelids and don&rsquo;t close their eyes like humans.�</strong>
<strong>During the resting phase, spiders conserve energy during the day and cold areas by lowering the metabolic rate and cutting their activity - how spiders hibernate during winter. But spiders are more highly active at night so as to avoid predators such as birds at day time.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-do-spiders-sleep"><strong>How Do Spiders Sleep?</strong></h2>
<p>In hibernation mode, the arachnids will lower their metabolic rates while also tucking in their legs. Most
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=oJxVDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP6&amp;dq=do+Spiders+Sleep&amp;ots=0sDheMGg5e&amp;sig=BlRRfLwk_a-nKhGyTSZ31hwIiJU">spider species</a>
will be active mainly at night. In addition, these arachnids will hibernate during the cold season.
Do spiders sleep?�To a curious mind, it would make sense that a creature with 8 eyes would need to sleep from time to time. However, do spiders sleep? The answer to this is fascinating and shrouded in mystery as demonstrated below
The fact that spiders do not have eyelids suggests that spiders rest, just not in the way we do but in their own unique way. Spiders have daily cycles of rest and activity. They cant shut their eyelids but their body reduces activity levels and lowers their metabolic rate to conserve energy.</p>
<h2 id="science-behind-sleep-hibernation-in-spiders">Science behind Sleep (Hibernation) in Spiders</h2>
<p>There is scanty research on the science behind animal sleep. However, studies suggest that animals have a cardiac rhythm which is determined by the time of day. Animals are either nocturnal (active at night) or diurnal (active during day time).
During their inactive phase, the creatures tend to burrow and experience a drop in their metabolic activity rate. During cold seasons, spiders curl their legs and reduce their metabolic rate even as they stay huddled together in cocoons during the coldest months of the year.</p>
<h2 id="do-spiders-crawl-in-mouth-while-sleeping">Do Spiders Crawl in Mouth While Sleeping?</h2>
<p>The fact that spiders are capable of such hibernation means that they can do so in short bursts on a day to day basis to give the impression of sleep. As the spider encounters a period of low food availability and harsh climatic conditions, they enter hibernation mode to conserve energy.
When the spiders are resting,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-brains/">their brains</a>
will be working round the clock. For example, they&rsquo;ll feel even the smallest vibration with their great tactile sense. In addition, they&rsquo;ll react in case of danger of when one of their prey gets stuck on their web.</p>
<h2 id="spiders-species---differences-in-sleeping">Spiders Species - Differences in sleeping?</h2>
<p>The spider&rsquo;s brain is a little different from the human brain. Therefore, the arachnids won&rsquo;t get bored in their &ldquo;rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; mode. But some spiders may take naps at night.
But hunting spiders posses more powerful eyesight compared to those that build webs. for example, wolf spiders will attack and chase their prey.
Crab spiders will just sit around waiting to ambush their prey on the leaf and flower.�In addition, jumping spiders will use their great
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-ears/">hearing capability</a>
, intelligent and eyesight.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-of-the-arachnids">Lifestyle of the Arachnids</h2>
<p>Different spiders will &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; in their webs but some won&rsquo;t require the web traps against their prey. For example, the trapdoors build their tunnels and install doors (with hinges).
There are over 1000 spider species globally. For example, jumping spiders are computed to be about 5000 - which is roughly 13 % of all species of spiders.
The Salticidae family - particularly jumping spiders don&rsquo;t also create spider webs but will spin tether ropes if they&rsquo;re jumping. So, spiders will be quite at rest waiting for a suitable prey or while conserving energy.</p>
<h2 id="arachnidssnoring-andbody-language">Arachnids&rsquo;�Snoring and�Body Language</h2>
<p>In hibernation mode, the arachnids will lower their metabolic rates while also tucking in their legs. Therefore, the spiders will live longer with no food as they won&rsquo;t be burning calories - particularly at night and during the cold weather.
However, whenever you see a spider that has taken an odd position such as legs tucked plus lying on its back - it could be dead.�What about snoring in spiders? Well, spiders won&rsquo;t snore like human beings.
In fact, these insect will be hiding in wall crack among other protected areas. Further, for survival these arachnids will sleep, nest, and hunt out of predator&rsquo;s harm.

<p>Some factors like cold temperatures or circadian rhythms may make the spiders such as Agelenopsis aperta may pass out or remain unconscious - you might in fact think that the insects is dead.
In addition, some drugs like marijuana, caffeine, or chloral hydrate may make the spiders to pass out or it&rsquo;ll negatively affect the insect&rsquo;s web-making capability.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Spiders (Parasteatoda tepidariorum) popular as the American house spider or common house spider are classified under the
<a href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdf/IN/IN39400.pdf">Parasteatoda genus</a>
.</p>
<ul>
<li>House spiders mainly live in cosmopolitan areas and are described as synanthropic meaning they live near and in human dwellings.
House spiders are largely found indoors (in the house). Also, a spider and its webs will prove to be a nuisance in the house - which makes homeowners classify it as a challenging pest.</li>
<li>You mainly find house spiders in Canada and the United States but they are also in other areas worldwide.
In this article, I will outline the facts, physical appearance, and behaviors of the house spiders.
Let&rsquo;s dig in!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identification-of-the-house-spider">Identification of the House spider</h2>
<p>The house spiders will take shelter in man-made structures such as your home barns and sheds.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if you noticed many cobwebs around the house, then house spiders must be this first suspect.
The spiders have a bulbous abdomen and produce uniquely-tangled webs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mc3eU6MdI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mc3eU6MdI</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-body-shape">1. Body Shape</h3>
<p>The female House spiders have an elevated (almost spherical) abdomen and they measure about 5 mm to 8 mm in length.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the male house spiders have abdomens that are elongated and their body length is about 3.7 mm to 4.8 mm.
The spider will appear grey or brown but will have some dark Chevron markings on its body.
The eggs of a house spider hatch in one week leaving it to go through different Instar development.</li>
<li>The female house spiders will go through 7 instars while the males will go through 6 instars.
The ballooning process will then take place - it involves dispersing the spiderlings from the silk threads to other habitats.
The adult house spiders can live 4 for a year or more.
These adults will be brown or yellow in color with their abdomens being Grey (dark and brown-banded legs) and having white marks.</li>
<li>Another differentiating characteristic of the house spiders is that the males and females can live together and thus mate many times.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-color">2. Color</h3>
<p>House spiders are generally around or yellowish Brown in color.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its abdomen is dirty white in color and has a number of dark stripes that meet at an angle.
First, on reproduction, a female house spider will lay roughly 250 eggs that will be wrapped in around (brownish) silken suck that is shaped like a flask.</li>
<li>In its lifetime, the house spider will produce 3700 + eggs that will be put into about 15+ silken sacs.
The house spiders are non-threatening and small in size. The bites are painful but then it will only bite for self-defense.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-legs">3. Legs</h3>
<p>Spiders have eight legs with an elongated bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the characteristic color of the house spiders is yellow-brown or brown.
However, its legs will have dark-colored rings but will still be largely brown.
The eight-legged arachnid has two body segments and lacks both an antenna and wings.
The house spider has 2 palps (pedipalps or appendages) in front of its legs.
If you have noticed some house spiders that have long legs, then outside these are the cellar spiders mainly found in the basements and cellars - damp and dark areas.</li>
<li>In fact, due to their thin and long legs, people refer to these cellar spiders as &ldquo;daddy longlegs&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Canada and the United States have about 20 species of these cellar spiders.
On comparing the common house spider with brown recluse - here&rsquo;s my take;</li>
<li>A sure way of identifying the brown recluse is with its eyes -they have six eyes as opposed to 8 most spiders.</li>
<li>The Brown recluses abdomen lacks markings that you will find in the common house spider and also they have smooth legs.
The brown recluse will also mainly occupy the warmer, darker, and quieter location where they will feed and reproduce.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-house-spider-habitats">3. House Spider Habitats</h3>
<p>House spiders generally love and hide in dark places where they can easily trap insects (such as flies and
bed bugs
) and camouflage from predators.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the outdoor spaces, the house spiders will largely hide under leaves and around windows, particularly around light sources that tend to attract insects.</li>
<li>In the indoor spaces, house spiders will mainly hide in crawl spaces, garages, basements, window frame angles, inside closets, under furniture, and in the upper corners.
Finally, in the warehouse, the house spiders will hide in corners around those that are always open.
The house spiders select the location of their webs through trial and error.</li>
<li>Therefore, the spider webs may build up very fast and also attract a lot of dust in a short time - you&rsquo;ll also see many<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-poop/">spider droppings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="controlling-the-house-spiders">Controlling The House Spiders</h2>
<p>House spiders are generally not dangerous but they make many humans fearful.</p>
<ul>
<li>So to maintain your peace at home and avoid possible venomous attacks you need</li>
<li>to control the spiders in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-spray-spider-insecticides">1. Spray Spider Insecticides</h3>
<p>Spray the house and the surrounding structures with insecticides that are formulated for spiders.
But since the spiders have long legs, it is important to ensure that the spray touches the spider&rsquo;s body directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, avoid squashing the spiders since this could lead to the fastest production of spider eggs and spiderlings will be distributed all over.
If the space under consideration has some cracks, then you should spray on them since spiders can hide inside there.</li>
<li>Since the crack space is small, then the spray chemicals will easily get into contact with the spider&rsquo;s body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-remove-possible-pest-food-sources">2. Remove Possible Pest Food Sources</h3>
<p>Spiders don&rsquo;t eat human food but other pests and insects will and so it is important to remove the foods.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the best and various insects are well fed, then the spiders will also be full and hence reproduce better.
So clean up the various scrubs and open food sources that may be lying around.
I advise that you keep all the food containers well sealed, wash the counters, and wipe all the food crumbs.
Doing such cleaner consistently we&rsquo;ll keep off the insects since they have less food - this will also reduce the spiders in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-adopt-great-pest-prevention-methods">3. Adopt Great Pest Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>The house spiders primarily feed on bugs and insects that get into the house and hence it is important to prevent their entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the entry points into your house will include screen tears, crevices, cracks, or drainages.
Some of the excellent pest prevention methods you can adopt for this include repairing the leaks or broken screens and sealing up the cracks.</li>
<li>This will limit the foods (insects and bugs) that are available for the spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-use-glue-traps">4. Use Glue Traps</h3>
<p>For areas of the house where you are sure to have spiders walking around, I advise that you set up some quality glue traps.</p>
<ul>
<li>The glue traps must be set up in places such as the basement or ceiling where there is darkness.
Spiders have great vision and they will see insects that are trapped and will attempt to catch them.</li>
<li>As the spider attempts to eat the trapped insect, it will also be trapped by the glue.
But remember to position the glue traps in quiet, and dark places like near the beds and around baseboards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-vacuum-the-house-thoroughly">5. Vacuum the house thoroughly</h3>
<p>To prevent the entry and fast reproduction of spiders, I advise that you vacuum the house thoroughly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to vacuum the hard-to-reach places such as the door frames, window frames, and baseboards.
The vacuum machine will help kill the live spiders while sucking up the egg sacs and the spider webs.</li>
<li>The vibrations, chemicals, and trauma caused by the vacuuming process will kill the spiders fast.
Male spiders have real height inside crawl spaces, basements, closets, under furniture, and in the ceiling corners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-dangerous-are-the-house-spiders">How Dangerous Are The House Spiders?</h2>
<p>House spiders aren&rsquo;t dangerous humans but will cause considerable nuisance and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/">pain</a>
in case they bite - just like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/wolf-spiders/">the wolf spiders</a>
.
So these spiders won&rsquo;t cause considerable health damage to humans but they may make the house or various spaces feel unwelcoming.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spiders will trigger nervousness among the family members and sleeping off the webs will also be a demanding task.
You can do the spider control as a DIY Project but it is best you hire a professional with knowledge of the various spiders.</li>
<li>You can prevent the entry of spiders and various insects by sealing up cracks using some silicone-based caulk.
If house spiders have gained entry into the house, you should vacuum the spaces to remove the webs, egg sacs, and adult spiders.
Avoid using a broom only in the cleanup since most of the adult spiders will escape.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>House spiders may not pose a great health risk to humans (and like spiders such as the
black widow spiders
) but they are bites are painful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, their presence may cause nervousness among family members.
So it is important that you adopt effective prevention and control of the house spiders.</li>
<li>Prevention will involve filling up cracks that may allow spiders and insects to get into your spaces.</li>
<li>You can control the house spiders byusing spider bombs, spider sprays, and vacuuming.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite that spiders contribute highly to the ecosystem by eating harmful bugs like mosquitoes, they can be enormously unsettling in your homes.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will answer one of the most common questions asked by people: How much do <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> exterminators cost?
**In brief; **</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The cost of a spider <a href="/posts/how-much-is-an-exterminator-for-mice/">exterminator</a> varies depending on the size and type of pest control company. If you have an infestation, your best bet is to call several companies and get quotes before making a decision.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>The average cost for most types of spider extermination services in the United States is $200 - $300 per visit.</strong>
Spiders reproduce quickly - so find a spider exterminator for your house.

<h2 id="why-you-need-an-exterminator-for-spiders">Why You Need An Exterminator For Spiders?</h2>
<p>Spiders seem to pop up everywhere when you least expect them and then they make a silk trail on your shoe, your coffee table, or the kitchen counter.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if you find that spiders are becoming too much of a problem in your home, then I would advise getting an experienced spider exterminator.
<strong>Most of us fear spiders and know little about them</strong>
Most spiders in homes (
<a href="http://agrilifecdn.tamu.edu/elementaryinsects/files/2011/10/TEACHERS-BOOKLET_1.pdf">among the 35000 species</a>
) do not hurt humans. But there are some that can make people sick and give them
painful bites
.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides being painful, the spider bites from
<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/brown-recluse-spiders"><strong>brown recluse</strong></a>
or
<a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/spiders/black_widow_spider.htm"><strong>black widow</strong></a>
may cause reactions such as nausea, fever, persistent itching, and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t feel confident handling spiders on your own or you lack the necessary knowledge, seeking professional help is best.</p>
<ul>
<li>A pest control company or exterminator can help you understand the best ways to<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-spiders/">get rid of spiders</a>.</li>
<li>The spider exterminators will know the habits, diet, and behavior of most spider species.
The professionals will know what types of pesticides work against spider infestations and they&rsquo;ll be able to take care of your problem quickly, safely, and efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-hire-a-professional-spider-exterminator">When to Hire a Professional Spider Exterminator</h2>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve seen a single or few spiders around and you&rsquo;re wondering is it time I called the exterminator?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s important to know the type and number of spiders that you can handle along and when you need to make that call to your exterminator for help with spider control.
**Hire a Spider Exterminator? **
If you can observe the spider and figure out which type it is - harmless or poisonous, then it&rsquo;ll be easy to determine if you should call the exterminator.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just an average, harmless spider in the house then there is no need for any help at all from pest control specialists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, the market hasspider trapsand catchers that enable spider control without touching or coming near the bug.
A spider catcher is a tool that is used for catching and releasing spiders.</li>
<li>A spider catcher usually consists of a long pole with a loop at the end, which can be either an open or closed hoop. The very tip of this rod has soft bristles - what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;the hook&rdquo;.
As soon as you see any type of spider crawling on your wall, in front of windows, etc., simply flick it out using the hooked part to release it outside from where it came from!</li>
<li>These tools will save you all types of panic attacks and stress from spider attacks
In this video, exterminator Jim Triggs provides some tips on how to kill spiders at home using a spider catcher.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwPECUavj8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwPECUavj8</a></p>
<p>Well, a number of factors are important to consider in deciding whether or not you should contact an exterminator. But, before reaching out to a pest control company, take a look at</p>
<ol>
<li>What the company can do for you, and</li>
<li>If this type of problem is within their scope.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="so-how-much-do-spider-exterminators-cost">So, How Much Do Spider Exterminators Cost?</h2>
<p>That depends on a number of factors.</p>
<p>Every company has its own pricing structure that may not be clear upfront, which means you need to take time and research prices before committing to anything.</p>
<p>And even then, there&rsquo;s no guarantee what your actual budget will end up being because rates vary by the city!</p>
<ul>
<li>You also have other factors like how many treatments they offer per year as well as if they provide any type of warranty or guarantees with the service.</li>
<li>Some companies offer monthly packages so make sure you find out this information ahead of time so you know what your total investment will be long-term versus
<strong>1. Cost of a Reactive Spider Treatment</strong>
Reactive treatment to control spiders inside your home can cost anywhere from $100 - $300. This will generally just get rid of any recent, active spiders in the house.</li>
<li>In reactive treatment, exterminators will spray pesticide in areas such as inside baseboards, ceilings, and the crawl spaces around your house.
It&rsquo;s not likely to offer any long-term protection from future infestations because it doesn&rsquo;t get rid of anything outside (in the yard or on neighboring properties) and it won&rsquo;t protect against more spiders coming into your house in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-preventive-spider-treatment">2. Preventive Spider Treatment</h3>
<p>Preventive spider treatment�will cost you anywhere from $500 - $1,000, but it can offer a lot more protection.</p>
<p>In this type of treatment, an exterminator will spray pesticide outside your house and on neighboring properties to deal with any spiders that could come in.</p>
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;ll also seal up the exterior cracks or gaps around your house so those spiders won&rsquo;t be able to get inside either.</li>
<li>This will involve spraying the outdoor-facing areas like various entry points, eaves, door frames, and windows to prevent a spider invasion.
One approach in preventive treatment is to set up a contract with an exterminator who will visit your property quarterly, annually, or both.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information-to-give-the-exterminator-for-spiders">Information to give the Exterminator for Spiders</h2>
<p>Working together, the exterminator and you can effectively get rid of spider infestations inside your spaces - office, yard, or home.</p>
<p>Before you call an exterminator, make sure to know what kind of information they&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<h3 id="1-spider-species-in-question">1. Spider Species in Question?</h3>
<p>The type of spider in question can affect the extermination measures, so it&rsquo;s important to tell your exterminator the specific spider they will be working with.</p>
<p>You can provide the exterminator with a call describing what types of spiders are present as well as their general physical characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Among the most common arachnids found in homes are funnel web,<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/spider-chart"><strong>jumping</strong></a>,<a href="http://entomology.wsu.edu/outreach/bug-info/yellow-sac-spider/"><strong>yellow sac</strong></a>,<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/longbodied-cellar-spider"><strong>cellar spider</strong></a>,<a href="http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/brown-recluse-spiders"><strong>brown recluse</strong></a>,�and<a href="https://texasinsects.tamu.edu/southern-black-widow-spider/"><strong>black widow</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-spider-location">2. Spider Location</h3>
<p>Gathering information about the spiders&rsquo; location will ensure that your exterminator is better prepared for effective treatment.</p>
<p>The exterminator will need to know the specifics of your home or space, such as the spider-infested areas. This will allow them to begin work without wasting time studying coverage areas.</p>
<p>It is important to call your pest control company as soon as you see any evidence that there is a spider problem in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>One way to identify this is seeing webbing anywhere from corners up the walls and in dark spaces like under cabinets, crawl space, or the attic.</li>
<li>Also, check webbing around windowsills, near hanging indoor plants, or behind curtains on window frames that extend floor-to-ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-duration-of-the-spider-infestation">3. Duration of the Spider Infestation</h3>
<p>A spider infestation can be short or long in duration.</p>
<p>If the spiders are only coming inside your home during rainy periods, it might just be a temporary issue with an open window which should clear up when the weather changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>But their webbing keeps increasing over time, then this indicates that professional intervention may need to happen sooner rather than later.
At the time of service, you will have to answer questions about the first spider sighting. This will allow the exterminator to assess the severity of the spider infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-recurring-spiderwebs">4. Recurring Spiderwebs</h3>
<p>If you have been seeing evidence of spider webs for more than six months and there is no reason why they would come indoors (or go outdoors).</p>
<p>Spiders will spin webs periodically, but they are usually only in one place for a short time.</p>
<p>A recurring spiderweb can be an indication that there is a nest of spiders nearby and the web is their hunting ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>The webs will get bigger or recur as more spiders come to feed on prey (i.e., you) until it gets so big that the structure collapses or washes away with rainwater.
This would be especially true if your house has another pest, such as insects or rodents which could attract spiders.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this happens contact exterminators who specialize in removing these pests from homes even before they cause any damage!</p>
<h3 id="5-any-spider-eggs-seen">5. Any Spider Eggs Seen?</h3>
<p>If you spot spider eggs in your home, it&rsquo;s a sign that you have spiders. Spider mothers can lay up to 100 eggs at one time and they will hatch within two weeks of being laid.</p>
<p>Spider eggs are a sign that you have spiders, and if they hatch before extermination is done then it will cause more problems for your home.</p>
<p>So, let the exterminator know if you&rsquo;ve seen spider eggs, and don&rsquo;t spray insecticides indoors without first asking for the exterminator&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may notice egg sacs that are woven on the ceiling or wall, on leaves of any indoor plant, or under the spiderweb inside the corners of a room.
When you notice a number of egg sacs laying around in different corners of the rooms, it is possible an infestation has already begun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-to-ask-the-spider-exterminator">What to Ask the Spider Exterminator</h2>
<p>When it comes to getting rid of spiders, finding the right exterminator matters.</p>
<p>To find out if youve found the right one, ask them these critical questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How often should I expect an exterminator to come?</li>
<li>What are your methods of extermination for spiders and other bugs?</li>
<li>What is the procedure for spider removal from inside walls, ceilings, or window screens?</li>
<li>Would you be picking up any furniture that needs to be sprayed with insecticide?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-licenses-and-credentials">1. Licenses and Credentials</h3>
<p>Certifications and credentials are important, but also only tell one part of the story.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask what licenses they hold instead, especially if you live in a state with specific laws about pest control (like California).</p>
<p>What kind of entomology certification do they have? If there is no response given by the company about their qualifications, it could mean that either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person doesn&rsquo;t know because he has never been asked before</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re too busy trying to get your business</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s something fishy
When looking for the right company to handle your spider infestation, it&rsquo;s important that you ask about their qualifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>You want written proof of their certifications, licenses, and registration. Ask for these documents before hiring the extermination company.</p>
<h3 id="2-references">2. References</h3>
<p>What are former customers saying about the services the spider extermination company offers?</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, ask them how long have they been in business, and how many customers do they serve on a regular basis?
Check the competence of the company by asking previous clients about their experience.</li>
<li>Reliable exterminator review websites such as Angie&rsquo;s List and HomeAdvisor can help you find a qualified specialist in your region.
Interview the past clients on the quality of service that the exterminator provided - especially on spider control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-extermination-methods-and-chemicals">2. Extermination Methods and Chemicals</h3>
<p>Ask the exterminator about their methods of spider elimination. Do they use environmentally safe chemicals?</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, spider control mainly uses<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.html"><strong>pyrethrin</strong></a>as the key ingredient since it kills the bugs on contact.
Barrier treatments, such as those using synthetic
<a href="https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/ent-6003/"><strong>pyrethroids</strong></a>
can offer additional protection.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to know what chemicals will be used by the exterminator in treatment before any chemicals are applied to your spaces.</p>
<p>Spider control can be achieved by using environmentally safe chemicals.</p>
<ul>
<li>This method is best for sensitive areas such as schools and hospitals, or in homes with pets and children.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-spider-control-guarantees"><strong>3. Spider Control Guarantees</strong></h3>
<p>As a homeowner, you want to know that the problems with your spider infestation are going to be treated properly and effectively.</p>
<p>The best way to know for certain that your spider infestation is under control is with a guarantee.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spider Control Guarantees to ensure you don&rsquo;t have any more spiders or be able to come back and treat the problem at no additional charge if they do return.
Many companies offer their clients guarantees, but there are many other factors to consider before selecting which company&rsquo;s services will work best for you.</li>
<li>Some of these considerations include price, length of the service contract, whether it includes maintenance agreements, and what type of chemicals they use in treatment.
Most companies offer a money-back guarantee and limited reapplication, but the duration of the warranty may differ.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-how-many-treatments-are-required">3. How many Treatments are Required?</h3>
<p>To get rid of spiders in your home, you will need to do a few treatments.</p>
<p>The number of spider treatments will depend on how bad the problem is with the spiders and how many there are.</p>
<p>Therefore, discuss the number of treatments required on the space after the exterminator conducts the property inspection.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-handle-pets-during-spider-treatment">How to Handle Pets During Spider Treatment</h2>
<p>When spider control treatment is initiated, it&rsquo;s important to know how to keep your pet safe.
**1. Isolate Pets to Untreated Rooms **
Spider infestations generally don&rsquo;t involve hundreds of spiders. They will typically only cover a small section of the house.</p>
<p>The pet might need to stay elsewhere during an insect treatment service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore the exterminator can accommodate them by giving you the choice of a room or two where they will not be applying pesticides - may be in the living room or bedroom.
If your pet is not allowed out of the house or if you have a cat, then just try to limit their access to areas where they may come into contact with spider control treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you let your pets roam around outside and are treating for spiders in the yard, make sure that all windows and doors are closed so no one can get inside without being noticed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to keep an eye on any plants around the house because some treatments do affect plant life as well as insects and other pests.</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is something that concerns you, it will be best to discuss details with someone from the company before services take place. They should be able to give insight on how much exposure there would be during spider control treatment if needed
<strong>2. Lock them in Pet carriers</strong>
As this article explains, the kennel is one of the best options for pet owners when dealing with pest control in residences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pet owners should consider locking their pets in a kennel when treating pests at home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pet carriers are more portable and lighter than traditional cages, making it easier to move your pet from one location to another.
Pet carriers will offer short-time refuge for the pets against the spider control chemical but it&rsquo;s required.</li>
<li>In the event that you have any questions about how to best handle your pets during spider control treatment, we recommend discussing this with someone from the chosen pest control company.
They should be able to give insight on how much exposure there would be if needed and provide guidance for ensuring pet safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a kennel is not available or can&rsquo;t be used as an alternative option, it will likely be necessary to lock them inside one of their normal crates while spraying takes place in the vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-take-after-the-spider-extermination-or-treatment">Steps To Take After the Spider Extermination or Treatment</h2>
<p>**1. Continnauly Check for Spiders **
First, once the exterminator is done treating your home for spiders, run a dry inspection to check for spiders that may have survived and report, if any, to the exterminator.</p>
<p>After a spider treatment, it is normal for live spiders to continue dying over the next few days and with less frequency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to check indoor areas regularly
<strong>2. Don&rsquo;t Clean Immediately</strong>
Professional exterminators won&rsquo;t leave a mess on the spider-treated spaces. Thus, you must not mop or clean the spaces and floors immediately.</li>
<li>While some treatments are applied directly to the baseboards, others come in granular form that can be vacuumed up after application - avoid this as it&rsquo;ll reduce its effectiveness.
After your pest control service has treated your home, you are left with an insect carcass or two and messy traps - but don&rsquo;t do a deep cleaning at least for a few days.
<strong>3. Repair any leaks</strong>
While looking out for possible survivors, make time to barricade your property against future invaders.</li>
<li>This can be done by sealing cracks and gaps, minimizing prolonged exposure to the outdoors, and avoiding clutter.
Be sure to keep all food in sealed containers if it&rsquo;s not eaten. This will prevent pests from coming in to get their next meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seal up any openings and cracks on the outside of your homes, such as around pipes, doors, or windows.</p>
<p>When painting over these areas use a paint that contains residual insecticide so it&rsquo;ll act as an extra line of defense against unwanted wildlife. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether the new paint is chemical-free, ask for a material safety data sheet (MSDS) before applying it yourself.</p>
<p>If you have gaps smaller than a one-half inch or vents less than 12 square inches then they need to be sealed with steel wool.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-alert-the-neighbors-about-the-spider-treatment">Should You Alert the Neighbors about the Spider Treatment?</h2>
<p>Noticing a spider infestation in your home could mean that you are not on your own!</p>
<p>Homeowners often have a misunderstanding of spiders. On one hand, they only move when it is necessary to do so; yet this doesn&rsquo;t indicate that they cant find their way into better hiding places if needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of the pests must start at every level: inside and outside the property - including on your neighbor&rsquo;s property and thus you should alert them before the spider treatment.
Watch the video below to see how spiderlings hatch from their egg sacs and migrate.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the question of how much do spider exterminators cost? it is far more imperative that you get on top of the infestation as soon as possible before it becomes worse.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-spiders-7-effective-tips">How to Get Rid of Spiders (7 Effective Tips)</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-spider-identification">Step 1: Spider Identification</h3>
<p>On
<a href="https://owlcation.com/stem/spider-identification">spider identification</a>
, the 8-legged arachnids (with fangs (chelicerae) and 2 body parts ) belong to the same group as mites, ticks, and scorpions.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-antennae/">Spiders have no antennae</a>
or wing.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are over 35,000 species of spiders worldwide but just a fraction of them will be in your yard or home.</li>
<li>The most common species will be black widows, brown recluses, jumping spiders, orb-weaver, and wolf spiders.</li>
<li>Only black widow and brown recluse have life-threatening venom but other spiders may also leave a nasty and irritating bite.
During the identification process, check the spider&rsquo;s behavioral patterns, color, size, number, and the set pattern of their eyes - but note that spiders will mainly be in some hidden areas.
*Are spiders dangerous? *</li>
<li>Well, most spider species (such as wolf spiders, hobo spiders, orb-weaver spiders, and garden spiders) are harmless.</li>
<li>But, some spiders (including brown recluse and black widow spiders) are dangerous with their venom causing hazardous health issues to humans.
<em>Why do I have a spider problem?�</em></li>
<li>The insects in your home, properties, or yard will attract spiders. They&rsquo;ll move inside during winter and late fall as they prey on insects.
<em>Where will I find spiders?�</em></li>
<li>As reclusive and shy creatures, spiders will live (either outside or inside) in the secluded, quiet, and dark places where they build webs or burrow.
<strong>NB:�</strong></li>
<li>Spiders that build webs such as orb-weaver, garden spiders, or black widows will create such webs in doorways, roof eaves, high trees, shrubs, and decks.</li>
<li>But, the burrowing spiders such as wolf spiders will nest on rockpiles, fallen trees, woodpiles, shrubs, and under bushes.
For the indoor spaces, the spiders will hide in the less-frequented areas such as under furniture and sinks, attics, garage, around windows and ceilings fixtures, closets, and basements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-declutter-and-vacuum">Step 2: Declutter and Vacuum</h3>
<p>Some spider species love dark and damp corners such as rarely-used closets and basements while others will hide in dry plus warm areas like attics.
<em>Declutter�</em>
First, declutter your house - most times spiders will be found in cluttered places such as basements, attics, and garages.
So, reorganize and throw out as many objects as possible - leaving spiders in the open and hence there will be no harborage areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic cleaning and maintenance n your house and spaces will be very important to get rid of spiders. Besides, vacuuming, you must declutter the spaces too.</li>
<li>Decluttering the spaces will remove those hiding places that are in your garage or home. Keenly dust and clean the clutter to reduce the spider-hiding areas.
<em>Vacuum�</em></li>
<li>Since you&rsquo;ve spotted the spiders around your home or yard, there must be some egg sacs lurking around the dark spaces such as crevices and cracks.</li>
<li>So, vacuum the whole house from closet corners and also under the furniture. Further, as you vacuum remember to remove all the spiders and spider webs - and finally dispose of that vacuum bag.
<em>Regular Cleaning:�</em></li>
<li>Regularly clean your spaces, garage, and home regularly to hinder new spider infestations - also dust the tabletops and open spaces to remove cobwebs.</li>
<li>Remove all clutter from the floors, conduct wall-to-wall vacuuming and move objects on countertops, and clean thoroughly</li>
<li>Once monthly, move the small furniture, light fixtures, and dust the ceilings - dusting and vacuuming effectively behind these fixtures.</li>
<li>Also, once monthly, clean under the bed and don&rsquo;t forget any item store beneath there, and for the floor, registers get the vent covers off to dust easily.
<em>Seasonal cleaning:�</em></li>
<li>Clean fire accessories and the fireplace by opening the chimneys flue to remove all cobwebs. Keenly clean and vacuum all items including the screens and fireplace logs.</li>
<li>Check and clean the attic for any cobwebs and leaks. Clean the storage boxes plus your attic floor - and remember to seal all the containers and boxes stored in the attic.</li>
<li>Inspect walls and basement for crack and leaks - fixing all of them while also dusting all the storage boxes and sweeping the surfaces and floors. Clean around the furnace and water heater.</li>
<li>Clean the garage, after getting the car outside to clean it thoroughly and sweep the walls and ceilings plus the exterior door.

<h3 id="step-3-use-terro-t2302-to-kill-any-spiders">Step 3: Use TERRO-T2302 to Kill any Spiders</h3>
<p>TERRO-T2302 gives install-killing results on spiders - quick and easy. Just spray around the holes, garden, crevices, and house or directly on that spider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The spider killer will prevent spider re-occurrence for about 6 weeks. It&rsquo;ll kill pests and spiders like black widows and the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/">brown recluse</a>, bed bugs, cockroaches, ants, and scorpions.
Spray this TERRO-T2302 on or around the spider&rsquo;s or ant&rsquo;s nest. You can spray it both outdoors and indoors while also controlling cockroaches and Asian-lady beetles.
But is Terro Spider really a spider-killer safe? Well, don&rsquo;t let
pets, kids, and even adults into the sprayed areas before the chemical is dried - avoid direct contact.</li>
<li>With 0.02 % Deltamethrin and 0.05% Pyrethrins as the active ingredients, TERRO-T2302 offers dual function - it&rsquo;ll know down the spiders and also offer 12 weeks bug control.</li>
<li><a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf">Pyrethrins</a>are extracted from chrysanthemum will trigger paralysis and eventual death as it excites the spider&rsquo;s nervous system.</li>
<li>Further,<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/DeltaGen.html">Deltamethrin</a>will disrupt the spider&rsquo;s nervous system killing the insects on contact. But TERRO-T2302 is not waterproof and thus don&rsquo;t use it during the rainy reason.
<em>To use TERRO-T2302 fo spiders�</em></li>
<li>For indoor spraying, use TERRO-T2302 on the non-food locations that pests will hide and pests - remember the spaces behind appliances or shelves and around windows and doors.</li>
<li>But for outdoor spraying, ensure to pint your spray nozzle at a downward angle but away from your body and face - but don&rsquo;t spray in a windy environment.</li>
<li>TERRO-T2302 will kill spiders and other insects on picnic areas and patios surface. The product willkill fleas, silverfish, crickets, ants, and cockroaches.
Ensure that the TERRO-T2302 must come into direct contact with the spider - so spray the outside and inside including the window and door frames.
Remember to spray TERRO-T2302 to get to those difficult spider webs. Also, don&rsquo;t remove the egg sacs and spider webs from those spaces until the spray is fully dried.
Spray the outdoor spaces including on non-crop or bushy areas, and the spider-infested weeds - including on lumber and firewood. Wash the clothes and skin using water plus soap.
Avoid using this spider spray around aquatic animals as it&rsquo;ll be toxic to them including to fish.

<h3 id="step-4-usecatchmaster-72mb-spider-catching-glue-boards">Step 4: Use<strong>Catchmaster 72MB Spider-Catching Glue Boards�</strong></h3>
<p>After monitoring the spider activity, you can use the Catchmaster 72MB as a glue trap to catch multiple insects that&rsquo;ll also capture spiders straying around the room.
Set up these traps around areas that you&rsquo;ve noticed some spider activity - this may include around the closet storage spaces and garage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insects including spider will wall on the glue board and they&rsquo;ll get stuck - ready for disposal. You can also remove the spider webs using the web out spray.</li>
<li>Spray the product under or inside your patio coverings - and this will help break down the spider web and then clean them up using a broom.</li>
<li>Sticky traps are mainly used forcockroachesandrodentsbut will also work against spiders - simply place the traps on hidden spaces such as the attic, basement, closet corners.
Catchmaster 72MB will capture the insects in a non-toxic way (no rodenticides or insecticides ) to get rid of roaches, ants, and mice - but the bugs will be attracted by the scent of the peanut butter.
Ensure to keep the spider traps in some moderate temperatures, avoid freezing or overly hot temperatures. You may also fold the trap to form some tunnel shape - and hence avoids dust.</li>
<li>For indoor use, position your glue boards in a horizontal direction on corners, or against the baseboards. Don&rsquo;t position on the moist surfaces or places near water.</li>
<li>Avoid using on areas with extreme heat. Also, for cold places like the walk-in fridge, get Catchmaster 48WRG which&rsquo;s great for cold temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-use-peppermint-oil">Step 5: Use Peppermint Oil</h3>
<p>Scientific evidence denotes that
peppermint oil will repel or exterminate spiders
working like a natural insecticide against spiders and other arachnids.
It is thought that spiders dislike either the monoterpenoids (with fumigants) or strong odors found in the oil as outlined in a
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014752/#!po=85.2941">2010 study by StudyTrusted</a>
.
But how do you use peppermint oil in controlling or repelling spiders? Just get a water-filled spray bottle and put peppermint oil (about 5- 20 drops) - add some
dish soap</p>
<ul>
<li>shake to mix.
Next, you&rsquo;ll require to spray the water-peppermint mixture around the dark corners and house perimeter plus other spider-hiding areas.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to apply this peppermint oil mixture onto various surfaces once weekly. When the spiders come back prior to wend-of-week, increase the frequency - maybe daily spraying?
You can position some peppermint plants around some strategic areas inside and outside the house. Further, sprinkle some ground peppermint leaves on areas frequented by some spiders.
Here are additional repellents (natural) that&rsquo;ll repel spiders, mainly essential oils:</li>
<li>Citronella Oil</li>
<li>Tea Tree Oil</li>
<li>Lavender Oil</li>
<li>Eucalyptus Oil</li>
<li>Lemon Oil
Spread some cedar mulch near the home to deter or repel the spiders - maybe you can drop some cedar sachet on the drawers and closet.

<h2 id="spider-bite-vs-bed-bug-bite-top-7-difference">Spider Bite Vs Bed Bug Bite: Top 7 Difference?</h2>
<h3 id="a-physical-appearance">a. Physical appearance</h3>
<p>Bedbug&rsquo;s bite is usually small and appears as a reddish bump on the skin surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bites are multiple/several/clusters in numbers. Contrary, a spider&rsquo;s bite appears as a single swollen mark.
The outlook feature of the bedbug&rsquo;s bite usually leaves fang marks on the surface, especially if it&rsquo;s from species such as the black widow spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-size-of-bite-mark">b. Size of Bite Mark</h3>
<p>The size of the bite mark from a spider is usually big/wide (deep fangs can be seen when the bite is still flesh), whereas the size of the bedbug&rsquo;s bite is small - no visible marks at times.
Further, the
<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/need-know-%5Bbed-bugs%5D(/posts/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/)/">bedbug&rsquo;s bite</a>
may appear like a flat patch on the skin or tiny-pus rashes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9UzvclvEQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd9UzvclvEQ</a></p>
<h3 id="c-number-of-bites">c. Number of Bites</h3>
<p>Spider leaves one <a href="/posts/flea-bites-vs-bed-bug-bites/">bite</a> at a time in a given surface/location, while bedbug carries multiple bites (clusters) in a given surface/point - you will see small shallow marks or swellings on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="d-signs-and-symptoms">d. Signs and Symptoms</h3>
<p>The outstanding symptoms of a spider&rsquo;s bite include high blood pressure, large swelling, severe pain, paralysis, increased heartbeats, muscle cramping, headache, nausea, and a high breathing rate.
Contrary, bedbugs symptoms include red swollen bumps, itchy rashes/blisters (with pus), smelly odor on the surface, and prevalent painful sensation.</p>
<h3 id="e-duration-of-bitewould">e. Duration of Bite/would</h3>
<p>Upon being bitten, the spider&rsquo;s bite may take one week (7days) to heal, particularly when the right treatment is undertaken.
However, the bedbug&rsquo;s bite will take a slightly longer period (one to two weeks - 14 days) to heal under proper medication.</p>
<h3 id="f-degree-of-bite-pain">f. Degree of Bite Pain</h3>
<p>The fact that the spider&rsquo;s bite is deeper and larger as compared to that of the bedbug, the bite mark on your skin is more painful and may bleed profusely for some time.
Further, the venom injected into your body worsens human health conditions through intoxication and paralysis  this is more pronounced if bitten by some particular species of spiders like the black widow.
Bedbug&rsquo;s bite is sharp and short-lived on bite onset. However, the reddish pimples formed on the skin later generate an itchy feeling that makes one scratch themselves in search of relief.</p>
<h3 id="g-bite-location">g. Bite Location</h3>
<p>Spider&rsquo;s bites are usually found on the fingers, arms, and legs (these are areas bitten mostly), while bedbug bites almost all parts of the body i.e. legs, arms, face, neck, torso, feet, and back.
Further, the bedbug bites either appear as a linear pattern or cluster on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="h-severity-of-bite">h. Severity of Bite</h3>
<p>Most spiders bites are known to be more venomous than bedbugs. Black widow and
brown recluse spider
bites inject hemotoxic venom that impairs the human response system and paralyzes the immune system, thus leading to death with time.
Most spider bites lead to large swollen proportions that may lead to severe wounds if not attended to instantly.
On the contrary basis, bedbug&rsquo;s bites never go beyond mere pimples, which appear like red boils with under-skin pus.
Though the bedbug&rsquo;s bite takes a slightly longer time to heal as compared to the spider&rsquo;s counterpart, the intensity of pain is less severe/painful - the pain fades away easily.

<h3 id="i-biting-time">i. Biting Time</h3>
<p>Usually, bedbugs bite night more than daytime. They tend to be more active in dark than a day  they are nocturnal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The light scares the bedbugs into their hideouts. On the other hand, spider bites during the day than at night.
The presence of light is a key factor that helps the spider to locate the biting point (either leg, arm, or fingers). This doesn&rsquo;t mean that a spider can&rsquo;t bite you at night - however, the chances are limited.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="j-bite-frequency">j. Bite Frequency</h3>
<p>Spider normally bites once at a given point (one bite and then runs always), while the bedbug may bite several times on a particular skin surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, unlike bedbugs, spiders tend to bite only when you threaten them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-ways-of-preventing-spiderbedbug-bite">Best Ways of Preventing Spider/Bedbug Bite?</h2>

</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-treat-spiderbedbug-bite">How to Treat Spider/Bedbug Bite</h2>
<p>In case a spider or bedbug bites you, consider any of the following treatment approaches:</p>
<h3 id="a-spider-treatment-methods">a. Spider Treatment Methods</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using Plantain</strong>- smear the flesh plantain on the spider bite area. This helps draw and neutralize the venom before a reaction takes place. Further, the fluid reduces severe reaction, swelling, and prevents anaphylactic shock.</li>
<li><strong>Activated Charcoal</strong>- rub activated charcoal on the spider bite gently and leave it for five minutes before cleaning. Rub once more and repeat this daily until the skin heals. The activated charcoal has high absorption properties that remove toxic venom and reduces acute pain</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>- dissolve baking soda in warm water and wipe the bitten area gently. The alkaline substance (in baking soda) reduces inflammation, itching, pain, and draws out the venom</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Meat Tenderizer</strong>- rub meat tenderizer onto spider bitten part, softly. The papain enzyme in the tenderizer breaks down the proteinaceous toxins in the bites, thus eliminating inflammation as well as itching/swelling occurrences.</li>
<li><strong>Apply for antihistamine medicine</strong>- apply for antihistamine medicine on the spider bitten area after washing the part with soap and warm water. The medicine helps in reducing itching, swelling as well as in preventing intoxication.</li>
<li><strong>Get Tetanus Booster</strong>- for a poisonous spider bite, it&rsquo;s advisable to take a tetanus injection booster to prevent intoxication and paralysis, which may be fatal if not attended to in time. This should be taken instantly if you note symptoms such as breathing difficulties and heart palpitations problems.

</ol>
<h3 id="b-bedbug-treatment-methods">b.� Bedbug Treatment Methods</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using Diatomaceous earth</strong>- Gently, rub diatomaceous earth on the bedbug bitten area and leave it for 10minutes before washing. Repeat the same two to three times. The active substance in diatomaceous earth reduces swelling and itching feelings that escalate if not attended to in time.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrocortisone cream</strong>- Apply the cream on the bitten section and leave it to heal with time. The paste does not only act as a pain relaxer but prevents swelling and curb further intoxication.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Antihistamine medicine</strong>- apply or get an antihistamine injection to prevent intoxication and further swelling of the bitten skin area. This should be carried out as soon as you discover the bite is bedbugs.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Herbal Lotion</strong>- consider applying herbal lotion over any bedbug bite since the compound contains components that prevent intoxication and swelling. Further, the herbal concoction acts as a pain relaxer too.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On spider bite vs bedbug bite, youll need to check on indicators such as the physical appearance of the bite, size of the bite mark, the number of bites on the surface/body, duration of bite to heal, location of the bite as well as the degree of pain instilled when you got bitten, in order to differentiate between the two.</p>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, it&rsquo;s advisable to observe the frequency of bite, biting time, and severity of the bite to attain detailed information.</li>
<li>Upon bite clarification, you are expected to undertake proper bite treatment, as highlighted in this article, as well as bedbug/spider prevention measures within your area so as to curb such occurrences.
Remember, spider or bedbug bites may lead to serious complications. Therefore, medical attention should always be sorted immediately, if need be, especially for allergy-sensitive individuals.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms of spider bites (e.g. Sydney funnel-web include pain, swelling, and red skin. On the other hand, mosquito bites mainly result in itchy, pink &amp; raised skin bumps but may trigger severe allergic reactions.</strong>
So, when you know what&rsquo;s in your yard - and control it well - it&rsquo;ll be easy to control the bugs as you enjoy your outdoor sports, picnics, pool parties, and barbecues without those annoying insect bites.

<h2 id="details-spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite-what-bit-me">Details: Spider Bite vs Mosquito Bite; What Bit Me?</h2>
<h3 id="1-different-in-bite-appearance">1. Different in Bite Appearance?</h3>
<p><em>a. Mosquito bite�</em>
Mosquito bites to animals and humans mainly come from their females to get that blood meal - enabling great egg production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using their proboscis (mouthpart), mosquitos pierce your skin and suck blood.</li>
<li>Its saliva causes your skin to itch and bump. For some people, the effect is more strong redness, soreness, and swelling.
The appearance of a mosquito bite include:</li>
<li>Dark spots on the skin resembling some bruises</li>
<li>Further, mosquito bites will result in reddish and puffy bumps that&rsquo;ll appear some minutes following the bite.</li>
<li>They cause reddish-brown, itchy, and hard bumps - which could also be multiple bumps that&rsquo;ll appear within the day after the bite.
Individuals who&rsquo;ll get adverse effects from mosquito bites include kids and adults that have immune system disorders or those who&rsquo;ve not previously been bitten by these bugs.
Further, mosquito bites reactions may have severe reactions including;</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
<li>Hives</li>
<li>Low-grade fever</li>
<li>Wide-area skin redness and swelling
<em>b. Spider Bite�</em>
The charactratics of spider bites from spiders such as the lack of widow spiders include pinprick-like, sharp, and immediate pain.
Also, the bite location will be numb.�Additional symptoms for bites from the black widow spider are;</li>
<li>Itchy skin rash</li>
<li>Excessive sweating</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Stiffness in the back, chest, shoulders, and painful muscle cramps</li>
<li>Vomiting and nausea</li>
<li>Excessive saliva production</li>
<li>Swollen and droopy eyes</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing
However, some of the bites from the spiders won&rsquo;t be immediately noticeable or painful. But the spider bite pain could be faced within 1 hour.
For the brown recluse, the spider bite symptoms will include;</li>
<li>The Bite area will have an itchy skin</li>
<li>Could lead to a skin ulcer and blisters (and later result in scars) - which start with reddish skin or bruises.
Finally, bites by Hobo spiders - and its bite on your skin will include;</li>
<li>Cognitive impairment</li>
<li>Nausea.</li>
<li>Fatigue.</li>
<li>Pus-producing blisters</li>
<li>Swollen and red skin</li>
<li>Hardened bite-area skin</li>
<li>Severe headache that beings shortly after getting bitten - and the headache could remain active for about a week.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-causes-high-risk-illnesses">2. Causes High-Risk** i**llnesses?</h3>
<p><em>a. Mosquito bite�</em>
Mosquito bites will result in pink, red &amp; rounded, plus itchy bumps. But this bite could result in severe illnesses like eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), malaria, West Nile virus, and Zika virus.
Zika virus will, for many humans, result in a flu-like illness. However, newborns from mothers infected with this virus could get microcephaly�birth defects.
The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com">CDC notes</a>
that the West Nile virus was (in 2019) spread over 47 states of the US.</p>
<ul>
<li>The virus symptoms will be evident within 2 - 14 days - these include skin rash, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, body aches, and headaches.
Further, humans that get West Nile that&rsquo;s severe may develop encephalitis, meningitis, and other signs like convulsions, high fever, disorientation, severe headache, and neck stiffness.</li>
<li>But mosquitoes will largely infect humans with malaria - but the malaria cases have malaria transmission in the US.
The malaria flu will result in symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, muscle aches, headache, and fever. However, CDC notes that malaria is treatable &amp; preventable.
Another mosquito species known as
<em>Aedes scapularis is found in Latin and Caribbean America but also in Florida - as noted by the JMEntomology.�</em>
<em>b. Spider Bite�</em>
Spider bites won&rsquo;t largely result in grave problems. However, you could experience pain, swelling, and redness around the area with the spider bite.</li>
<li>But bites from spiders like the hobo spiders, brown recluse, and the black widow may result in more grave effects
Such effects may include muscle cramps that are painful, severe headaches, and trouble breathing - such effects from spider bites could need urgent medical care.
But how serious are these spider bites? Well, bites from most spiders will be harmless. All spiders will have the venom poison but many of them have small fangs that won&rsquo;t easily puncture the skin of a human.
So, which spider species will be venomous to humans? From the over 60 spider species, but only a few of these spiders will be dangerous - these include:</li>
<li>**Hobo spiders -**The brown-colored hobo spiders have a herringbone (V-shaped) of their belly - mainly occupying the Pacific Northwest. You&rsquo;ll find them on woodpiles, window wells, crawl spaces, moist &amp; dark basements - areas where they&rsquo;ll create their funnel-shaped webs.</li>
<li>**Brown recluses - **Also referred to all the violin or fiddle-back spiders, the spiders largely found in the Southern and Midwestern states. You&rsquo;ll largely find them in sheltered and dry places like on leaves, rocks, piles of wood. Also, you can find them in shoes, attics, and dark closets.</li>
<li>**Black widows -**These back window species will mainly occupy the outhouses, fence, woodpiles, and building eaves (overhangs) - and largely occupy the Southern &amp; Western U.S. Their belly has an hourglass shape that is colored red.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-difference-in-treatment-of-spider-and-mosquito-bites">The difference in Treatment of Spider and Mosquito Bites</h2>
<p>After identifying that bite, it&rsquo;s important to use the right technique to treat the various bug bites.
<strong>Treating Spider Bites:�</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by quickly locating that spider which bit you. You might need to search those hiding or dark areas - this will help you identify if the bite is toxic.</li>
<li>For toxic spider bites such as from Brown recluse or Black Widow spider, you&rsquo;ll require emergency medical treatment.</li>
<li>Avoid home treatment if their spider at hand is noted to inject toxic through their bites</li>
<li>Thoroughly clean the spider bite, if the spider is identified as being non-toxic, and this will help avoid further infection</li>
<li>In addition, to prevent an additional allergic reaction from that spider bite, I advise you take some antihistamine
<strong>Treating Mosquito Bites:�</strong></li>
<li>Compared to the bites from ticks or spiders, mosquito bites are known to be largely harmless</li>
<li>So, unless there are serious symptoms such as fever or nausea, you won&rsquo;t require to take those drastic measures</li>
<li>To stop the skin itching after the mosquito bite, I recommend you rub some baking soda or salt.</li>
<li>For those with no sensitive skin or even younger kids, you can use calamine lotion</li>
<li>Further, for mosquito bites, you may use some mild treatments such as honey, tea bags, and ice.
In summary, compared to mosquito bites, some of the spider bites will be more toxic and life-threatening.
But with mosquito bites, it&rsquo;s important to take appropriate prevention steps while also controlling the resulting diseases plus easing the biting pain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On spider bite vs mosquito bite, in summary, that unsettling bite bump on your body could be from a mosquito or spider.
Spiders bites that are largely poisonous are the tarantula, hobo spider, black widow, and brown recluse.</p>
<ul>
<li>But mosquitoes will bite even when they&rsquo;re not threatened - mosquitoes aim to suck mosquitoes for reproduction and nutrition.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post will answer the question &ldquo;What is a Hobo Spider?&rdquo; and give you 9 other interesting facts about these unique creatures!</p>
<p>Hobo spiders (Tegenaria agrestis) are aggressive
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/house-spiders/">house spiders</a>
; they like damp and dark areas like in brick crevices, basement, garage, behind furniture, under radiators, or between boxes.
**What Do **
**Hobo Spiders **
<strong>Look Like? - A summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Characteristics:**The eight-eyed Hobo spider does not have a typical eye arrangement for this species. A close look at the spider shows that its ALEs and AMEs are almost joined.</li>
<li>**Color:**Hobo spiders come in different shades of brown, so it&rsquo;s important to learn the distinguishing features but they&rsquo;ll look anything like the brown recluse spider and<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/wolf-spiders/">wolf spiders</a>.</li>
<li>**Males:**The males of the species are typically shorter than 11 mm, with swollen appendages. The appendages are actually their reproductive organs.</li>
<li>**Females: **The female hobos have a length ranging from 11 mm - 14 mm. Their abdomens are larger than that of their male hobo spiders.
So, let&rsquo;s get into the details!
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Spider Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-hobo-spider-are-they-serious">What Is A Hobo Spider? Are they Serious?</h2>
<p>**So, how can you tell a hobo spider? **
To tell if a spider is a hobo spider, look at its front body. The front body will be brown (with darker-brown markings) and it has brown legs and yellow abdomen markings.
<strong>Do They Bite?</strong>
They usually do not bite humans, contrary to popular belief. But if they feel threatened, or are provoked, they might.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hobo spiders will bite if they perceive a threat to their young ones or egg sacs - they&rsquo;ll be highly protective in this case.</li>
<li>Most people don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;re encroaching on the hobo spider, which typically hangs out in hidden and dark areas.</li>
<li>For the most part, they&rsquo;re harmless and just make webs but you need to know what they look like.
**Are They Dangerous? **
A previous study of the hobo spider venom reported that Hobo spiders are a medical threat and that they&rsquo;re cause necrotic lesions.</li>
<li>However, current research shows that hobo spiders<a href="https://www.usu.edu/today/story/hobo-spider-bite-may-not-be-so-dangerous">aren&rsquo;t medically threatening</a>
**Other Bug Problems **
The hobo spider, though an expert predator in its own right, is also preyed upon by other animals. These bugs include:</li>
<li>Centipedes</li>
<li>Birds</li>
<li>Bees,Mud-dauber wasps, and hornets</li>
<li>Spiders such as the wolf spider</li>
<li>Rodents and furry animals likesquirrelsor chipmunks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hobo-spider-ecology-habitat-and-distribution">Hobo Spider Ecology, Habitat, and Distribution</h2>
<p><strong>Where are hobo spiders found?</strong>
The spiders in the Agelenidae Family, including the Hobo spiders, spin entangled silk webs that serve as their prey traps, detection devices, and nests.</p>
<p>It is often seen on fence posts and tree branches as the sunset with its web being used to capture small insects flying overhead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally when found in buildings, it will be found seeking shelter under boxes or other debris.
**Their Webs? **
Hobo spiders will weave webs that are funnel-shaped with sticky silk that sticks to small insects flying by them while they are hunting for prey on their webs - they use them also as mating grounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&rsquo;ll create the webs in a tangle of vegetation or at the edge of trees and usually have more than one attachment point to the ground, such as stones or branches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Females stay within their web as males wander in search of mates.
<strong>What Do They Eat?</strong>
The primary food source of Hobo spiders is insects and arachnids, on which they feed until the animal dies. They are also known to prey upon other spiders and arthropods.</li>
<li>Once their prey touches the web triggers (detection devices), there are vibrations on the silken line that&rsquo;ll alert the Hobo.
Though the Hobo Spider bite is not often lethal, some of the symptoms such as necrosis are similar to what you get with bites from the brown recluse.
<strong>Geographic Range</strong>
They&rsquo;re largely Native to Europe but you&rsquo;ll mainly find Hobo Spiders in parts of;</li>
<li>Asia</li>
<li>Europe</li>
<li>The Pacific Northwest US</li>
<li>Montana</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>Utah</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>Wyoming</li>
<li>Oregon, and</li>
<li>Washington.
**Reproduction **
The male Hobo Spider (Tegenaria agrestis) mate with their receptive female counterparts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The male Hobos die or move on soon after the mating process.</p>
<p>So, the female spider is the one who does all of the work to produce new offspring.</p>
<ul>
<li>She lays a single egg sac, and then she guards it against predators until her babies hatch.</li>
<li>The young spiders will wait for their mother on top of or next to her web as she goes out hunting for food; after she returns with prey in tow, they will climb onto her back and feed while riding home again to protect themselves from potential danger along the way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-a-hobo-spider-poisonous">Is a hobo spider poisonous?</h2>
<p>No, the Hobo Spider is not venomous and does not pose any threat to humans or animals -
according to the CDC
.</p>
<p>Recent
<a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7488.html">studies</a>
show that the venom of the hobo spider does not create significant skin reactions in animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, some people are allergic to their bite and can develop symptoms such as local swelling, itching around the area bitten by the spider, headache, nausea, or vomiting, and general malaise.
If you experience these symptoms after being bit please seek medical attention immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hobos spiders do have an &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; reputation, but they are not venomous creatures. They will typically feed off smaller insects like flies and arachnids.</p>
<p>Notable spiders that have dangerous venom in the US are like the brown recluse or the black widow.</p>
<p>Hobo spiders are not known to be aggressive; instead, they show a tendency to flee and hide when disturbed.</p>
<p>The hobo spider is also not known to be found in areas where humans live, but they are often spotted on the sides of buildings or other places such as a barn.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-kill-a-hobo-spider">Should I kill a Hobo Spider?</h2>
<p>If you can avoid it&rsquo;s best not to kill hobo spiders, since having some spiders around helps keep down pests such as cockroaches; however, there are exceptions to this rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, were born with a natural fear of spiders, as evidenced by the physical response we have every time we see or touch one.
Therefore, sometimes we may have to kill these hobo spiders as a last resort if they are infesting our home and cannot be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hobo spider is not known to be poisonous; however, it can bite humans which may cause some discomfort but usually, no permanent damage will occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should kill hobos by using an aerosol product for killing insects such as bug spray and undertakethorough spider vacuuming.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-you-do-if-you-find-a-hobo-spider">What Do You Do If You Find A Hobo Spider?</h2>
<p>If you find a hobo spider, please contact an exterminator for
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-much-do-spider-exterminators-cost/">spider inspection and control</a>
as they have venomous fangs.</p>
<p>The spider exterminator may employ these steps to get rid of a hobo spider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum to get rid of those spiderwebs. Also, change your vacuum filter regularly; ideally, monthly.</li>
<li>Prevent wandering spiders from entering homes byinstalling sticky trapsin dark, damp places like basements and closets.</li>
<li>Use suitable insecticide powders, sprays, and dust (carefully following label instructions) on crevices, doorways, windows, and baseboards
Spray window screens, door thresholds, and garage doors with the insecticide.
<strong>If you find a hobo spider outdoors</strong>
where it is not dark or damp:</li>
<li>Knockdown the webs (if any) to eliminate hiding places for wandering spiders;</li>
<li>Eliminate their food sources by keeping vegetation trimmed back from foundations of buildings and sidewalks;</li>
<li>Place sticky traps in areas of high-traveling activity near exterior walls.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-a-hobo-spider-kill-a-dog-or-cat">Can a hobo spider kill a Dog or Cat?</h2>
<p>Recent studies shoes that hobo spider�bites aren&rsquo;t harmful or won&rsquo;t kill your cat or dog; this is unlike the case with
**brown recluse and the **
black widow that&rsquo;s fatal to pets and humans.</p>
<p>If your pet or child is bitten by a hobo spider and shows signs of illness, contact the vet immediately for treatment advice.</p>
<p>Since hobos will typically stay in dark corners like sheds, basements, etc., you&rsquo;ll need to sweep them out with a broom into an outdoor area where they can&rsquo;t get back inside and then vacuum up their webs.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there&rsquo;s no access point outside that allows them to re-enter, use sticky traps as well because these spiders also live on walls.
The signs of a bite from such spiders on the cat or dog may include agitation, tremors, diarrhea, muscle rigidity, vomiting, cramping, and muscle pain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, on the question of &ldquo;What is a Hobo Spider?&rdquo; we hope this article has been helpful.</p>
<p>Hobo spider bites rarely result in serious medical issues but may cause swelling at the site of injury along with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, and headache.</p>
<p>As always, happy spider hunting!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This question of what kills spiders instantly is very tricky. Why
kill the spiders
when a large number are harmless? Some eat mosquitoes and other bugs in our homes and play an important role in the ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>**So, what kills spiders instantly? Well, use essential oils, vinegar, diatomaceous earth, ammonia, bleach **<strong>among others. You can also use pest control products that kill fast though on the other hand, their safety levels are questionable.�</strong>
That notwithstanding, spiders in our houses-whether venomous or not make our houses look untidy. Related:

<h2 id="what-kills-spiders-instantly---a-safer-and-quicker-remedy">What Kills Spiders Instantly? -� A Safer and Quicker Remedy</h2>
<p>Though most spiders are harmless in our homes, some are a serious threat within the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the US some spiders like the black widow and brown recluse are very common and may force you to take immediate action against all spiders in your house.
As a homeowner, when killing those harmful spiders, always take note of the ways that are also safe and maybe the natural ways of doing it. Essential oils, vinegar, cider, ammonia, diatomaceous earth can be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-diatomaceous-earth"><strong>1. Diatomaceous Earth</strong></h3>
<p>This is a white powder that is very common for use in our households to control
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-have-antennae/">common bugs and pests</a>
. The good thing about this powder is that it is safe for home use even when there are children and pets.</p>
<ul>
<li>This powder works by dehydrating spiders causing them to die. It absorbs the soils, waters, and fats from the spiders causing their death.</li>
<li>After contact with DE, it will not take more than 24 hours before the spider dies.� This powder also remains active
Also, the DE remains active as long as you are able to keep it intact and also dry within your house.
When applying a tablespoon of DE mixed in a bottle will effectively do the work of killing those venomous spiders and other bugs hiding within and outside your house.</li>
<li>Spray the target areas being careful not to inhale the dust because it is harmful.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ToC2kQm5Bk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ToC2kQm5Bk</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-vinegar"><strong>2. Vinegar</strong></h3>
<p>This is still another useful product within your house that you can use to control or kill spiders. Vinegar has acetic acid which plays a vital role in chasing spiders from our houses.</p>
<ul>
<li>It chases spiders by producing a strong odor that keeps them off.</li>
<li>Vinegar is very common in most homes and also safe to use where there are pets and children.
Before you can use vinegar in control against spiders, mix it with water in a ratio of 1:1 and then spray it around the infested area.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ammonia-mixed-with-water-">**3. Ammonia Mixed With Water� **</h3>
<p>Ammonia is a good agent for use against spiders. It works by producing a staunch smell that rebels against them. However, it cannot be used alone and should be mixed with water in the ratio of 1:1.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have achieved this, you can then proceed to spray it around the affected areas to chase away the spiders.
Ammonia has also been used as one of the active ingredients to manufacture Windex which is used to kill spiders both outdoors and indoors.

<h3 id="4-citrus-">**4. Citrus **</h3>
<p>Citrus is as good as vinegar. You can use it to keep spiders out of your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use citrus in many forms. You can opt to mix it with water and spray it around your house to keep off the spiders.
You can spray it on their entry point on windows, crevices, and others hiding areas for the spiders. You can also use citrus to clean around your house. The strong smell from the citrus repels away the bugs and also spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-mint-">**5. Mint **</h3>
<p>Mint is among the essential oils that you can use to repel the spiders from your homes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When using this essential oil, it is good to mix it with water before you can spray it all-around your house and any other place you intend.
If what you have are the flesh peppermint leaves, try smashing the leaves in order for them to produce the smell. You can place them at strategic points within your house to repel all the bugs and spiders.

<p>Though borax is not used to kill spiders, it serves a very good purpose in keeping the spiders away from your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>As for borax, it kills the bugs and other insects within our homes that spiders feed on.
This leaves the spider with nothing to eat and with no choice but to relocate where there is food.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-vacuum-cleaning-and-dusting-">**7. Vacuum cleaning and dusting **</h3>
<p>Though this does not involve the use of chemicals and substances, dusting helps keep your house off spiders. Spiders love dusty areas where they can establish cobwebs to trap their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>With proper and regular dusting, spiders will not be able to thrive in such an environment.
Alternatively, vacuum cleaning is also a good option for dusting your home and keeping off spiders and also other insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-cedar-">**8. Cedar **</h3>
<p>This is also another essential oil that you can use to eliminate spiders and other bugs from your home.</p>

<p>Other than what kills spiders instantly, you can consider repelling them away from your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is despite some being venomous but a big number of spiders are also harmless and sometimes helpful by preying on dangerous insects in our homes like mosquitoes.</li>
<li>Even so, allowing spiders into our house makes it look weird and sometimes untidy.
Instead of killing them, you can repel them to the natural environment
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-spider-traps/">or trap them</a>
because they are an important part of other parts of the ecosystem. As discussed, use the trick of natural and safe ways of repelling spiders away from your home without harming them.</li>

Most spiders won&rsquo;t try getting into your house during winter - it was just a spider myth. Spiders are cold blooded and thus may die or fail to reproduce when they get into your warm house.</p>
<h2 id="details-where-do-spiders-go-in-the-winter">Details: Where Do Spiders Go in the Winter?</h2>
<p>Through natural instincts, the spiders will move to better sheltered areas during winter. These include rock piles, bark cracks on trees or under leaf litter. During winter, the favorable conditions in these areas plus their antifreeze keep the fleas alive.
In addition. spiders like the tarantula will lay their eggs during spring and thus will safely cross the harsh winter as babies in their protective cocoons.
Further, some of the baby spiders, after hatching, will hide in the egg sacs that are webbed for use by the whole spider community over the winter period.
However, the spiders that&rsquo;ll be hiding under rock piles and leaf litter� won&rsquo;t be sleeping (
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-sleep/">spiders don&rsquo;t sleep</a>
) but may be moving around searching for food.</p>
<h3 id="1-outdoor-spiders">1 Outdoor Spiders</h3>
<p>Sutdoor spiders� will live very comfortably in your outdoor spaces but won&rsquo;t easily survive the conditions in the indoors. E.g. North American spider can&rsquo;t survive the winter in the indoor shelters.</p>
<p>As &ldquo;cold-blooded&rdquo; insects, spiders won&rsquo;t be attracted to conditions of warmth in the indoor spaces. Thus, spider&rsquo;s won;t get cold or shiver from the winter - they become come dormant and less active.
The outdoor spiders will hibernate into indoor spaces but won&rsquo;t reproduce or they&rsquo;ll even die.
Further, spiders come with &ldquo;antifreeze&rdquo; in their bodies - particularly those from temperate areas. Therefore, antifreeze prevents the spider&rsquo;s body from freezing at temperatures above about -5 C.</p>
<h3 id="2-indoor-or-house-spiders">2. Indoor or House spiders</h3>
<p>The indoor or house spiders are few in terms of species but they&rsquo;ll conditioned to live in the indoor conditions - i.e. limited water supply, bad food supply, and constant climate.
Historically, some species of the house spiders (mainly found in Europe) are known to have always lived in the indoor spaces. The spiders have moved worldwide and some are conditioned to live in the outdoor spaces such as in North America.
These house spiders will occupy your house through
<a href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-all-spiders-make-webs">eggs sacs</a>
that comes with building materials or old furniture. They&rsquo;ll mainly live in the house and only emerge during
<a href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-late-summer-has-most-spiders">the last summer</a>
(which is around September &amp; August).
The baby and female spiders will hibernate in the neglected spaces, behind appliances or furniture, storage rooms, and crawlspaces. Notably, just a small percentage of the house spiders will ever more outdoors.</p>
<h2 id="how-spiders-survive-winter">How Spider&rsquo;s Survive Winter</h2>
<h3 id="1-antifreeze">1. &ldquo;Antifreeze&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Spiders living in the colder regions have an�&ldquo;antifreeze&rdquo; - and adaptation that helps prevent their body from freezing during the cold or winter season.
If the temperatures begin to fall, then the spider&rsquo;s body accumulates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol">glycol compounds</a>
(this acts like the antifreeze) in the blood. The antifreeze will work just like the engine antifreeze.
The glycol enables the tissues in the spider to stay
<a href="https://arthropodecology.com/2016/01/05/frozen-spiders/">unfrozen withvery low temperatures</a>
. However, this method is a short term remedy used by the spiders during winter.
Thus, the spider hibernates to the favorable areas such as neglected spaces, behind appliances or furniture, storage rooms, soil or snow layer and crawlspaces - the
<a href="https://northernwoodlands.org/outside_story/article/subnivean-shelter-snow">subnivean zone</a>
.
The favorable zone will insulate spiders against harsh winter conditions like cold but allow them to run around searching food. But, during the spring, the spiders will eventually stop generating the antifreeze as the air and temperature clears.</p>
<h3 id="2-nests">2. Nests</h3>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted above, spiders eggs will die from the low and freezing temperatures - and thus they&rsquo;ll do the best to ensure the eggs will survive through winter.
Most of the spiders will produce eggs (after mating)
<a href="https://www.wpr.org/what-happens-spiders-winter">during early fall</a>
. Therefore, the spiders will search favorable places to lay and hide their eggs as the temperatures fall.
These include secluded, dark or hidden areas such as burrows, downspouts, chimneys. This allows the spider eggs to rain alive and warm through winter waiting for spring to hatch.
Further, the spiders create webs that look like webs - creating a safe haven for the eggs. The spiders also create a web wall that&rsquo;ll overall the bare cracks or corners.
After winter or when the temperatures and conditions become better, the baby spiders will gnaw away the spider webs to jump off to the environment.</p>
<h3 id="3-house">3. House</h3>
<p>Definitely some spiders may look onto your house as a safe place to hide away from the harsh and freezing winter climate. Just like
bed bugs
, the spiders will sneak into your home for safety.
Spiders search for humid and warm conditions during winter where they can create their safety webs. Therefore, your home offers the favorable conditions.
The bugs will climb onto roof shingles, siding, walls, windows and get into your home. Also, dark pantries, closets, basements, and attics will be suitable locations for the spiders to hide in your house.
Considering a food sources, spiders will also search for a location that&rsquo;ll enable them to hunt for their prey. Therefore, spiders can prey on other pests that&rsquo;re bugging you during winter.</p>
<h3 id="4-insulation">4. Insulation</h3>
<p>Spiders are equally intelligent bugs that&rsquo;ll create insulation against the freezing winter conditions - they&rsquo;ll
<a href="http://www.actforlibraries.org/spiders-in-winter/">build a warm pod</a>
waiting for warmer months.
The spiders will build the pods on secluded and enclosed places where they&rsquo;ll build web covering the openings to make something looking like their egg nests.
The pod&rsquo;s web will prevent the cold air for hitting the spiders and their eggs for them to survive winter conditions. However, other spiders create the pads under snow or the soil for additional insulation.</p>
<p>Spiders will also insulate their bodies and eggs by building on building sidings and roof corners. However, the bugs will break off from the webs when its warmer to hunt for food.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike the
Black Widow Spiders
, the Wolf Spiders are big hunting spiders that will not require webs to affectively trap their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the United States, youll find 2 main species of the Wolf Spiders (Lycosidae spp); H. aspersa and the Hogna carolinensis.
The Lycosidae family (where the <a href="/posts/can-you-drown-a-spider/">spider</a> belongs) are arachnids that have athletic, hairy, and have a large body size.
The Lycos bit means &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; due to the wolf-like hunting habits but the spiders are solitary animals and thus they hunt alone and not in packs.

<h2 id="wolf-spider-appearance">Wolf Spider Appearance</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about your traditional spider then the wolf spiders won&rsquo;t match that body and behavior archetype.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, wolf spiders will not spin webs but instead hunt down their prey just like wolves.</li>
<li>The Lycosidae (meaning wolf in Greek) may have some similarities with the tarantulas but they are smaller and come from a different family.
Wolf spiders have brown to Gray (and hairy) bodies that have varied lines or markings.</li>
<li>The male spiders are about 19 mm (3/4&quot;) in length while their female counterparts are 23 to 24 mm (3/8&quot; - 1&quot;).
The male carolinensis measure about 18 - 20 millimeters while the females have a length of 22 - 35 millimeters.
The male Tigrosa aspersa measure about 16 - 18 millimeters while the females measure about 18 - 25 millimeters.
The darker color of the wolf spiders helps them camouflage and hide from their predators and approach their prey unnoticed.
The Hogna ingens (desertas wolf spiders) are documented who has the longest body with their legs spanning about 12 cm.
The wolf spiders have eyes that are arranged into three rows.</li>
<li>The eyes in the first row are small-sized (4), those in the second row are larger (2), and finally, the eyes in the bathroom are medium-sized (2).
A unique feature of the eyes in the wolf spiders is that the eyes in their central row are considerably larger.
Next, you should check if the end of the spider&rsquo;s legs 3 claws (tarsal claws).</li>
<li>The tarsal may be described as the last segment in the legs of an insect.
The wolf spiders are in the infra-order Araneomorphae ( &ldquo;true spiders&rdquo;) and the members in this group have pincer-like fangs that have a side-by-side orientation.</li>
<li>The side-by-side oriented fang will help you differentiate the wolf spiders from the small tarantula.</li>
<li>The latter (the small tarantula) are classified in the infraorder Mygalomorphae that come with fangs that are vertically-oriented.
On comparing the brown recluse with the wolf spiders; the wolf spiders have shorter legs and they lack the marking behind-the-head (violin-shaped) which is characteristic in the brown recluse.

The wolf spiders also have hairs that cover their abdomen -
<a href="https://www.uky.edu/Ag/CritterFiles/casefile/spiders/wolf/wolf.htm">Kentucky Entomology</a>
.</li>
<li>This feature may make you confuse them with the tarantula but the wolf spiders are smaller in body size.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wolf-spider-behavior">Wolf Spider Behavior</h2>
<p>As noted above the wolf spiders are hunting arachnids (theyre great sprinters) and so they won&rsquo;t lay webs to catch their prey.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is where the wolf spiders derived their name from because they will hunt down their prey.
Where can you find the wolf spiders? The habitat of the wolf spiders includes the rainforests, alpine meadows, wetlands, coastal forests, inland shrublands, deserts, and dry or Woodlands.</li>
<li>But some species of wolf spiders may occupy suburban gardens, riverbank beds, mountains herbal fields, and coastal sand dunes.
The
<a href="https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=847731">ITIS</a>
reports that the wolf spiders (Lycosidae) have about 2400 species that are classified into 123+ genera.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wolf-spider-habitat">Wolf Spider Habitat</h2>
<p>Examine whether the spider under consideration will retreat to some burrow. The burrows may be found on outbuildings, around the house, and windows or doors.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will identify the spider as a wolf spider if it tends to move into a crevice or burrow as opposed to a web.
But the trap doors and the tarantulas also tend to move into burrows but they are relatively larger in size compared to the wolf spiders.
Another characteristic feature of the wolf spiders is that they will be comfortable on the ground spying on their prey and they will rarely climb onto tall objects.
As noted earlier the wolf spiders will have some white sack (containing eggs) on the back of the abdomen during the summer and spring seasons.</li>
<li>Also, the female wolf spiders tend to carry they are spiderlings on their backs.
Wolf spiders hunt their prey (including caterpillars and crickets) during the night (thanks to having a great night vision) and day.</li>
<li>But the shining of their eyes during the night makes them also be detected easily.
Finally, the wolf spiders are classified as very fast - an adaptation that helps them catch their prey very fast.
The main habitats of the wolf spiders are low vegetation, gravel, stream edges but may sometimes climb on trees although you will mainly find them on the ground.
Wolf spiders can enter your house through breezeways, crawl spaces, and basements.
Females with large bodies can eat small reptiles and amphibians but wolf spiders generally eat other spiders, crickets, and ground-dwelling insects.
Wolf spiders utilize their vibrations sensitivity, fast movement, excellent camouflage, and keen eyesight to avoid predators such as hunting wasps, birds, and lizards.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-dangerous-are-the-wolf-spiders">How Dangerous Are The Wolf Spiders</h2>
<p>Wolf spiders will only bite humans when mishandled or if they feel threatened.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arachnids will only socialize during the mating season and thus they will walk as lone wolves.
Wolf spiders are venomous but are not classified as poisonous to humans - as reported by
<a href="http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/wolf-spiders">Penn State College</a>
.
This means that the venom produced by The wolf spiders will paralyze the small and crawling insects but won&rsquo;t be toxic people.</li>
<li>In comparison, the wolf spider bite is classified (on pain level and the danger posed) just under a bee sting.
The wolf spider bite will cause redness and pain in most humans but these side effects will go off gradually.
So if you have noticed a spider that is moving fast in the house, most likely it is a wolf spider since the brown recluse spiders don&rsquo;t come out in the open regularly.
When ready to mate, the female wolf spiders will drop scent markings that will help the males locate them.</li>
<li>The males will wave their pedipalps (the sensory appendages around the mouths) and legs to signal their courtship intentions to the females.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So what should I do when I see a wolf spider? You can evade the wolf spider bites by avoiding picking or touching (or even squishing) them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Squishing the female wolf spiders may also damage the eggs sacs on their backs and thus may drop hundreds of them and spiderlings in your house - you canuse spider bombs to contol them.
Wolf spiders are mainly walking on the ground and will rarely climb on tall objects or structures.</li>
