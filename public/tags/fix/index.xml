      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/airless-paint-sprayer-tips/">Paint</a> peeling is a common problem that occurs on painted walls, ceiling, pavements, or furniture due to loss of stickiness strength over a while. Usually, peels damage the primary surface and destroy the aesthetic impression of a given surface.</p>
<p><em>Well, the question at hand is, how do I <a href="/posts/how-to-fix-peeling-paint-on-drywall/">fix</a> peeling paint on the ceiling? Simple! You need to prepare the surface sufficiently (sanding), prime the polished ceiling, repaint, and let the final finish dry naturally without touching even your bathroom.</em>
<em>Also, purchase interior paint and primer that match the paint type you intend to apply on a particular ceiling (whether acrylic or latex paint/primer). Further, the sanding/polishing should be finely done to improve stickiness and eliminate drains during paint application.</em></p>

<h3 id="b-ceiling-preparation---sanding">b. Ceiling Preparation - Sanding</h3>
<p>This stage is crucial since its geared toward eliminating the peels and chips from the ceiling. Further, the ceiling preparation paves the way for a more comfortable way of prime application. Follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put on theprotective gear - goggles, dustcoat, respirator, gloves, face mask, and safety boots</li>
<li>Set the ladder in such a way you can access the ceiling without straining  consider a stand-alone type of ladder</li>
<li>Lay tack cloth, plastic sheet, or polyethylene paper on the floor to prevent it from straining during the restoration</li>
<li>Using the paint scraper, remove peels gently from the ceiling  you can use a wire brush for solid paint peels</li>
<li>Using the putty knife and a filler, seal the holes, cracks, and opening on the ceiling and leave it to cure for 10 minutes</li>
<li>Sand the ceiling gently with rough grain sandpaper and polish with fine-grain sandpaper to remove paint traces</li>
<li>Blow/wipe of dust from the surface using ashop vacuumor a piece of cloth
The ceiling should be left dry - any wetness should be dried out (use a heat gun) before priming begins.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c-priming">c. Priming</h3>
<p>The primer prepares the primary ceiling surface by sealing any holes or porous points on the primary material. In doing this, the paints stickiness ability is boosted while unnecessary drains/runs are reduced.
You can either use an oil-based primer or water-based primer according to the final paint you intend to paint your ceiling. Follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark the ceiling points with masking tape  prevents prime overflow to adjacent surfaces when priming.</li>
<li>Prepare your primer appropriately according to the manufacturers instructions.</li>
<li>Soak the paintbrush or arollerin the primer sufficiently (dont overload)</li>
<li>Gently apply the primer on the ceiling back and fro  a roller is preferable as it leaves a better surface finish.</li>
<li>Repeat the process until the entire ceiling is primed
NB: Avoid over excess prime application apply sufficiently to cover primary ceiling material. Do not use a double primer layer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-repainting-the-ceiling">d. Repainting the Ceiling</h3>
<p>The repainting process should be carried out in a well-ventilated room. The paint choice (either oil-based or latex paint) should be matched with the primer used. Otherwise, the wrong combination will lead to peeling action with time.
Follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare the paint according to the manufacturers instructions</li>
<li>Soak the roller or a paintbrush sufficiently in the paint (dont overload)</li>
<li>Gently, apply the paint on the ceiling  to and from</li>
<li>Repeat the previous step until the entire ceiling is painted</li>
<li>Use an angled paintbrush to paint ceiling corners or clear drains
NB:
a ceiling paint sprayer
guarantees you a better finish when used for ceiling painting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e-finish">e. Finish</h3>
<p>Upon completion, leave the paint to dry for about one hour (follow manufactures advice). Remove all the masking tape gently  rapid removal causes paint chipping or damage finish.
Clean
the paintbrush
, roller, or paint sprayer with thinner or water according to the paint used and store it appropriately. Collect the peel debris in a dust collection bag and dispose of it appropriately.
Using a wet piece of cloth or thinner, wipe up any paint/primer sport that may have stained the floor  this is best done when the stain is still wet. Remove all equipment and leave the ceiling to cure naturally without touching.</p>

<h2 id="what-causes-house-ceiling-paint-to-peel">What Causes House Ceiling Paint to Peel</h2>
<p>Paint peeling doesnt just occur naturally - its attributed to causes ranging from the nature of paint to primary surface preparation. Here are some of the major causes of peeling paint on the ceiling:</p>
<h3 id="1-low-quality-paints">1. Low-Quality Paints</h3>
<p>Low-quality paint has poor flexibility and weak adhesive properties. Such paint has low poor stickiness ability and doesnt dry properly; thus, they end up peeling after a short period.</p>
<h3 id="2-moisture">2. Moisture</h3>
<p>Moisture weakens the paint stickiness ability with primary ceiling material. As the moisture penetrates the paint coating, the layers detach, bulge, and eventually peels off.</p>
<h3 id="3-exposed-to-high-temperatures">3. Exposed to High Temperatures</h3>
<p>High temperatures weaken paint adhesive bonds that are in direct contact with ceiling surface material. Continued heating leads to cracking, chipping, and peeling off paint coating/layers.</p>
<h3 id="4-improper-surface-preparation">4. Improper Surface Preparation</h3>
<p>Improper surface preparation, like imperfect sanding process (rugged surface), creates room for bubble formation when painting. These bubbles break and lead to the peeling action of the paint layer.
Uncleaned dirt polish traces on the ceiling surface weakens the paint stickiness leading to peeling with time.</p>
<h3 id="5-incorrect-paint-application-method">5. Incorrect paint application method</h3>
<p>Using the wrong paint application method leads to low paint cohesion on the ceiling surface. The bubbles may be embedded with the paint layer, which may initiate chipping or peeling action with time.
Roller painting leaves unattended corners, which triggers peeling action.</p>

<h3 id="6-painting-dirty-ceiling-surface">6. Painting Dirty Ceiling Surface</h3>
<p>The ceiling should be dirt-free before any painting takes place. The presence of dirt weakens paint stickiness strength, thus leading to peeling action.</p>
<h3 id="7-ceiling-surface-being-in-a-dry-environment">7. Ceiling Surface Being in a Dry Environment</h3>
<p>When the painted ceiling is exposed to arid conditions, the paint adhesive bonds weaken and start to chip and peel off.</p>
<h3 id="8-paint-that-is-incompatible-with-the-ceiling-primary-surface-material">8. Paint that is Incompatible with the Ceiling Primary Surface Material</h3>
<p>The primary surface material of the ceiling determines the type of paint to use during application. Some paints are not compatible with the ceiling surface. Upon application, the paint layer chips or peels in a short period.
Some ceiling material may have chemicals that react with applied paint, thus weakening the paint stickiness on that particular surface.</p>
<h3 id="9-too-many-layers-of-paint">9. Too Many Layers of Paint</h3>
<p>Too many paint layers form a weak surface stickiness. They add self-weight on the ceiling and end up peeling off. Besides, the layers may stretch the first coating on the ceiling and hence breaks the surface contact.</p>
<h3 id="10-using-old-paint">10. Using Old paint</h3>
<p>The old paint has a weak paint cohesive bond and low surface stickiness. The paint sticks gently and ends up chipping or peeling after a short period.</p>
<h3 id="11-different-kinds-of-paints-used">11. Different Kinds of Paints Used</h3>
<p>Mixing different types of paints weakens the stickiness ability on the ceiling surface. Applying latex paint over acrylic paint will cause peeling off due to a weak paint adhesive bond on a given surface.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/help-for-fertilizer-burn-in-lawn/">Fertilizer</a> is a vital tool for cultivating a lush, green lawn, providing essential nutrients that encourage robust growth and vibrant color. However, like any powerful tool, it must be used with care and precision. An overzealous application or improper technique can quickly turn a beneficial treatment into a damaging one, leading to a common and disheartening issue known as &ldquo;fertilizer burn.&rdquo; This unwelcome sight manifests as yellow, brown, or even black patches, making a once-healthy lawn appear scorched and unsightly.</p>
<p>Fertilizer burn is a setback that can leave homeowners frustrated and their lawns in distress. The good news is that while it looks severe, many cases of fertilizer burn are fixable, and more importantly, preventable. Understanding why burn occurs, how to accurately identify its symptoms, and implementing corrective measures are crucial steps toward recovery. This guide will delve into the causes of fertilizer burn, provide a step-by-step approach to nursing your lawn back to health, and offer comprehensive tips to ensure you never face this common lawn care mishap again.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-fertilizer-burn">What Is Fertilizer Burn?</h2>
<p>Fertilizer burn, often referred to as &ldquo;chemical burn&rdquo; or &ldquo;salt burn,&rdquo; occurs when grass roots are exposed to an excessive concentration of salts present in fertilizers. Most fertilizers, particularly synthetic ones, are composed of mineral salts that dissolve in water to release nutrients. While a controlled amount of these salts is beneficial for plant uptake, too much can create an osmotic imbalance.</p>
<p>In simple terms, when the salt concentration in the soil around the grass roots becomes higher than the salt concentration inside the roots, water is drawn <em>out</em> of the roots rather than being absorbed <em>into</em> them. This process, known as reverse osmosis, essentially dehydrates the grass cells, causing them to dry out, turn yellow or brown, and eventually die. The effect is similar to what happens when you pour salt on a slug � it draws out the moisture. This rapid dehydration is why the damage appears so quickly and severely, mimicking a scorched appearance.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-fertilizer-burn">Identifying Fertilizer Burn</h2>
<p>Recognizing fertilizer burn is key to addressing it promptly. The symptoms are usually quite distinct:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Yellowing:</strong> The initial sign is often a rapid yellowing of grass blades. This is a common stress response, but with fertilizer burn, it progresses quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Browning/Browning Tips:</strong> As dehydration worsens, the yellow areas will turn brown. You might see just the tips of the grass blades browning first, which then spreads down the blade.</li>
<li><strong>Crispy, Dry Texture:</strong> The affected grass will feel brittle and dry to the touch, almost straw-like, even if the surrounding soil feels moist.</li>
<li><strong>Distinct Patterns:</strong> Fertilizer burn often appears in specific patterns corresponding to the application method:
<ul>
<li><strong>Streaks or Stripes:</strong> If using a spreader with an uneven application pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Circular Patches:</strong> Where a granular fertilizer spreader might have stopped, creating a concentrated pile.</li>
<li><strong>Outline of Beds/Driveways:</strong> Where excess granules landed outside the intended area.</li>
<li><strong>General Discoloration:</strong> If a liquid fertilizer was applied unevenly or at too high a concentration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Onset:</strong> Unlike nutrient deficiencies or diseases that develop gradually, fertilizer burn typically manifests within a few hours to a few days after application.</li>
<li><strong>Healthy Surrounding Areas:</strong> Often, the areas immediately adjacent to the burn spots, or areas that received less fertilizer, will remain green and healthy, providing a stark contrast.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to differentiate fertilizer burn from other issues like fungal diseases (which often have distinct lesion patterns or fungal growth), insect damage (which can show chewing marks or specific patterns of dieback), or drought stress (which usually affects the entire lawn uniformly before progressing to patches).</p>
<h2 id="4-common-causes-of-fertilizer-burn">4 Common Causes of Fertilizer Burn</h2>
<p>Understanding the reasons behind fertilizer burn can help you prevent it in the future:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Over-Application (Too Much Fertilizer):</strong> This is the most frequent cause. Applying more fertilizer than recommended by the product label or soil test leads to an excessive concentration of salts in the soil. More is <em>not</em> better when it comes to fertilizer.</li>
<li><strong>Uneven Application:</strong> Even if the correct amount of fertilizer is used, applying it unevenly can lead to concentrated pockets. This commonly happens with:
<ul>
<li><strong>Spreader Errors:</strong> Malfunctioning spreaders, improper spreader settings, or overlapping passes too much.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Spreading:</strong> Inconsistent scattering of granules by hand.</li>
<li><strong>Liquid Sprayer Issues:</strong> Clogged nozzles or inconsistent spray patterns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applying Fertilizer to Wet Grass:</strong> When granular fertilizer lands on wet grass blades, it dissolves rapidly and sticks to the blades, causing localized, intense burn spots before it can dissolve and move into the soil. It can also lead to uneven distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Applying Fertilizer During Hot or Dry Conditions:</strong> High temperatures and dry soil amplify the effects of fertilizer salts. Without sufficient moisture to dilute and distribute the nutrients, the salts become highly concentrated around the roots, leading to immediate dehydration. Lawns already stressed by drought are particularly vulnerable.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-fix-fertilizer-burn-6-steps">How To Fix Fertilizer Burn (6 Steps)</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve identified fertilizer burn on your lawn, immediate action is crucial to minimize damage and promote recovery.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the Burned Areas:</strong> Clearly delineate the affected spots.</li>
<li><strong>Rake Up Excess Granules (If Applicable):</strong> If the burn is very fresh and you can still see undissolved fertilizer granules on the surface, gently rake them up and remove them. This prevents further dissolution and exacerbation of the problem. Be careful not to further damage the grass.</li>
<li><strong>Flush the Area with Water:</strong> This is the most critical step. Immediately and thoroughly saturate the burned areas with water. Use a sprinkler or hose to apply water for 15-30 minutes, aiming for at least an inch (2.5 cm) of water. The goal is to dissolve the excess salts and leach them deeper into the soil, away from the root zone. Repeat this flushing process daily for several days, especially if there&rsquo;s no rain.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate Damage and Wait:</strong> After flushing, wait a few days to a week. Severely damaged grass may not recover and will likely die. However, less affected areas or grass that was only partially burned might start to show signs of recovery or stop getting worse.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Dead Grass (If Necessary):</strong> If, after a week or two of flushing, the burned patches are clearly dead (brown, crispy, and don&rsquo;t show any signs of greening at the base), gently rake out the dead grass and debris. This prepares the area for reseeding.</li>
<li><strong>Reseed or Resod:</strong> For areas where the grass has died completely, you will need to reseed or resod.
<ul>
<li><strong>Reseeding:</strong> Loosen the soil in the bare patches, apply a thin layer of new topsoil or compost, spread grass seed appropriate for your region, and lightly cover it with more compost or peat moss. Keep the newly seeded areas consistently moist until germination and establishment. This is often best done in the fall for cool-season grasses or late spring for warm-season grasses.</li>
<li><strong>Resodding:</strong> For immediate results, you can cut out the dead turf and replace it with new sod. Ensure good soil contact and consistent watering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Patience is key during the recovery process. It may take several weeks for the lawn to show significant improvement or for new grass to establish.</p>
<h2 id="9-tips-for-preventing-fertilizer-burn">9 Tips for Preventing Fertilizer Burn</h2>
<p>Prevention is always better than cure when it comes to fertilizer burn. Adhere to these best practices for safe and effective fertilization:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read the Label Carefully:</strong> This is the most important rule. Always follow the product manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended application rates, spreader settings, and instructions precisely.</li>
<li><strong>Measure Your Lawn Accurately:</strong> Know the exact square footage of your lawn to ensure you apply the correct amount of fertilizer. Overestimating leads to over-application.</li>
<li><strong>Calibrate Your Spreader:</strong> Different fertilizers have different granule sizes and densities. Calibrate your spreader according to the fertilizer&rsquo;s instructions for accurate distribution. Test it on a hard surface first to check the spread pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Apply to Dry Grass:</strong> Always apply granular fertilizers to dry grass. This prevents granules from sticking to wet blades and causing localized burn.</li>
<li><strong>Water Immediately After Application (Granular):</strong> After applying granular fertilizer to dry grass, water your lawn thoroughly (about 0.5 inches or 1.25 cm). This dissolves the granules, moves the nutrients into the soil, and dilutes the salts, preventing burn.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Overlapping Spreader Passes:</strong> Overlapping passes too much can double the application rate in those areas. Use a consistent walking pace and overlap by just the recommended amount (often the width of your spreader wheels) for even coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Edge with Caution:</strong> When turning at the end of a pass, close your spreader gate to avoid dumping excess fertilizer. For liquid applications, turn off the sprayer briefly. Be extra careful along driveways, sidewalks, and garden beds, as runoff or direct contact can burn plants.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Fertilizing Stressed Lawns:</strong> Do not apply fertilizer to a dormant, drought-stressed, or unhealthy lawn. Ensure the lawn is actively growing and adequately hydrated.</li>
<li><strong>Consider Slow-Release Fertilizers:</strong> Slow-release (or controlled-release) fertilizers release nutrients gradually over time, significantly reducing the risk of burn compared to quick-release (fast-acting) fertilizers. Organic fertilizers also typically have a very low burn potential due to their natural, slower breakdown.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="when-to-seek-professional-help">When To Seek Professional Help</h2>
<p>While most cases of fertilizer burn can be managed with DIY steps, there are instances where professional help might be necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extensive Damage:</strong> If a very large portion of your lawn is severely burned, a professional lawn care service might have the equipment and expertise to recover it more efficiently, potentially through specialized treatments or rapid reseeding/sodding.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Problems:</strong> If you consistently experience fertilizer burn despite following prevention tips, a professional can assess your soil composition, identify underlying issues, and recommend a tailored fertilization plan.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty About Cause:</strong> If you&rsquo;re unsure if the damage is truly fertilizer burn or another issue (disease, pests), a professional diagnosis can prevent you from applying incorrect treatments.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Time or Equipment:</strong> If you simply don&rsquo;t have the time, the necessary equipment for large-scale reseeding, or the desire to tackle the problem yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>A reputable lawn care professional can often provide a soil test, offer expert advice, and implement effective recovery strategies.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-about-fixing-fertilizer-burn-on-lawn">Final Thoughts About Fixing Fertilizer Burn on Lawn</h2>
<p>Fertilizer burn is a disheartening but often recoverable setback in lawn care. The key to mitigating its impact lies in swift action, primarily focused on flushing the affected areas with plenty of water to dilute and disperse the excess salts. While recovery may take time and potentially require reseeding, the long-term lesson is invaluable: precision and moderation are paramount when applying lawn fertilizers.</p>
<p>By committing to accurate measurements, proper spreader calibration, and meticulous application techniques, you can largely eliminate the risk of fertilizer burn. Furthermore, by understanding your lawn&rsquo;s specific needs and opting for appropriate fertilizer types and timings, you empower your grass to thrive, ensuring that your efforts yield the lush, green results you desire, rather than a scorched landscape. Treat your lawn&rsquo;s nutrition with respect, and it will reward you with vibrant health.</p>

<li>Using a broom, sweep the drywall to remove the dust or surface debris completely. Alternatively, you can pass a vacuum cleaner over the drywall gently in order to suck dust particles</li>
<li>Using a paint scraper, scratch old peeling paint entirely. You can thin the paint before scraping where necessary</li>
<li>Usesandpaper (220 grit or medium grit)to sand the surface gently  helps remove remnants of peeling paint from the surface and eliminate surface unevenness</li>
<li>For finer sanding process, consider using a sander, which matches the type of primary drywall material</li>
<li>Use a blower to clean dust and dislodged material from the drywall surface
<em>2. Polishing</em></li>
<li>Plug a polishing machine (soft grade) to the power supply and run it over the sand surface in order to achieve a smooth final finish.</li>
<li>When polishing, run the machine back forth as per the orientation of the drywall surface. For wood and laminated drywall, pass the polishing machine along the direction of the grains to avoid further surface damage</li>
<li>Blow or sweep dust from the surface and scan to see if there is any paint remains on the surface</li>
<li>Using a wet piece of cloth, mop and rinse the drywall to dryness</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-repairseal-the-dents-and-damaged-section">c. Repair/Seal the Dents and damaged section</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using patching material, seal/repair dents and damaged sections. Fill the holes and porous sections too</li>
<li>Smoothen the filled area with a putty knife and clean excess material</li>
<li>Leave the surface to dry sufficiently</li>
<li>Sand and polish the sealed points, and mop before leaving the drywall to dry naturally ready for the next step
When carrying out a surface repair, select the patching compound that matched the particular primary material of the drywall.
Otherwise, the adhesive contact may be low, leading to peeling or flaking with time.</li>

<h3 id="d-primer-and-paint-selection">d. Primer and Paint Selection</h3>
<p>When selecting the primer, consider the type of drywall material. Its advisable to purchase universal primer (works for almost all surfaces).
Moreover, your selected primer should match with the final paint finish  oil-based paint should be primed using oil-based primer and vice versa.
Choose a primer and paint thats fast-drying peel resistant, more comfortable to prepare and resistant to mould/mildew. The paint should either be used indoors or outdoors as per the location of the drywall.
Remember, the quantity of paint purchased is a function of the surface area under paint application.</p>
<h3 id="e-prime-the-surface">e. Prime the Surface</h3>
<p>Add primer into an empty bucket and thin where necessary  you need to follow manufacturers instructions when thinning. Alternative, carry out a drip test  a well-thinned primer should load on a paintbrush without forming many drains</p>
<ul>
<li>Dipthe paintbrushinto the primer and apply over the drywall  back and forth  until the entire surface is coated</li>
<li>Leave the prime coat to dry as per the time given by the manufacturer before applying the next coat if need be</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="f-actual-paint-application">f. Actual Paint Application</h3>
<p>Pour finish paint into an empty bucket and thin accordingly  as directed by the manufacturer</p>
<ul>
<li>Dip a paintbrush into the paint solvent and apply over the primed drywall. Alternatively, use a roller, especially for a flat, wide drywall surface.</li>
<li>Using a paintbrush (while on a ladder), cut corners and eliminate runs and streaks that may from when using roller before they dry out</li>
<li>Leave the surface to dry before applying a second coat where necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="g-final-finish">g. Final Finish</h3>
<p>To attain a smooth final finish, a soft bristle paintbrush should be used when terminating edges and lining paint finish coat.
Covering the painted surface (for oil-based paint) or sprinkling some water on the surface should be done to keep off the dust from settling due to electrostatic charges attraction.
Importantly, never polish or sand drywall after painting (when correcting runs/drains) as this act may destroy the impressive outlook impression.�See Also:

<h2 id="what-causes-paint-to-peel-on-drywall">What Causes Paint to Peel on Drywall?</h2>
<p>The following are some of the factors/conditions that cause the paint to peel on drywall:</p>
<h3 id="1-age">1. Age</h3>
<p>Upon application, the paint begins to age with time. The chemical structural formula is highly affected by extreme weather conditions, which weaken the molecular bonds.
Further, the paint begins to disintegrate (breaks) and loses adhesive ability over the primary surface material, thus leading to flaking or peeling.
On the other hand, applying old paint (expired paint) on the drywall leads to peeling, chipping, or scuffing due to low stickiness ability.</p>
<h3 id="2-excess-heat">2. Excess Heat</h3>
<p>Presence of high heat or direct sun radiations weakens the paint adhesive bond leading to peeling or flaking.
In addition, the UV-rays damage the paint chemical formulation, thus accelerating the ageing process  reduces paint coat service life.
Excess heat in enclosed drywall (interior) leads to continuous underneath accumulation (settles between the drywall and paint layer) leading to peeling action.
Interior drywall should have sufficient air conditioning system. See Also:

.</p>
<h3 id="3-humidity">3. Humidity</h3>
<p>High humidity level over the paint layer initiates peeling by allowing continuous moisture accumulation beneath the painted wall, thus weakening the stickiness ability.
Continuous wetness over the paint layer leads to weakening of paint molecules and reduction stickiness action over the drywall.
NB: Interior drywalls with high humidity content should be fitted with a dehumidifier to boost paint service life.</p>
<h3 id="4-poor-surface-preparation">4. Poor Surface Preparation</h3>
<p>Primer or paint that is insufficiently prepared causes peeling to occur on drywall with time.
This occurrence may result due to low paint stickiness action or incomplete activation of active ingredients within the solvent upon paint application.
A highly viscous paint (under diluted) sticks fairly over the drywall  it ends up peeling after a couple of days.
Moreover, thin paint forms too many drains on the surface when painting, which leads to peeling or chipping occurrence.
NB: Always follow the manufacturers instructions during paint preparation or subcontract a painting professional to help you.</p>
<h3 id="5-too-many-paint-layers">5. Too many Paint Layers</h3>
<p>Applying too many paint layers creates internal stress at the bottom coat, thus leading to the onset of peeling action.
Usually, the surface strain on each paint layer is concentrated to the bottom paint coat (one holding on the drywall), which eventually loses the adhesive strength with time.
Furthermore, coating old peeling painting without surface preparation will only stay a few days before the entire paint layers peel again.
Its, therefore advisable that you consider applying a minimum paint layer (one or two) in order to avoid chipping, peeling, or scuffing problems.

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-paint-peeling-on-drywall">How to Prevent Paint Peeling On DryWall</h2>
<p>To enjoy longer service life upon paint application, you need to maintain your drywall properly and consider using these preventive measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean your drywall often with a moist piece of cloth to remove dust and surface debris  they cause paint coat weakness and initiate chipping and peeling action.</li>
<li>Never apply too many coats on the drywall or coat old paint before surface preparation.</li>
<li>High humid areas should be fitted with a dehumidifier in order to boost the drywalls service life.</li>
<li>Wet (painted) drywall should be mopped and rinsed effectively to prevent paint coat damage.</li>
<li>For the exterior drywall painting process, consider coating the finish layer with a UV-ray protective lamina.</li>
<li>Correct drains and runs formed when painted before they dry out and avoid scratching dried paint.</li>
<li>Do not wet drywalls painted with water-based paint  water thins the paint layer, thus leading to section peeling or chipping?</li>
<li>Aerosol chemicals shouldnt be sprayed over drywall coated with oil-based paint  lead to chemical reaction and surface disintegration.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="precautions-for-fixing-peeling-paint-on-drywall">Precautions for Fixing Peeling Paint on Drywall</h2>
<p>When fixing peeling paint on drywall, its advisable to follow the following precautions and safety measures in order to prevent injuries and other related health hazards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always put on protective attire  facemask, respirator, overall, gloves, boots, and goggles.</li>
<li>When sanding the drywall, avoid over pressing as it may damage the primary surface material.</li>
<li>Primer selected should always match the finish paint to be used  oil-based primer should be used with oil-based paint and vice versa.</li>
<li>Follow manufacturers instructions during paint preparation or contract a pint professional.</li>
<li>Never smell paint or primer directly (with your nose)  the paint has components that may choke you when inhaled.</li>
<li>Always carry out a drop test experiment before you begin to paint drywall (to ascertain stickiness level).</li>
<li>In case you get contact with thinner, primer, or paint, wash the section with water and soap immediately.</li>
<li>Clean the floor or working area after painting the drywall and dispose of waste material in a dustbin or a garbage pit.</li>
<li>Store paint and primer that remain, away from kids/pets to prevent intoxication if swallowed.</li>
<li>Avoid using old paint when fixing peeling paint. Always check the expiry date of a particular paint before breaking the seal.
