<h2 id="details-can-i-freeze-roaches-to-death"><strong>Details: Can I Freeze Roaches to Death?�</strong></h2>
<p>Roaches prefer temperatures between 25-30 degrees Celsius. When they fall below this level, the roaches will move to a warmer place. This explains why infestations are high in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Although roaches are cold-blooded, they cant make the transition from room temperature to an extremely cold environment in a matter of seconds. Also, you can consider the
