<h2 id="common-venomous-lizards">Common Venomous Lizards</h2>
<p><strong>1. Gila Monster</strong>
Gila is an endangered lizard of northern Mexico and the south-western US. Its usually black in color with bright spots on various parts of the body. It has a notable stout body which is bulged at the head and tail.</p>
<p>An adult can reach about 20 inch and feeds on birds, small mammals and their eggs. The bulged head helps in holding the prey in place as it injects the venom to paralyze it.</p>
<p>But unlike snakes, all venomous lizards such as
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/11/17/1506321.htm">Australian lizards</a>
dont have fangs. Venom flows over the groves on their teeth to the prey. They rarely bite humans. If they bite they wont cause death.
<strong>2. Mexican Beaded Lizard</strong>
A close relative to the Gila monster, Mexican Beaded Lizard lives in western as well as the central parts of Mexico. It resembles the Gila monster in all aspects except that its darker and grows longer (32 inches).</p>
<p>Its also an endangered species and its trade has been banned. They inhabit thorn scrubs and pine forests where they feed on small mammals, birds and their eggs - like the
blue tailed lizards are venomous
.</p>
<p>Similar to Gila, this lizard bites it prey and holds on it with its powerful jaws before paralyzing it with its venom. For humans, the bite is only painful but it wont cause death.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8bD0y2M3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8bD0y2M3s</a>
<strong>3. Iguana</strong>
These are large lizards stretching to about 6.6 feet long. The most common is the green iguana usually found in Brazil and Mexico. They mainly inhabit arid areas, tree and the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Unlike most lizards, iguanas are vegetarians. However, they have sharp teeth which they use to bite impending intruders. Their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom">venom</a>
is relatively mild compared to other venomous lizards.</p>
<p>Although they dont attack easily, they can cause serious injuries on soft skin such as face, hands and legs.�But they are known to warn intruders before they strike. Watch out for iguanas when they take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on their fours.
<strong>4. Monitor Lizard�</strong>
Last but not least is the
monitor lizards
. Commonly found in Australia, these lizards vary greatly in size (2/3 foot to 10 feet). They are not usually very aggressive to intruders and will tend to run away.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-know-if-a-lizard-is-poisonous">How Do You Know If A Lizard Is Poisonous?</h2>
<p>Therere only few venomous lizards on earth. Unlike the common house lizards, venomous lizards live in the wild away from humans. Most of them live in burrows and dont come out so often. Here are notable features to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theyre relatively larger than house lizards</li>
<li>Their skin is beaded skin instead of being scally</li>
<li>Can be recognized by their distinct colors i.e black and yellow, black and red or black and orange.</li>
<li>Strong limbs</li>
<li>They exhibit signs of panic. For instance, some lizards will produce a hissing sound. Notably the iguanas will take a deep breath, lower their dewlap or stand on its four limbs.</li>
<li>When they bite, they clamp on until they are forcefully dislodged</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-dislodge-a-lizard-from-a-victim">How to Dislodge a Lizard from a Victim</h2>
<p>Whenever they bite, venomous lizards tend to cling on the victim while they release venom. The powerful jaws on their head makes it hard to detach.</p>
<p>Its advisable not to try to pull the animal as this would leave broken teeth in the victims flesh and cause further tissue damage. Here is what to do.
<strong>Open the Jaws with a Prying Tool -�</strong>
A prying tool such as a pliers or butter knife can be used to force open the jaws, and safely dislodge the lizard from the victim.
<strong>Immerse the Lizard in Water -�</strong>
Immersing the victims body together with the lizard in cold water is a safe way of detaching the animal. Some lizards are protected and so killing them is an offence.
<strong>Flame under the Chin -�</strong>
Another method of getting the lizard from the victims flesh is to slightly apply a flame just below the chin.
<strong>Allow the Lizard to Stand On Its Feet -�</strong>
If the lizard gets good grip on the ground, it may feel secure and release the grip. But this is not a quick method if you want to save the victim from subsequent venoms.</p>
<h2 id="final-word"><strong>Final Word</strong></h2>
<p>Most lizards are non-venomous and will not readily bite you. Even the few venomous lizards bite when provoked or in defense when they feel threatened.</p>
<p>Although the venom can barely kill a human, it can cause serious body reactions. In addition the bite can cause serious tissue damage. So, it good to be on the safe side whenever you encounter such lizards.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May be you have come across various species of lizards in your home, park or zoo and wonder whether they have backbones or not. How could their internal organs be protected or supported? Could they be having similar anatomy as mammals or other animals?
**So, Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates? The simple answer is, all species of <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">Lizard</a> are vertebrates (they have backbone also called the vertebral column/spinal column). **
**The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal regions and sacral apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into caudal and precaudal. **
<strong>The main function of the backbone is to offer protection to the spinal cord. It also provides an option for attachment of body muscles.�</strong>

<h2 id="are-lizards-vertebrates-or-invertebrates">Are Lizards Vertebrates or Invertebrates?</h2>
<p>Lizards including
bearded dragons
are vertebrates whose spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, caudal and sacral vertebrae. Some species may have lumbar region too.</p>
<p>The main function of vertebral column in Lizards is to protect the spinal cord (this house the nervous system and aid in body coordination). In addition, the backbone offers support to the body and attachment of muscles, pectoral and pelvic girdle for easier locomotion.</p>
<h3 id="a-vertebral-column-in-lizards">a. Vertebral column in lizards.</h3>
<p>Lizard (apart from legless lizards) have vertebral column also called spinal column or backbone that is divided into four parts i.e. cervical, dorsal, sacral and sacral vertebrae. Some lizard species may also have lumbar region.</p>
<p>These vertebral sub-divisions are formed mainly to help perform a given functions in lizards. The major function of vertebral column it to ensure sufficient protection of spinal cord  which runs vertically and centrally within vertebral column from the head to tail. The spinal cord helps in condonation of the nervous system of the entire lizard.</p>
<p>Related:
Do Lizards Have Teeth?
<strong>i. The cervical vertebrae.</strong>
This vertebra is found at the neck region of the lizards. The cervical vertebrae help support the neck and assist in free movement of the neck  side by side, up and down or around.</p>
<p>The special type of cervical vertebrae called atlas is well adapted to help in nodding while axis allows rotary motion. In most lizards, the vertebral are articulated and fused is such a way that they seem vestigial. In some lizard species, most of these bones are advanced to form dorsal vertebrae.</p>
<p>The cervical vertebrae also provide the option for attachment of neck muscles and skull resting point.
<strong>ii. Dorsal vertebrae.</strong>
This is also called Thoracic vertebrae. The Dorsal vertebrae offer the point for attachment of the ribs. The ribs provide protection for the lungs, heart and the liver. The sternum and scapula are also attached on these vertebrae.</p>
<p>The number of dorsal vertebra varies according to the species. The small lizards such as chameleon lizards and savannah lizards may have 8 to 12 dorsal vertebra. The medium size lizards such as Nile monitor lizards may have 11 to 17 thoracic vertebra while large lizards such as Komodo dragon may have 16 to 25 dorsal vertebra.
<strong>iii. Lumbar Vertebrae.</strong>
These are vertebrae that are found between the dorsal and the sacral vertebral. These vertebrae do not carry any rib. Most lizards do not have Lumbar vertebrae thus their dorsal and sacral vertebrae are directly interconnected.</p>
<p>Lumbar vertebrae are only found in few large lizard species such as monitor lizards and Komodo lizards. The lumbar vertebrae provides an option for the attachment of body muscles. These vertebrae also enable lizards to fold coil easily.
<strong>iv. The Sacral Vertebrae.</strong>
The Sacral vertebral is the found in sacrum section. It is connected with pelvic to offer option for support and attachment of pelvic muscles.</p>
<p>The sacral vertebral has 1 to 7 bones in lizards. The number varies according to the lizard species. The first 3 sacral bones are fuse to form a strong support at the pelvis girdle.</p>
<p>The sacral vertebra has a short stout rib-like protrusion, which offer point of muscle attachment. Moreover, these vertebrae have short arches and spines.
<strong>v. The Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
This is also called the tail vertebrae. In some lizards, the caudal vertebrae are fused with sacral vertebrae. These vertebrae have short stouts on the sizes that provide for the attachment of the muscles. There are 1 to a maximum of 30 caudal vertebra in lizards.</p>
<p>The small-tailed lizards such as stumpy-tailed lizards have few vertebra while long tailed lizards such as skinks, basilisk and chameleon lizards have large number of caudal vertebrae (10 to 30).</p>
<p>The arches and spines in caudal vertebrae continuously decreases up to the last vertebra. The caudal vertebral are adapted to provide easier movement of the tail.</p>

<h3 id="b-the-vertebral-column-of-legless-lizard">b. The Vertebral Column of Legless Lizard.</h3>
<p>Legless lizards are lizard species that have lost their legs independently at a point in life or their legs have reduced into point of no use in locomotion. These lizards crawl on the ground like snakes.</p>
<p>The legless lizard has its backbone divided into two sections i.e. the precaudal and caudal vertebrae. These sections collectively support the lizard and protect the spinal cord from external damage as well as offer support and attachment for body muscles.
<strong>i. Precaudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The precaudal vertebrae consist of bones that are found before the tail/caudal or pelvic region. In precaudal vertebrae, bone are interconnected to form one chain that help the lizards in locomotion.</p>
<p>The cervical, dorsal/thoracic and lumbar are connected into one unit. These vertebrae offer option of attachment of body muscles and the ribs.</p>
<p>Most legless lizards have the first to fifth bones in the precuadal vertebrae fused thus having minimum movement/turning.
<strong>ii. Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The sacral and tail vertebrae in legless lizards are fused to form caudal vertebrae. Legless lizards do not have lumbar vertebrae and pelvic girdle (if any is very small).</p>
<p>The caudal vertebrae forms the tail region, which is powerful for defense action. The first 5 to 10 vertebral bones are fused to give ample strength to the legless lizard at the caudal origin.</p>
<p>The caudal vertebra has stout that protrude laterally to provide option for attachment of back muscles. Moreover, the caudal vertebrae have short spines and arches that decreases gradually till the tip of the tail.</p>
<h3 id="c-functions-of-the-backbonespinal-column">c. Functions of the Backbone/spinal column</h3>
<p>The major function of spinal column in lizards is to protect the spinal cord, which controls the nervous systems. The spinal cord runs vertically from the head to the tail and its centrally located through the hollow sections left along the vertebral column.</p>
<p>The backbone also provides option of attachment of the body muscles and point of growth of other body somatic cells. The muscles grows from the backbone and accumulate enough to help coordinated movement of the lizards.</p>
<p>The backbone provides the point of connections for other appendicular skeleton. The femur, the humerus and scapula are jointed to the backbone using either ball and socket joint or hinge joint to enable easier locomotion. The appendages are interlinked and their entire weight is housed at the backbone.</p>
<p>In addition, the backbone provides extra support and protection to internal organs such as the heart, liver, lungs and intestine. The clavicle, ribs and pelvis girdle are well jointed on the backbone to help in provide further internal protection.</p>
<h2 id="is-lizard-a-reptile-or-amphibian">Is lizard a reptile or amphibian</h2>
<p>All lizards are reptiles including
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-monitor-lizards-poisonous/">monitor lizards</a>
. They are cold-blooded animals (ectothermic). Unlike amphibians (which have smooth and slippery skin), Lizards have skin which is covered with scare  this one features of all reptiles. The following are characteristics/fears of reptiles (lizards):
<strong>1. They are cold blooded</strong>
. This means that their body temperature changes according to the change in temperature on its environment. Because of the ectothermic metabolism of the lizards, they are forced to bask under the sun to raise its body temperature. A warm lizard is more active that a cold one.
<strong>2. Their skin is covered with scale or scutes</strong>
. Reptiles develop hard skin that is made of scale using protein keratin. Reptiles such as turtles and armored crocodile have scutes which form deeper layer under the skin. All lizards skin is covered with scale.
<strong>3. Most reptiles lay eggs.</strong>
Like most reptiles, lizards are oviparous  they lay eggs, which have hard shells. Their eggs are laid mainly on land. Lizards also take care of the eggs until they hatch. The eggs of amphibians (frogs) do not have hard shell. The eggs are enclosed in a jelly substance that offer protection  the female frog never take care of its eggs once laid in water.
<strong>4. They breathe by use of lungs</strong>
. Reptiles (lizards) breathe though the lungs in their entire life  even when in water. Contrary, amphibians such as frogs and toad breath through lungs, skin or gills (at young stage - tadpole).
<strong>5. They have four walking legs (apart from legless lizards)</strong>
. The reptiles (lizards) have four legs that are used for locomotion/walking. Amphibians such as frog, newt or toad have two hind legs for jumping and two front legs adapted for landing. Their legs cant walk as in the case of lizards.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-have-backbones">Do Lizards Have Backbones?</h2>
<p>Yes. Lizards have backbones since they are classified as vertebrates. The backbone is used to give support to body organs, muscles and cells. Moreover, the Backbone of lizards offers option for attachments of body muscles.</p>
<p>The backbone provides point link for appendicular skeleton such as ribs, femur, humerus, sternum or scapula as well as protect internal organs such as heart, lungs, livers and kidneys.</p>
<p>The hard bone spines and arches formed by the spinal column of lizards provide suitable defense tool against its enemies.</p>
<h2 id="major-facts-about-lizard-as-a-reptile">Major facts about Lizard as a reptile.</h2>
<p><strong>1. The Survival Mechanism</strong>
.</p>
<p>Lizards have adapted to living in the harshest conditions without getting extinct due to their feeding diversity. Lizards feeds on variety of food such as small insects, crustaceans, snakes, birds and ever lard animals such as baby turtles.</p>
<p>Lizards such as Komodo dragon and tree crocodile are known for predation culture. They even attack human beings for food.</p>
<p>Lizards are able to camouflage and escape any predator. For example, the chameleon lizards are able to change color randomly to march the background and use this mechanism to escape the predator.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">venomous lizards use the poison to paralyze</a>
their prey before swallowing them. The strong tail of predator lizards is used a weapon to grasp and knock down their prey or defend themselves in case of attack.</p>
<p>Lizards often escape in case they notice dangers to hideouts that make predators difficult to reach them e.g. under the roof, in the thorn bushes or holes/cracks.
<strong>2. The lizard Habitat.</strong>
Lizards are found everywhere in the world. They mostly live on the ground. Lizards do not make nests. You will spot some lizards in trees, marshy areas or riverbanks (Nile monitor and Asian Water monitor)</p>
<p>Though lizards are ectothermic (cold blooded), you will find them in cold region as well as in arid and semi-arid areas e.g. Savannah monitor.
Leopard geckos are crepuscular
.</p>
<p>Lizards such as marine iguanas dwell under the water though they often come to the shore to bask and lay eggs. Lizards, which dwell on trees, have short wide toes that are well adapted to climbing.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All Lizard species are vertebrates. They have backbone, also called the vertebral column/spinal column, whose main function is to protect the spinal cord and offer option for attachment of body muscles and appendicular skeleton.</p>
<p>The lizards spinal column is divided into cervical, dorsal, sacral and vertebrae apart from legless lizards whose backbone is divided into precaudal and caudal vertebrae.</p>

environment
.</p>
<h2 id="key-factors-to-consider">Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3 id="1-safety-">**1. Safety **</h3>
<p>Some products, like
<strong>Reptile Carpet such as�Zoo Med Eco Cage</strong>

.
But most of us wonder; which food or snacks should your avoid or give to beardies? Well,
bearded dragons eat a variety of foods
like fruits, vegetables or commercial foods.
<em>But can bearded dragons eat apple? Yes, bearded dragons will eat apples. However, for a healthy diet, peel the apple&rsquo;s skin and cut the fruit into small pieces.�</em>
<strong>Ensure the Caution - only feed apples like a treat because excessive apples will lead to runny stools.�</strong>
<strong>Apples are a source of nutrients including vitamin C, proteins, fiber and so on. Apples also contain a lot of water which helps in hydrating your beardies.�</strong>

<h2 id="bearded-dragons-and-the-apples"><strong>Bearded Dragons and the Apples��</strong></h2>
<p>Apples make a very good diet for bearded dragons like

. Apples are good for because of their high nutrition value. But peel the apple fruit first before feeding on the beardies.
Notably apples are a good source of vitamin C, protein, fiber, carbs and so on. Though bearded dragons require small amounts of vitamin C, its a vital component of their diet.
Improperly or unpeeled apples fed onto the bearded dragon could cause impaction. Also, give the apples as snacks - in small bits to avoid running stools. You can give bearded dragons water from some bowl.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ITWqNQyuU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ITWqNQyuU</a>
Deficiency in vitamin C can cause stomatitis, bleeding gums, bruising of skin. Bearded dragons or reptiles exhibiting such conditions are usually treated using vitamin C - known this to properly

.
Apples consist about 86% water. That gives you a perfect means of hydrating your bearded dragon. Notably these creatures drink little water and most of them dont even know how to drink water from a bowl. In fact, it takes time to train your beardie how to drink water. However, when you feed then with apples, you dont have to worry about dehydration.
Apples meant for bearded dragons need to be washed properly to remove chemicals used for pest control. Ingesting pesticides can make your beardie very sick or even result to death. In addition, apples should be peeled and sliced into very thin slices to make it easy for them to chew.

<h3 id="can-baby-bearded-dragons-eat-apples"><strong>Can Baby Bearded Dragons Eat Apples?</strong></h3>
<p>You can feed your baby bearded dragon on apples but not on a regular basis. The diet of baby bearded dragons should consist of 80% animal protein since they are still in their growing stage.
So, they should be fed more on insects such as roaches, worms, crickets and so on.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tqQijUN0Dw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tqQijUN0Dw</a>
Their plant protein diet should only be 20%. Therefore, baby bearded dragons should be fed with minimal amounts of apples. This applies to other fruits and vegetables.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-apple-skins">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Apple Skins?</h2>
<p>Well, bearded dragons will eat apples as part of their diet. However, don&rsquo;t feed the apple skins or peels to the bearded dragons as this may cause trigger runny stools.
Also, cut the apples into small bits after peeling their skins. Because bearded dragons won&rsquo;t chew properly, the small bites makes it easy to eat and equally delicious.
Bearded dragons won&rsquo;t easily eat the apple skins or peels. The pets are unable to properly digest the apples skins and thus you&rsquo;ll need to avoid feeding them on your beardies.

<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-drink-apple-juice"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Drink Apple Juice?</strong></h3>
<p>Apples are very enticing to bearded dragons. So, they wont resist the taste of apple juice. However, they should be given small amounts of apple juice because its sugary drink.
Too much sugar isnt good for a bearded dragons stomach. It causes loose stool thus leading to a lot of mess in their cage.�You can take advantage of the sweetness in apple juice to teach your bearded dragon how to drink water from a bowl.
Beardies are not used to drinking water from a pool when in the wild. They normally hydrate from their diet which mainly consists of plants and insects.
Adding apple juice to the beardies water bowl makes the water a little bit tasty. Your pet will get lured to the flavoured water and with time it will get used to using the water bowl even without the flavour.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-green-apples"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Green Apples?</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the apples appear red in color. But theres also a green apple going by the name Granny Smith Apple. Bearded dragons will eat all types of apples regardless of color.
Their differences in nutrition content are negligible, with the green apple having higher protein, iron and potassium content.
The only notable difference is their taste. Red apples are sweeter while green apples have a sour taste. Also, green apples have a slightly greater fiber content compared to the red apples.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-apple-peels"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Apple Peels?</strong></h3>
<p>Fruit peels including apple peels should not be given to bearded dragons for two reasons. First, bearded dragons have a delicate digestive system which cannot effectively digest apple peels. Chewing the peels also proves difficult for these tender creatures.
Another reason why you should not feed your beardie on apple peels is that the skin might contain chemicals sprayed on apples. Ingesting such chemicals can lead to illness or even death.

<h3 id="how-to-feed-bearded-dragon-with-apples"><strong>How to Feed Bearded Dragon with Apples</strong></h3>
<p>Some bearded dragons take some time to get accustomed to a new diet or environment. As a result you might notice that your beardie isnt eating apples.
But with some effort and trick you can easily get your
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">bearded dragon to start eating</a>
apples.�Follow these steps to prepare and teach your beardie to eat apples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash the apples to remove dirt and any chemicals used as pesticides.</li>
<li>Peel off the skin using a knife or vegetable peeler. Ensure you dont lose too much of the flesh. If this is too much work, you can get a mini peeler to help you peel apples in a short time.</li>
<li>Slice the apples into very thin pieces. Bearded dragons wont be able to chew large chunks of apples. For baby beardies, the pieces should be even smaller.</li>
<li>You can chop a sizeable amount of apples and store in the refrigerator for future use. But of course you should defrost the pieces before feeding. When feeding your beardie with apples from the freezer sprinkle some thiamin powder since freezing causes a reduction in thiamin.</li>
<li>Place the pieces in a shallow bowl so that your beardie can easily see whats inside.
If youre giving them apples for the first time, they might refuse to eat. In this case, you can teach them to eat apples through hand-feeding. You can touch the beardies mouth with a piece of apple so that it gets a taste of the sweetness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Apples are an ideal diet for bearded dragons in addition to other plants like vegetables. Other than being a source of vitamins and fibre, apples are less acidic which makes them good for beardies.
When feeding your beardie on apples, ensure that they are thoroughly cleaned, peeled and chopped into small pieces. Plus do not overfeed your pet on apples.
Therere plenty of other foods you can give to your beardie including insects and leafy vegetables. In particular, baby beardies should be given very small amounts of apples.</p>

      <description>Bananas (*musa spp)*</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hort.ufl.edu/trees/MUSSPPA.pdf">Bananas (<em>musa spp)</em></a>
are widely eaten at homes in cooked form or as snacks when ripe. It concerns many whether
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/">bearded dragons can feed</a>
on bananas, whether ripe or raw. May be you even wonders if banana peels, leaves or stems can be used to feed these lizards.
<em>So, can bearded dragon eat bananas? The direct answer is YES!� Bearded dragons will comfortably feed on bananas whether ripe or unripe. Bananas have rich vitamin composition (needed to boost immunity), high dietary fibers (specially unripe bananas  which prevents constipation), high potassium content (needed to regulate blood pressure and kidney stones).�</em>
<em>Bananas have strong antioxidants (dopamine, catechins  reduces heart diseases), low salt and sugar content (especially unripe bananas- which reduces diabetes and teeth decay), low water level (that reduce over hydration) as well as rich mineral components such as folate, iron, niacin, riboflavin, magnesium, manganese &amp; calcium, which improves growth and development of bones, tissues and organs.�</em>

<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas-7-secrets">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?? 7 Secrets</h2>
<p><strong>Yes, but</strong>
bananas shouldnt be fed as the main meal since they contain low calcium: phosphorous ratio (leads to metabolic bone disease). These are the key considerations in
<a href="https://www.texvetpets.org/article/bearded-dragons-cold-blooded-companions/">caring for beaded dragons</a>
.
They have relatively high sugar level (some ripe bananas � causing diabetes) as well as low glycemic index (controls carbs uptake into the bloodstream). Controlled and supplemented banana feeding is therefore required.</p>
<h3 id="1-rich-vitamin-composition">1. Rich Vitamin Composition</h3>
<p>Bananas are rich in vitamin A (10.67mg - which is necessary for normal vision, boosts reproduction and immune system), vitamin B1 (that helps in breakdown of carbohydrates to give energy on your beardie as well as boost nerve signals).
Bananas also have vitamin B6 (0.4mg-needed for creation of red blood cells and metabolism of protein &amp; fat) and vitamin C (8.4mg-necessary for growth &amp; development as well as repair of all worn out body tissues).
Ripe bananas have more vitamins than starch as compared to unripe ones, especially Williams and apple banana species. Related -

<h3 id="2-high-dietary-fibers">2. High Dietary fibers</h3>
<p>Bananas have a high dietary fiber-mainly pectin (thats water-soluble) which is needed to prevent constipation. For every 100g of banana meal, there is 3.1g of both soluble and insoluble fibers that helps lower cardiovascular disease CVD and coronary heart disease CHD.
Notably, unripe bananas have high fibers than ripe ones and at times are difficult for your beardie to digest. It is required that you feed your beardie with bananas that are just about to ripen so that you may acquire maximum nutrients from either side (ripe and unripe).
Though edible, green bananas should, least be used as meal for your beardie as it draws a lot of water during digestion thus leading to constipation on excess feeding.</p>
<h3 id="3-high-potassium-content">3. High Potassium Content</h3>
<p>For every 100g of banana fruits, there is 422mg to 453mg of potassium mineral on average. This quantity is quite high as compared to other fruits such as grapes, mangoes or apricots.
Potassium mainly regulates fluid balance, nerve signals and enables smooth muscle contraction of your beardie. NB: Ripe bananas have more potassium content that unripe ones.
In addition, high potassium in bananas will help reduce water retention in the body and lower blood pressure of your beardie. Importantly, potassium will protect your beardie against kidney stones and osteoporosis/stroke.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFL6Bmecvxs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFL6Bmecvxs</a></p>
<h3 id="4-strong-antioxidant">4. Strong Antioxidant</h3>
<p>Bananas (especially Cavendish species) are considered to have high antioxidants such as dopamine, cetachins and gallocatechins. Gallocatechins will help reduce cholesterol (that cause clogging of inner lumen of blood vessels) accumulation in your beardie by breaking any cholesterol traces.
On the other hand, dopamine will enhance oxidation of low-density lipoproteins and reduce plasma oxidative stress.
Importantly, the Trans-� carotene and cetachins found in bananas will further help reduce heart diseases and generative illness that may attack your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="5-low-salt-and-sugar-content">5. Low Salt and Sugar content</h3>
<p>Apple bananas, cooking banana and Williamss banana species have low salts and sugar levels, especially when raw. There is actually 4.5mg to 12mg sugar for every 145g of banana fruits.
Starch in unripe bananas inhibits salts and sugar concentration - just like with
Cucumbers
. However, as these bananas ripen, the sugar and salt levels increases.
Excess sugar in some ripe banana species such as red bananas will cause insulin resistance that lead to diabetes mellitus/insipidus in your beardie or cause obesity. In addition, sugar accumulation on their teeth will cause teeth decay.
Low salt in the blood is needed for healthy beardies life since excess salt will cause water retention and high blood pressure, which may lead to stroke or heart attack.</p>
<h3 id="6-low-water-level">6. Low Water Level</h3>
<p>As compared to other fruits such as mangoes, pawpaw, grapes or berries, bananas have far low water content. On average, bananas contain 34.5% to 59.2% water, which is mixed with solid carbs and calories content.
Unripe bananas (especially plantains and red species) have a higher water content that reduces as the banana ripens. Read too -
Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cantaloupe?
.
Low water content in necessary to reduce over hydration on your beardie. Excess water causes runny/watery poo, drooling, kidney failure as well as osmotic imbalance in your bearded dragon.
The water content in bananas, unlike in other fruits, is store in combined form thus will only be used after the food is completely digested.</p>
<h3 id="7-rich-mineral-content">7. Rich Mineral Content</h3>
<p>Bananas are rich in minerals such as Iron (which prevents anemia), Calcium (5mg  for strengthening of bones and teeth), Magnesium (27mg), Zinc (0.2mg), Sodium (1mg) and Manganese (0.3 mg) for every 100g of bananas.
These minerals will help boost growth and development of body tissues of your beardie as well as boost its immunity.</p>
<h3 id="8-no-cholesterol-and-improves-insulin-sensitivity">8. No cholesterol and improves insulin sensitivity</h3>
<p>Most banana species such as Cavendish and Williams are cholesterol free. This means that your beardie wont suffer from cholesterol associated disease such as heart failure or arteries clogging/thrombosis, which lead to death of many bearded dragons.
In addition, ripe bananas improves insulin sensitivity making it quick acting and thus reducing chances of diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure on your beardie.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragon-eat-bananas-peels-stems-and-leaves"><strong>Can Bearded Dragon Eat Bananas Peels, Stems and Leaves?</strong></h2>
<p>Most beardie species will eat banana peels and leaves but not banana stems. Actually, banana peels contain vitamin B6 (which protect Type 2 diabetes, weight loss), vitamin B12, polyphenol and carotenoids, which boost health immunity of your beardie.
Normally, feed your beardie with fresh peels of ripe bananas. Unripe banana peels are highly rejected by most beardie species.
Banana peels are not beardies favorite, therefore, your will need to mix chopped pieces with other fruits like grapes, guavas or main meals.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-bananas-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to prepare Bananas for your bearded dragon.</h2>
<p>Follow the following procedure when preparing bananas for your bearded dragon.</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest bananas while unripe and separate them from stalk.</li>
<li>Allow them to drip water for two to three days if you intend to feed your beardie when they are still raw.</li>
<li>You can keep them for one or two weeks (until they near ripening) in open air without adding any substance that may quicken ripening process - this will help maintain high nutrients content available.</li>
<li>Clean them with warm or treated water before peeling to remove any chemical or poisonous insects such as fireflies that may be on the skin.</li>
<li>Peel the bananas and chop them into small pieces that are not larger than the space between the beardies eyes.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can chop the bananas without peeling after cleaning  however, some beardie species wont eat bananas with peels.</li>
<li>Mix chopped bananas with other fruits such as guavas, kiwi, apricots as well as vegetables like
cabbages
and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-broccoli/">broccoli</a>
in a ratio of 1:3.</li>
<li>You should supplement banana feeds with main diet always. Feed 250g to 600g of bananas per given meal.
<em><strong>NB</strong></em>
: Its necessary to feed you beardie with bananas nearing to ripen than feeding them with immediate or over ripen bananas.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-often-should-you-feed-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How Often Should You Feed Your Bearded Dragon?�</strong></h2>
<p>Bananas should be used as occasional meal due some problems (mentioned in this article) that may arise when used as main diet for your bearded dragon. Feed your beardie once or twice per month with banana salad.
Avoid excess use of green bananas combination when preparing the meal since they have very low glycemic index that lowers the carbs uptake rate.
Baby beardie shouldnt be fed using immediate harvested unripe bananas or fully ripe bananas as this may affects its digestive track or make it docile.
Occasional feeding is also attributed by low calcium: phosphorous (0.3:1). High phosphorous quantity in bananas as compared to calcium affects the calcium (necessary for bones and teeth strengthening) uptake leading to a calcium deficiency disease called metabolic bone disease.
NB: It is importance to improve calcium levels using power calcium supplement regularly.</p>
<h2 id="which-types-of-bananas-should-you-avoid-feeding-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>Which Types Of Bananas Should You Avoid Feeding Your Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-bananas-with-too-much-starch"><strong>1. Bananas with too much starch</strong></h3>
<p>Excess starch (especially found in unripe bananas) is hard to be digested by many beardie species. In addition, starch draws a lot of water during digestion leading to constipation if continuous banana feeding is undertaken.
You will need to use bananas with less starch level like apple bananas or allow them to ripen to lower the starch levels before feeding your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="2-banana-with-excess-phosphorous-content"><strong>2. Banana with excess phosphorous content</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, banana have higher phosphorous content as compared to other fruits like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">mangoes</a>
and
tomatoes
.
However, you should always select a banana species that has the lowest phosphorous content as it inhibits calcium uptake into the blood leading to calcium deficiency.</p>
<h3 id="3-green-bananas"><strong>3. Green bananas</strong></h3>
<p>Most green bananas/plantains species have high starch content (when raw) and low glycemic index, which affects the digestion of most beardie species. In addition, plantains have higher phosphorous content that is undesirable for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="4-bananas-with-too-much-sugar-content"><strong>4. Bananas with too much sugar content</strong></h3>
<p>Excess sugar will cause high blood pressure, heart attack/stroke as well as kidney fatigue on your beardies if not controlled. In addition, sugar from bananas clogs on the teeth leading to teeth decay.
Avoid regular feed of such bananas as red bananas in order to curb associated sugar problems</p>
<h3 id="5-bananas-with-low-glycemic-index"><strong>5. Bananas with low glycemic index</strong></h3>
<p>Glycemic index determines how fast carbs in food enters bloodstreams. A lower index is associated with high loss of carbs from the meals due to low absorption into the blood stream.
Actually, low glycemic index in bananas results from high starch and fiber structure (especially immediate harvested unripe bananas).
You will have to select banana species such as Williams that has higher glycemic index for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="6-bananas-with-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio"><strong>6. Bananas with low calcium: phosphorous ratio</strong></h3>
<p>Most banana species have low calcium: phosphorous ratio thus occasional feeding is recommended. However, some banana species have higher ratio than others do. Therefore, you are required to select those bananas that have higher calcium: phosphorous ratio in order to reduce occurrence of metabolic bone disease that may occur.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So,�can bearded dragons eat bananas?
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">Bearded dragons will not only eat</a>
bananas, but will also feed on their peels and leaves. However, bananas should not be used as main diet. Occasionally, feed your beardie with 250g to 600g of banana salad that is supplemented with other main meal.
Avoid banana species that have high sugar level, low glycemic index as well as low calcium: phosphorous ratio. Importantly, always engage qualified veterinary to provide medical checkups after every 3 months in case you often feed your beardie with bananas.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can bearded dragons eat broccoli? Vegetables are part of the
recommended diet
for bearded dragons.�Broccoli is a source of essential minerals and vitamins. However, not all vegetables are
good for your bearded <a href="https://cvm.ncsu.edu/documents/caring-for-your-bearded-dragon/">dragon</a>
.
<em>So, can bearded dragons eat broccoli? A simple answer is YES. A little broccoli wont do harm to your beardie. However, you should only feed your beardie with small amounts of broccoli once in a while. Thats because broccoli contains high contents of oxalic acid which may cause kidney failure in reptiles.�</em>
<em>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</em></p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-broccoli"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Broccoli?</strong></h2>
<p>Broccoli provides a good source of calcium, protein, fibre and vitamins such as vitamin A, B1, C, E and K. But they also contain high levels of oxalic acid which makes it unsuitable for reptiles including bearded dragons.</p>
<p>Although
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango/">bearded dragons can eat</a>
broccoli, they should be given very little of it. The high levels of oxalic acid in broccoli isnt good for their kidney and bone health. Taking too much oxalic acid reduces the amount of calcium in their body. Oxalic acid reacts with calcium in the body of the reptile which leads to an imbalance in the calcium: phosphorous ratio.</p>
<p>As a result, the body of the reptile utilizes the calcium from the bones which leads to bone degeneration. Inappropriate combination of calcium also affects the functioning of the kidney. It leads to bladder stones which in turn affect the kidney due fluid retention.</p>

<h2 id="broccoli-cap-ratio-how-it-affects-bearded-dragons"><strong>Broccoli Ca:P Ratio: How it Affects Bearded Dragons</strong></h2>
<p>The ratio of calcium to phosphorous in a bearded dragons diet is of great importance. The ideal Ca:P ratio for bearded dragons and other reptiles is 2:1. That means for every unit of phosphorous there must be two units of calcium.</p>
<p>Ca:P ratio determines how effectively calcium is absorbed in the reptiles body. Higher levels of phosphorous inhibits calcium absorption in their body which in turn causes Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD).</p>
<p>Equal parts of calcium and phosphorous result in a reaction which forms calcium phosphate. Since this is an insoluble salt, it wont be absorbed in your beardies intestine. Also, excess calcium in the beardies body inhibits the absorption of phosphorous which helps in bone health and PH balance.</p>
<p>The 0.7:1 calcium to phosphorous ratio in broccoli isnt good for your bearded dragon. Therefore broccoli should be given occasionally and in small quantities. A good balance of calcium and phosphorous can be achieved by mixing broccoli with a range of greens or vegetables. Alternatively, you add supplements to achieve the 2:1 ratio.</p>
<h2 id="broccoli-for-bearded-dragon-what-you-need-to-know"><strong>Broccoli for Bearded Dragon: What you need to know</strong></h2>
<p>As earlier said, you can give your bearded dragon small amounts of broccoli without any worries. If you resolve to give broccoli to your bearded dragon, remember these tips.</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat your bearded dragon with small amounts of broccoli.</li>
<li>Broccoli should be given only occasionally as a means of adding variety to their vegetable diet.</li>
<li>Serve only raw broccoli.</li>
<li>Broccoli should be cut into very small pieces to allow easy chewing and prevent choking.</li>
<li>Give only the floret because its softer for the beardie to chew and digest. Avoid the leaves and stalk.</li>
<li>Do not give broccoli to baby beardie. Not only do they need less vegetable diet but its also hard for them to digest.</li>
<li>In case your bearded develops complications after eating broccoli stop the feeding immediately. If possible consult your veterinarian.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cabbages, whether red, green, or variegated, are vegetables that are often eaten together with course meals across the world.
Previously we checked
what <a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/">bearded dragons eat</a>
. It may even concern you if these lizards can eat all cabbage species or not.
<em>So, can bearded dragons eat cabbages? The simple answer is YES! The bearded dragon will feed on all varieties of cabbages without any problems. Actually, cabbages have rich vitamin composition (needed to boost beardies immune system), and high calcium: phosphorous ratio (that prevents metabolic bone disease).�</em>
<em>Cabbages have high dietary fiber (which prevents constipation), large mineral contents (needed for growth and development of tissues), contain powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory, low-fat content (thus preventing obesity) as well as relatively low sugar level that help reduce cases of diabetes and high blood pressure on your bearded dragon.�</em>

<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-cabbage">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cabbage?</h2>
<p>But it is necessary to keep close monitoring of the sugar and
water levels of your beardie
as excess intake may result from unregulated cabbage feeding. Read also;
Can Bearded Dragons Eat Tomatoes?</p>
<h3 id="1-high-calcium-phosphorous-ratio">1. High calcium: phosphorous ratio</h3>
<p>Cabbages have proven to be one of the best vegetables with very high calcium: the phosphorous ratio of 2:1 or 2.4:1.
This ideally means that your bearded dragon will enjoy high uptake of calcium (necessary for the strengthening of bones) into the bloodstream without phosphorous inhibition.
Actually, phosphorous is a dangerous cofactor that inhibits calcium absorption in the blood if it occurs in high quantities in any animal feed.
Problems that result from excess phosphorous (such as metabolic bone disease  calcium deficiency disease) will be reduced far or get eliminated by feeding your beardie with cabbages.
Green cabbages like Savoy and Nana cabbage species show high calcium: phosphorous ratio as compared to red and variegated cabbage species. Read also -
Can Bearded Dragons Eat Mango?
Storing harvested cabbage for 2 to 5 days before feeding your beardie will improve the calcium uptake level and reduce phosphorous activeness. This is important.</p>
<h3 id="2-rich-vitamin-composition">2. Rich Vitamin Composition</h3>
<p>Vitamin K, which regulates clotting of blood in case of injuries and building/replacing worn-out tissues, is found in very large quantities in cabbages (especially Savoy species). For every 100g of cabbage, there is 54% to 83% of RDI of Vitamin K -
from eggs
.
As compared to other vegetables like kales and corianders, cabbages show 64.6mcg extra of vitamin K. Cabbages also have vitamin D and B12, but in low quantities as compared to other vitamins.
Also, cabbages Vitamin C (51.5mg of RDI- needed for the proper functioning of the bones, blood vessels, and smooth skin /muscle flexibility), Vitamin B1 (0.11mg - which boost nerve signals and accelerates carbohydrates breakdown to give energy for your beardie), Vitamin B6 (required for fat/protein metabolism and red blood cell creation) as well as vitamin A that boosts the beardies vision during the night.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeihdUU3phg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeihdUU3phg</a></p>
<h3 id="3-high-dietary-fiber-25g">3. High dietary fiber 2.5g</h3>
<p>For every 100g of fresh cabbage, there is 2.5g to 3.21g of fibers. Green cabbages have more fibers than variegated and red cabbage species.
Fibers will keep a healthy digestion/alimentary canal by fueling regular and smooth bowel movement. It is the insoluble fibers found in cabbages that add bulk to the stool network, bind it well thus preventing your beardie from constipation (difficulties in releasing bowels).
Cabbages also have 1.2g to 1.5g of soluble fibers, which add to the main meal during digestion  these cruciferous fibers decrease the cholesterol level and help break down low-density lipoproteins that may lead to a heart attack or high blood pressure.
Feed your beardie with cabbages that are 3days after harvesting to a period just before the outer leaves begins to turn yellow so as to acquire maximum fiber content  fibers lose action ability when the cabbage turns yellow.</p>
<h3 id="4-large-mineral-contents">4. Large mineral contents</h3>
<p>Cabbages have high mineral components such as potassium (367mg per 100g of cabbage) that is needed to regulated nerve signals, ensure smooth contraction of muscles, maintain optimal osmotic balance as well as prevent kidney stones and lower blood pressure.
In addition, cabbage has other minerals like magnesium (12mg), iron (0.47mg), zinc (0.18), manganese (0.19mg), and sodium (0.78mg) that help in the growth and repair of beardies tissues as well as boost its immune system.</p>
<h3 id="5-low-fat-content">5. Low fat content</h3>
<p>Cabbage generally have low fat content of about 0.2g for every 100g of cabbage. This quantity is very low as compared to over vegetables like lettuce or broccoli.
Fat is quite dangerous for beardie as excess of it accumulates at the tail and berry lining making it inactive or docile. Read Also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?</a>
In addition, excess fat will cause your beardie to generate high blood pressure and heart failure or stroke if not attended to accordingly.
In comparison, red cabbage species have lower fat content than variegated and green cabbage species. You can therefore supplement the main meal with savoy or red cabbage species if you want to lower the fat intake of your bearded dragon.</p>
<h3 id="6-relatively-low-sugar-and-starch-level">6. Relatively low sugar and starch level</h3>
<p>Fresh Cabbage has a lower sugar content of about 2.3g to 3.4g for every 150g of cabbage. This sugar level is relatively low and will not have effect your pet beardie if proper feeding routine is followed as advised in this article (below).
High sugar level will lead to high blood pressure, heart attack as well as kidney failure. Further, excess sugar may cause diabetes.
Cabbage has low starch content (7.3%). Excess starch (in combined form) in a meal will be difficult for most beardie species to digest.
Actually, starch draws a lot of water from intestine for digestion process and needs high energy thus may cause constipation.
Low starch as compared to other nutrients (all combined) is needed to help ease the digestion process of your beardie.
NB: Yellow cabbages (about to dry) are more sugary and should be avoided as beardies meal.</p>
<h3 id="7-high-energy-generation">7. High energy generation</h3>
<p>When broken down through digestion, cabbages will give out 103 kJ to 113kJ or 25cal of energy for every 100g of cabbages.
The value is quite high as compared to other vegetables such as kales, green beans, or corianders.
Enough energy is needed for beardies daily activities such as moving about, feeding as well as keeping it warm (homeostatic function)</p>
<h3 id="8-powerful-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatory-compounds">8. Powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds</h3>
<p>Cabbages have powerful antioxidants such as polyphenols that will prevent your beard from damages caused by free radicals (molecules with odd electrons that damage body cells) on body tissues.
The anti-inflammatory compound (kaempferol and sulforaphane) found in cabbage will
protect your bearded dragon
from diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease as well as heart disease.
Importantly, these compounds will also reduce any chronic and acute inflammatory diseases. Read also;

<h2 id="how-to-prepare-cabbages-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to Prepare Cabbages for Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Follow the procedure below when preparing cabbages for your bearded dragon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest mature cabbages (avoid immature cabbages as they have low calcium levels and nutrients arent fully stocked) and remove the base stalk  this prevents draining of nutrients from the cabbage.</li>
<li>Store the cabbage for 3 to 6 days before feeding your beardie  this will improve calcium uptake,
drain excess water
and reduce phosphorous activeness.</li>
<li>Remove the outer foliage leaves (may have infections) and clean the cabbage with warm water or treated water to remove any poisonous insects (fireflies) or chemicals that may be in contact.</li>
<li>Split the cabbage (into 3 or 4 pieces) and remove the mid-rib/talk  this is hard for beardie to digest.</li>
<li>Chop the cabbage in to small sizes (size not larger than the space between beardies eyes). Always check (when chopping) any possibilities of insects or worms that could have hid between leaf blades.</li>
<li>Mix the cabbages with fruits like grapes, mangoes, or bananas to improve the taste (normally, cabbages are not beardies favorite meals).</li>
<li>Feed your beardie with 250g to 650g of cabbages once or twice per week. You can supplement cabbage salad with other main meals like mealworms or silkworms.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cabbage-species-you-shouldnt-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Cabbage Species You Shouldnt Feed Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<h3 id="1-cabbages-with-very-low-glycemic-index"><strong>1. Cabbages with very low glycemic index</strong></h3>
<p>Glycemic index determines how carbs are absorbed into beardies bloodstream.
Most cabbage species such as nana cabbage and red cabbage have a relatively low glycemic index that affects starch breakdown.
This is attributed to the presence of certain cofactors that prevent starch conversion/digestion.
Select cabbage species that have a higher glycemic index e.g. savoy so as to eliminate digestion problems that results from undigested starch</p>
<h3 id="2-cabbages-with-high-water-content-">**2. Cabbages with high water content **</h3>
<p>Freshly harvested cabbages have a high water content of 60% to 85% (116g out of 150g) in relation to dry matters. As said earlier, cabbages should be stored for 3 to 6 days to drain excess water.
Avoid
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-should-i-feed-my-bearded-dragon/">feeding your bearded dragon</a>
with variety of cabbages that have high water content e.g. nana cabbage, before draining period.
Excess water that accumulates in the beardie due to continuous cabbage feeding will make your pet docile, have low blood pressure, or experience diarrhea and runny poo.
Moreover, overhydration that results from excess water will lead to osmotic imbalance thus causing homeostatic problems in your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="3-cabbages-with-high-sugar-level"><strong>3. Cabbages with high sugar level</strong></h3>
<p>Many varieties of cabbages have relatively low sugar content (2.3g to 3.4g for every 150g of cabbage). However, sugar level increases as the cabbage overstay after harvesting (as it tends to turn yellow).
On the other hand, species like red cabbages and variegated cabbages have higher sugar content if they overstay on the farm or in store thus should be used within the first 10 days after harvesting.
High sugar level (as stated in this article) cause high blood pressure, kidney fatigue as well as heart problems.
You will need to select low sugar cabbage for your beardies health safety and avoid cabbages that have overstayed in stores (15- 24 days).</p>
<h2 id="which-parts-of-cabbages-dont-you-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Which Parts of Cabbages Dont You Feed Your bearded dragon</h2>
<p>It is required of you to remove the following parts of the cabbages before feeding your beardie:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-middle-stalkmidrib"><strong>1. The middle stalk/midrib</strong></h3>
<p>This is the hardest part of the cabbage that is found at the center and prolongs outside to form the taproot network.
Though nutritious, your beardie wont be in a position to digest it easily (hard).
In addition, the section has tough starch composition that impairs the digestion process.�Actually, the stalk may get stuck in the alimentary canal causing impaction or chock your beardie to death.</p>
<h3 id="2-foliage-leavesfirst-leaves"><strong>2. Foliage leaves/first leaves</strong></h3>
<p>First/foliage leaves of cabbages should be removed as they contain many chemicals (acquired at the initial stage  if cabbage is not organically grown) that may impair/affect your beardies digestive system.
Moreover, these leaves stores excess oxalate (impairs digestion) needed for cabbage build up at the earlier stage of growth and development.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragons will feed on all species of cabbages to acquire vitamins, minerals, and enough energy needed for growth and development. Moreover, cabbages have a dense fiber network that will add bulk to beardies stool thus preventing constipation.
High calcium: phosphorous ratio should be one of the reasons for selecting cabbages as a regular diet for your bearded dragon.
Remember to involve a qualified veterinarian often to check your beardies health, if you consider cabbages as a diet since they contain average sugar and water level that may arise if not monitored.</p>

Cantaloupes are over sugary (causing teeth decay), very acidic (cause indigestion problems). Also, cantaloupe have excess water content (which cause runny poo), Low calcium: phosphorous ratio as well as low quantities of minerals.</strong>
*Though most Bearded Dragon owners tend to feed their pet beardies with cantaloupe, this act may endanger the animals health at long run. *
<em>Some vet recommends occasional feeding of bearded dragon with little bit of cantaloupe, but I suggest you avoid them completely due to the above named problems.�</em></p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-cantaloupe-7-tips">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cantaloupe? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>Cantaloupe, also known as sweet melon, muskmelon, honeydew, rock melon or persian melon in different regions of the world, is a common fruit mainly eaten as a snack or dessert by people.
Could be you grow cantaloupe in your farm or have come across some in the groceries and wonders whether your Bearded Dragon can eat these fruits.</p>
<h3 id="1-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio">1. Low Calcium: Phosphorous Ratio</h3>
<p>The biggest danger of feeding your bearded dragon with cantaloupe is the low calcium: phosphorous ratio. Currently, a well-cultivated cantaloupe has a calcium: phosphorous ratio of 0.6:1. Actually, the ideal or recommended calcium: phosphorous ratio should be 1:1, 2:1 or more.
Why is the ratio crucial for your pets health? Well, its important to know that presence of high level of phosphorous as compared to calcium inhibits calcium uptake at the alimentary canal into blood stream.
This happens due to high affinity of phosphorous absorption. In addition, if phosphorous concentration is high, it will suppress calcium ions from any intake process.
This will lead to calcium deficiency in your bearded dragon. Since calcium is required for bone strengthening and making, your pet lizard will end up suffering a very dangerous/deadly disease called metabolic bone disease.
To avoid this occurrence, it is recommend that you feed your beardie with fruits that have high calcium: phosphorous ratio.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gIL6J6Sqv4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gIL6J6Sqv4</a></p>
<h3 id="2-excess-water-content">2. Excess Water Content</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe has a very high water content of about 90%. Though water is necessary for your pet beardie hydration, excess of it will lead to over hydration.
The alimentary canal of an over hydrated beardie has a mucus lining that prevents absorption of nutrients and accelerates flow of food before digestion occurs.
The lizard will also suffer frequent diarrhea and watery/runny poo that messes the cage often. The animals kidneys get fatigued easily or overworked by the ultrafiltration and may fail at long run (kidney failure).
The excess water content in cantaloupe also makes your bearded dragon inactive/docile if not taken care of. You need to monitor the water level of your pet beardie (through use of qualified vet) to ensure its not over hydrated or dehydrated.
Moreover, youll need to note that dehydration of your beardie will lead to dizziness, low blood pressure, dry mouth &amp; dry skin as well as indigestion problems like constipation.
It is therefore recommended that apart from avoiding cantaloupe for your beardies, also limit fruits that contain high water content in their meals.</p>
<h3 id="3-high-acidic-level">3. High Acidic Level</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe have a pH between 4.5 to 6.9. This alone tells us that excess feeding of these fruits will lead to acid accumulation in your beardies digestive track.
High acid levels will cause burning sensation or irritation along the gullet  the beardie will tend to move around abnormally or scratch its throat/neck region against objects in the cage.
Also, acidity will cause stomach upset to your bearded dragon. The lizard looks uncomfortable, fatigued and at times may even vomit feeds.
High acid levels affect normal digestion in the stomach and intestines of beardies by denaturing the enzymes, which controls the
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-cucumbers/">digestion process</a>
.
At time, a beardie suffering from acidity problems will excrete dry undigested waste material that may even have mucus or blood stains.</p>
<h3 id="4-low-vitamins-and-mineral-content">4. Low vitamins and mineral Content</h3>
<p>As compared to other fruits such as grapes, berries, apple or apricot; cantaloupe has lower mineral content.
There is 0.21 mg iron, 0.18mg zinc and 0.14mg manganese for every 100g of cantaloupe Oz. This is an indication that you will need to overfeed your beardie with extra cantaloupe to acquire the right quantity needed by the body for normal functioning  this contradicts the recommendation that you should avoid cantaloupe.
Vitamins such as vitamin D, E and K that are very crucial for your bearded dragon are unavailable too and those that are present such as vitamin A, B1 and C are in low quantities.
This, therefore, is an indication that cantaloupe will not provide enough vitamins and mineral if used as a daily meal for your bearded dragon.</p>
<h3 id="5-very-sugary">5. Very Sugary</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe has 7.86g of sugar for every 100g of the fruit oz. This this level is quite high for bearded dragon
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">nutrition</a>
requirements.
In the ideal situation, an adult beardie should take 0.5g to 2g (max) sugar contentment for every 100g Oz of a given meal while juvenile beardies should be fed with meals that have 0.4g to 1.2g sugar content.
Ideally, the sugar content in this fruit is already far beyond the needed amount in your lizards body/physiological processes.�Excess sugar that is absorbed in the blood may cause high blood pressure or diabetes that may lead to death easily.
Sugar, also accumulates on the teeth and between teeth gaps leading to teeth decay or dental carries. Normally, its not possible to brush the teeth of your beardies as a form of healthcare.
However, you should monitor their sugar deposit level by ensuring that you feed less sugary meals and by also providing vegetable meals that have high fiber content, which brush the teeth in the process of feeding.
Actually, its very necessary to engage a qualified vet often for teeth inspection of your beardie.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-cantaloupe-for-occasional-feeds">How to prepare cantaloupe for occasional feeds?</h2>
<p>Though it is not advisable to feed your bearded dragon with cantaloupe, some beardie owners still feed their pets with these fruits.
To meet proper health standard of your bearded dragon, you will need right preparation and control feeding program. To achieve this, follow the procedure below while feeding your beardie:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all the vines and foliage when harvesting your cantaloupe and leave it for a week to reduce fresh water content.</li>
<li>Wash the cantaloupe thoroughly with warm/disinfected water (if possible)  this will help remove and kill any insect or bacteria on the fruit skin.</li>
<li>Peel the entire fruit to remove the green out skin  this part is usually more acidic and has high phosphorous content that lead to calcium: phosphorous imbalance condition.</li>
<li>Slice/chop the peeled cantaloupe into small sizes  the chopped sizes should not be larger the space between your beardies eyes to allow easier swallowing and reduces chocking that may happen.</li>
<li>Leave the chopped cantaloupe in air or warm environment to drip excess water before feeding.</li>
<li>Feed your adult beardie with 100g to 500g of chopped cantaloupe per month in order to control side effects associated with it.
Some veterinaries have recommended occasional use of cantaloupe, which in my case I suggest that there should be close monitoring of your beardies in order to curb any complications that may arise.
Occasional feeding of bearded dragon with cantaloupe (once per month) may not show any harmful effects on their health at all, especially when the feeding is supplemented with other daily meals.
However, if there is a laxity in sugar monitoring, calcium: phosphorous ratio control as well as water regulation, then, your bearded dragon will suffer some of sicknesses highlighted in this article at the beginning.
<strong>NB</strong>
: It is highly advisable to mixed cantaloupe with other fruits/vegetables such as berries, apple, cabbages, green beans/peas etc. at a ratio of 1:3 to supplement it and enhance its digestion process without complications.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cantaloupe, just like avocado and orange, shouldnt be used as a main meal for your bearded dragon. The fruit is very acidic and has high water content that may lead to kidney failure, diarrhea or watery/runny poo.
Moreover, cantaloupe has low calcium: phosphorous ratio, which inhibits uptake of calcium necessary for bone strengthening thus leading to metabolic bone disease.
The high sugar content found in cantaloupe will cause teeth decay if not monitored at long run. It is therefore advisable to avoid use of cantaloupe as main diet for your pet bearded dragon.</p>

<a href="http://avianexotichospital.com/bearded-%5Bdragon%5D(/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/).html">bearded dragons</a>
eat carrots? You know that bearded dragons love eating a variety of vegetables. Vegetables are a good source of minerals, vitamins, and water. So, we recently analyzed this -
what do bearded dragons eat?
But, can bearded dragons eat carrots?
<strong>Short answer is YES  Bearded dragons love eating carrots. Carrots are rich in Beta-carotene and vitamin A which are essential requirements in a bearded dragons diet. However, carrots should be avoided if the bearded dragon is presently on vitamin A supplements.�</strong>
Thats because feeding the bearded dragon on carrots while it is receiving vitamin A supplements might lead excess vitamin A. This condition is known as vitamin A toxicity or hypervitaminosis A.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrots"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Carrots?</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons will generously eat carrots! With carrots, you have a good chance of enriching your pets diet with valuable nutrients.
Carrots contain numerous nutrients which contribute to the overall health of your bearded dragon. Here is the breakdown.</p>
<h3 id="1-contains-vitamin-a">**1. **<strong>Contains Vitamin A</strong></h3>
<p>Vitamin A is an essential requirement in a bearded dragons diet. Bearded dragons get vitamin A either from plants such as carrots or it can be administered as vitamin A supplements. Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-cabbage/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cabbage?</a>
Giving vitamin A to your bearded dragon comes with three benefits. The main importance of vitamin A in a beardies body is vision. Just like in humans, carrots help in maintaining eye health since they contain a lot of vitamin A. A deficiency in vitamin A can adversely affect the beardies eye sight.
Thats why swollen eyes are the first symptoms of vitamin A deficiency in a bearded dragon.�Vitamin A also plays an important role in bone development, skin health, protein synthesis and reproductive health.
While vitamin A proves good for your bearded dragon, it can reach toxic levels if given in excess. If youre feeding your beardie on carrots, its extremely hard for the calcium to reach toxic levels.
However, if you feed your beardie with carrots and vitamin A supplements at the same time, theyre very likely to suffer vitamin A toxicity (hypervitaminosis A). Therefore, its advisable not to feed your bearded dragon with carrots at a time when they are on vitamin A supplements.</p>
<h3 id="2-contains-beta-carotene">**2. **<strong>Contains Beta-Carotene</strong></h3>
<p>Carrots also contain beta-carotene which acts as means of regulating the amount of vitamin A consumed by your bearded dragon. Excess beta-carotene wont have any harmful effects on your bearded dragon as long as it comes from plants including carrots. The only effect is the tendency of their skin to turn yellow.
However, if excess beta-carotene is administered in form of supplements, it is likely lead to hypovitaminosis A (vitamin A deficiency). In excess, the beta-carotene from supplements tends to destroy vitamin A thus leading to its deficiency.
In summary, beta-carotene from carrots will do no harm to your bearded dragon. But it becomes dangerous when you give carrots and supplements that contain excess beta-carotene.</p>
<h3 id="3-fiber">**3. **<strong>Fiber</strong></h3>
<p>The fiber content in carrots plays a big role in digestion. Without fiber, the outer shell from the insects that you give to your bearded dragon could prove very difficult to digest. Inefficient digestion causes constipation which in turn may make your pet beardie sick. Severe constipation can even lead to death.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrot-leavestops"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Carrot Leaves/Tops?</strong></h2>
<p>You might already be feeding your bearded dragon on greens such as kale, cucumber, celery leaves, Swiss chard and so on. But are carrot leaves also good for them? Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Bananas?</a>
Well, bearded dragons cant resist the luring scent from the carrot tops. However, these greens will do more harm than good to your pet beardie. They contain high levels of oxalates which are harmful to bearded dragons and other reptiles when consumed in excess.
Oxalates are associated with calcium binding in the body. With little calcium in the body, a lot of oxalates reach the kidneys which may eventually lead to kidney stones.
Therefore, although your beardie can eat carrot tops, you should give very small amounts and on very rare cases. Give carrot tops as occasional treats.</p>
<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-cooked-carrots"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Cooked Carrots?</strong></h2>
<p>Beardies readily eat cooked vegetables including carrots. However, cooking leaches out the nutrients that would otherwise be beneficial to your beardies health and growth.
When it comes to nutrients in vegetables, fresh is always a factor. So, if bearded dragons can eat raw carrots, there is not benefit of cooking it. Youll be denying them the nutrients required a healthy life.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-should-you-give-carrots-to-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How Often Should you Give Carrots to Your Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons require a host of other nutrients which are absent in carrots. In addition, their diet in the wild doesnt include carrots at all. Therefore, carrots should be given sparingly and not as their staple food. You can make it once every week.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-carrots-for-your-bearded-dragon"><strong>How to Prepare Carrots for Your Bearded Dragon</strong></h2>
<p>Now its time to feed your bearded dragon with carrots. Below is a step by step guide for preparing a carrot meal for your pet: Read also;
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-grapes/">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Grapes?</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Wash the carrots with clean water and peel using a kitchen knife or a mini peeler. Dont give the peels to your beardie because they might contain pesticides.</li>
<li>Chop the carrots into very small pieces because large pieces prove difficult for the bearded dragon to bite and chew. Alternatively, you can shred the carrots to make it even easier for your beardie to chew. Shredded carrots are even better for baby bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Place the chopped or shredded carrots in a dish and put it in the beardies terrarium. Bearded dragons love the sweetness in carrots. So, even if youre giving them carrots for the first time, theyll generously pounce on it with bites.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can prepare a sizeable amount of carrots and keep in the refrigerator. But remember to defrost when feeding your beardie with frozen carrots.
<em><strong>NB</strong></em>
: Only give fresh carrots. Once peeled and chopped, carrots will go bad easily. Rotten carrots might lead to diarrhea or other complications. Read also;

</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>From the above guide, you can certainly confirm that carrots arent a bad diet for your bearded dragon. They are a rich source of vitamin A, fiber and beta-carotene which are all beneficial to your beardies health.
However, you should avoid carrots if youre presently administering vitamin A supplements on your bearded dragon. Thats because you may end up raising the amount of vitamin A in their body to toxic levels.</p>

cucumber or other plant matter can sometimes be tricky. Some bearded dragons wont start eating cucumbers right away.
So you might need to train your beardie to get used to cucumber. Below are tips to guide you on how to train our beardie to eat cucumber.</p>
<h3 id="1-introduce-cucumbers-to-your-baby-dragon"><strong>1. Introduce Cucumbers to Your Baby Dragon</strong></h3>
<p>A saying goes by, You cant teach an old dog new tricks. Well, its advisable to introduce cucumber or any other vegetables at an early age so that your beardie gets used to it.
Baby beardies are especially hard to give new food. But with a little patience and trick, its only a matter of time before they start eating cucumber.
Typically, the
diet of a baby
beardie should constitute 80% proteins and 20% plant matter. But the plant matter should be increased as the animal progresses to adulthood.
The best way to introduce cucumber to your baby beardie is to give it early in the morning before it eats anything.
But you dont want to starve the little thing. If it refuses to eat at all, you can give them its favorite food. The intention is to make it used to cucumbers. Eventually, itll bear results.</p>
<h3 id="2-offer-cucumber-and-insects"><strong>2. Offer Cucumber and Insects</strong></h3>
<p>Treating cucumber slices with their favorite insects will gradually make your bearded dragon used to a plant diet.
This trick works best in the morning when the beardie is hungry.
Introduce one or two wax worms or Dubai roaches into the bowl containing cucumber slices.
The bearded dragon will immediately pick on the insect and in the process, theres a chance of getting a bite on the cucumber slice.
You can repeat this trick several times until your beardie gets used to cucumber.</p>
<h3 id="3-mix-cucumber-with-sweet-fruits"><strong>3. Mix Cucumber with Sweet Fruits</strong></h3>
<p>Fruits such as apples, strawberries, and papaya can be mixed with cucumber to entice the beardie with their sweet taste.
Mix the cucumber with fruits that the beardie is used to. It will be drawn to the food by the smell of the fruits and immediately begin to bite.
Make sure the fruits and cucumber are sliced into small pieces and mixed thoroughly. This ensures that your beardie doesnt miss a bite of the cucumber as it picks on the sweet fruits.

<li>*Vitamin A:*Although bearded dragons require very minimal vitamin A, it helps in enhancing their normal vision, reproduction and developing their immune system.</li>
<li>*Vitamin D:*Eggs are rich in vitamin D which helps your bearded dragon in absorbing calcium from their diet. On the other hand, calcium helps in maintaining strong and healthy bones. Low calcium levels are associated with weaker and deformed bones.</li>
<li>*Vitamin E: *Vitamin E plays a big role in the bearded dragons body. Perhaps the most important is its role in boosting their immune system which helps in fighting bacteria and viruses. In addition it helps in red blood cells formation and preventing tissue damage.</li>
<li>*Vitamin B12:*Though not very common, vitamin B12 deficiency leads stunted growth, hatching discrepancies, weak leg muscles and high mortality rates. However, feeding your bearded dragon on eggs reduces chances of vitamin B12 deficiency.
Eggs also contain essential minerals such as magnesium, calcium, selenium, zinc, folate etc.

<li><strong>Eggs Contain Protein</strong>
Bearded dragons will readily eat eggs because they contain proteins which are vital in their growth. Baby bearded dragons require diets that are higher in proteins and less in vegetables because of their higher growth rate. Typically baby beardies need 80% proteins and 20% vegetables.
However, adults should be fed on 20% proteins and 80% vegetables. Whether youre dealing with adult or baby beardies, eggs should be given sparingly because they are very rich in proteins.
High protein intake makes your bearded dragon excessively fat. The problem with this is that it may lead fatty liver disease where fat builds up in the liver cells. The liver may eventually fail to function effectively.

<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-raw-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Raw Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>A big NO to raw eggs! The bacterias present in raw eggs are likely to make your bearded dragon sick. You may end up with a dead beardie.
Eggs should always be cooked before being fed to bearded dragons to kill the harmful bacterias.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-egg-shells"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Egg Shells?</strong></h3>
<p>The risks of feeding your bearded dragon with egg shells outweigh the benefits. Although they are richer in calcium than the egg itself, they cannot be easily be digested. Even in their finest form, egg shells take long to be broken down once inside the beardies digestive system
Also, because of the poor egg shell digestion, your bearded dragon may end up with lumps of shells in their stomachs which may cause impaction.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-hard-boiled-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Hard-Boiled Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>Hard-boiled eggs come with all the nutrients contained in an egg including protein, minerals and vitamins. So, giving them to your beardie would be very beneficial to their growth and health.
However, as earlier said, eggs should constitute a negligible percentage of their diet. Thats because too much protein can bring about health complications in future. They tend to become too fat and eventually suffer fatty liver disease.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-scrambled-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Scrambled Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>Scrambled eggs are just as good as hard-boiled eggs. Again, because of high protein issues, they should be feed in small quantities. However, they should not be cooked with fat the manner were used to prepare our eggs.
The reason for this is to avoid adding more fat to their diet. Also, check whether

<h3 id="egg-yolk-vs-egg-white-which-is-good-for-bearded-dragon"><strong>Egg Yolk vs Egg White: Which is Good for Bearded Dragon</strong></h3>
<p>Both egg white and egg yolk are good for bearded dragons. They contain vital nutrients that contribute to the well-being of your beardie. But owing to their high protein levels, bearded dragons should only have very little amounts of any of them.</p>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-quail-eggs"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Quail Eggs?</strong></h3>
<p>In terms of safety and nutritional value, quail eggs are just as good as chicken eggs. Similarly, you can only give your beardie small amounts of quail eggs because they contain too much protein.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-eggs-for-a-bearded-dragon"><strong>How to Prepare Eggs for a Bearded Dragon?</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you have confirmed that eggs are good for your bearded dragons, its time to know how to go about preparing an egg meal for your beardie. Therere two ways you can prepare eggs for the bearded dragon.
<strong>Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Break the egg open and pour in a bowl.</li>
<li>Scramble until the egg white and egg yolk blends into a uniform paste.</li>
<li>Pour the resulting paste into a non-stick pan and heat on a low/medium flame gas burner to prevent sticking. Do not use any frying oil.</li>
<li>If the egg tends to stick, you can mix it with a spoon without concentrating on the final shape of the egg. Furthermore, youll have to break it into small pieces to make it easy for your beardie to eat.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can cook the eggs in the oven in bowl without using cooking oil.</li>
<li>Once its ready you can put it in the beardies bowl and serve once it has cooled. Ensure you slice the cooked egg into small pieces. You can serve it with their favourite vegetables such as kales, broccoli, collard and so on.
<strong>Boiled Eggs</strong>
Although scrambled eggs are tastier to your bearded dragons you can also give them boiled eggs. Below are steps for preparing hard boiled eggs for your pet.</li>
<li>Put the eggs in a pot and add water that just covers the eggs.</li>
<li>Boil the eggs in high heat until the water boils rigorously.</li>
<li>Put off the burner and leave the pot covered for 13-16 minutes.</li>
<li>Once they cool, peel off the shell and chop the egg into small pieces.</li>
<li>Put the egg in the bearded dragons bowl or feeding point. You can serve with vegetables or greens.
Note: You should only serve small amounts of eggs because they are very rich proteins. Too much proteins will fatten your bearded dragon to dangerous extents. Also, avoid adding salt or sauces to eggs meant for bearded dragons.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Eggs make a very nutritious diet for bearded dragons. Thats because they contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and proteins. However, because of the high protein content, they are only suitable as a once in a while treat.
If youre already treating your beardies with an insect diet, they already have enough of protein in their bodies. Eggs can be given occasionally to give them variety. Excess protein will only make your pet very fat. This may eventually lead to liver complications or even death.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Answer; Yes - bearded dragon can eat grapes - just like other fruits and vegetables! Most species of bearded dragon eat grapes comfortably without any challenge  they actually like them.�</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grapes contains strong fiber content (needed to prevent constipation), relative water content (needed for osmoregulation), high potassium content (necessary for blood pressure control), low acid content as well as rich minerals and vitamin composition.�</strong></li>

<h2 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-grapes-7-secrets">Can Bearded Dragons Eat Grapes? 7 Secrets</h2>
<h3 id="1-richstrong-fiber-content">1. Rich/strong Fiber Content</h3>
<p>Grapes have rich and strong fiber content that is necessary for digestion process of your bearded dragon. For every 150g of grapes, there is 1.5g to 2.8g fiber content  this is quite high value as compared to other fruits and vegetables.
Maybe you have vineyard or have seen some grapes in groceries and wonders whether your
<a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/bearded-dragons-feeding">bearded dragon can feed</a>
on them. Would it be okay if you feed it with grapes leaves or vines?
Fiber acts as roughage and binds the food being digested within the alimentary canal. Normally, grapes fiber network will help prevent constipation (inability to release bowels) in your bearded dragon.
Moreover, the grapes fibers are strong, long and coiled (especially for seedless grapes) thus providing a strong grip on food being digested without breaking. This improves the peristalsis process too  the smooth flow of chyme within the digestive track of your bearded dragon.
NB: It is important to note that the fibers are never digested and are highly need in every diet that you feed your beardie.

<h3 id="2-relative-water-content-level">2. Relative Water Content Level</h3>
<p>Ripe grapes have 45% to 68% water content  this variation is due to climatic conditions in areas they are grown. Also, red grapes have slightly higher water content than green and pink grapes.
Apart from eating the grapes, your beardie will even eat their leaves too. However, grapes shouldnt be used as a regular diet for bearded dragon, since they have high calcium: phosphorous ratio (causes metabolic bone disease) and relatively high sugar content that may cause teeth decay, high blood pressure and diabetes.
However, on average, the water content in grapes is relative okay for your bearded dragon (if not overfed or when fed occasionally as advised).
For every 180g of ripe grapes, there is 80g to 121 g of water. This generally indicates that grapes will provide good amount of water (to your beardie) necessary for osmoregulation  this is a very crucial physiological process in beardies, which if not corrected will lead to high blood pressure or kidney failure.
Water also help in keeping your pet beardie hydrated thus preventing problems of dehydration such as dizziness, dry skin and dry mouth, constipation as well as low blood pressure.
Importantly, grapes water contain low glycemic index that helps control blood pressure and boost ultrafiltration process of your bearded dragon.
Note: You will need to be careful not to overfeed your beardie with grapes as this may lead to excess water intake that cause over hydration in your pet lizard. Actually, over hydration will make the beardie docile, have watery/runny poo, cause osmotic imbalance as well as diarrhea.</p>
<h3 id="3-low-acid-and-fat-level">3. Low Acid and fat Level</h3>
<p>The acidity level in either unripe or ripe grape is below 0.02mg for every 155g of grapes. In addition, the pH level of grapes on the chart ranges between 6.1 to 6.91.
This shows a strong indication that your bearded dragon has health safety when eating grapes as a diet.
We know well that high acid level in diet will cause discomfort and irritation along the alimentary canal (especially along the gullet). Moreover, acid will cause a burning sensation on the mouth inner lining and will cause indigestion problems to your beardies.
Its worth noting that grapes also have Antioxidants components �such as �phytochemical resveratrol (red grapes), lutein and zeaxanthin, �which help control heart related diseases and reduces inflammation on your beardie. These chemicals also promotes reduction of allergies occurrence on your pet lizard.
Notably, the skin of red grapes has high composition of antioxidant compounds like flavonoids myricetin and quercetin that will help repair radical cells in the beardies brain thus initiating stress relief.</p>
<h3 id="4-rich-minerals-and-vitamins-composition">4. Rich Minerals and Vitamins Composition</h3>
<p>Ripe grapes have rich vitamin C (27% of RDI), vitamin K (28% of RDI), vitamin B6 (6% of RDI) as well as vitamin A  these vitamins plays a crucial role in protecting your beardie against infection and boosts their pets vision.
Grapes also have compounds that reduces cholesterol absorption within the alimentary canal  this prevents cholesterol related diseases such as heart failure or obesity.
Thiamine and riboflavin found in grapes will richly boost the immune system of your bearded dragon further.
Grapes has high content of potassium that is necessary for controlling and regulating your beardies blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. Actually, for every 150 g of grapes, there is 288mg of potassium ions  relatively higher as compared to other fruits and vegetables.
Moreover, grapes also contains other minerals such as manganese, copper, magnesium, iron and zinc that will help build up bones, muscles and body tissues of your beardie, thus boosting its good health.

<h2 id="how-to-prepare-grapes-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to Prepare Grapes for Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>When preparing grapes for your bearded dragon, kindly follow the procedure below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick fresh ripe grapes right from the vineyard as an entire cluster. Leave them to drain excess water for 1 to 2 days.</li>
<li>Wash the grapes with warm or treated water to remove any chemical or poisonous insects such as fireflies that may be on the skin.</li>
<li>For seeded grapes, remove the seed as they may chock and kill the beardie when swallowing. Normally, you should slice the seeded grapes into 2 or 4 parts for easier removal of seeds.</li>
<li>For seedless grapes, you can feed your beardie direct or mesh them to form a viscous meal, which it can lick with its tongue.</li>
<li>After slicing grapes (smaller pieces enables the beardie to roll them with its tongue), supplement them with other fruits like apples, guavas, apricots as well as vegetables to boost its nutritional value and balance the low calcium content.</li>
<li>Place the meal salad in a dish and let the bearded dragon feed itself. Avoid pouring food into the beardies mouth directly from above as it may cause impaction or chocking leading to death.
NB: Avoid feeding your beardie with wild grown grapes  normally, most of them are poisonous or cause illnesses to your pet lizard.�Read Also:

</ol>
<h2 id="problems-with-overfeeding-bearded-dragon-with-grapes">Problems with Overfeeding Bearded Dragon with Grapes.</h2>
<p>Grapes, unlike other fruits such as bananas or guavas, should be fed to your beardie occasionally. This is because these fruits cause various side effects to your pet if overfed and not monitored.
Feed your adult beardie once or twice per week with 100g to 150g of ripe grapes. Supplement grapes with main diet when feeding your pet always. After one or two months of feeding your beardie as advised, it is necessary to involve a vet to monitor its health condition.
<strong>1. High sugar levels.</strong>
For every 100g of grapes, there is 23.37 g of sugars. This amount is relatively high and if not controlled may cause your beardie to suffer from high blood pressure, heart failure and diabetes. In addition, the sugar may be deposited on their teeth in large quantities leading to teeth decay.
<strong>2. Relatively High Water Content</strong>
Grapes are 45% to 68% water content. This a lone is an indicator that the fruits should be taken in fewer quantities to prevent over hydration on your beardie. Excess water in your beardie will cause diarrhea, runny/watery poo, kidney failure or make your pet inactive.� Feed your beardie with grapes that have low water content to curb these occurrences.
<strong>3. Imbalance calcium: phosphorous ratio</strong>
Major challenge of using grapes as main meal is the imbalance calcium: phosphorous ratio 0.5:1 This is far below the require/ideal ratio, which is usually 1:1, 2:1 or more.
Presence of high phosphorous as compared to calcium will inhibit calcium intake in the blood leading to metabolic bone disease. Since grapes has other high nutritional benefits, you will need to boost the calcium level using calcium powder or other feeds that have high calcium content.
Importantly, avoid using grapes species that has very high phosphorous content.�It is also necessary to note that most grapes contain oxalate, which inhibits calcium intake. You will need to avoid using such grapes species for your beardie too.
Avoid feeding your beardie with unripe grapes  they usually have high acid content and low nutrition value.�Grapes shouldnt be used in excess as main meal for your bearded dragon for the different reasons.

<h2 id="can-bearded-dragon-eat-grapes-leaves">Can Bearded Dragon Eat Grapes Leaves?</h2>
<p>Apart from eating the grapes, your bearded dragon will also eat the grapes leaves. Actually, most beardie species love to eat grapes leaves more that the fruits.
You will only need to separate the leaves from the vines, clean and wet them a bit (for easier swallowing) before feeding your beardie. If possible, chop the leaves into small pieces for easier feeding.
Grapes leaves are more nutritious and rich in fibers, which help prevent constipation for your bearded dragon. Normally, the beardies dont eat the stems  the stem are not succulent and the beardies teeth are not well adapted to peel off the back skin from the stems.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Your bearded dragon will not only eat grapes, but it will also feed on their leaves nicely.�Grapes are rich in fiber content needed to help in digestion and also contain high level of potassium content necessary for blood pressure control in your beardie.
In addition, grapes have rich vitamin composition and minerals that boost beardies immunity. For beardies good health, always involve qualified veterinary for checkup.
However, grapes should be administered as an occasional meal since overfeeding may lead to high water content, high sugar level as well as imbalance calcium: phosphorous ration your beardie.</p>

<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-mango-7-secrets">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Mango? 7 Secrets</h2>
<p>*Moreover, mangoes have relatively low water content (thus prevent over hydration) and it is an aphrodisiac fruit (improves beardies sexual activities). *
<em>However, mangoes should be supplemented with other meals as they contain Low calcium: phosphorous ratio, relatively high sugar level, moderate oxalate level as well as sight acidic content that may impair beardies body functionalities if fed in excess.</em></p>
<h3 id="1-vitamins-composition">1. Vitamins Composition</h3>
<p>For every 100g of mango salad, there is 6% to 10% Vitamin A that is needed to boost beardies eyesight thus preventing dry eyes and night blindness. In addition, vitamin A will improve your pets immune system further and help in development of reproduction system -
just like with eggs
.
Mangoes also have Vitamin B6 (0.119mg or 11.6% RDI needed for fat &amp; protein metabolism as well as in manufacture of red blood cells), Vitamin C (34.6mg or 67.2% of RDI - required to help repair worn-out tissues and boost your beardies growth and development) and Vitamin E (0.9mg or 9.67% RDI  needed for destruction of free radicals within tissues and prevents beardies skin from UV rays damage that may occur).
Importantly, mangoes have vitamin K (6% of RDI) that improves beardies blood clotting (in case of injuries) thus preventing any excess bleeding.

<h3 id="2-rich-pre-biotic-dietary-fiber">2. Rich Pre-Biotic Dietary Fiber</h3>
<p>Mangoes are known to have pre-biotic fibers that are will add bulk to your beardies stool thus preventing it from constipation (difficulties in releasing bowels). Scientific research shows that for every 100g of mango salad, there is 2.6g to 3.2g dietary fibers  this number is relatively high as compared to other fruits such as paw paws and berries.
The soluble based mango fibers will also add to the food content in the alimentary canal and ease the digestion process. Importantly, these fibers will help lower chances of your beardie suffering from coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease.
To acquire maximum dietary fibers, feed your beardie with ripe mangoes. Avoid mangoes that are over ripe as the fibers are usually very weak.

<h3 id="3-strong-antioxidant">3. Strong Antioxidant</h3>
<p>Mango species such as Apple mango have Strong antioxidant compounds that help in destruction of free radicals that mainly attacks body cells.
Antioxidants such as astragalin, gallate, quercetin, isoquercitrin, fisetin, and gallic acid and methyl work together in breaking down any free radical and poisonous chemical component that is taken in through ingestion by your beardie.
Moreover, mangoes contain other powerful antioxidants such as polyphenols, rhamnetinm, angiferin, catechins, anthocyanins and kaempferol, which further boost the intestinal lining protection and improve beardies immunity.
Notably, ripe mangoes have more antioxidants than unripe ones.</p>
<h3 id="4-rich-mineral-content">4. Rich Mineral Content</h3>
<p>There is 168mg of potassium in every 100g of fresh ripe mango salad. Potassium is required for smooth muscle contraction, fluid regulation and quick nerves signal control in your bearded dragon. In addition, potassium will lower the blood pressure, control excess water levels and prevent occurrence of diseases such as osteoporosis and kidney stones.
Presence of 11mg calcium will further help strengthen your beardies bones and teeth. Other minerals present include Sodium (1.3mg  needed for osmoregulation and blood pressure balance), Magnesium (10mg boosts heartbeat and maintains smooth nerve signal response), Zinc (0.19mg-required for cell division and repair of injuries), Manganese (0.063mg needed for metabolism of cholesterol and amino acid as well as clotting process) and Iron (0.16mg-prevents anemia and oxygen transportation).
Mangoes also contain phyto-nutrients such as �-carotene, �-cryptoxanthin and a-carotene, which easily combine with other antioxidants thus helping in elimination of free radicals.

<h3 id="5-relative-water-content-level">5. Relative Water Content Level</h3>
<p>On average, most mango species contain 49% to 74% water content when ripe. This quantity wont be harmful to your beardie if controlled feeding is carried out. Your beardie will have a stable osmoregulation (very crucial process for beardie without which it suffers kidney failure) if you follow proper feeding and preparation procedure given below.
Average water content is needed for your beardies homeostasis processes as well as maintenance of its skin and cells in hydrated state for proper physiological processes.
Low water content in beardie will cause dehydration that leads to dizziness, constipation and dry skin.
You should avoid overfeeding your bearded dragon with excess mangoes-it may lead to over hydration that causes high blood pressure and runny poo. Normally, Mangoes should be fed occasionally and be supplemented with other meals like mealworms or silkworms.

<h3 id="6-aphrodisiac-fruit">6. Aphrodisiac fruit</h3>
<p>Mangoes, from the recent scientific research, are now aphrodisiac. They contain compounds, which improves sexual activities of bearded dragons.
If your beardies are sexually inactive, just prepare 300g of mango salad weekly (as supplement feed) for a period of 3-4 months in order to boost their mating desire and performance.
Species such as chaunsa and alphonsos mangoes strengthen further the bonds of male and female beardies in a given cage they tend to stay together most of their time.</p>
<h3 id="7-low-fat-and-cholesterol-level">7. Low Fat and Cholesterol Level</h3>
<p>According to Jasleer (nutritionist), mangoes are cholesterol free and fat free. However, some species show about 0.0013mg of fat in every 100g of mango salad. This is a very low quantity thus safe for your beardies consumption.
Excess cholesterol in beardies accumulate in the inner lining of blood vessel thus narrowing them this causes high blood pressure and heart failure at long run.
In addition, excess fat builds up at the berry and tail regions thus making your pet beardie docile/inactive as well as obese.
<em>Mangoes have a high dietary fiber (needed to add bulk and reduce constipation), low fat and cholesterol (reducing obesity and heart problems), strong antioxidants (that prevent cells against free radicals) and high potassium level (needed for nerve signals control, muscle contraction and osmoregulation).</em></p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-mangoes-for-your-bearded-dragon">How to Prepare Mangoes for Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>To prepare mangoes for your bearded dragons meal, follow the procedure below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Harvest ripe mangoes from the farm and leave them to drain water for at least two days  this will also improve their nutrients action/uptake by your pet beardie.</li>
<li>Clean/Wash mangoes using warm or treated water to remove any chemicals or stains that may harm your beardies digestive system.</li>
<li>Leave clean mangoes to dry in air/shade for 20minutes before peeling them.</li>
<li>Slice/chop the peeled mangoes into small sizes (the sizes should not be larger than the space between the beardies eyes)  this may lead to chocking that causes death easily.</li>
<li>Dont chop the central seed (dispose it instead)  mango seed is hard for beardie to digest and when swallowed may cause impaction or block the gullet.</li>
<li>Mix the mango salad with other supplement like cabbages and mealworms to add extra flavor.</li>
<li>Measure 300g to 545g of mango salad in a given time when feeding your beardie  the quantity is for one adult beardie.
NB: It is required of you to feed beardie twice or thrice per month with mango salad in order to avoid over hydration and side effects of excess sugar that may arise. Do not feed your beardie with unripe mangoes they are difficult for beardies to digest and often impact/chock them when swallowing.

<h2 id="mango-species-not-to-feed-your-bearded-dragon">Mango Species not to Feed Your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<h3 id="1-mangoes-with-relatively-high-water-content"><strong>1. Mangoes With Relatively High Water Content</strong></h3>
<p>High water content is unfavorable for beardie as it leads to runny poo, high blood pressure, diuresis, difficulties in osmoregulation as well as diabetes. In addition, excess water will make your beardie docile or less active.
Mango species such as chaunsa have high water content as compared to others and should be fed least when they have not reached overripe condition.
Select mangoes, such as apple mangoes, which has low water content to eliminate such problems. It is also necessary to avoid overripe mangoes as they to be more acid the benzoic acid content in some mango species increases as they overripe.</p>
<h3 id="2-mangoes-with-high-sugar-levels"><strong>2. Mangoes With High Sugar Levels</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, mangoes have relatively high sugar content of about 7.68g per every 100g of mango salad. Excess sugar intake by beardies cause high blood pressure, diabetes and heart attack. In addition, sugar accumulates within teeth gaps and lead to teeth decay  this is very common.
Select low sugar mango species for your beardies occasional or daily feed supplement e.g.� keitt mango, osteen mango or haden mango varieties.
You can feed your beardie with mangoes that are about to ripen  they usually have low sugar content.</p>
<h3 id="3-mangoes-with-low-calcium-phosphorous-ratio"><strong>3. Mangoes With Low Calcium: Phosphorous Ratio</strong></h3>
<p>One great problem of mangoes is that they have low calcium: phosphorous ratio of 0.4:1. This is dangerous since excess phosphorous inhibits (binds) calcium from being absorbed into the bloodstream leading to calcium deficiency disease called metabolic bone disease.
However, you can boost beardies calcium level in the mango salad by adding commercially manufactured calcium powder supplement when feeding.
You need to know that low calcium to phosphorous ration will also affect absorption of carbs by your beardie. Therefore, select mango species that have relatively high calcium: phosphorous ratio.

<h3 id="4-mangoes-with-high-acidity-level-">**4. Mangoes With High Acidity Level **</h3>
<p>Most mangoes have about 0.12% of RDI acid in every 100g of mango salad. Acid such as tartaric, benzoic acid and few traces of citric acid in some mongo species will affect the digestion process of beardies. Actually, high acid level will inactivate digestive enzymes leading to vomiting or drooling of the beardies.
You should consider mango species such as haden, keitt or apple mangoes that have least acid content as frequent diet supplement for your beardie.</p>
<h3 id="5-mangoes-with-high-oxalate-content"><strong>5. Mangoes With High Oxalate Content</strong></h3>
<p>Just like phosphorous, oxalate found in some mango species will inhibit calcium absorption leading to metabolic bone disease. Moreover, oxalate will also limit carbs absorption and digestion of starch. It is therefore necessary to select mango species with low oxalate content.</p>

<p>Normally, bearded dragons do not eat stems and barks of mango tree since they are hard to digest and post swallowing challenges. Though mango lives have nutritious content, beardies dont like them they are rough, irritate beardies tongue and damage the mouth lining.
However, most bearded dragons will eat mango peels if they are well sliced/chopped. Actually, mango peels contain important antioxidant compounds necessary for destruction of free radicals that may be found within beardie body tissues.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded dragon will easily eat mangoes to acquire vitamin A, B6, C, E and K. In addition, mangoes have rich pre-biotic dietary fibers as well as rich mineral content.
Notably, low fat and cholesterol content makes mango salad a suitable feed supplement. However, mangoes contain relatively high sugar, moderate oxalate/acid and low calcium: phosphorous ratio and thus should be used occasionally.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bearded dragons enjoy a diverse and balanced diet that includes leafy greens such as collard greens and
cabbage
, as well as vegetables like bell peppers,
tomatoes
, and
carrots
.
However, it is crucial to carefully assess the food you offer to these unique and docile reptiles, as some foods may be unsafe for their consumption.
So, mushrooms: <a href="/posts/are-blue-tailed-lizards-poisonous/">are</a> they safe for Bearded Dragons?
<em>In summary, it&rsquo;s generally unsafe to feed mushrooms to bearded dragons - despite these bites having essential nutrients.�Although mushrooms have essential nutrients, many varieties, including wild mushrooms, are toxic to reptiles, including bearded dragons.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Besides, the consumption of mushrooms can lead to digestive problems or organ failure in bearded dragons due to these bites having high acidity levels and an unbalanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio.�</em>
<strong>Check out these Bearded Dragon Foods.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risks-in-feedingmushrooms-to-bearded-dragons">Risks in Feeding**Mushrooms to **<strong>Bearded Dragons�</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-unbalanced-calcium-to-phosphorus-ratio-causes-bone-related-illnesses"><strong>1. U</strong>*nbalanced *<em>calcium-to-phosphorus ratio Causes Bone-related Illnesses</em></h3>
<p>The�calcium-to-phosphorus ratio is a critical aspect when analyzing the foods to give your�bearded dragons. Phosphorus has a critical role in cell functioning and energy production. On the other hand, Calcium is required to appropriate metabolic processes, bone development, and muscle function.
However, the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio must be carefully balanced - their diet must contain a high amount of calcium compared to phosphorus.</p>
<ul>
<li>An imbalance where the bearded dragon&rsquo;s diet has more phosphorus (than calcium) leads to lower rates of�calcium absorption and thus may result in diseases like metabolic bone disease (MBD), fractures, deformities, or even brittle bones.
Bearded dragons require a diet with a calcium-to-phosphorous ratio of 2:1 or 1:1. However, mushrooms have high phosphorus ratios and may lead to bone-related health conditions. For instance, the ratio in portabella mushrooms is 1:16.3 - calcium to phosphorous.
So, feeding your bearded dragon with mushrooms isnt good for their health. The unbalanced Ca:P ratio in mushrooms interferes with calcium absorption in the beardies body.</li>
<li>This results in calcium deficiency which in turn leads to problems such as metabolic bone disease, muscle weakness, and the inability of blood to clot.
When the amount of phosphorous exceeds calcium, phosphorous reacts with calcium to form calcium phosphate which is difficult to absorb in the gut.</li>
<li>Further, experts recommend including more foods that have a balanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-bearded-dragons-eat/">dragon&rsquo;s diet</a>. Some of these foods are vegetables and calcium-dusted insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-oxalic-acid-in-mushrooms-negatively-affects-calcium-levels">**2. **<strong>Oxalic Acid in Mushrooms Negatively Affects calcium levels�</strong></h3>
<p>Mushrooms have a considerable amount of oxalic acid - an element that&rsquo;ll negatively affect the levels of calcium that&rsquo;s available in the body of your bearded dragon.
So, if you feed mushrooms to bearded dragons, the oxalic acid in the food will bind with calcium to create calcium oxalate (CaC2O4)- a compound that is insoluble and indigestible to your bearded dragons.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, binding calcium in an insoluble compound implies that there less calcium will be readily absorbed for proper body functioning in the beaded dragon such as in bone formation - read this may cause calcium deficiency.
As noted earlier, calcium is a vital nutrient in these reptiles as it helps in enhancing metabolic processes,� nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and making strong bones.</li>
<li>To make up for the low calcium levels, the body tends to get calcium from available sources such as bones. This leads to a condition called metabolic bone disease where bones become soft and weak.
Signs of metabolic bone disease in bearded dragons include deformed limbs, arched spine, limping, bone fracture, and lethargy among others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-mushrooms">Alternatives to Mushrooms</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear, by now, that mushrooms are unsafe for your bearded dragons and so I dig deep into finding nutritious and suitable alternatives for the reptile&rsquo;s diet.</p>
<h3 id="1-leafy-greens">1. Leafy Greens</h3>
<p>Using leafy greens the diet of your bearded dragon will help increases the calcium levels absorbed in their bodies.
These greens will give the pets suitable and safe minerals and vitamins. Exp[erts recommend using some of these leafy greens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mustard greens</li>
<li>Collard greens</li>
<li>Kale</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-vegetables">2. Vegetables</h3>
<p>Bearded dragons will benefit from vegetables - as an alternative to the nutrients they could have acquired from mushrooms.
Include some of these vegetables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Bell peppers</li>
<li>Tomatoes
The vegetable will give your bearded dragons an excellent mix of fiber and vitamins -which will significantly benefit the good health of your pet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-calcium-dusted-insects">3. Calcium-dusted insects</h3>
<p>Feed the bearded dragon with calcium-rich foods such as calcium-dusted insects - they&rsquo;ll also offer proteins. You may require to dust these insects with some reptile-friendly calcium powder before feeding your beaded dragons.
Some foods under this category include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dubia Roaches</li>
<li>Mealworms</li>
<li>Crickets
You can supplement calcium for the reptiles through substrates - Experts recommend using some considerable
substrate
in the diet of these reptiles to supplement the calcium levels in their food - but this must be done in moderation to avoid impaction or digestive problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mushroom-toxicity-for-bearded-dragons"><strong>Mushroom Toxicity for Bearded Dragons�</strong></h2>
<p>Although some mushrooms are included in the human diet, therere a few species of toxic mushrooms. They are potentially harmful to both humans and animals including bearded dragons when accidentally ingested.
Out of the common mushroom species, only a few species are lethal. Many others will only lead to noticeable symptoms when ingested by humans or animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms is extremely difficult because they share a lot of similarities.</li>
<li>Thats why misidentification is the leading cause of mushroom poisoning in humans.
Mushrooms can grow anywhere theres high moisture content including the yard, garden, basement, garage, and so on. To avoid accidental ingestion by your bearded dragon, kids, or other animals its advisable to get rid of any wild mushrooms.
Some of the common toxic mushrooms include:</li>
<li>Amanita phalloides</li>
<li>Inocybe</li>
<li>Amanita muscaria</li>
<li>Amanita pantherina</li>
<li>Clitocybe</li>
<li>Scleroderma citrinum

<h3 id="1-symptoms-of-mushroom-poisoning-in-bearded-dragons"><strong>1. Symptoms of Mushroom Poisoning in Bearded Dragons</strong></h3>
<p>Bearded dragons are usually confined to their tanks or terrarium. However, some beardie owners may once in a while take their pets outdoors to get some warmth from the sunlight.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your bearded dragon accidentally eats poisonous mushrooms in the yard, it may fall sick within a short time or even die.
Symptoms of mushroom poisoning vary depending on the pets vulnerability and the mushroom species. Below are some symptoms to look for in case your bearded dragon or other pets accidentally eats toxic mushrooms:
**a. Gastrointestinal Irritation (GI): **
It is the first sign of mushroom poisoning and may entail diarrhea and vomiting. These symptoms occur within 6 hours and may last up to 24 hours. However, if GI is not accompanied by other symptoms, its an indication of mild poisoning. Thus, it may not require major veterinary intervention.
<strong>b. Muscarinic Effects and GI:</strong>
If gastrointestinal irritation is accompanied by muscarinic effects such as pupil constriction, tear production, and drooling, these could be signs of more serious poisoning. In this case, your bearded dragon needs veterinary attention as soon as possible.
<strong>c. Muscarinic Effects, GI plus Lethargy, and Depression:</strong>
Apart from the muscarinic effects and gastrointestinal irritation, severe symptoms like lack of energy, depression, bleeding, and seizures. Eyes and the mucus membrane may turn yellow indicating possible liver damage.
These could be symptoms of Amanita phalloides mushrooms popularly known as death cap. Symptoms begin within six hours and may last up to 20 hours. Serious clinical attention is required to avoid fatality.
<strong>d. Hallucinogenic Syndrome:</strong>
Though nontoxic the magic mushroom causes hallucinogenic symptoms such as staggering, seizure, depression, muscle problems, or coma in severe cases. Since these mushrooms are illegal, its unlikely to find them in someones yard.
The only possible place your pet may pick magic mushroom is from the trash. If such symptoms are observed, serious veterinary intervention is required.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-how-to-preventdeal-with-mushroom-poisoning"><strong>2. How to Prevent/Deal with Mushroom Poisoning�</strong></h3>
<p>Mushrooms grow anywhere as long as theres high moisture content. They can grow in the yard and damp places like in the garage, or basement.
When you take your bearded dragon outdoors -
keep them caged
, therere chances of ingesting toxic stuff including mushrooms.�Here are tips for preventing/dealing with mushroom poisoning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove any mushrooms that are growing in your home. Common areas to check for mushroom growth include the yard, flower garden, near woodpiles, outdoor water points, and so on.</li>
<li>Ensure your bearded dragon does not stray to the garden or yard.</li>
<li>If you cannot immediately identify a mushroom, treat it as toxic. Therefore, you should contact your vet in case of suspected mushroom ingestion.</li>
<li>If you can locate a piece of the ingested mushroom, take it with you to the veterinarian.</li>
<li>If the bearded dragon defecates or vomits after mushroom ingestion, take with you a sample of the poop or vomit to the animal clinic.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The high acidity levels and
<a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/which_pet_is_right_for_me">unbalanced calcium-to-phosphorous ratio</a>
in mushrooms can lead to deteriorated health in your bearded dragon. In addition, some mushrooms are very poisonous which makes them unfit for bearded dragons.</p>

or have you seen one at you field or zoo and even wonder what they actually eat?
But when it comes to other foods such as onions, you may need to pay a little bit of attention.
<em>So, can bearded Dragon Eat Onions?�</em>
<strong>The simple answer is No. Never feed bearded dragon with (cooked or raw). Onions are laced with high levels of acids and have high calcium to phosphorous ratio. These components cause indigestion problems along the delicate alimentary canal of Bearded Dragon.�</strong></p>
<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-onions">Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat Onions?</h2>
<h3 id="1-toxic-to-their-digestive-system">1. Toxic to their digestive system</h3>
<p>Onions (scientific name
<em>Allium cepa</em>
) usually contain toxic substance which when eaten by Bearded Dragon, it toxifies the alimentary canal leading to digestion problems such as incomplete digestion,
<a href="https://www.vetexotic.theclinics.com/article/S1094-9194(16)30081-0/abstract">vomiting and burning sensation</a>
.</p>
<p>You will notice mixed reaction when you feed your beard dragon with onions due to colorless steam produced by fleshly cut onions. These steam emissions from onions usually make your
pet bearded dragon
to even shed tears (though they dont cry like human beings do).</p>
<ul>
<li>Though scientific research has been done, it has not been able to establish the exact chemical that cause tears and itching sensation on bearded dragon.
The onion leaves produces slippery fluid between leaf layers, which makes it unpleasant meal for your bearded dragon.� The green leafy onions have hollow inner sections that incubate gas, which causes vomiting to your bearded dragon when eaten.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-high-acidity-level">2. High Acidity level</h3>
<p>Onions have high level of acid content, which cause hurt burn and throat discomfort to your bearded dragon when eaten. The Folate (Folic Acid) &amp; ascorbic acid portions found in onions form a high pH environment in chyme within the stomach thus inhibiting normal working of digestive enzymes (high acid levels inactivates the digestive enzymes).</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw onions when eaten causes burning sensation (due to acid content) on the tongue and inner lining of Bearded dragons mouth. This feeling makes the pet get agitated or angry leading to loss of appetiteand they can&rsquo;t mate.
The red onions (normally fed to bearded dragons most  have white fleshy interior leaves and are sweet) have compound that affect the red blood cells of your bearded dragon leading to low cell count.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-unbalance-nutrition-components-calcium-to-phosphorous-ratio">3. Unbalance Nutrition components (Calcium to Phosphorous ratio).</h3>
<p>Onions have unbalance calcium to phosphorous ratio. For every 1gram of calcium, there is 2 grams of phosphorous in a given onion species. This on itself cause ion imbalance in the body.
High level of phosphorous as compared to calcium is not ideal for Bearded Dragon Survival. Excess or phosphorous will inhibit calcium intake leading adrenal or renal disorder. On the other hand, excess or calcium within the body may not be healthy for your bearded dragon (this may result from inhibition caused by the phosphorous within the bones or kidneys).
Proper calcium to phosphorous ratio for your bearded dragon to achieve healthy life is 2 grams of calcium for every gram of phosphorous or 1:1 ratio. This will ensure a balance calcium intake and phosphorous removal from the bones and thus preventing any possible disorder.
Onion has other nutritional components that may be of nutritional value for your bearded dragon. For every 100 grams of onions sliced for analysis, the following nutritional components will be found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calcium  23 milligrams ,<strong>Phosphorus  29 milligrams</strong>&amp; Potassium  146 milligrams</li>
<li>Iron  0.21 milligrams &amp; Magnesium  10 milligrams</li>
<li>Protein  1.1 gram, Sugars  4.24 grams &amp;��� Carbohydrates  9.34 grams</li>
<li><em>Folate (Folic Acid)  19 micrograms &amp; Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid)  7.4 milligrams</em></li>
<li><em>Pantothenic Acid (B5)  0.123 milligrams</em>&amp; Niacin (B3)  0.116 milligrams
By observation, it is clear that the phosphorous (written in bold) levels in sample is far much high as compared to calcium. In addition, the acidity level in different onion nutritional components (written in italic) are far much high too. This means that onions are not suitable for bearded dragon at whatever case.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rule-and-guidelines-to-follow-when-feeding-your-bearded-dragon">Rule and Guidelines to Follow When Feeding Your Bearded Dragon.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Any plant feeds should be fresh, chopped and thoroughly washed before feeding your bearded dragon. Water provides added nutrition to your beaded dragon.</li>
<li>Never feed your bearded dragons with food pieces that are larger than the space between the eyes (this cause chocking while feeding).</li>
<li>Let your bearded dragon hunt for food (insects) introduced in the cage to enable it to exercise while moving.</li>
<li>Always ensure that you feed you bearded dragon from a dish to prevent it from direct swallowing, which may cause impaction leading to death or health complications.</li>
<li>Never leave excess food in the cage after feeding your bearded dragon -
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-eggs/">including egg diet</a>
. This makes it less active or docile since most of them never stop eating.</li>
<li>It is always advisable to offer plant feed mixed with insects to boost the nutrients acquired per feed.</li>
<li>Fruits should be peeled and chopped when feeding your bearded dragon.</li>
<li>Never entrust your kids to feed your bearded dragon in your absence.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragon do not eat onions in any form (raw or cook). Though some owners mix onions with other feeds, this is not right since onions contain toxic substance, acids and high calcium to phosphorous ratio, which cause digestion problems.
It is therefore advisable to avoid giving your pet bearded dragon any onion species. Also, follow the feeding guidelines discussed above to ensure a healthy life for your pet bearded dragon.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">bearded</a> dragons eat oranges?</strong>
Well, previously we&rsquo;ve seen that
beardies feed on selected veggies, insects (bugs), fruits
.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The short answer is NO - bearded dragons don&rsquo;t eat oranges - oranges contain excessive fruit acid and sugar that may irritate the digestive system of the bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-bananas/">dragon</a> causing dehydration and diarrhea.�</strong>
Also, oranges contain more phosphorous than calcium, giving a Ca:P ratio that is incorrect for bearded dragons.
These beardies love supplements that have a ratio of calcium: phosphorus ranging from 2:1 to 3:1. See other foods for bearded dragons.

<h2 id="details-can-bearded-dragons-eat-oranges"><strong>Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat oranges?�</strong></h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feed
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/central-bearded-dragon">bearded dragons</a>
(or other lizards) with oranges. Oranges have excessive fruit acid and sugar that&rsquo;ll irritate the digestive system of your bearded dragon.
Like other citrus fruits, oranges are very acidic. When ingested by beardies, they can cause severe diarrhea plus dehydration.
Also, the consumption of oranges interferes with the pets Ca:P ratio. Oranges contain large amounts of phosphorus compared to calcium.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, calcium is utilized in the absorption of phosphorus from the intestines into the bloodstream.
The extra calcium required for phosphorus is obtained by the body from the bones.
This is a known cause of bone degeneration in beardies which are fed on oranges.�Read Also:

<strong>Side-note:�</strong>
<em>Feed Bearded dragons with very small portions of limited types of fruits - including grapes, pears, cherries, peaches, plums, raspberries, pineapples, apples, peeled bananas, watermelon, and papayas.�</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-orange-fed-insects"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Orange-Fed Insects?�</strong></h3>
<p>A bearded dragon may eat the food, but some may be poisoned, have serious illnesses, or death.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, is it okay to feed your omnivorous bearded dragon with oranges - maybe some Mandarin oranges?
Bearded dragons love eating small creatures like roaches, crickets, and so on.</li>
<li>Since roaches and crickets have an appetite for sugary foods, you can feed them with oranges to enrich their bodies with calcium.
Oranges are particularly very helpful in the thriving and reproduction of Dubai roaches.</li>
<li>If you feed your bearded dragon on these insects, youll be indirectly giving them the calcium in oranges.</li>
<li>Just like in humans, calcium helps in maintaining the bone health of your bearded dragon.
As for the citric acid, the insects digestive system breaks it down to levels that are just appropriate for your beardie to absorb.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-mandarin-oranges"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Mandarin Oranges?</strong></h3>
<p>Mandarin oranges are types of oranges that contain less concentrations of citric acid.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, they are still not far from being harmful to bearded dragons. The sugar content in these citrus fruits is likely to cause diarrhea.</li>
<li>These creatures require a high plant intake in their diet. Plant diet is broken down by beneficial micro-organisms in the beardies gut.
However, optimum activity for these organisms is significantly hindered by the acidity in oranges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-drink-orange-fruit-juice"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Drink Orange Fruit Juice?</strong></h3>
<p>The sugar content and acidity remain the same whether you have the raw orange fruit or its juice.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, orange fruit juice should not be fed to bearded dragons since it can also cause diarrhea and dehydration.
Further, bearded dragons have poor drinking habits. Theyre so accustomed to desert conditions that they rarely take drinks when in captivity.</li>
<li>So, you might not bring your bearded dragon to drink orange fruit juice.</li>
<li>It takes time to teach bearded dragons to start drinking anything including water.
But in case you manage, do not give it orange fruit juice.�Read Also:

</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-citrus-fruits"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Citrus Fruits?</strong></h3>
<p>Oranges are in the class of citrus fruits and so are grapefruits and lemons.
Fruits in this class contain different levels of citrus acid concentration. So none of these should be fed to bearded dragons.
The acidity and sugar levels in citrus fruits will readily cause diarrhea in bearded dragons and other lizards.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, citrus fruits contain high levels of oxalic acid, especially on their peels.
It combines with calcium to form an insoluble compound (calcium oxalate).�This causes a deficiency in calcium which in turn leads to bone degeneration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-oranges-peels"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Oranges Peels?</strong></h3>
<p>Orange peels should not be fed on bearded dragons because they are also very acidic.</p>
<ul>
<li>They also contain oxalic acid which combines with dietary calcium to form calcium oxalate (CaC2O4).</li>
<li>This leads to lower levels of calcium which is necessary for phosphorous absorption.
To compensate for the low calcium levels, the body system uses calcium from the bones which lead to bone degeneration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-clementines"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Clementines?</strong></h3>
<p>Clementines are close relatives of oranges derived from the crossing of sweet orange and mandarin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since theyre acidic, they should not be fed on bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Their acid content is much less than in oranges.
Although clementines are a good source of calcium, phosphorous, and fiber, their acidic content isnt good for your beardie.
Like other citrus fruits, it has the potential to cause diarrhea. In addition, the sugar level and the Ca:P ratio arent good for your beardie.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-bearded-dragons-eat-tangerines"><strong>Can Bearded Dragons Eat Tangerines?</strong></h3>
<p>Tangerines are close relatives to oranges, mandarins, and clementines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a citrus fruit, tangerine also has excessive acidity and sweetness. That rules out its viability as food for bearded dragons.</li>
<li>Tangerines have loose and thick skin with orange flesh and are red-colored.
But these fruits have a slightly reduced sourness. But Tangerines are very acidic to be fed to bearded dragons like their staple food.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-bearded-dragons-eat-in-the-wild">What Do Bearded Dragons Eat in the Wild?</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons are
omnivorous lizards that&rsquo;ll also eat wild vegetation such as leaves and some fruits.
The beardies will feed on
vertebrates like lizards plus invertebrates such as beetles and ants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beardies will forage the wild vegetation and fruits plus flowers, plants, and small-sized bugs.
These pets can go for a long time with no food while conserving energy as they wait for suitable prey including small bugs.</li>
<li>The wild bugs and vegetation provide the bearded dragons with nutrients plus vitamins to supplement their regular diet.
Thus, the captive beardies may need supplements to match such nutritional supply - but you can give them salads and bugs.</li>
<li>Also, make the beardies work a bit to get their food while you&rsquo;re equally providing diet change.
Further, you may simulate wild feeding by providing videos - this also enhances their physical and mental health.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Bearded dragons must never be fed with citric fruit because they&rsquo;re highly acidic and have high sugar levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>As much as you want to give a calcium diet to your bearded dragon, you should avoid feeding them with oranges.</li>
<li>The sweetness and acidity of oranges and other citrus fruits arent good for the health of your beardie.
Therefore, you should feed them with alternative foods like kale, carrots, collard greens, and other leafy vegetables.</li>

<li>Can spinach harm the bearded dragons or does it hold some significant nutritional value for them?
<strong>So, technically, YES - bearded dragons will feed on spinach as it&rsquo;s not toxic to these pets and the leafy vegetables have some level of nutritional value.�</strong>
But spinach has notable compounds that would make the vegetable unsuitable for feeding to the bearded dragons on a regular basis. So, we generally advise you to avoid spinach in the beardies&rsquo; diet.</li>

<li>A section of the dragon pet keeps saying that they won&rsquo;t feed their beardies with spinach to avoid the risk. I approve of this since spinach is instant necessary for the development of the pet.
So, I would recommend you consider other more nutritious and safer food or bites to feed your dragon compared to using spinach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dietary-requirements-for-bearded-dragon">Dietary requirements for Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons will require a dietary balanced meal that included veggies, fruits, and insects.</p>
<p>The adult dragon will require 20% insects and 80% plants. But baby or younger dragons require 30% plants and 70% insects (meat) or even 50-50 as advised by the veterinarian.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bearded dragons are considered omnivores - and thus they&rsquo;ll feed on both plant and meat foods. But their nutritional requirement will change with their age.</li>
<li>So, if you&rsquo;re checking out meat alternatives or sources to give your dragons, I would recommend trying some Nightcrawlers. Further, the plant-based dies must have mainly vegetables.
Feeding Spinach to�Bearded Dragons? Any Benefits?</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of feeding spinach to our bearded dragons include that it offers some level of nutritional value.</p>
<p>These are the nutritional values of raw spinach - this is per every 100 grams as noted by the
<em>Agriculture Department in the United States.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Magnesium 79 mg</li>
<li>Iron 2.71 mg</li>
<li>Vitamin A469 �g</li>
<li>Vitamin C28.1 mg</li>
<li>Protein 2.86 g</li>
<li>Fat 0.39 g</li>
<li>Potassium 558 mg</li>
<li>Phosphorus 49 mg</li>
<li>Calcium 99 mg</li>
<li>Sugar 0.42 g</li>
<li>Water 91.4 g</li>
<li>Fiber 2.2 g</li>
<li>Carbohydrates 3.63 g</li>
<li>Energy 23 kcal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-rich-in-antioxidants--minerals">1. Rich in Antioxidants &amp; Minerals</h3>
<p>Spinach is an antioxidant- and nutrient-rich vegetable as it comes with high levels of calcium, iron, folic acid, vitamin K, vitamin C, and carotenoids.</p>
<ul>
<li>On anti-oxidants, spinach is a great source of antioxidants such as lutein which is considered to reduce the probability of macular degeneration and enhance eye health.</li>
<li>Spinach contains a great blend of antioxidants and minerals that&rsquo;ll help the dragon to evade heart problems as it reduces cholesterol levels.
The anti-oxidants and minerals will also strengthen the bearded dragon&rsquo;s bones and tissue� - keeping the dragon&rsquo;s bonds strong and also healthy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-suitable-vitamins-source">2. Suitable Vitamins Source</h3>
<p>The beaded dragons will reap some significant vitamin quantities in the spinach - these include vitamins C, B-6, and A.
<strong>Vitamin C -</strong>
The USDA notes that there are 28.1 mg Vitamin C in every 100-gram of spinach - these include either the semi-savoy spinach, flat spinach, or savoy spinach.</p>
<p>Vitamin C has a major role in the repair, growth, and development of body tissues. The vitamin will assist in absorbing iron, maintaining bones and immunity.
<strong>Vitamin B-6</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin B-6 in spinach will help animals create their antibodies - these aid in fighting disease &amp; infections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin B-6 will help in the development of the nervous and immune systems while minting excellent brain development while also keeping appropriate weight.
<strong>Vitamin A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin aids in the development of excellent vision - while also promoting the growth of a suitable immune system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-high-potassium-levels">3. High Potassium Levels</h3>
<p>Spinach equally has high potassium levels - notably, a single spinach cup will have as high as 167-mg of potassium.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be great to notes that compared to amounts of potassium on a banana, spinach contains largely more. But how does Potassium help? Well, Potassium assists to keep normal fluid levels in the animal cells.</li>
<li>Further, the nutrient will assist muscles in contracting and keep blood pressure at normal.
Besides, potassium will also assist in regulating the normal body fluid levels, muscle activity, and kidney function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-suitable-phosphorus--calcium-balance">4. Suitable Phosphorus &amp; Calcium Balance</h3>
<p>Spinach will also offer a great Phosphorus &amp; Calcium balance that the bearded dragons will love.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is especially important for the younger beardies that will suffer when calcium levels are low in their diet.</li>
<li>Therefore, I recommend that you spray some supplements with calcium powder on the dragon&rsquo;s food. Further, we&rsquo;ve talked about phosphorous above, and this ingredient helps in binding the calcium for easier absorption.
Notable, metabolic bone disease (MBD) will arise in the dragon if it does not have adequate calcium in its body - 100 grams of spinach has phosphorus to calcium amounts of 49 mg and 99 mg.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-low-levels-of-fat-sugar-and-calories">5. Low Levels of Fat, Sugar, and Calories</h3>
<p>The bearded dragon could also be affected by obesity and thus it&rsquo;s important to control nutrients and ingredients that could contribute to this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>For this issue, spinach will have low levels of fats, sugars, and calories - and thus it&rsquo;ll be a great treat.
For hydration, the spinach also offers excellent water content that&rsquo;ll largely benefit the bearded dragons.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feeding-spinach-to-bearded-dragons-what-are-the-risks">Feeding Spinach to Bearded Dragons? What are the Risks?</h2>
<h3 id="1-calcium-and-oxalates">1. Calcium and Oxalates</h3>
<p>One of the challenges that will arise from feeding the spinach to your bearded dragons includes that there may be dangers of not getting inadequate calcium and high oxalates in the diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>This may occur when the dragons eat foods that have high amounts of phosphorous in comparison to what they have as calcium.
Further, the high levels of oxalic acids and oxalates in the spinach have proven to be problematic to bearded dragons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-risk-of-metabolic-bone-disease">2. Risk of Metabolic Bone Disease</h3>
<p>Feeding spinach to your bearded dragons makes you risk metabolic bone disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>The under 2 years with the beardies may become calcium-deficient and this may contribute to them having deformed, weak, and soft bones.
When the diet has low calcium, vitamin D-3, while also having high phosphorus - and this may cause a high risk of MBD.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in summary, should I feed my bearded dragons with spinach? Well, spinach is an okay munch for your dragon as it has good calcium: phosphorous ratio.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, spinach has high oxalates that will prevent the absorption of calcium and this may trigger metabolic bone disease in the beardie.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Could be you have come across lizards in a pond, river, sea, ocean, or stagnant water at your home and wonder how they move about. How do they cross water bodies? So,</p>
<ul>
<li>can lizard Swim?�*
**The direct answer is, YES! Lizards can swim in water bodies including rivers, seas, oceans, or pods. These reptiles use their tail to propel themselves forward when swimming plus use front limbs for vertical movement. **
<strong>Some lizards like Gecko can even walk on water. Lizard, they&rsquo;re vertebrates, such as Marine Iguanas can swim in deep seas or oceans down to the floor in search of food while holding their breath for 45 minutes.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-can-lizards-swim-can-they-drown-movement">Details: Can Lizards Swim? Can they Drown? Movement</h2>
<p>Lizards can swim. The swimming capability varies from one species to another and is determined by body size, shape and length of the tail. Some lizard species such as Gecko and skinks can walk or run on the water bodies.
Marine Iguana lizards are known to swim in deep waters and can hold its breath for over 45 minutes while feeding on its prey at the floor of sea or ocean. Lizard such as sandfish or
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/science/21obsand.html">saharan lizard</a>
can swim even on sand instead of walking.</p>
<h3 id="1-mechanisms-used-by-lizards-to-swim">1. Mechanisms used by Lizards to Swim.</h3>
<p>Before getting into the water bodies, lizards take in a deep breath, which will sustain them while under the water. Then, the lizards walk into the water where they float since their large bellies offer suitable swimming buoyancy.</p>
<p>The Lizard, then, swings its tail sideways to propel it forward  tail is the main organ that is used mostly by lizard when swimming. The sideways movement of lizards tail is carried out intermittently and slowly unless the lizard detects danger (it flips tail fast to accelerate its escape motion).</p>
<p>Lizards use their legs to maintain themselves in a horizontal position. The front limbs will also be useful when lizards are changing their direction as they act as steering.</p>
<p>To dive downwards, the lizard pitches its head at a downward angle and locks the hind legs close to its body. Then, it uses its tail to propel itself downward. During the movement, the lizard holds its breath.</p>
<p>The Lizard is able to move vertically upward while using the font legs/limbs, which acts as flippers. The dorsal protrusion found at the back of the lizards help them from rolling sideways while swimming. They also acts as breakers for the sea/ocean current which may alter lizards movement.</p>
<p>The Iguana, Bearded dragon, Komodo dragon and Asian water monitor lizards are known to swim deep in the sea or ocean waters in search of food.�Once the lizard gets its tail detached, it may not be possible to swim well and may get drowned in most cases.</p>

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-bones/">Do Lizards Have Bones?</a></p>
<h3 id="2-distance-that-lizard-can-swim">2. Distance that Lizard can swim.</h3>
<p>Medium size Lizards can swim on the surface of water for 1 to 16 feet nonstop. They can also dive down up to 2 to 8 feet in search of prey.</p>
<p>Large Lizards such as Iguanas, Bearded dragon, Asian water monitor and Komodo dragon can swim more than 16 feet. In fact, Komodo lizard is known to swim 13 kilometers per hour. The Iguanas, Bearded Dragon and Komodo dragons are known to swim from one Island to another.</p>
<p>Most Lizard species prefer swimming on the surface since they are able to shoot their head up to blow and take in fresh air. The lizards tend to swim along the shoreline and wont get far into the sea or ocean lest they drown out of insufficient air since they cant breathe under water.</p>
<p>Marine Iguanas are able to swim down to ocean beds/floors in search of food. In addition, the marine Iguanas are well adapted to salty waters  they often blow off to remove salts from nasal cavities.</p>
<h3 id="3-challenges-faced-by-lizards-while-swimming">3. Challenges faced by Lizards while swimming.</h3>
<p>Drowning is major problem that face lizards while swimming. Though they can hold their breath longer (1 to 48 minutes) than other animals (human beings, birds), lizards get drowned when the air withheld replenishes.</p>
<p>Lizards that are used to flesh waters such as Nile monitor lizards will easily drown in case they find themselves in large water mass such as Mediterranean Sea.�Salty water environment makes the breathing activity of lizards difficult.</p>
<p>The salt particles block the nasal cavities and lizards breathing system causing them to drown or get fatigued faster. Though some lizards such as Marine Iguanas, Bearded Dragon and Komodo Dragons are adapted to swimming deep in salty sea and ocean waters.</p>
<p>However, most species of flesh water lizards are unable to fit in those environments.�Small size lizards are easily carried by sea and ocean current. They lack efficient braking mechanism and may be taken far into the water bodies where they get drowned.</p>
<p>Lizards that prefer to walk on water (gecko) are easily swept away by the water waves and eventually get drowned or fed by the prey.</p>
<h2 id="4-adaptation-of-lizards-to-swimming">4. Adaptation of Lizards to swimming.</h2>
<p>The following are adaptation of lizards to swimming. Lizards have web skin between their toes, which help them to float easily while swimming.</p>
<ol>
<li>The belly of lizard is flat and wide  this makes it float easily on water and thus increasing buoyancy while swimming.</li>
<li>Lizards have long tail, which help in forward propulsion.</li>
<li>The front limbs of lizards have wide and flat-bottomed toes, which help navigation.</li>
<li>The dorsal/back of the lizards protrude upwards slightly from the head to tail. This prevent lizards from rolling due to water current  acts as side breaks.</li>
<li>The lower part of the mouth of the lizards is large and act as reservoir for air when they are under the water.

</ol>
<h2 id="can-baby-lizard-swim">Can Baby Lizard Swim?</h2>
<p>Baby lizard can swim. Once hatched, the baby lizards have similar features as the adult lizards  only that they are not fully grown and adapted to full functionality.</p>
<p>The baby lizards swim in shallow water where heavy currents cannot drift them away. Their tail and dorsal protrusions are not fully developed to swimming and thus can easily be drowned.</p>
<p>The adult lizards help the baby lizards on how to swim by carrying them slight on their back. The Young lizard will then develop the art of flipping the legs and swaying of the tail slowly to being an expert with time.</p>
<p>Normally, a baby lizard can swim for 1 to 7 minutes before getting exhausted. It can move a distance of 1 to 10 feet on the surface. The baby lizards rarely swim under the water since they have not developed fully the art of withholding air while swimming.</p>
<p>Most of baby lizards that swim under water usually get drowned. In case you want to train your baby lizard pet on how to swim, you must ensure that you provide an underneath water protection.</p>
<p>You can make it step on a mesh table, which can allow water to pass and then tag it along as the baby lizard swim. This will make it easier to rescue your baby lizard pet in case it tend to drown.</p>
<p>You can also train your baby lizard to swim by holding it at chest region over the water and releasing it intermittently to make it swim. You can do so this at home using the basin water or the slow-running stream.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-can-lizard-hold-breathe-under-water"><strong>How Long Can Lizard Hold Breathe Under Water?</strong></h2>
<p>Normally, lizards do not breathe under water. They hold their breath while swimming under water. Small and medium size lizards such as Gecko and Skinks can hold their breath up to 16 minutes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, large lizards such as Iguanas, Asian Water monitor and Komodo dragon can hold breath for 30 to 50 minutes.</p>
<p>Marine Iguanas and Bearded dragon lizards can feed while holding breath under water. Lizards are able to swim back to the surface of water to take breath intermittently. This helps them to continue swimming without retreating to the shores.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-can-lizard-swim"><strong>How Long Can Lizard Swim?</strong></h2>
<p>Lizards can swim for 1 to 30 minutes nonstop. Most of the medium and small lizards swim in shallow waters and often retreat to the shores to bask and take extra breath.</p>
<p>Large lizards such as Tree crocodile Monitor can swim for 30 to 60 minutes continuously. In fact, Marine Iguanas swim very fast and is able to cover 13kilometers without stopping in 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Lizards are able to swim longer while on the water surface than when under water since they can shoot their head often to blow and take more air.</p>

<h2 id="can-lizards-walk-on-water"><strong>Can Lizards Walk On Water?�</strong></h2>
<p>Yes! Lizards such as Gecko and skinks tend to walk on water that swim. These lizards love shallow waters. Though they have long tails, they rarely use them to swim. Instead, they walk on the water surface by flipping their partially webbed limbs.</p>
<p>In Central America, the lizard called Jesus Christ lizard is known to literally walk on the water. This species has its body and legs adapted to maintain the lizard on the water body. It walks mostly against the water current to prevent it from being carried away.</p>
<p>At times, small lizards would run over the water. Gecko lizards are experts when it comes to running over the water bodies. They raise their tail slightly to acquire full momentum.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lizards can swim. They use their tail to propel them forward while on the surface or in deep water.</p>
<p>The partially webbed toes of the lizards help them in flapping and navigation while their flat-bottomed berry help in maintaining high buoyance of the lizard when swimming.</p>
<p>Some lizards such as gecko can walk and run on water. Baby lizards can swim though they may not be as excellent as the adult ones.</p>

Can your lizard and cat pet live together? It is interesting to find how cats go along with lizards in your place? So, do cats eat lizards?
<em>The direct answer is YES! Cats will eat lizards. Cats are great lizard predators. They will hunt, kill and eat lizard either by cutting it into pieces or swallow it whole (for the small sized cats).�</em>
<em>Cats prefer eating smaller lizards such as geckos, skins and Savannah�lizards. However, depending on the species, cats may not be safe after eating lizards. Some species such as salamanders and juvenile blue-tailed skinks secrets poison in their skin, which may kill your cat if eaten.�</em>

<h2 id="details-do-cats-eat-lizards">Details: Do Cats Eat Lizards?</h2>
<h3 id="1-how-do-cat-eat-lizards">1. How Do Cat Eat Lizards</h3>
<p>Cats normally hunt and kill the lizards before eating them. The cat will cut (using its teeth-canines) lizard into parts for easier swallowing. Also, the cat can tear the soft flesh from the body meat of the lizard. Main parts of lizards that are usually fed on by the cats include the body meat, limbs and the tail. When feeding on the lizards, cats do not remove lizards skin (which is infectious in some lizard species).
Most cats do not eat the Head of lizard unless when they swallow lizard whole (which is a rare case). Small cats dont eat the lizards bones. You will, probably, find bones leftovers where the cat was feeding.
Cats dont hunt lizards as a group unless when training their kitten. You are not likely to spot cats feeding since they hide mostly.�After killing the lizard, cat begins by eating the tail since its soft, fatty and its caudal bones can be chewed together with meat easily.</p>
<h3 id="2-which-lizards-do-cats-eat-most">2. Which Lizards Do Cats Eat Most?</h3>
<p>Your pet cat may not be selective when hunting lizards for food. However, most cats have been found to hunt more some of the following lizard species:</p>
<ol>
<li>**House lizards (Gecko).**These lizards are readily available at many homes and are safer when eaten by cats (not toxic/poisonous, contains no venom).</li>
<li>Moreover, geckos do not run faster when escaping in case of danger and their defense mechanism against cats is weak (mild bite and hiding) as compare to other lizards such as Tree crocodile monitor, which attack its predators.</li>
<li>**The savannah Lizards.**These lizards are small in size and are found in subtropical climate. Your pet cat will mainly go hunting them in the fields. Savannah lizards are quick to catch since they do not run fast.</li>
<li><strong>Nile water monitors</strong>. These love water bodies in rivers and pods around your home or region. Cats hunt them even though they get wild during capture. These lizards are safe and non-venomous.

</ol>
<h3 id="3-which-lizards-are-poisonous-to-cats">3. Which Lizards Are Poisonous To Cats?</h3>
<p>The following lizards are poisonous to your pet cat when eaten.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Mexican Bearded</strong>These lizards are found in Southern United states and are highly venomous. The roots or Mexican Bearded lizards have venom glands that releases poison every time it bites your cat. The poison lowers the blood pressure of the cat and prevent blood clotting. Moreover, the cat face walking challenges, breathing, have frequent pooping and urination and generates inability to meow after eating Mexican bearded lizards.</li>
<li>**Gila Monitor lizard.**This lizard is known attack and bite cats in defense. Its poison is severe than that of Mexican Bearded lizard and its poisonous teeth paralyzes the cat on injection. Their skin also house bacteria that causes severe infection on your cat.</li>
<li>**Komodo dragon.**This lizard is able to attack and kill cats on approach immediately. It has poisonous glands that release killing venom on biting. Cats bitten by die in minutes. Most cats fear hunting the Komodo dragon. In fact, Komodo dragon is known to kill human beings.</li>
<li>**Juvenile blue-tailed skinks.**The skinks secrets poison in their skin, which kills the cat when eaten. Cats are highly attracted to blue tailed skinks and often prey on them. The skinks dont run fast in case of attack (they are easily caught by cats).</li>
<li>They have poisonous skin (skin produces poison) which kill cats when eaten. Salamanders have smooth soft skins and are usually swallowed whole by cats. Salamander dont escape faster and thus are easily caught by cats (predators).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-it-safe-for-cats-to-eat-lizards-what-are-the-dangers">Is it safe for cats to eat lizards? What are the Dangers?</h2>
<p>Most lizards are not toxic to cats when eaten (they are therefore safe). The body meat of lizard do not contain any poison that may affect the health of your cat. However, some lizards such as Komodo dragon and Gila Monitors have poisonous gland at their tooths root, which inject venom to its prey (cat) on attack thus paralyzing or killing it.
Though the lizards meat may not be poisonous, it may post the following dangers when eaten:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Get Liver Flukes. **Lizards such as skinks, savannah and geckos have liver flukes in their elementary tracks. These flukes do not affect these lizards. However, when your pet cat eats lizards, the liver flukes are transferred into the cats digestive canal from where they move up the liver to the gall bladder.</li>
<li>The liver flukes cause liver inflammations and block the bile duct of your cat leading to death.<em>Some symptoms of liver flukes</em>in your pet cat include yellow eyes and skin, vomiting, diarrhea, Lethargy, loss of appetite and swelling of abdomen.</li>
<li>**Acquire Salmonella Bacteria. **The skin of house lizard (gecko), skinks and bearded lizard house bacteria such as Salmonella. The salmonella bacteria may not cause sickness on a healthy cat. However, when the cat fall sick, the bacteria will accelerate the illness.</li>
<li>**Skin Infections.**The under skin of skins, Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, house lizards etc. have pathogens which cause severe skin infections on your pet cats.

<h2 id="how-do-lizards-protect-themselves-from-cats">How Do Lizards Protect Themselves From Cats?</h2>
<p>Lizards have various mechanisms of protecting them from their predator. These ways include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Running Away.**Most small sized lizards such as Gecko, skinks and savannah lizards run away in case of the attacks. However, they may not run very fast, but their swift enables them to reach their hideouts safely.</li>
<li>Inflate their Bodies. Lizards such as Thorny devil and Horned toad lizard inflates their bodies to appear big so as to scare away their predators. Bearded dragon is able to puff their throat out making them bigger thus scaring their predators.</li>
<li>**Autotomy.**This an act where the lizard is able to carry out self-amputation of tail. Lizards such as leopard geckos and house lizards are able to cut off its tail in case of danger. The cut tail is used as a bait or a mechanism that stops the predators (scare/confuse) from following them further.</li>
<li>** Fighting. **Monitor lizards such as Tree Crocodile monitor and Gila monitors are famous of fighting against their assailants. The Komodo dragon and Green Iguana use their tail to knock down their enemies.</li>
<li>**Using venom/biting.**Venomous lizards such as Komodo dragon, Gila monitors, Mexican Bearded lizards and the Tree Crocodile have venom in their teeth roots, which paralyses their prey on biting.</li>
<li>**Camouflaging.**Lizards such as chameleons are able to change color to match their hideouts. Small lizards are brown, grey or black colored, which camouflage well with their environment such as back or trees, rocks or sand. Some lizards such as bearded lizards and Gila monitors camouflage to send a warning signal to their predators.</li>
<li>**Hissing.**Frilled dragon opens its frills and produces a hissing sound, which frightens the predator and also makes it look more dangerous.</li>
<li>Squirting blood from their eyes. Pygmy short horned lizards squirts their blood from their eyes when they spot a predator. This make their eyes to enlarge thus scaring away their predators.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-do-i-know-my-cat-has-eaten-a-lizard-symptoms">How do I know my Cat has eaten a Lizard? Symptoms?</h2>

<li>Seizures or muscle tremors.</li>
<li>Abnormal/erratic movements.</li>
<li>Coma in some cases.</li>
<li>Mouth foaming and excessive drooling.
*NB: These symptoms are as a results or eating poisonous lizards. *
In case the lizards eaten has a pathogenic skin or has Salmonella bacteria, your pet cat will show the following symptoms:</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes.</li>
<li>Loss of appetite.</li>
<li>Sudden shock.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below I answer this question - do geckos eat bed bugs or what can you use to exterminate the bugs. So, will lizards help exterminate the bed bugs?
<em>In summary, do lizards eat bed bugs? Yes, lizards (particularly geckos or house lizards) will kill bed bugs - but won&rsquo;t be an effective pest control remedy.�</em>
<em>However, Bed bugs are fast reproducers and hence lizards won&rsquo;t keep up to feed on the bugs with their quick multiplication just�like with other house pests.�</em>

<h2 id="details-do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs">Details: Do Geckos Eat Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>Some Lizards like the <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-roaches/">Gecko</a> will <a href="/posts/do-cats-eat-lizards/">eat</a> bugs including bed bugs - great bed bugs extermination. The pest extermination methods to use on bed bugs will reduce the sucking of human blood.
Bed bugs (Cimex hemipterus or Cimex lectularius) will invade your clothing and mattresses - these will cause bites. You may result in skin-related issues, blisters, and rashes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bed bugs have an average body length of about 1 to 7 mm - and hence they&rsquo;re visible - they&rsquo;ll also jump onto household items, pets, and clothing.</li>
<li>If there bed bugs (pests) around your house - maintain great hygiene - including in the urban area.
But can multiple lizards exterminate the bed bugs? Well, yes, lizards and geckos will feed on lizards but may also leave mess and droppings.

<h2 id="any-dangers-feeding-bed-bugs-to-geckos">Any Dangers Feeding Bed Bugs to Geckos?</h2>
<p>For any lizards that are allowed to fend for themselves around your house, as a pest control measure, you won&rsquo;t experience any problems - but not when
adopted as a pet
.
Therefore, feeding the lizards with bed bugs (that are brought from elsewhere) may not be a great idea since bed bugs are known to hold organisms causing bacterial infections.</p>
<h2 id="issues-with-using-geckos-to-control-bed-bugs">Issues with Using Geckos to Control Bed Bugs</h2>
<p>So, if any homeowner considers employing geckos of house lizards to eat bed bugs, they must be prepared to control different issues related to that.</p>
<h3 id="1-gecko-feces">1. Gecko Feces</h3>
<p>Involving house geckos to control bed bugs will lead to different issues with undesirable effects including leaving feces on different surfaces.
The lizard droppings will be concealed in hard-to-find or dark places - near or around the kitchen cupboard that won&rsquo;t be moved regularly.
The feces may be hidden in areas that are hard to notice - and you&rsquo;ll notice this issue when you see flies swarming in some specific dark or partially hidden places.</p>
<h3 id="2-damaging-household-devices">2. Damaging household devices</h3>
<p>Further, the geckos may equally cause damage to your household devices including electronics.
This may cause losses in terms of malfunctioning devices - due to electrocuted lizards.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-pests-to-feed-to-your-geckos">Alternative Pests To feed to your Geckos?</h2>
<p>Some homeowners believe that any uninvited insect must be exterminated using chemical methods - but to control the
intruder
, you can use different creepy-crawlies.</p>
<h3 id="1-mosquitoes">1. Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>There are alternative pests that you may feed to your lizards - house lizards won&rsquo;t only feed on bed bugs but will also attack the small pests running around your house and
yard
.
Lizards are largely diurnal, and they won&rsquo;t eat numerous mosquitoes, but will opportunist capturing of the pests. But toads and frogs crepuscular &amp; nocturnal) eat more mosquitoes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLBtiyLAgAU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLBtiyLAgAU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
Lizards love mosquito diets - they&rsquo;ll simply stick out their sticky tongue and feed on the bugs. But lizards may not be welcome in homes that have small rodents,
cats
, and dogs.
Therefore, for houses that have pets, you&rsquo;ll require to acquire the services of some expert exterminators for the
control of the mosquitos
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, lizards (many amphibians) tend to be very creepy particularly in the house basement. Lizards may also bring diseases - they love damp and warm environments.
Therefore, to help control mosquitoes, you may avoid killing the lizards you notice around your home, pantry, or garden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-mice-and-rats">2. Mice and Rats</h3>
<p>Mice and rats will create a great food source for geckos in your spaces - even in the rented spaces - but they&rsquo;ll mainly eat the young ones and rat litter.
Geckos will efficiently predate on mice and rats - geckos mainly hide in dark areas - and they&rsquo;ll feed on the pinkies - young rats particularly while their mother rat is away.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqMRsTMiwI&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqMRsTMiwI&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
You&rsquo;ll find the lizards hanging around dark places - locations where you also get mice and rats and their younglings. Thus lizards get to snack on the pests and their�pinkies.</p>
<h3 id="2cockroaches">2.�Cockroaches</h3>
<p>So, will geckos feed on cockroaches? Well, yes geckos and house lizards will also eat roaches and their larva. But they occupy different places - roaches love places near the ground.
On the other hand, geckos occupy spaces that are higher above the ground - they love dark, damp, and equally cool places. But house lizards will occupy dark places - also loved by cockroaches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See Also:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-cockroaches/">Animals that Eat Cockroaches</a>
Centipedes will feed on house lizards - the bug&rsquo;s wriggly motion will attract lizards that snatch them fast. You&rsquo;ll get the centipedes around the house on wood beams and other wooden fixtures.
Lizards will also feed on termite swarmers that move in colonies - they have wings and hence will fly as swarmers.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="will-housegeckos-eat-bed-bugs-in-captivity">Will House<strong>Geckos Eat Bed Bugs in captivity?�</strong></h2>
<p>So, will house geckos feed on bed bugs while they&rsquo;re in captivity? Well, yes, geckos (even when in captivity) will munch different pests including bed bugs, cockroaches, silkworms, or waxworms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, while the geckos are in captivity you&rsquo;ll need to provide additional food and meal supplementation like vitamins.</li>
<li>But ensure to check the size of the pests and insects you&rsquo;re giving to the geckos to avoid choking - they must measure a maximum of the distance between the gecko&rsquo;s eyes.
In addition, live crickets must not be allowed into the
gecko&rsquo;s enclosure space
since they actually nibble and bite on your humble pests.
On gecko thirst for water, mist water in the pest&rsquo;s enclosure. So, don&rsquo;t pour water simply into some dish since the geckos will quench from water droplets on leaves and tree branches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the question &ldquo;do geckos eat bed bugs&rdquo;, Yes, geckos will feed on bed bugs but they may also bring salmonella and also leave damaged devices and drop feces.</p>

      <description>Lizards are fascinating creatures, and their diverse dietary preferences reflect their adaptability to different environments.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lizards are fascinating creatures, and their diverse dietary preferences reflect their adaptability to different environments.</p>
<p>The question of whether lizards eat snails can be answered with a resounding &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; though the specifics of this feeding behavior depend on various factors, including the species of
<a href="https://ucanr.edu/sites/MarinMG/files/116745.pdf">lizards</a>
, their natural habitat, and the availability of other food sources.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the dietary habits of lizards, their relationship with snails as prey, and the broader ecological role both animals play.</p>
<h2 id="lizards-and-their-dietary-preferences">Lizards and Their Dietary Preferences</h2>
<p>Lizards belong to a diverse group of reptiles, encompassing over 6,000 species worldwide. Depending on their species, they can be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.</p>
<p>Most lizards that prey on snails are typically insectivores or carnivores, feeding on a variety of small animals, including insects, worms, spiders, and, in some cases, snails.�Certain lizards have a specialized diet that includes specific prey, while others are opportunistic feeders that consume whatever is readily available.</p>
<p>In the wild, food scarcity often pushes lizards to diversify their diet, including feeding on snails, particularly when they are abundant. This is especially true in environments where snails are easy to catch and offer a good source of nutrition.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-lizards-eat-snails">Why Do Lizards Eat Snails?</h2>
<p>Snails provide an excellent source of protein and other essential nutrients for lizards. Their soft bodies, though protected by a hard shell, are rich in energy, making them an attractive food option for many <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> species.</p>
<p>Moreover, snails are relatively easy to catch because of their slow movement, and lizards can easily overpower them.�The availability of snails often depends on environmental factors, such as moisture and temperature.</p>
<p>Snails tend to thrive in humid conditions, which makes them abundant in environments like forests, gardens, and wetlands. Lizards living in these habitats may naturally encounter snails more frequently and incorporate them into their diet.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-lizards-that-eat-snails">Types of Lizards That Eat Snails</h2>
<p>While not all lizard species eat snails, several species and
baby lizards
are known to do so, particularly those that dwell in areas where snails are abundant. Lets explore some of the lizards that are likely to include snails in their diet.
<strong>1. Skinks:</strong>
Skinks are one of the most well-known groups of lizards that frequently feed on snails. These small, smooth-scaled reptiles are found in various habitats, from deserts to forests. Skinks are generally insectivorous but will not hesitate to eat snails when available. Their strong jaws help them crush the snails shell, allowing them access to the soft body inside.
<strong>2. Anoles:</strong>
Anoles are another group of lizards that might occasionally eat snails. Native to the southeastern United States, Caribbean, and parts of South America, anoles are small, agile lizards that primarily feed on insects. However, larger anole species, such as the Cuban brown anole, may also eat snails if they are easy to catch.
<strong>3. Geckos:</strong>
Geckos, particularly larger species, may also eat snails. These nocturnal lizards, known for their ability to climb vertical surfaces, typically feed on insects, but they are opportunistic feeders. If snails are readily available in their habitat, geckos may include them in their diet.
<strong>4. Monitor Lizards:</strong>
Large lizards, such as monitor lizards, are known to eat a variety of prey, including snails. Monitors are powerful carnivores that can hunt larger animals, but they are also skilled at scavenging and foraging for smaller prey. Snails, though a small meal for these large reptiles, can be a convenient source of nutrition in environments where food is scarce.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-lizards-eat-snails">How Do Lizards Eat Snails?</h2>
<p>The act of eating snails requires some specific adaptations, particularly when it comes to dealing with the snails protective shell. Many lizards that eat snails have strong, sharp teeth or jaws that allow them to break through the shell to reach the soft flesh inside.</p>
<p>For instance, skinks are known for their ability to crush snail shells with their strong jaws. Once the shell is broken, the lizard consumes the snails body, leaving the broken shell behind. In some cases, lizards may even swallow smaller snails whole, shell and all, allowing their stomach acids to break down the calcium-rich shell.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-impact-of-lizards-eating-snails">Ecological Impact of Lizards Eating Snails</h2>
<p>Lizards play an important role in the ecosystem by regulating populations of smaller animals, including snails. By consuming snails, lizards help control snail populations, which can be beneficial in both natural and agricultural environments.</p>
<p>In gardens and farms, for instance, snails are often considered pests because they feed on a variety of plants, causing
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">venomous</a>
to crops and ornamental vegetation. Lizards that feed on snails can act as a natural form of pest control, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>This predator-prey relationship helps maintain ecological balance and prevents any one species from becoming too dominant.�Additionally, the consumption of snails by lizards contributes to the nutrient cycle in ecosystems.</p>
<p>By feeding on snails, lizards facilitate the transfer of energy and nutrients up the food chain. The calcium in snail shells, for instance, is a valuable nutrient for lizards, helping them maintain healthy bones and eggshells during reproduction.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, lizards do eat snails, though the frequency with which they do so depends on factors such as species, habitat, and availability of other prey. Snails provide a rich source of protein and nutrients for lizards, making them a valuable food item in certain environments.</p>
<p>Lizards that are capable of overcoming the protective snail shell, such as skinks, geckos, and anoles, often include snails as part of their diet.�The consumption of snails by lizards is not only beneficial for the reptiles themselves but also has broader ecological implications.</p>
<p>By controlling snail populations, lizards contribute to the balance of ecosystems and help reduce the impact of snails on plants and crops. This predator-prey dynamic exemplifies the interconnectedness of species within an ecosystem and highlights the important role that lizards play in maintaining biodiversity.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably you have come across various species of lizards in your home, compound, fields, yards, or zoo and wonder if they have bones. How then are their body muscles supported?��So,
<em>do lizards have bones?�</em>
<strong>The direct answer is, YES, all **
lizards are vertebrates
** that have bones that are interconnected together to help them in locomotion.�</strong>
<strong>The bones of lizards are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton. These bones offer support, protection of internal organs, and options for attachment of body muscles and cells. The number of each bone varies according to size and species of lizard.�</strong>

<h2 id="details-do-lizards-have-bones">Details: Do Lizards Have Bones?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860302/">Lizards, like other reptiles, have bones</a>
. Their bones are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton. The appendicular skeleton consists of the pelvic girdle, the pectoral, the limbs, and the bones of the front and hind legs.</p>
<p>The axial skeleton form the central axis of the lizards body. It comprises the skull, the dorsal/thoracic cage and the vertebral column.</p>
<p>The two skeleton structures are interconnected and plays a great role in protecting the inners body organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and intestines as well as the spinal cord (vital). Moreover, they provide suitable support of the body and enhances easier locomotion.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-functions-of-bones-in-lizards">What are the functions of Bones in Lizards?</h2>
<p>The following are main functions of bones in lizards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protecting the spinal cord - the vertebral column bones.</li>
<li>Protecting the brains and cerebral system - the skull.</li>
<li>Protecting providing option for attachment of internal organs such as digestive organs, heart, kidney, liver and lungs (ribs).</li>
<li>Provides option for attachment of the body muscles  axial skeleton, pelvic and pectoral girdle.</li>
<li>Help in locomotion/movement  the appendicular skeleton  femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, scapula, metacarpals, and metatarsals.</li>
<li>For grasping and grinding over the surface  the phalanges, metatarsals and metacarpals - including<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">lizard teeth</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-many-bones-does-a-lizard-have">How Many Bones Does a Lizard Have?</h2>
<p>Lizard species have different varying number of bones due to their difference in sizes. However, the skeleton of lizard has 28 specialized bones, which work collective to offer protection and locomotion effectively.</p>
<p>These bones include the vertebral column (caudal, sacral, lumbar, thoracic/dorsal and cervical vertebrae), the sternum, the scapula, the tarsals, metatarsal, carpal, metacarpal, tibia, fibula, ulna, radius, ribs, mandibles, maxilla and the phalanges.</p>
<p>Most lizards have 100 to 300 bones while large lizards such as Tree crocodile may have more. On the other hand, small lizards such as gecko may have less than 100 bones.</p>
<h2 id="do-lizards-have-bones-in-their-tails">Do Lizards Have Bones in Their Tails?</h2>
<p>Yes! Lizards have bones in their tail. The tail which is formed from the caudal vertebrae contain bones, ligaments, nerves, vasculature and tail muscles which gives it the tail power.</p>
<p>The tail of most lizards get detached easily when held. The Fracture of the tail vertebrae usually occurs at the fracture plane leaving behind flesh tail tissue to heal.</p>
<p>The cut tail is not easily returned in lizards  thus most of lizard species wont grow their tail back (remain tailless) - check
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5484412/">lizard tail bones regeneration</a>
.</p>
<p>Though a few lizard species show lateral growth of detached tail, the tail may not be as functional as the original tail. The First 3 bones in the lizard caudal vertebrae are fused to give it tail power. In case the tail detachment occurs past these three bones, there is normally no regrowth that can occur in most cases.</p>
<p>Lizards lack the tail autotomy and cannot be treated once their cut tail. Ensure you hold your pet lizard from below at the chest region (not lifting it by the tail).</p>
<h3 id="a-appendicular-skeleton">a. Appendicular Skeleton.</h3>
<p>The appendicular skeleton in lizards comprises of the bones that form the front and the hind legs plus the pelvic girdle and pectoral girdle from which the limbs are attached to the axial skeleton. These bones collectively coordinate the lizards movement.
<strong>1. Pectoral girdle.</strong>
This consist of two main bones, that is, the scapula and the collarbone also called clavicle. The clavicle is s-shaped <a href="/posts/do-spiders-have-bones/">bone</a>, which articulates with the sternum at the front chest of the lizard. The clavicle also joins the scapula at the end of lizards shoulder.</p>
<p>Its main function is to support the scapula. Lizards have two collarbones  each jointed at the sternum and scapula.�Scapula is a bone that articulates with humerus and aid in the shoulder movement of lizard.</p>
<p>Scapula has a wide v-shaped surface area that offers an option for attachment of the neck and back muscles that coordinates the movement of joints. Lizards have two scapula  one for each front leg/limb.
<strong>2. Front Legs.</strong>
Lizards have two front legs. Each leg has similar and equal number of bones as the other. Humerus (limb) joins scapula at the shoulder articulation point.</p>
<p>Then, the two leg bones (ulna and radius) join humerus at the sigmoid notch. At the end of ulna and radius lay carpal bones, which allow rotary movement of the arm.</p>
<p>The Carpals extent to form the metacarpal bones (bones at the palm of the arm) and phalanx bones (the bones that allows the folding of the arm). The phalanges are jointed to help the lizards when grasping the prey.</p>
<p>The bones at the front legs of lizards function to coordinate in the locomotion and grasping the prey. In addition, they provide option for attachment of front leg muscles.
<strong>3. Pelvic girdle.</strong>
The Pelvic girdle has three bones that provide an option for the attachment of the lizards hind legs. The three bones are the pubis (front), ischium (back) and ilium (wing). The pelvic girdle also provides the surface for attachment of back muscles.</p>
<p>Most lizard species have their pelvic girdle fused and linked to the axial skeleton at the caudal vertebrae except in large lizards such as Komodo Dragon and Tree Crocodile Monitor and
bearded dragons� do they eat tomatoes?
.</p>
<p>In small lizards, the femur is connected directly to the axial skeleton through the ball and socket joint at the sacral vertebrae.
<strong>4. Hind legs.</strong>
Lizards have two hind legs. Each leg has equal number and similar bone type as the other. The Hind leg is joined to pelvic girdle at caudal vertebrae using the femur  which has the ball shaped end to allow the notch rotary motion.</p>
<p>At the end of femur, there is a patella bone, which helps form the knee joint. The leg is extended using two bones called tibia (larger) and fibular (smaller). These two bones function to support the weight of lizards and offer
<a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/18/3013">option for attachment of leg muscles</a>
.</p>
<p>At the end of tibia and fibula lay tarsal bones that allows two-way motion of the arm. These bones are connected to metatarsal bones (metatarsals are elongated bones and forms base of lizards foot). At the end of metatarsals are phalanx bones. The phalanges are jointed and form the toes, which help in grasping on the ground, trees or rocks when walking.</p>
<h3 id="b-axial-skeleton">b. Axial Skeleton.</h3>
<p>The axial skeleton comprises of the skull, the dorsal/thoracic cage and the vertebral column. Axial skeleton forms the central axis of the lizards. The major function of axial skeleton is to offer point for the attachment of the appendicular skeleton and protect the spinal cord (spinal cord is responsible for nervous system coordination).
<strong>1. The skull.</strong>
Skull is a bony structure, which forms the head. The lizards skull is divided into several bones, which include the facial bones, the cranial bones, the hyoid bone and auditory ossicles.</p>
<p>The skull also contain the lower jaw (mandible - the only movable bone) and maxillae. The meninges (head hard skin and muscles) grow and merge with the lizards body skin.</p>
<p>Major functions of the skull is to protect the brain  which is be most sensitive part of the body coordination system.
<strong>2. Cervical Vertebrae</strong>
The cervical vertebrae consist of vertebra found at the lizards neck region. The first two cervical vertebra (atlas and axis) are specialized to help the nodding of head (atlas) and rotary motion of the head (axis).</p>
<p>Other vertebra are fused making the neck region of lizard stiff while some advance to form thoracic vertebrae. The cervical vertebrae also offer option for attachment of neck muscles.
<strong>3. Thoracic/dorsal vertebrae.</strong>
The dorsal vertebrae, also called thoracic vertebrae, is found at the chest region of the lizards. The vertebra provides option for the attachment of the ribs (ribs protects internal organs such as lungs, heart and livers from external damage).</p>
<p>The end of each rid is attached to sternum (breastbone) that is located at the front chest region. The number of ribs and vertebra varies from one lizard species to another. Large lizards like Tree Crocodile monitor and Komodo Drago have 15 to 24 vertebra, the medium sized lizard lizards have 10 to 16 dorsal vertebra while small lizards such as savannah and chameleon lizards have 7 to 11 thoracic vertebrae.</p>
<p>Each dorsal vertebra is connected to two ribs (one on either side).� The dorsal vertebral provides option for the attachment of the back muscles.</p>
<p>Related:
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">Are Lizards Poisonous?</a>
<strong>4. Lumbar Vertebrae.</strong>
Most lizard species do not have lumbar vertebrae apart from the large lizards such as Komodo dragon and Asian water monitor lizards. The lumbar vertebra do not have the ribs attached. This region is where the stomach lay and provides option for the lizards to coil effectively during attacks.
<strong>5. Sacral Vertebrae.</strong>
The sacral vertebrae are found at the sacral section (sacrum). The pelvic girdle is jointed with the sacral vertebrae and offers large surface area for attachment of back muscles. The Lizards have 1 to 7 sacral vertebra. However, larger species can have 3 to 5 more vertebra.</p>
<p>Small and middle-sized lizards such as Nike water lizards, savannah lards and house lizards have their sacral vertebra fused to form caudal vertebrae.
<strong>6. Caudal Vertebrae.</strong>
The caudal vertebrae, also called tail vertebrae, is what forms the tail of the lizards. Caudal vertebrae has bones that decrease in size up to the last one. Each vertebra has two short protruding ribs that provide surface for attachment of tail muscles.</p>
<p>The caudal vertebra has short spines and arches. Long-tailed lizards such as Basilisk, chameleon lizards and skinks have 10 to 32 caudal vertebrae while small-tailed lizards have 1 to 10 caudal vertebrae.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>All Lizard species have bones that are collectively linked to aid them in protection and locomotion. The bones are classified under either appendicular skeleton or axial skeleton.</p>
<p>Main functions of the bones include support, protection of internal organs and offer options for attachment of body muscles. �The total number of bones vary according to size and species of lizard. Lizards have an average of 28 specialized bones.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably youve seen a <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> running around your house or yard. So, youre wondering whether these reptiles can bite you, other humans, in your residence, or even pets.</p>
<p>Further, how do these lizards even feed  with or without teeth? So, do lizards have teeth?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The short answer is, YES! Lizards have teeth that are well adapted to the type of food they eat. The dentition of lizards varies from one species to another within the taxonomic family where some have pleurodont teeth formation while others have acrodont teeth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The shape of their teeth is either conical, pointed, or serrated to help them grip the prey and push it into the digestive tract. Lizards do not have alveoli or tooth sockets in their dentition. Some lizard species have venom ducts connected to their tooth roots to help paralyzed their prey.�</strong>

<h2 id="do-lizards-have-teeth---reptile-dentition">Do Lizards Have Teeth? - Reptile Dentition</h2>
<p>Lizards have teeth that are well adapted to the type of food they eat. Lizards,
<strong>unlike mammals which have several types of teeth</strong>
, have all their teeth similar (one type) except a few species.</p>
<p>Normally, lizards do not have teeth sockets or alveoli. Their teeth are either acrodont or pleurodont.
<strong>1. Acrodont teeth classification.</strong>
In this classification, the teeth are superficially fused to the tooth-bearing bone usually at the biting edges of the maxilla and mandibles.</p>
<p>Particularly, this fusion should be handled with care (by lizard owners) since acrodont dentition is not replaceable on removal. However, only young lizards can have their acrodont teeth replaced.</p>
<p>The acrodont teeth are weak and easily lost. With wear and tear resulting from biting, their jawbones are left exposed or sometimes bleeding due to abrasive action.</p>
<p>Lizards possessing the acrodont type of teeth include Agamid lizards like water dragons, bearded dragons, and chameleons. �Acrodont class is highly susceptible to diseases such as periodontal.
<strong>2. Pleurodont teeth classification.</strong>
This is the main type of dentition that is found in most lizards. The teeth are attached to the interior side of the jawbone creating a wider surface that offers strong fusion as compared to the acrodont type.</p>
<p>The teeth are often replaced in the lifetime of lizards while others may be swallowed with the prey during feeding. Some lizards may grow numerous teeth in their palate.</p>
<p>The front acrodont teeth are shed off and replaced often since they are frequently involved in grasping, biting, and holding the prey when feeding as compared to the posterior teeth.</p>
<p>The sharpness and shape of the pleurodont class lizards vary from species to species. The majority of lizards have short, sharp-pointed, and conical-shaped pleurodont teeth.</p>
<p>Some lizards like Kamodo Dragons have curved and serrated teeth that can cut hard flesh causing serious breeding on biting.</p>
<p>Molluscivores such as Nile Monitor and Caiman Lizard have teeth that are flat, blunt, and rounded. These teeth also have crowns, at the back of the jaw, adapted to the crushing of crustaceans such as clams and snails.</p>
<p>Venomous lizards, also known as heloderma, have a large longitudinal fold or groove in the interior part of each lower jaw tooth that helps in storing venom used to paralyze the prey.</p>
<p>Lizards that are herbivores such as iguana have wide and flat teeth crown with serrated sides adapted to plant feeding.
<strong>The pleurodont class</strong>
of lizard teeth is mainly found in monitor lizards, iguanas, anoles, basilisks, and chuckwallas.
<strong>3. Thecodont teeth classification.</strong>
This type of teeth is mainly found in other reptiles such as snakes, crocodiles,s and all mammals. Importantly, the thecodont teeth are easily confused with the pleurodont and acrodont types in reptiles - you must therefore be keen.</p>
<p>However, the thecodont type of teeth is characterized by well-established, deep bony sockets which hold into place teeth that are replaceable in a given order and cycle according to the individual animal species.</p>
<p>Thecodont is firmly adapted for strong grasping without being shed off.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-teeth-do-lizards-have">How Many Teeth Do Lizards Have?</h2>
<p>Different species of lizards have a varying number of teeth from the young stage to adulthood. These lizard species include:</p>
<ol>
<li>This type usually has an average of 20 to 30 teeth in each quadrant. At maturity, iguana would have a total of 80 to 120 teeth.</li>
<li>**Nile Monitor.**Its teeth are classified into: premaxillary teeth are 9, each maxilla has 10 to 11 teeth and each dentary has 11 to 12 teeth that are well adapted to crushing and grinding food.</li>
<li>**Kamodo Dragon. **It has approximately 60 teeth protruding one inch from the jawbone. The teeth are sharp-pointed and cause serious harm on a single bite.</li>
<li>Apart from few exceptions, an average Gecko has approximately 50 to 100 teeth. However, a leaf-tailed Gecko has 300 or more teeth  the largest number of teeth ever found in lizards.</li>
<li>The number of teeth found in skinks is not defined in various species available. However, the minimum number of teeth you can get in a given skink is 20 while the highest number is 90 teeth on average.</li>
<li>An adult chameleon has 32 to 44 teeth on average. However, these are not the number of teeth it has during death. Most of the front teeth are worn out or removed due to grasping and biting, leaving behind a roughjawbone.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-are-lizards-teeth-used-for">What are Lizards Teeth Used For?</h2>
<p>Lizards Teeth can be used in any of the following functions:
<strong>1. For Feeding.</strong>
These are the primary functions. Lizards use teeth to grasp, bite, and coarse the food/prey before swallowing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The teeth also help in preventing the prey from slipping away during feeding.</li>
<li>Some lizard species use their teeth to cut prey into small sizes that would facilitate easier swallowing.
Normally, Lizards dont chew their food; instead, they swallow in bits.
<strong>2. For Protection/Defense.</strong>
Lizards use their teeth for defense in case of danger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Veterinary examination shows that young lizards make rapid snaps when agitated or stressed as they try to bite while large adult lizards make deep cut when biting and use their tails to knock off their enemy.
<strong>3. Aid in Mating.</strong>
During the copulation period, male lizards latch on the female. It bites the females back, head, or neck to gain the ample stability needed during mating.</p>
<p>The Iguana lizards are more aggressive as compared to other species since the female produces pheromones during the menstrual cycle that attracts the male often.</p>
<h2 id="do-baby-lizards-have-teeth">Do Baby Lizards Have Teeth?</h2>
<p>Yes! Young lizards are hatched with
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-lizards-eat/">teeth in place for eating</a>
. As the lizard grows and near maturity, the teeth increase in number. The Pleurodont class of lizards is able to shed off and replace their teeth regularly up to 6 times a year.</p>
<p>Contrary, the acrodont class of lizards do not replace their teeth once they are shed off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, special care should be taken (by owners) when handling these species of lizards.</li>
<li>The teeth of baby lizards are adapted to feeding on soft food substances.
Though they can grasp, the teeth are usually not strong enough to cause any substantial resistance against their prey. So, most of the young lizards are fed by their mothers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-lizard-bite-human-being">Can Lizard Bite Human Being?</h2>
<p>Lizards, usually, will bite you if they feel threatened or when they are stressed. Some of these bites are not injurious (are harmless) while some
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizards are poisonous</a>
and may infect you, your humans, and pets badly.</p>
<p>Iguanas, Monitor lizards, and Nile monitors are some of the lizards that are rampant in biting when threatened or stressed.</p>
<p>Normally, Lizards dont attack human beings. They live a cohesive and associative life with the human being thus becoming a nice pet to have.</p>
<p>However, research shows that lizards at times rebel, a special class of people such as veterinarians, when undergoing medical checkups  they try to defend themselves by biting back.</p>
<p>In case a lizard bites you, it is necessary to seek medical attention from the hospital.</p>
<p>However, most of the bits from house lizards (Geckos) are mild scraps that can be attended at home using a home fast aid kit.</p>
<p>NB:
<em>It is advisable to wear protective gear always when handling lizards during medications and physical checkups. Related: Are Leopard Geckos Nocturnal?</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All lizards have teeth. The teeth of young lizards increase in number as they grow to their adulthood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Importantly, lizards have either acrodont or pleurodont type of teeth that are well adapted to feeding, mating, or defense.</li>
<li>Lizards rarely bite human beings. Their bites are usually harmless though there are few species that have venom that may cause infections.
Lizards are generally harmless thus can be nice pets if taken care of well.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Lizard Lifespan - Probably you have come across the house lizard (commonly known as house gecko) in your house, yard, compound or zoo and wonder how long
these vertebrate
s live. Could House Lizards live just like human beings or survive for a couple of weeks?
<em>So, whats the house lizards lifespan?�</em>
**The simple answer is, house lizard live for 4 to 6 years on average. However, this lifespan is subject to factors such as the care given, environment/climate and availability of basic needs for the house lizard. **
<strong>Some house lizards may even live slightly longer than 6 years if the above factors are maintained. On the other hand, skin shedding problems and wounding occurrences may lower the lifespan of the house lizards.�</strong>

<h2 id="whats-the-house-lizard-lifespan">What&rsquo;s the House Lizard Lifespan?</h2>
<p>The house lizard (also known as house gecko) has a life span of 4 to 6 years on average. This period is subjects to factors such as environment/climate, care given and availability of basic needs.
Most of the house lizards are faced with problems of wounding and skin shedding which lower their life span. For those house lizards that are well taken care of, they live slightly longer than 6 years.
The oldest House Lizard that ever lived recorded 27 years. House lizards are known to hatch in 60 days after which they grow to maturity in a couple of months (12 months) before breeding.

What Does a Garden Lizard Eat?</p>
<h2 id="general-factors-that-affect-the-lifespan-of-house-lizard"><strong>General Factors that affect the Lifespan of House Lizard</strong></h2>
<p>The lifespan of the House lizard is affected by the following factors.
<strong>1. Environment/Climatic conditions.</strong>
House lizards are known to live in warm environment. Being cold blooded (ectothermic), these reptiles are adversely affected by change in temperature (sudden rise or fall). You must ensure that your pet house lizard has suitable/optimal warmth in its cage.
House lizards living in cold climates live lesser years as compare to those living in warm temperate climate. This is because cold environment makes house lizards less active (inactive) forcing them to hibernate till summer.
The environment full of predators such as cats, dogs, snakes, skinks etc. posts risks to life house lizards. Most of house lizards are fed on by their predators before they reach full maturity. Large water bodies easily drown the house lizards since they tend to
walk on water instead of swimming
.
Very hot climate/environment like desert will kill the house lizards faster due to their ectothermic nature. Their body enzymes (protein in nature) are denatured by high temperature leading to death.
<strong>2. Availability of basic needs.</strong>
House lizards requires basic needs such as proper habitat, food and water and right care. The habitat should entail nice cage with proper lighting and temperature. The cage should also have a hideout option for your house lizard and comfortable beddings (leaves or plant materials that does not cause discomfort).
The presence of food and water is vital for the survival of house lizard. Provide a variety of food such as crickets, ants, flies, leafhoppers, mealworms, grasshoppers, moths, soft shell beetles, pupae of butterflies and moths to your pet house lizard. Lizards that lack enough food and water die earlier (short life span  less than 18 months)
Provide the right amount of water for your house lizard in shallow bowls and make sure you replace it regularly. You can even provide a small pod in the cage for your house lizard to swim. Lack of right basic needs for your house lizard will reduce its life span.
<strong>3. Care given.</strong>
Proper care is vital for the house lizard if you need to boost its lifespan.� Ensure that you take your pet house lizards to veterinary regularly. Monitor the health of your house lizard every 48 hours. Clean the cage regularly and quarantine new pet house lizards for the first one to two months.
Provide stimulation such as mist spay that cause house lizards to relax and active within the cage. You can have rocks, hollows, plants and hideouts within the cage. You can even hide food for your house lizard to make it do something else.
House lizards that have been given continuous proper care have lived even more than 6 years.</p>
<h2 id="health-problems-that-affect-the-lifespan-of-house-lizard"><strong>Health Problems That Affect the Lifespan of House Lizard�</strong></h2>
<p>The following are problems that affects the lifespan of the House Lizards mostly:
<strong>1. Wounding Problem.</strong>
House lizards have soft skin that is easily wounded. Scratch from the walls or spikes on the house lizards skin cause mild to severe wounds.
Normally, House Lizards would prefer to roll on soft surfaces. You must ensure that the substrate in the cage does not cause injuries on landing or while moving about. You can also provide some soft beddings in your House lizards hideout.
House lizard are easily wounded when they fall due to their soft skin. Their skin also get ruptured by impact force. The scratch from the paws of the other lizards while playing cause back and skin wounds. These would leads to severe bleeding and their autotomy nature (self-amputation of tail in case of danger) may lead to death if not attended.
Lizards that are often wounded have lower lifespan (1 to 2 years) whereas those house lizards that are less wounded have longer lifespan (4 to 6 years).�NB: In case your pet lizards are wounded, seek quick medication from your vet.
<strong>2. Skin Shedding Problem.</strong>
House Lizards do shed their skin often (after every 4 to 6 weeks). They, then, eat their skin such that you may not notice easily. However, their skin color change can be noticed.
Contrary, some house lizards have problem while shedding their skin. You will notice a thick/excess skin at the neck, back/dorsal, tail, at the head and around the eye due to the unshed skin. This skin cause extreme pain, unhappiness and continued discomfort to your house lizard.
Seek your veterinary assistance to help remove excess unshed skin on your pet house lizard.
<strong>3. Loss of Tail.</strong>
House lizards have tendency of losing their tail in case of attack as a defense mechanism. This cause the gecko to lose a lot of energy during replacement. In addition, the regeneration of the tail takes longer and makes your house lizard less active as compared to other tailed house lizards.
In case your house lizard undergoes through a several loss of tail, it will die earlier (less than 2 years) than its expected time even if normal care is carried out.
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-bones/">Do lizards have bones</a>
?
To prolong the lifespan of your pet house lizard, do not hold it by the tail. Instead, lift your house lizard by the chest. Moreover, do not cause tension to your house lizard while in its cage too.</p>
<h2 id="weird-life-behaviors-of-house-lizard">Weird Life Behaviors of House Lizard</h2>
<p>House lizard has several weird behaviors that you may need to know. These behaviors include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eating their own shed skin</strong>. Gecko eat their skin -<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-have-teeth/">using their teeth</a>- as soon as it is shed. You may not notice that, however, you will find a change in its new skin color.</li>
<li>**Female is parthenogenesis.**This mean that the female house lizard does not need a male to reproduce always. It have ability to reproduce without mating with male. However, it has been found that such offspring lack a certain gene needed for diversity.</li>
<li>**Lack eyelids and lick their eyes.**Unlike human beings, house lizards do not have eyelids. Instead, their eyelids forms a colorless membrane that protect the eyes. To moisten the eyes when dry, the house lizard licks them often unlike in human where eyes are moisten automatically by the eyelids.</li>
<li>**Have autonomy capability.**This means that house lizards can cause self-amputation of their tail. This is done when the gecko detects danger during which it uses this method as a defense mechanism since the predator your tend feed on the tail and let go the lizard.

</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>House lizards have a lifespan of 4 to 6 years on average. However, this period is subject to factors such as care given, environment/climate and availability of basic needs for the house lizards.
Some House lizards may even live slightly longer than 6 years under proper care. Skin shedding problems and wounding occurrences may lower the lifespan of the house lizards. Consult your vet on your gecko care always.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bearded dragons are docile and beautiful reptiles that you&rsquo;ll love for their low maintenance.�In this article, I will let you know how big bearded dragons (Beardies) can grow while in captivity.
**In brief, an adult (and fully-grown) bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">dragon</a> will have a length of 16 - 24 inches and have a weight of between 380 - 510 grams. However, this reptile will be classified as unhealthy (suffering stunted growth) when it&rsquo;s under 300 grams all under 16 inches after one year - mainly due to cognitive or physical sickness. **</p>
<ul>
<li>**The bearded dragons reach sexual maturity at around 1 to 1.5 years and this is when they achieve full size. **
If the Beardies length is more than 24 inches, then this could be a German giant or what we call an uncommon mophr. The German giant achieves around 1,000 grams and a length of 32 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stage-1-of-growth-juvenile-bearded-dragon-size">Stage 1 of Growth: Juvenile Bearded Dragon Size</h2>
<p>If you are rearing a bearded dragon I&rsquo;m thinking of getting one, this information will help you prepare issues such as maintaining its general health, diet, and tank size.</p>
<p>A baby or juvenile bearded dragon is classified as one between the ages of 2 - 7 months.</p>
<p>Bearded dragons have different growth rates for stage 1 &amp; stage 2;</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1 growth rate: 1 to 3 inches every month</li>
<li>Stage 1 growth rate: 1 to 2 inches every week
The bearded dragons have a small rate of growth after one year but around this age, they&rsquo;ll have a thick tail base and their belly will be filled out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to its demanding body growth needs, a bearded dragon requires great nutrition (and regular feeding) at this age.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, you may need to feed this pet about 50 crickets daily to satisfy their dietary requirements.
Also, provide each of these pets with a separate cage of about 30 gallons. This is because they&rsquo;ll grow very dormant and territorial.</li>
<li>In fact, the large-sized dragons will dominate the hideouts, the lovely basking areas, and the food bowl.
Therefore, the small-sized dragons could be deprived of suitable lighting and adequate nutrition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stage-2-of-growth-size-of-baby--hatchlings-bearded-dragon">Stage 2 of Growth: Size of Baby / Hatchlings Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>The hatchlings of bearded dragons are about 3 inches in length and 4 grams in weight.</p>
<p>In the initial 2 months of growth, the bearded dragons grow at a rate of 1 inch to 1.5 inches every week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, in the first two months, these hatchlings will acquire about 3 grams to 5 grams.
So, to maintain a normal weight of the hatchlings of the baby bearded dragons, you need to weigh them weekly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I advise you to monitor the room lighting and the baby dragons feeding habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>I noted that some of the hatchlings would have diseases such as metabolic bone disease or also they could experience feeding competition leading to dietary deficiency.
Thus, Critical factors to consider and provide to the hatchlings of the baby dragons in their first year of growth are; proper bedding, nutrition, and appropriate lighting.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Notably, You should feed the babies of the bearded dragons with a diet that has a higher proportion or ratio of proteins (insects) as compared to the number of salads included.</li>
<li>You should also include a Tube light (T5 UVB) On the outer side of the Dragon smash but at a minimum of six inches.
Therefore, as noted, the survival and growth of bearded dragons or their babies are highly dependent on the environment and diet that you provide.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sizes-of-various-bearded-dragons-by-breed">Sizes Of Various Bearded Dragons By Breed</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons come in 8 subspecies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, You should note that these subspecies have different adaptations that allow them to live in a specific region;</li>
<li>This is because the various subspecies live in various locations of Australia.

What&rsquo;s The Growth Rate Of The Bearded Dragon?</li>
</ul>
<p>During the early life (i.e. 1 - 3 months), the bearded dragons tend to grow at a highly accelerated rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be summarised as the growth of about 10 to 50 g every month and 2 inches in each month.
However, the growth rate of the bearded dragons will have slowed down after 3 months since hatching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, the reptiles in the juvenile stage will gain about 50 g every month and roughly 1 inch to 1.5 inches every month.</p>
<ul>
<li>And rid of skin-shedding, these pets will shed about 1 to 2 times every month.
However, once the bearded dragons achieve their full size (this is in around 1 year), the bearded dragons will shed their skin at a slower rate which is about 1 - 2 times every year.</li>
<li>Another critical factor to notice is that the bearded dragons will have around 350 g in one year and will gain more slowly in the second year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-average-and-maximum-weight-at-each-growth-stage">The Average and Maximum Weight at Each Growth Stage</h2>
<p>The growth rate of a bearded dragon is highly impacted by factors such as their health, their diet, and their environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, experts recommend that you use some approved growth charts that will help you make some accurate guesses on the growth rate of bearded dragons.
The growth charts require that you check the juveniles&rsquo; growth rate during the first six months.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the bearded dragon will be 15 + inches while it&rsquo;s 6 months old, I&rsquo;ll say that your pet may grow to be among those large beardies in their species. Id predict that the bearded dragon could Grow to be around 25 inches in length.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, if the bearded dragon is only about 11 inches at 6 months, I&rsquo;ll say that the animal might only (as a full-grown adult) get to around 16 to 18 inches.
Between 8 to 18 months, the bearded dragon we have achieved sexual maturity and itll have stopped growing in size.</li>

<h2 id="the-factors-that-affect-the-size-of-the-bearded-dragon">The Factors That Affect The Size Of The Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Bearded dragons tend to grow very fast and their clothes are considerably first time in their first year but there are some factors that will also affect how fast they grow.</p>
<h3 id="1-husbandry"><strong>1. Husbandry</strong></h3>
<p>If a bearded dragon has some sickness, or has poor health care, then the animal could have a lower weight and be smaller in size than expected for its age.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notable parasites and diseases like impaction can affect the number of nutrients that are bearded dragons get from their diet.
Such health issues and illnesses will affect the physiological functioning of the Dragon and this slows down the rate of growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check for health issues such as extreme appetite changes, the Dragon becoming overly sluggish, bloating, and significant weight loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you notice such health issues on your dragon ensure to talk to the pets vet</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-housing-">**2. Housing **</h3>
<p>The type and size of the house ( among other environmental factors) is a major factor affecting how big to do bearded dragons will grow.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should provide an enclosure (for the bearded dragon) that has adequate room for feeding, movement, or exercise.</p>
<p>If the enclosure has a small size compared to the subspecies of reptile, then the pet cool experience stunted growth cheese that home is not adequate for exercise and normal growing.</p>
<p>For example, you will require a tank of 40 gallons capacity for a juvenile bearded dragon and one of 120 gallons capacity for the adult.</p>
<p>Also, provide appropriate and enough lighting in and outside the enclosure to avoid stunted growth of your lizard.</p>
<ul>
<li>With enough UVA or B rays or adequate heat, the bearded dragon will synthesize vitamin D and also absorbed other nutrients correctly.
Hence, the lizard will escape getting the metabolic bone disease and it will have a healthy metabolic function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-diet"><strong>3. Diet</strong></h3>
<p>The bearded dragon will grow and developed if you provide them with a balanced and complete diet.</p>
<p>Notably, to escape stunted growth, don&rsquo;t feed the animals with low-nutrient bites such as iceberg lettuce.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further, don&rsquo;t feed the lizards with nutrients that are improperly balanced such as*grubs. *
Also, remember to alter the diet of the bearded dragons as the age advances.</li>
<li>The adults will require lesser proteins compared to the juveniles. So, you feed the juvenile lizards with 25% plants ( such as fruits, vegetables, and greens) end 25% are their diet should be insects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-gender"><strong>4. Gender</strong></h3>
<p>The sex or gender of the bearded dragon will also affect how big they grow.</p>
<ul>
<li>These pets can be described as sexually dimorphic.
The females of the bearded dragons have a slender (slim) tail but with a broader body.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the mals have wider (larger) heads and longer bodies compared to the females.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-genetics-">**5. Genetics **</h3>
<p>The maximum size of the bearded dragon is also affected by their genetics animal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the bearded dragon will grow as big or close to the size of the parents.
Are the characteristics that will differ with the lizard subspecies include the spikes, scales, and color.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the German giant morph will achieve 35 ounces in weight and 32 inches in the length.</p>
<h2 id="but-is-my-bearded-dragon-really-overweight">But Is My Bearded Dragon Really Overweight?</h2>
<p>Youll know where&rsquo;s the bearded dragon is overweight if its belly is bulging and it extends beyond the lizard&rsquo;s sides well it&rsquo;s standing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The chest area also is plump and the legs are very thick.
However, if the bearded dragon is female and it has an enlarged belly then the animal could need surgery since it could be suffering from egg retention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, when you believe that the bearded dragon might be overweight, you should begin the examination with the tank temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>notably, the tank area used for basking must not exceed a temperature of between 95 degrees Fahrenheit to 200 degrees Fahrenheit for normal body weight.
Unique characteristics that may point that your bearded dragon is over it include having a full chest, fat limbs, looking around, and being a little stout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowing exercises such as walking, offering an appropriate diet (foods with high protein and fats), and also lowering the temperature of the tank (heat tends to make the lizards eat more) will assist the pets to have fewer weight issues.</p>
<h2 id="but-is-my-bearded-dragon-really-underweight">But Is My Bearded Dragon Really Underweight?</h2>
<p>Unique features that will show your bearded dragon is underweight include protruding spine and ribs, sunken fat pads, and sagging skin(wrinkly and sullen).</p>
<ul>
<li>If the lizards are underweight in the first two to three months (growth phase) might be due to hibernation (brumation), illness, all nutritional challenges.</li>
<li>Also, the plate could lose its appetite due to temperature or food quality changes - lower temperatures trigger a slower metabolism.
For the underweight dragons, experts recommend you feed them with supplements, appetite stimulants, and a diet that is high in fats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So on the question of how big the bearded dragons can grow, I&rsquo;ll see that these will not have a straightforward response but they are important considerations to make.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, you should ensure that the bearded dragons have the correct tank, proper nutrition, and diet to allow the animals to draw their maximum possible size.
Cheers!</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How Do Lizards Mate? Maybe you have pet lizards at home or have seen one and wishes to know how they mate. Do they court like human being before mating? Well, in this article we shall answer the question, How Do Lizards Mate?
*During Mating, the male <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> (vertebrates) clings on the females back and support itself by biting the females neck. Then, the male lizards connects is hemipenes/male organ to the females cloaca (female organ) and pours its sperms that move up the oviduct to fertilize the ova (female egg). *
<em>However, before mating, the male and female may have 1 to 2 months of courtship during the mating season (spring). After fertilization, the lizard (Savannah, monitor, iguana, or Komodo dragon) lays eggs, which hatch into baby lizards in 4 to 8 weeks.�</em>

<h2 id="details-how-do-lizards-mate-and-reproduce"><strong>Details: How Do Lizards Mate and Reproduce?</strong></h2>
<p>Lizards undergo the following steps/stage during mating. Contrary, some viviparous lizards such as the blue-tongue skink and Solomon Island skink give live birth to their baby lizards.</p>
<h2 id="step-1how-lizards-attract-their-mate-for-sex-mating---courtship">Step 1:<strong>How lizards attract their mate for sex (mating - courtship)</strong></h2>
<p>Before mating, lizards court for 1 to 60 days to create a strong friendship/bond and form a royal pair that may last them their entire lifetime. During this time, there are some of things/techniques that lizards (either male or female) use to attract their mate for copulation or coitus. These may include:
<strong>1. Tactile commination�</strong>
Some lizards such as monitor lizards use touch as a way of attracting their mates to sexual engagement. The Komodo dragon likes to lick its female mate to see if its sexually ready or responsive.
The direct touch is used severally by lizards to create a close bond -

.
<strong>2. Auditory calls�</strong>
The lizards use the auditory call to entice the mate they intend to court with. Many lizards may not use this method since the predators may take advantage and catch/trace them using auditory call signals.
However, Tokay Gecko are known to use auditory calls when looking for courting mate. But
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/421925v1.abstract">Male Anolis**lizards�**prefer virgin females.</a>
<strong>3. Use of visual display�</strong>
The lizards mostly use visual displays such as, swaging of tail, changing of colors, frequent gapping of the mouth, moving of the tongue, special body posture, head bobbing as well as inflation and push-ups to attract its mate for courtship.
Flying lizards and Anoles lizards, males have well-developed and brightly colored throat dewlaps and fans which open and close and use them to attract the female lizards for courtship. This method is most used and pronounced as compared to others.
<strong>4. Chemical Cues�</strong>
The lizards produces a chemical pheromones that when smelled will attract the mate for courtship. Normally, female lizards produces these chemical cues to attract the male lizard for mating purpose.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-mating-process">Step 2**: Mating Process�**</h3>
<p>During mating, the male lizard climbs over the female lizard. Then, it connects its hemipenes into the cloaca of the female lizard and pours the sperms into the cloaca from where the sperms swim up the uterus to the oviduct to fertilize the ova (singular - ovum).
The puring process is not a bumpy liquid but continuous drips. The male lizard must wait until the whole pouring process is completed.
The male lizard usually bites the neck of the female lizard to support itself during coitus/copulation. In addition, the male lizard will produce/secret cellular debris that have scent, which makes the couple be able to locate each other in a colony of lizards. Moreover, this debris prevent the male lizard from sliding during mating.
During mating, the female lizard raises the tail slightly to enable the male access the cloaca (you may see as if lizards are coiling while mating). There is no kissing in lizards. However, lizard species such as Komodo dragon and monitor lizards lick their female mates during copulation/coitus.</p>
<h3 id="step-3after-mating-occurrences">Step 3:<strong>After mating occurrences.</strong></h3>
<p>Once the male lizard mates with female lizard, it leaves the female and go to search for other female (most lizards are polygamous). The female searches for a nice place where it intends to lay the eggs.
This place can be in warm holes, leaves, under the sand, seashores or in caves where predator cant locate them (the eggs have strong eggshells that offer further protection).
Then, the female lizard lays the fertilized eggs in batches may have 1 to 20 eggs. Eastern Bearded Dragon usually lay 5 to 17 per batch. Water Dragon will lay between 6 to 18 eggs per batch while Blue tongue lizard will lay 10 to 20 eggs per batch.
The eggs are left to hatch after 4 to 8 weeks. The female lizards rarely take care of the eggs.�Some lizards such as the blue-tongue skink and Solomon Island skink give birth to young live offspring after 10 weeks.
However, these lizards do not have mammary glands to breastfeed their baby lizards. Baby lizards usually have low life expectancy since they face many predators and less care from the adult lizards.

<h2 id="which-is-the-matingbreeding-season-for-lizards">Which is the Mating/breeding season for lizards</h2>
<p>Normally, lizards prefer to court and mate during the spring season. This is favored by warm temperatures that provides a conducive outdoors bonding for lizards. During this time, the male lizard undergo through spermatogenesis (sperms production) and mates with the female lizard after courtship.
The female lizard will then store the sperms in its oviduct until ova (female egg cells) are produced and mature for fertilization. The warmth in spring makes lizards more sexual active such that, they can mate severally in a given day.
The ability of the female lizard to store sperms in some species makes them easier to carry fertilization even when they are not mating.�Some lizards such as Iguanas and Monitor lizards love mating during summer due to high temperature, which activates the copulation/coitus urge for the mates.
The Asian Water dragon becomes bright red during mating season while North American Lizards become orange skinned when mating season approaches.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-lizards-reproduction-organs-specialized-for-mating-in-lizards">How Are Lizards Reproduction Organs Specialized for Mating in Lizards.</h2>
<p>Lizards, unlike human beings, have special reproduction/sexual organs. The male have hemipenis (plural hemipenes) or penis (tubular) that is used during copulation (sexual intercourse). These organs are sac-like and lack erectile tissues as in human being or other animals.
The testicles and the hemipenes in male lizards are stored inverted inside the body at the back of the tail and are only used during copulation (they are not used for urination or egestion). The testicles of male lizards enlarge during the breeding season (you may notice the bulge part at the back of the lizards tail).
The female lizard has two oviducts, which join to form the cloaca (a special type of female organ). The cloaca is a multi-purpose organ in female lizards as it is used during mating, egestion and urination too.
During mating, the male lizard connects and pours into the cloaca of the female lizard from where the sperms swim to the uterus and up the oviduct to fertilize the ova.
The uterus of the female lizards (especially the viviparous lizards  those that give birth) has large volume that help carry many eggs/baby lizards.
During mating, the cloaca stops completely its other functions i.e. urination and egestion. You can locate the tiny pole at the back of the tail in each sex (male or female lizard) that represents the sexual organ.

<h2 id="do-all-female-lizards-need-to-mate-to-get-fertilized-or-pregnant">Do All Female Lizards Need to Mate to Get Fertilized or Pregnant?</h2>
<p>No. Not all lizards that need mating to lay eggs. Some lizards such as gecko, rock lizards, monitor lizards are parthenogenetic (do no need to mate to lay eggs). These lizard species lay eggs (though not fertilized), which hatch to baby lizards.
However, the young ones from these eggs do not have genes that favor diversity like those from fertilized eggs.�The asexual lizards (parthenogenetic) usually have both chromosomes that are provided by the male sex cell thus helps in grow of the egg to maturity.
Other lizard species such as Komodo lizards are bisexual- they can reproduce sexually or by parthenogenesis. In most cases, the bisexual lizards would prefer mating as it offers the bonding chance that make them create a colony for daily activities or defense purposes.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-babiesoff-springs-do-lizards-hatch">How Many Babies/Off Springs Do Lizards Hatch?</h2>
<p>The number of eggs laid by a give lizard species determines the number of baby lizards that are raised in a given season. After mating, the female lizard lays 1 to 20 eggs per batch in a warm environment.
In a given breeding season, female lizards can lay 2 to 3 batches, which may lead to breeding problem on hatching. 80 to 90 percent of the laid eggs normally hatch to baby lizards in 50 to 57 days.
About 1 to 40 lizards are hatched in a given breeding season from a single female lizard. However, due to large predation in the breeding ground, 60 percent of the population do not survive to maturity. Most of them are eaten away or die due to adverse weather conditions and less parental care.
Species such as Blue tongue lizard can raise between 5 to 18 baby lizards. The Asian water dragon manages 5 to 12 baby lizards while Bearded Dragon can hatch between 15 to 20 young ones.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-baby-lizards-take-to-mature">How Long Does The Baby Lizards Take To Mature?</h2>
<p>Baby lizard takes about 12 months to acquire full maturity. During this time, the baby lizard is fed partially by the adult ones and also engaged in light hunting of food.
At this age, the lizard can carry out reproduction (can mate and lay eggs). The adult lizard then assumes the duties of food gathering (hunting) since its old enough to even have its own shelter/cage.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When mating, the male lizard climbs over the female lizard and introduces its hemipenes (male organ) into the cloaca (female) of the female lizard and pours the sperms that swim to the oviduct where they fertilize the ova (singular ovum).
The male lizard has scary underneath skin with debris, which prevent it from sliding during coitus. The male and female lizard must court before mating begin.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bearded dragons are often hailed as one of the most intelligent reptiles, just behind some lizards.</p>
<p>Do bearded dragons behave like mammals? Do they respond to training? It is possible to train them?</p>
<p>This article will look at the intelligence of
<a href="https://www.petmd.com/reptile/care/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-bearded-dragons"><strong>bearded dragons</strong></a>
and answer these questions.
<strong>How smart are bearded dragons?�</strong>
<em>Bearded dragons may be less intelligent than some lizards, but these reptiles are equally smart.�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>*They can learn to solve problems and are capable of imitating other bearded lizards (an intelligent skill thought to belong to mammals of higher cranial capacity). *</li>
<li>*Bearded dragons can tell if you are their owner or a person who feeds them. They will be happy or sad, depending on how they feel about you. *</li>
<li><em>They can be trained with actions (patterns and routines) like a head pat or push-ups and feeding time to reinforce desired behaviors.</em>

<h2 id="how-smart-are-bearded-dragons-research">How Smart are Bearded Dragons? Research</h2>
<p>While humans may have once been the only species capable of imitation, new research has shown that some lizards are on equal footing with us in the intelligence department.</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2014/09/970.asp">University of Lincoln, U.K research</a>aimed to provide a better understanding of the intelligence of bearded dragons - through imitation testing.
The bearded dragons were studied while in terrariums. They were offered a wire door and get to the sumptuous mealworm.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Group 1</strong>- One bearded <a href="/posts/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/">dragon</a> was shown a video where another bearded dragon was opening the wire door from the left</li>
<li><strong>Group 2</strong>- Another bearded dragon was shown a video where another bearded dragon was opening the wire door from the right</li>
<li><strong>Group 3</strong>- Another bearded dragon was shown a video where a human being was opening the wire door</li>
<li><strong>Control group</strong>- Four bearded dragons didn&rsquo;t get any video instruction on how to open the wire door
**The results and conclusion? **</li>
<li><strong>Group 1 and Group 2</strong>(shown videos of other bearded dragons opening the wire door) acted in exactly the same way and even followed the direction used in opening the door in the video.</li>
<li><strong>Group 3</strong>- But bearded dragon showed a video of human beings opening the wire door didn&rsquo;t open the door; i.e. no imitation observed.</li>
<li>Finally, in the control group (the bearded dragons were not shown any videos) and the finding was that they did not learn door opening.
**Conclusion? **</li>
<li>Bearded dragons are clever animals and they can learn from one another especially through imitation.</li>
<li>Bearded dragons use their intellectual ability to imitate other bearded dragons better than they can mimic humans.</li>
<li>It took about three weeks for bearded dragons to understand and imitate the video instruction.

<h2 id="intelligence-signs---recognize-owners-or-feeders-feeding-time-routines">Intelligence Signs? - Recognize owners or Feeders, Feeding-time Routines</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragons are <a href="/posts/roku-smart-soundbar-review/">smart</a>; they learn and recognize their owners or people who feed them by use of sight, smell, pleasure, or anger.</p>
<p>The research showed that bearded dragons are intelligent as they can imitate other bearded dragons.</p>
<ul>
<li>But people with Bearded Dragons pets have seen other smart things they do for a long time.</li>
<li>A lot of animals kept as pets learn patterns and routines.
They are more intelligent than other reptiles like geckos, Gila monsters, or Komodo dragons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bearded dragons are highly motivated by food; they&rsquo;ll remember and adhere to feeding-time routines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the owner enters its cage, the Bearded Dragon smells his/her presence and while using its sight its able to recognize the owner/feeder  you will fill Bearded Dragon approach him/her on entering the cage.</li>
<li>It relaxes and also enjoys the pleasure of being held by the owner without resistance.
When it&rsquo;s mealtime, bearded dragons usually gravitate to the same spot as their food bowls - if you position it at a single location in their enclosure.</li>
<li>You can teach your bearded dragon to come when it hears its name, by calling them before they eat.</li>
<li>Also, the bearded dragon associates its human owner with pleasurable experiences, such as and eating.
Bearded dragon has great animal intelligence; they&rsquo;ll acknowledge waving and nodding by humans or bearded dragons because they understand that these gestures are signs of politeness, even though they don&rsquo;t have the ability to speak.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, the Bearded Dragon would not resist any presence of an intruder in its cage who is not the owner/feeder or someone or an animal who caused them a painful or bad experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, Bearded Dragon may generate anger (an aggressive posture) and begin to run away, or even attack.
Therefore, have a cover or screen on the reptile&rsquo;s enclosure, so that it can hide from any intruder who is not the owner/feeder.</li>
<li>Also, don&rsquo;t the bearded dragon be out of their cage without supervising them.

<h2 id="can-i-train-my-bearded-dragon">Can I Train My Bearded Dragon?</h2>
<p>First, dragons are not difficult to train on routine including potty training. But they won&rsquo;t perform tricks like cats or dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that your bearded dragons are much less intelligent than iguanas and tegus.
You can also train Bearded Dragon. The experiment carried out by researchers at the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom shows that a Bearded Dragon was able to be trained and learn how to open doors to access its food.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was achieved by placing Trained Breaded Dragon with untrained ones. When untrained Bearded Dragons saw trained ones open the door to access food, they were also able to open too.</p>
<p>In fact, these animals are able to imitate other reptiles (bearded dragons) and practice the learned skills - but their learning time varied.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed how bearded dragons respond to both negative &amp; positive daily experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best way to keep your bearded dragon from associating you with fear, anger, or pain is by giving it positive attention.
So, keep your beardie happy by giving him food like super worms and mealworms.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-tame-your-bearded-dragon">How to Tame your Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>First, the sign of stress in most bearded dragons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hiding from other bearded dragons or you</li>
<li>Their beard turning dark-colored</li>
<li>Having an expanded or frilled beard</li>
<li>Bobbing their head
It is possible to train your Bearded Dragon so that it may conform and respond to some activities you may desire. Such activities may include:</li>
<li>Recognizing its name/sound.</li>
<li>Accessing a place to take their food.</li>
<li>Recognize their owner or people who feed them.</li>
<li>Locate a place to poop/excrete.</li>
<li>Wave to people/visitors.</li>
<li>Escape danger.
To achieve these skills in the Bearded Dragon, you must train one skill for a given period of time. It is not possible for the Bearded Dragon to master all these skills simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normally, Bearded Dragons are shy by nature. It wont be possible to train them in any of the above skills until you create a close bond between you and Bearded Dragon. To do this, you will need to carry out the following steps for your newly acquired Bearded Dragon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you bring a new Bearded Dragon in your home, allow it to have its free time without touching it. Feed it from a distance so that you dont create tension or fear. Ensure it is living in a large enclosed place.</li>
<li>Start to Hand Feed your Bearded Dragon. This will make your Bearded Dagon get free and comfortable with your touch. It will also boost its trust in you. Bearded dragons are normally harmless  they may not bite you when hand feeding.</li>
<li>Make sure you spend a lot of time in the cage where the Bearded Dragon lives. You can be there cleaning, making its sleeping place, or feeding it. This will create recognition with time.</li>
<li>Allow the Bearded Dragon to move about in an enclosed cage for some hours. This can be done effectively by setting up little food in bowls at various points to attract its movement. Keep watch from a distance to see if it has any signs of stress (showing an aggressive posture).</li>
<li>Once you realize that your Bearded Dragon is now free with you, pick it with your hand and softly rub its back softly to kill its tension or fear. Do not lift the Bearded Dragon from behind  this may make it get angered or generate fear. Never raise it up by the tail  it may startle. The tail of the Bearded Dragon does not grow back once cut. Slowly and calmly pick your Bearded Dragon from the front and support its trunk gently. In case it reacts restrictively, taps its back softly as you tend to put it on the ground.</li>
<li>Further, calm your Bearded Dragon until it&rsquo;s stress-free. This will be shown by indicators such as warm relaxations and lack of aggressiveness.
Once you are able to handle your Bearded Dragon with your hands freely without it reacting, then it will be easier for you to train it other skill as indicated above through the use of Conditioned reflex action.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Every time you handle your bearded dragon, try to get in the habit of washing your hands; you dont want to pass salmonella on to your pet.</li>
<li>Bearded dragons have an exceedingly high tolerance for pain, so never attempt to restrain them by grabbing their tail.</li>
<li>To reassure them, stroke their backs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-you-potty-train-the-bearded-dragon">Can you Potty Train the Bearded Dragon?</h2>
<p>Bearded Dragon report that they&rsquo;ve effectively potty-trained some of these pets.</p>
<p>Some bearded dragons don&rsquo;t quickly learn to use the litter. However, most will get into the habit of going in one spot on their own within a week or two.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reptiles hate the smell and sight of their poop, and thus they learn to avoid it by choosing a single pooping litterbox�spot that&rsquo;s far.</li>
<li>Also, the bearded dragons have a tendency to go out of the cage to poop.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-bearded-dragons-friendly">Are Bearded Dragons Friendly?</h2>
<p>Yes, Bearded Dragons are docile. These reptiles rarely show aggression unless you get too close to their space, at which point they may try to flee the area.</p>
<p>Bearded Dragons are a good pet because they do not bite people and they are easier to tame; they&rsquo;ll curl or turn when held as a sign of cool pleasure.</p>
<p>These reptiles will not attack your children when in their cage or when invading their hideouts.</p>
<p>Bearded Dragons do not cause any rebellion against other pets. If you have a bearded dragon, then you can also have other pets in the same cage.</p>
<p>But, when Bearded Dragon gets aggressive, it begins to Hiss, open its mouth, stare, bobbing its head, puffing the beards or generate stress marks.</p>
<p>The reaction may be caused by stress, stiff competition in the case, being scared often, shedding, hormonal imbalances, breeding season, or environmental change.</p>
<h2 id="do-bearded-dragons-show-affection">Do bearded dragons show affection?</h2>
<p>Yes! Bearded Dragons are special as compared to other reptiles in that they are eagerly waiting for their owner or the person feeding them. You will find them warming up as you approach which is a sign of affection and appreciation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Bearded Dragons Voluntarily seek to be held by their owner. You will find them preferring to feed on your hand instead of using their bowls.</p>
<p>The affection of the Bearded Dragon increases with age. You will find that it likes to always be closer to you/owner. In addition, it will even climb over you for fun. Therefore, Bearded Dragon is an incredibly affectionate reptile.</p>
<h2 id="are-bearded-dragons-nocturnal">Are Bearded Dragons Nocturnal?</h2>
<p>No! Bearded dragons are very inactive at night. Indeed, these lizards are diurnal  they are active during the day and sleep the whole night. We noted that
Leopard Geckos are<strong>crepuscular</strong>
Bearded Dragons are docile reptiles. They are active when the room temperature rises during the day to a level that can make them go hunting or move around in the cage.</p>
<p>Normally, the light will make the Bearded Dragons wake up while Darkness makes them sleep. Artificially, you can control the sleeping style of the Bearded Dragon in an enclosure/cage by switching off and on light or using a time switch.</p>
<p>However, it would be problematic to make your Bearded Dragon be active in the presence of light. They will sleep often during the day, especially after feeding.</p>
<h2 id="do-bearded-dragons-respond-to-their-names">Do Bearded Dragons Respond to Their Names?</h2>
<p>Yes! Bearded Dragons will respond to their names. However, they do not respond to those names as a human does. You must associate the given name/voice with something that will attract (at first) the Bearded Dragon such as food.</p>
<p>Any time you give the Bearded Dragon food, mention the name. With time, it will connect that voice with itself and food too.</p>
<p>It is not easy to take Bearded Dragons to respond to their names though with commitments and repetition, you will have them respond to your call even without food.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On how smart are bearded dragons; YES, they&rsquo;re smart - they&rsquo;ll imitate other Bearded Dragons and learn feeding-time routines such as name-calling.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can easily tame it for a given task through a conditioned reflex action method.</li>
<li>In case you want to feed your Bearded Dragon, you can this by calling it a given name just before giving it food. With time, Bearded Dragon will associate that sound/name with food or your presence.
We cannot say that Bearded Dragon is the most intelligent reptile we have. However, we can attest that Bearded Dragon is smart and able to learn with continuous training.</li>

and you wonder whether these reptiles are a source of food. Can they be eaten?</p>
<p>Can Wall Geckos cause food poisoning or be poisonous when eaten by humans or carnivores? So,
<em>is wall <a href="/posts/do-geckos-eat-bed-bugs/">gecko</a> poisonous if eaten?�</em>
**The simple answer is NO! <a href="/posts/how-to-remove-paint-from-walls/">Wall</a> Gecko is not poisonous to humans or other animals when eaten. The meat from the Wall Gecko is non-toxic (has no toxins) and is safe for human consumption. **
<strong>However, there are some parts of Wall Gecko that should not be eaten e.g. skin and mouth-part. These sections are known to house pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which multiply rapidly and cause food poisoning when eaten.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Geckos&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="details-is-wall-gecko-poisonous-if-eaten">Details: Is Wall Gecko Poisonous If Eaten?</h2>
<p>The Wall Gecko is safe and edible reptile that does not cause any harm to human beings when eaten. Their meat does not have toxins and can also be eaten by other carnivores without causing any food poisoning.</p>
<p>However, the mouth-part and skin of wall Gecko house the salmonella bacteria and pathogens that may cause food poisoning when eaten.</p>
<h3 id="1-what-to-eat-in-wall-gecko">1. What to eat in wall Gecko</h3>
<p>The Wall Gecko can be eaten by humans, your pets such as cats and dogs as well as other carnivores. However, not all parts of Wall Gecko can be eaten. You will need to be cautious when killing the Wall Gecko as it can bite (mild bite) and instill pain. The following are some of the parts that are preferably eaten.</p>
<ol>
<li>**The body meat.**Once you kill your Wall Lizard, peel of the skin (this can be used to make drum as in Thailand) and dissect it to get body meat. The body meat (somatic) it best to feed on since its soft and tender. This meat does not contain any toxins that may cause food poisoning. The Meat from the Wall Gecko may not be that big, like goat or cow, so, you will need to be precise while slicing. Take care of bones as they should be separated from steak meat.</li>
<li>**The Internal organs.**The internal organs such as lungs, heart, kidneys and intestines. Organs like heart and kidneys are very small and may not be substantial to eat. Intestines need to be cleaned thoroughly before boiling them to kill any bacteria that may be in the digestive track. Care should be put into place when handling the liver not to damage the gall bladder (it contains the bile juice, which may poison the meat).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>**The Bones.**Bones can be boiled to form marrowbone soup which when added some spices becomes very delicious. Before boiling, the bone skin (limb bones) must be removed as well as cleaning thoroughly the toe-webbed skin  the skin houses a lot of bacteria and pathogens which lead to food poisoning. You can pass the limbs over the fire (grill) to dry the skin fully before boiling.
Nevertheless, you should not eat any of these parts of Wall Gecko:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>**The skin.**Ensure to dissect the Wall Geckos skin perfectly well to detach it with body meat completely. This prevents the meat from being contaminated with the pathogens and bacteria that may be housed in the skin. Never eat the Wall Geckos skin since the salmonella bacteria found in it will be transfer with the meat to your digestive track causing food poisoning. Moreover, the bacteria and pathogens on the skin multiply very fast.</li>
<li>**The mouthpart.**The mouth of Wall Gecko is known to house variety of pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella. These bacteria hide in the teeth gaps, under the tongues, in the air sack region, on the palate and even along the throat. Normally, these bacteria cause infections when lizards bite you. When killing the Wall Gecko, it is advisable to get rid of the mouthpart completely or heat-treat it with high temperature (above 110 degree centigrade) to eliminate any living bacteria or pathogens.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>**The Toes.**The toes of Wall Gecko are partially webbed. The tip of the toes have crawls that provides a suitable hideout of bacteria and pathogens. It is difficult to remove these bacteria due to the coiling of the crawls. It is therefore necessary to cut of these sections. In case you must feed on them, carry out thorough cleaning and heat treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-how-to-cook-wall-gecko">2. How to cook Wall gecko.</h2>
<p>Before you cook meat from a Wall Gecko, ensure that you clean it with warm water thoroughly to remove any contamination that may come from the skin. The body meat should be slice into sizable piece that can be handled using a fork.</p>
<p>You can roast, boil or fry the body meat from the Wall Gecko. Do not overcook when boiling (5 to15 minutes are enough) since the meat breaks easily into watery soup.</p>
<p>The Wall Gecko body meat is best when fried or roasted at a lower temperature (lesser than boiling temperature).</p>
<p>Before boiling the Wall Gecko bones for soup, it is important to preheat them (steam or fry slightly) to kill any bacteria or pathogens that may get into soup. Ensure that you spice your soup to make it more delicious.</p>
<h3 id="3-poisonous-parts-of-wall-gecko">3. Poisonous parts of wall gecko</h3>
<p>The skin and the mouthpart of the Wall Gecko are poisonous. They house pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which multiply rapidly and cause food poisoning when eaten. The Skin contain scales that offers options for bacteria hideouts.</p>
<p>The mouth provides optimal environment for growth and multiplication of bacteria such as salmonella and other pathogens. These microorganisms hide under the tongue, in the teeth gaps, on the palate and throat too. They cause food poisoning and infection in case you are bitten.</p>
<p>The toes of Wall Gecko have short curved crawls at the tip. These parts house and incubate the disease causing pathogens and bacteria.</p>
<h3 id="4-precautions-when-eating-gecko">4. Precautions when eating Gecko**.**</h3>
<p>In case you would like to eat your Walk Gecko, it is necessary to observe the following precaution as a way of preventing food poisoning that may occur.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your Wall Gecko thoroughly with hot water after killing it (to remove and kill bacteria and pathogens). You can crap off the scale using a knife or any sharp object.</li>
<li>Clean the body meat thoroughly after slaughtering your Wall Gecko to remove any trace of germs or bacteria.</li>
<li>When slaughtering your Wall Gecko, check keenly on the gall bladder to prevent it from rapturing/damage (the bile juice will poison the meat making it unsuitable for human consumption).</li>
<li>Remove webbed toes of the Wall Gecko carefully and throw them away.</li>
<li>Never eat the mouthpart of the Wall Gecko  it contains pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which cause food poisoning. Throw away the mouthpart.</li>
<li>You can involve the veterinary to check the health status of the Wall Gecko before eating.</li>
<li>Burry the leftovers of the Wall Gecko meat or grind them into soft powder. It is not good to give your dog or cats plan bones from the Wall Lizards. The bones are sharp and when swallowed affect their digestive track.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-do-you-keep-wall-gecko-as-pet"><strong>How Do You Keep Wall Gecko As Pet?�</strong></h2>
<p>Wall Gecko are cold-blooded (ectotherms) reptiles and thus need special care. As a Pet, Wall Gecko needs a cage that is well aerated and spacious. Access to water and food without strain is important. You can use bowls and shall water cans which the Wall Gecko cannot tend to swim in.</p>
<p>Provide a warm pod where your Pet Wall Gecko can swim in at will. Normally, Wall Gecko will walk or run on water unlike other species of lizards such as Marine Iguanas and Komodo dragon.</p>
<p>Wall Gecko loves climbing on walls and branches, try piles stones in the cage and cross some branches (you can place some logs) to offer alternatives for climbing.</p>
<p>Ensure you warm the cage during the night to keep your pet active in case your cage is under a roof where there is no direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Wall Geckos can easily climb out of the roof, kindly ensure that you place some stop barriers such as extended flat tops.�Feed your Wall Gecko, just like
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-leopard-gecko-eat/">leopard geckos</a>
, 2 to 3 times in a day. This will make it active and friendlier always.</p>
<p>Carnivores such as cats and dogs can feed on the Wall Gecko. Ensure you keep such pets away from the cage where your pet Wall Gecko is housed. Moreover, wall gecko may have some of the infectious pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella, which can infect your humans and other pets.</p>
<p>Make sure that you seek frequent medical checkup from your veterinary to ensure that your Wall Gecko pet is healthy always.�Do not overfeed you Wall Gecko as this may cause it to generate unusual obesity, which may lead to locomotion problems or get inactive.</p>
<h2 id="which-animals-can-eat-wall-gecko">Which Animals Can Eat Wall Gecko?</h2>
<p>Wall Gecko is highly hunt due to its edibility and defenseless lifestyle. The reptile rarely fight back. Instead, it escapes by running away. Though Wall Gecko can bite in case it lacks refuge, the bite isnt intense.</p>
<p>However, these bites are infectious since the mouth of Wall Gecko is habited with numerous pathogens and bacteria such as salmonella.</p>
<p>Apart from human beings who hunt them from meat, Wall Gecko are eaten carnivores such as cats, dogs, crocodiles, snakes and large lizards such as Komodo dragons and Breaded lizards as flesh.</p>
<p>These carnivores swallow the Wall Gecko alive while others may slice it before feeding. Wall Gecko does not poison the carnivores. There is no case that has been reported of an animal that died after feeing on Wall Gecko.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wall Geckos are safe and harmless reptiles whose meat does not poison either human beings or carnivores. The meat do not contain toxins that may lead to food poisoning.</p>
<p>However, the skin and mouthpart of Wall Gecko contain pathogens and harmful bacteria, which may cause food poisoning and therefore should not be eaten. Proper care and precautions should be taken when preparing a Wall Gecko meat for a meal.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may even desire to see a dragon live. Can you imagine having your own pet dragon at home? So,
<em>what pet lizards that look like Dragon?�</em>
**In summary, **
<em>pet lizards that look like dragons include Chinese Water Dragons, Bearded Dragons, Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks, Plumed Basilisks, Crested Geckos, Draco Lizards, Green Iguanas, Armadillo Lizards, Horned Lizards, Sailfin Dragons and Frilled Dragons among others.</em></p>
<h2 id="5-pet-lizards-that-look-like-dragons">5 Pet Lizards That Look Like Dragons.</h2>
<h3 id="1-bearded-dragons">1. Bearded Dragons.</h3>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/group/bearded-dragon/">bearded Dragon</a>
, scientifically called
<em>Pogona vitticeps,</em>
is an intermediate <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> that looks fiercer and resembles tiny dragon. It has mild personalities and doesnt post much threat to humanity  they are friendly in nature and enjoy much interaction with people as well as love close attention.</p>
<p>When fully grown, Breaded dragon measures 60 cm or 2 feet long and can live for 5 to 10 years when taken care of well. Normally, Bearded Dragon is omnivore. It can feed on fruits and
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-tomatoes/">vegetables</a>
as well as dust insects (crickets) with high calcium level. When trained, some bearded dragon can feed on dead insect mixed with fresh vegetables.</p>
<p>For the beginners level, this is the best <a href="/posts/healthy-pets-rodent-control/">pet</a> lizard dragon that you can give priorities. .The reptile is easier to handle and can be a nice pet for young responsible children  they rarely attack kids.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, Bearded Dragon is a perfect example for anyone who desires to have a pet dinosaur or dragon at home. The lizards does not feed too much (low maintenance) and is calm and responsive to the owner.</li>
<li>The Bearded dragons are native to Australia and live in arid, semi-arid and rocky environment. Therefore, as pet lizards, they should be provided with similar environment.</li>
<li>Their cage should have shallow dish or basin water to ensure that they are kept hydrated. Expose your pet Bearded dragon to light bulb designed purposely for reptiles (you can get these in your nearby pet store).
A threated Bearded dragon has an expanded throat with standing spikes which flattens when the lizards calms and gets contented. It is easier to train Bearded Dragon for some activities such as feeding and recognition. Bearded dragons are the most common pet lizards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-chinese-water-dragons">2. Chinese Water Dragons.</h3>
<p>The
<a href="http://digimorph.org/specimens/Physignathus_cocincinus/">Chinese Water Dragon (<em>Physignathus cocincinus</em>)</a>
is a small lizard that looks like tiny Iguana and resembles a small dragon. When fully mature, the Chinese Water Dragon can reach 60 cm to 90 cm or 2 to 3 feet. They live 10 to 15 years though some can even reach 20 years of age under special care.</p>
<p>This reptile is an omnivore and best suitable for intermediate level pet owners.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese Water Dragon are not expensive to take care of, however, they need more maintenance than other lizards. They love climbing on rocks and branches  their cage should therefore provide such options to keep them active.</li>
<li>These pets are common in various places and are considered more friendly and lovely due to their color, size and behavior. They love being handle by their owner  this reduces any aggressive level that may arose in them.</li>
<li>Chinese Water Dragon is a social reptile. It is able to tolerate other animals in the cage without rebellion. When threatened or scared, Chinese Water Dragon usually whip its tail or rather bite (slightly) for defense purpose.
Chinese Water Dragon love swimming a lot. A sizable pod or dishwater should be provided in the cage to keep it hydrated. Ensure the enclosure is 80% humid for better survival of your pet Chinese Water Dragon</li>
</ul>
<p>Chinese Water Dragon love running along the wall and rubbing against it. A larger area cage would do better and bottom lining of the cage is necessary to prevent themselves from skin damage due to scratch.</p>
<h3 id="3-red-eyed-crocodile-skink">3. Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink.</h3>
<p>Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks (
<em>Tribolonotus gracilis</em>
) are medium sized lizards that look like master dragon. They are best for the intermediate pet owners since they have a higher intelligent level.</p>
<p>When fully grown, Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink measures 10 to 18 cm and lives for a minimum of 10 years. It is a carnivore reptile that needs a lot of calcium supplement always when feeding.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink has a protruding and serrated back with a long tail, which resembles a dragon. The lizard is easier and cheaper to maintain. It requires about 23-gallon aquarium to serve adequately a single pair.</li>
<li>Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks have orange rings around their eyes that makes them unique and their eyes turn red with time due to their variation in their emotional levels.</li>
<li>These lizards are friendly and attractive to keep. Their movement and eye orientation offer a perfect attraction look to the viewers.
Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks are native in tropical forest of the New Guinea and Equatorial climates. They love climbing trees and scurrying on the ground thus such options should be provided in their closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks are not picky when feeding. They love being handled often and will make loud sound or play dead if scared or frightened.</p>
<p>Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks love playing in hideouts. You should therefore provide hiding options and large enclosure for running when playing.</p>
<h3 id="4-plumedgreen-basilisks">4. Plumed/Green Basilisks.</h3>
<p><a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/23/4363">Plumed Basilisks (<em>Basiliscus plumifrons</em>)</a>
, commonly known as Green Basilisks or Jesus Christ lizards are beautiful green-scaled lizards that resemble dragons. They have crown-like head adornment, which gives them power and mighty appearance.</p>
<p>Plumed Basilisk measures between 2 to 3 feet when fully grown and lives for up to 10 years. They are bright green in color with blue specs.</p>
<p>These lizards love to roam a lot within the cage and therefore, large space should be provided. They like digging small holes and climbing walls and trees. Such provisions should be available in the enclosure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plumed Basilisks are native in Central America, especially in Costa Rica and Guatemala. They are found in dense forest, rivers and large waterways due to food abundance and escape mechanism (running on water). You can also find them in Nicaragua, West Panama and Eastern Honduras.</li>
<li>Plumed Basilisks feed on live bugs such as locust, mealworms and crickets. They can also eat small fish or snake by swallowing them whole. This tells you that Plumed Basilisks are carnivores in nature.
You can bond with Plumed Basilisks with time though they love having their quiet moments, especially after feeding. �These reptiles have unique personalities that you may not find with other lizards. They are hard to find around but amazing to pet in your home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then threatened, Plumed Basilisk usually run across the water body instead of swimming and hence their nickname Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Plumed Basilisks dont like being handle much and are therefore not recommended for beginner pet owners. They are considered advance lizard of a higher intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="5-crested-geckos">5. Crested Geckos.</h3>
<p>The Crested Geckos (
<em>Correlophus (Rhacodactylus) ciliatus</em>
) are smaller lizards that are characterized by spiny Scales and large eyes that make it look like a small dragon. Though their number is not large, they are very popular due to their cool behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crested Gecko measures 7 to 9 inches when fully grown and can live for 10 to 20 years. These lizards have maintenance cost and thus easier to take care of.</li>
<li>They love running and climbing on the wall (due to their sticky feet) and therefore, you should provide rocks and branches in the cage for them to explore during the night.</li>
<li>Crested Geckos are nocturnal lizards. They love to carry their activities during the night instead of the daylight. Their cage dont necessarily need lighting system.
Crested Geckos are omnivore and will basically feed on insects such as crickets, silkworms and waxworms as well as fruits.</li>
</ul>
<p>These lizards very docile. They often try to jump out when being held at the first time though with time, they would get familiar with the owner.</p>
<p>When stressed or scared, Crested Gecko will drop its tail (defense/protection mechanism) which does not grow back.</p>
<p>Crested Geckos are native to New Caledonia. They inhabit Rain forests canopies are often seen at night jumping from branches.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dragons are mythical serpent like creatures that depict epitome of power according to various communities in the world.</p>
<p>There are various lizards such as Chinese Water Dragons, Bearded Dragons, Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink, Plumed Basilisks, Crested Geckos, Draco Lizard, Green Iguana, Armadillo Lizard and Horned Lizard that resembles dragons. You can keep any as your home pet dragon.</p>

<h2 id="caresheet-for-your-red-eyed-crocodile-skink">Caresheet for Your Red Eyed Crocodile Skink</h2>
<h3 id="1-housing">1. Housing</h3>
<p>The Red-eyed croc skinks are mainly found in New Guinea and other locations with cool and moist weather. These creatures will climb onto the low-lying decor and branches but they aren&rsquo;t huge climbers.
Therefore, on space, Red-eyed croc skinks value floor space more compared to the height in their enclosure. So, get an enclosure or tank that is roughly 18&quot; by 18&quot; or 30&quot; by 12&quot;.
For instance, check the �Zilla&rsquo;s 200-long� or the Exo Terra&rsquo;s Small as they&rsquo;ll give the reptile a great housing space. The croc skinks will live best as a male and a female or just singly. Females will be territorial and defensive when places together while males tend to fight.
You should keep the croc skinks in tanks or locations that have high humidity - and you may require to use some moss covering such as the New Zealand sphagnum. These help in holding moisture while also increasing the spaces&rsquo; humidity.
Further, such as an environment with foliage cover that is low lying (plus taller foliage) offers great hiding spots and increases the creatures&rsquo; comfort - check the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6356264/">Welfare Assessment Method</a>
.
Some live-planted enclosures may also work while hiding places such as Exo-terra hanging plants, Exo terra fern, or Exo terra rock hides give suitable places for ducking into.</p>
<h3 id="2-temperament">2. Temperament</h3>
<p>Croc skinks don&rsquo;t like being handled - you&rsquo;ll notice that they&rsquo;ll be quiet and stiff when held in the hands. This shows that they&rsquo;re looking for an opportunity to escape to safety - as they&rsquo;re not happy when held.
But you can handle the Croc skinks, although not regularly, you must give them the right environment - such as holding the reptiles during the daylight hours - this is particularly so if this coincides with the reptiles feeding or eating time.</p>
<h3 id="3temperatures--lighting">3.�Temperatures &amp; Lighting</h3>
<p>The Croc skinks love temperatures that are humid and cool - but they&rsquo;ll also rely on thermoregulation for body-temperature control.
Thus, you&rsquo;ll need to offer a cool and hot side in the reptile&rsquo;s enclosure (for these
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540286/">Ptyodactylus)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>place cool elements on one side and then the heat elements on the opposite side.
Ensure that the warm-side temperature must not be over 82 degrees - you can increase the enclosure temperature using either the Zoo-Med heat pad or Exo terra that can be placed underneath that enclosure.
Make sure that the other parts of the tank or enclosure are maintained at about 72 to 75-degree. When temperatures drop at night (to about 70 degrees), use quality temperature gauges such as the Exo Terras Thermometer.
For lig
hting, utilize the Exo-Terras light (LED-type), as this will assist in illuminating the housing, tank, or enclosure - and they won&rsquo;t add heat - and since these reptiles are nocturnal - they won&rsquo;t require UVB lighting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-feeding">4. Feeding</h3>
<p>The Croc skinks love eating insects - you can give them
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/flying-ants-vs-termites/">various feeder bug</a>
types. But the reptiles can also be given pinky mice occasionally.
Further, you can use the Exo-terras dish to feed the Croc skinks with worms - therefore, the worms won&rsquo;t burrow into that su
bstrate prior to getting eaten by Croc skinks.
Ensure to offer the Croc skinks with the required food - this may include providing appropriate calcium with D3. among other calcium supplements.</p>
<h3 id="5-humidity">5. Humidity</h3>
<p>Provide the reptiles with an average-sized water dish having fresh water - but don&rsquo;t get a very deep one; I recommend getting some non-porous bowls (naturalistic) such as the Flukers-rock dish or the Exo-Terra bowls.
Also, ensure daily changing of the water - particularly if the lizard is fond of kick-bedding in the water. Do once-weekly scrubbing of the bowls as this will hinder bacteria build-up.
For these aquatic Croc skinks, you may make the tank or enclosure to be half water and half land. Thes creatures love a 80 to 95% humidity - particularly in the wild.
To achive and mainatin such a high humidity, ypou may need to hoise some plexiglass or towel over a section of the screen - but also mainatin fresh aeration.
You may mist the Croc skinks&rsquo; ensosure a few times daily - to achiecve excelent moisture - but also use a humidty -gauge while using misters such as the Zoo-Med0-fogger or Exo-Terra-monsoon automatic mister.</p>
<h2 id="red-eyed-crocodile-skink-care">Red Eyed Crocodile Skink Care</h2>
<p>There are several elements that make up good red-eyed crocodile skink husbandry. The first one is the enclosure.
The enclosure should be a 10-gallon aquarium or any other tank but of a similar size. A 10-gallon tank can host two skinks but you should ensure the screen type allows maximum ventilation.
Do not put two male lizards together or else they will fight to the death.� These lizards are not tree dwellers but they do have excellent climbing skills so also consider this when choosing an enclosure.
Enclosure accessories are the next element. You can make use of fake plants but just know that this is not positive for humidity. You can just go for natural plants but just ensure that they are herbicide-free.
Foliage and shrubbery will do because they offer protection and volume inside the enclosure. Add some rocks and logs so that the lizards have a place to hide and a place to bask hence promoting thermoregulation and reducing pressure on the animal.
Water is life in the enclosure so ensure that you place it in a shallow dish so that the lizard can walk in and out without drowning. You have to remove the dish if you will be feeding the skinks live crickets.
Crickets will jump inside the dish and drown (Skinks do not eat dead prey). The other element is the temperature. You should always have two thermometers for purpose of having the correct temperature is maintained.
The red-eyed crocodile skink does not like too much heat. If there is a lamp then ensure there is a hedge of protection that stops accidental burns. This should also be done for the basking lights but you can also just raise the lamp from the floor. Temperatures should not go beyond 72 degrees.
Everyone has an opinion about lighting. I have mine too. My skinks are healthy and none of them suffered from metabolic bone disease. I have no UV light, just a compact fluorescent light. The substrate should be appealing and easy to clean. A reptile carpet will do.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFg0ttnAv7Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFg0ttnAv7Y</a></p>
<h2 id="how-to-care-for-eggs-and-crocodile-young-ones">How to care for Eggs and Crocodile Young ones</h2>
<p>For the ultimate results in hatching, artificial incubation is recommended. You do this by removing the eggs from where the nest and transfer them, half-buried and slightly ventilated.
The container can be filled with some moist peat moss ( not wet ) but you should be careful not to reposition the egg from its original position. The juveniles must eat every day and their food should be dusted with calcium supplements during every other mealtime.
Water should not be added to the incubation medium unless necessary. An indented egg is dead or dehydrated. Sweating eggs are a common phenomenon but too much of it is a danger signal.
The egg incubation period could last up to 85 days at temperatures of around 73 to 81 degrees. The hatchlings come into the world weighing about 3 to 5 grams and are 6 to 8 centimeters long. They will start searching for food in hours. These wonderful creatures live up to 10 years in captivity.</p>
<h2 id="red-eyed-crocodile-skink-ailments">Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink Ailments</h2>
<p>Very little is known about diseases and parasites that could infect the red-eyed crocodile skink. What is known is that skinks can die suddenly even when healthy.
So you have to check several things when buying one as a pet. Examine it for any parasites. Check to see if it has any wounds or deformities. The eyes should be shiny and bright.
Study their demeanor. These guys are the masters of staying alert. They can play dead, try to run away, or vocalize when handled.
The best step to take is to quarantine the new pet and ensure a fecal exam is done. Deworming comes high on my list. Ensure the skink gets its calcium and vitamin D3.</p>
<h2 id="types-ofred-eyed-crocodile-skink">Types ofRed-Eyed Crocodile skink</h2>
<p>The red-eyed crocodile skink is a type of lizard that hails from the Tribolonotus genus. You will find eight other species in this genus but the red-eyed crocodile skink is the most common.
The scientific name for this lizard is Tribolonotus Gracilis. People started keeping the red-eyed crocodile skink as a pet in the mid-1990s.
They were and are still fascinated by the fact that these lizards are like miniature crocodiles and the only difference is that the skink is so shy. Do not forget why it is called the red-eyed crocodile skink because a red ring encircles its beautiful eyes.
As we had mentioned before, the red-eyed crocodile skink is not the only member of its family. There are eight other types of skink and it is important to know them too.
Out of these eight, only two species can be kept as pets. These are the novaeguineade and Tribolonotus gracilis.
These lizards are commonly found in Irian Jaya, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea.� The other six species that are left to roam the wild are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annectens</li>
<li>Blanchardi</li>
<li>Brongersmai</li>
<li>Pseudoponceleti</li>
<li>Ponceleti</li>
<li>Schmidti
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEfZZFP3-CE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEfZZFP3-CE</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-red-eyed-crocodile-skink">Characteristics of Red-Eyed Crocodile skink</h2>
<p>For you to be able to care well for the red-eyed crocodile skink, you will need to know the character it possesses. First and foremost, this skink has stout legs. Its underbelly is as majestic as its eyes, it&rsquo;s cream-colored.
You already know why it is called red-eyed but do you know why the word crocodile is also included? Its scales are curved backward and they have tapered points plus it has four dorsal rows that look like those of a crocodile.
The young ones have the same type of body and skin as that of the adults but their eyes have no reddish/orange scales. The adults have a solid reddish-orange color around their eyes. The red-eyed crocodile lizard can grow up to 10 inches.
They are quiet and shy but are not afraid to vocalize their frustrations when under duress. They will do this when there is a captor around. If this does not work then they will do the old trick of playing dead.
The babies play dead more often than the adults while the entire species will not hesitate to drop their tails when startled.� During mating, both males and females make unique sounds.</p>
<h2 id="red-eyed-crocodile-skink-home">Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink Home</h2>
<p>The T gracilis is a tropical lizard and can withstand high temperatures of 81 degrees and if the temperatures are low then they can be as low as 73 degrees.
These lizards are normally found under the debris of the forest. They dig and create nests. This is usually done near water because these guys cannot go 24 hours without water or else they die.
However, there is a problem of deforestation that has seen their natural habitat destroyed and has led to them creating and adapting to living in coconut plantations. They fit in well with the coconut husks.</p>
<h2 id="red-eyed-crocodile-skink-diet">Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink Diet</h2>
<p>These lizards usually go for grubs, insects, and small worms. You should note that these lizards like their meals alive and fresh plus the food size should be half the size of their head.
The young ones and hatchlings are to eat 2-3 food items once each food item daily while the adults can do with the same portion every other day.
Employ gut loading whereby you feed leafy vegetables to the prey a day or two before feeding it to the skink. This ensures that the prey lives longer.

<h2 id="how-to-breed-your-red-eyed-crocodile-skinks">How to Breed your Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks</h2>
<p>You should note that red-eyed crocodile skinks are violent towards members of their similar sex unless it is a pair and their babies. These can actually live apart in the same enclosure.
Pairs will always be extremely aggressive especially when a baby is on the way.�The red-eyed crocodile skink becomes sexually active from the ages of around 3 and 4 years.
Their throat color turns orange as they approach this age. The males are larger than the females but this is not always the case. Check the underside, male skinks are greyish blue and have raised pores.
The females have two ovaries but only the one on the right functions. The eggs in the left ovary travel from the left side to the right side if they are to stand a chance. The females lay up to six eggs. Each egg is laid and buried. This happens every week for six weeks.
Remember, they are not only shy but secretive. You should condition an adult pair prior to breeding. Let them settle in their new environment. The period of pairing should be from June to September. Feeding is after one day.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Red-Eyed crocodile skink is a wonderful creature that requires gentle hands. They do not bite and no, you can not handle them as a beginner.
They need a good pair of hands but once you keep one, you will love it. There is beauty in their mysterious lifestyle.
I hope this red-eyed crocodile skink care guide has been of great help and now that you are totally informed, your reptile pet-keeping ways are truly reformed.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do bearded dragons eat? For a healthy life, it is important to feed your bearded dragon with a proper balanced diet. As a
smart omnivore
, this dragon either eats fruits, plant or animal products/ supplements.
Maybe you have come across a bearded dragon in the fields, zoo or probably own one and wonders what this reptile eats.
*So, what do Bearded Dragons Eat? Well, these reptiles feed on fruits such as tomatoes, apples, guavas, bananas, berries, figs, watermelons, mangoes, papayas, grapes, kiwi, apricots, pears or plums. *
<em>Bearded Dragons can also feed on vegetables/greens such as cabbages, celery, sweet potatoes, peas, green beans, courgette, butternut squash, okra, bell pepper, clover, turnip green, mustard green, coriander or collard/ kales.�</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Bearded Dragons&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-do-bearded-dragons-eat-7-tips">What Do Bearded Dragons Eat? 7 Tips</h2>
<p>Also, you can feed your bearded dragon with animals like crickets, earthworms, cockroaches, mealworms, waxworms, butter worms, Dubia roaches, silkworms, locust or king worms.</p>
<h3 id="1-fruits-eaten-bybearded-dragons">1. Fruits Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-tomatoes"><strong>a. Tomatoes�</strong></h4>
<p>Tomatoes are ideal meal for your bearded dragon
as they are the main source of vitamin A, which promotes good vision, skin development and protein synthesis.
However, it is dangerous to feed your dragon with excess of these fruits. Tomatoes contain oxalic acid (not easily excreted) which inhibits absorption of calcium needed for bone development.
Importantly, avoid feeding your pet bearded dragon with tomatos leaves, stem or flowers since these parts contain alkaloids such as solanine and tomatine, which negatively affects its health, and alter its physiological processes greatly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSH8c6AZ1k&amp;amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSH8c6AZ1k&amp;amp;t=2s</a></p>
<h4 id="b-apples"><strong>b. Apples�</strong></h4>
<p>Apples for bearded dragons
are an essential fruit as they contain 1% of vitamin A, 5% of Vitamin K and 14% of vitamin C, which enhances good vision and development. When feeding, it is necessary to peel the apples and slice them into sizable pieces that can be chewed and swallowed smoothly without chocking the lizard.
Apples have high-level Calories (95%) and 4g fibers per fruit that will boost your dragons energy and reduce indigestion problems.
Moreover, apples large quantities of magnesium and potassium minerals, which improves development and immune system of your Breaded Dragon.</p>
<h3 id="c-bananas"><strong>c. Bananas�</strong></h3>
<p>Peal your bananas and slice them into small pieces before feeding your bearded dragon if unripe. Most beardies wont eat banana peels unless they are grown under natural care.
You should feed your pet beardie with banana occasionally (maybe once or twice a month). Why because, bananas contain high levels of phosphorous that binds the calcium in the body (inhibits its intake) and thus may end up causing metabolic bone disease (calcium deficiency disease).</p>
<h3 id="d-berries"><strong>d. Berries�</strong></h3>
<p>Berries such as blackberries, raspberries, strawberries or blueberries can be fed to bearded dragon as they add extra water content to the blood stream. In addition, berries contain rich fiber-networks that improves digestion process - just like the
<em>cantaloupe.�</em>
Berries should be fed directly without peeling or mashing. However, wild picked berries should be cleaning thoroughly before feeding or you avoid them since they may contain toxins or harmful pests.
Blackberries are slightly harder and can be split for easier swallowing.�Blueberries should be given occasionally since they contain oxalates that binds calcium leading to metabolic bone disease.
<strong>e. Papaya and watermelon</strong>
Papaya and watermelon contain sugary taste that attracts your beardies for extra feeding. They have strong fiber content that prevents your beardie from constipation. You can also
feed your bearded dragons with cucumber
.
Though necessary, the excess water content found in these fruits may be dangerous as they may lead to over hydration and runny poo.�Therefore, it is recommended that you supplement these fruits with main meal and use them occasionally (twice per month).
<strong>f. Cherries and plums</strong>
Cherries have high level of potassium necessary for fluid balance regulation and blood pressure reduction. However, excess eating may lead to calcium inhibition and thus cherries should be fed once per week as a supplement to main meal.
Apart from water content addition, plums have fibers that help prevent constipation. It also contain iron, calcium and magnesium minerals necessary for growth and development.
It is necessary to remove the central seeds found in cherry and plum as they may cause impaction to your bearded dragon.
<strong>g. Grapes and mangoes</strong>
Grapes contains a high level of
calcium necessary for bone strengthening
. You will need to slice them into small pieces for easier swallowing.
Grapes also have fair level of oxalate and phosphorous thus should be supplemented with other main meal.�Like grapes, mangoes have fibers that help in digestion of your beardie.
The sugary component in mangoes makes them favorite to beardies. However, these fruits have high level of oxalate that binds and inhibits calcium absorption. They should, therefore, be fed twice or thrice per month and be supplemented with other main feeds.</p>
<h3 id="2-vegetablesgreenseaten-bybearded-dragons">2. Vegetables/Greens�Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-cabbages"><strong>a. Cabbages</strong></h4>
<p>Cabbages are essential meal for your bearded dragon
since they contain high-energy content (113kJ). They also contain strong fibers (prevents constipation), water and vitamin A, C, &amp; K necessary for growth and development.
Moreover, magnesium, iron, zinc and manganese minerals are also plenty - just like
broccoli for bearded dragons
. Notably, cabbages have high level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (2:1) which prevents occurrence of metabolic bone disease.
Ensure that green or red cabbages are thoroughly washed (to remove harmful chemicals or insects) and sliced into sizable pieces before feeding your bearded dragon.�Minimize use of purple cabbages since they are highly acidic.</p>
<h4 id="b-sweet-potatoes"><strong>b. Sweet potatoes</strong></h4>
<p>Normally,
bearded dragons dont eat
raw sweet potatoes. They may feed on peels, but occasionally. Actually, raw sweet potatoes are great challenge to chewing as most beardies swallow food as a whole.
However, these lizards will eat mashed or cooked sweet potatoes.
You can also supplement your beardies main meal with sweet potatoes vines, which should be chopped well. But
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-carrots/">bearded dragons can also eat carrots</a>
.
The relative level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (1:1.56) make it inappropriate to use sweet potatoes as daily meal.
Sweet potatoes vines have rich fiber networks that help in preventing constipation.</p>
<h4 id="c-green-beans-and-peas"><strong>c. Green beans and peas</strong></h4>
<p>Green beans and peas are ideal meal for your beardies as they contain high-energy content (131 kJ), vitamins A, C&amp;K as well as calcium, magnesium and iron minerals.
You can either feed your beardies with green pods or vines, which need to be chopped into small sizes first.�The relative calcium to phosphorous ratio of these greens means that they can only be used occasionally (once or twice per week.).
Beans or peas pods and vines have rich fiber content, which will help prevent your bearded dragon from indigestion problems.�You need to clean green peas and beans before feeding your pet bearded dragon so as to remove any toxic chemical or poisonous insects (fireflies).</p>
<h4 id="d-corianders-or-kales"><strong>d. Corianders or Kales</strong></h4>
<p>Corianders are rich in fibers, vitamin (A, C, E&amp;K) and minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, copper and phosphorous.�This occasion meal should be fed once per week. The relatively high calcium: phosphorous ratio means that overfeeding/excess use will lead to metabolic bone disease.
Kales are rich source of vitamin K and C as well as magnesium mineral. Kales also have thiamine that boost the immunity of your beardie. However, these green should only be supplemented with the main meal.
Notably, corianders or Kales are acidic in nature thus will alter the pH of digestive track leading to indigestion problems.</p>
<h3 id="3-animals--animal-products-eaten-bybearded-dragons">3. Animals / Animal Products Eaten by�Bearded Dragons</h3>
<h4 id="a-crickets-and-locusts"><strong>a. Crickets and Locusts</strong></h4>
<p>Crickets and locusts are staple insects to feed your bearded dragon. They have high level of proteins necessary for growth and development of your pet lizard.
Crickets and locusts also contain a large quantity of iron needed to strengthen teeth and bones. When feeding your beardie, remove the legs to allow easier swallowing and slice large locust where possible.
Baby beardies should only be fed with small locust/crickets (1-10 days).</p>
<h4 id="b-earthworm"><strong>b. Earthworm</strong></h4>
<p>Earthworms are major source of calcium for your bearded dragon. They are also fatty, thus should not be used as the main diet  too much fat accumulation will make your pet docile.
Purchase earthworms from vet approved vendors.
Avoid feeding your beardies with wild picked earthworms, as they may be poisonous.</p>
<h4 id="c-silkworm"><strong>c. Silkworm</strong></h4>
<p>Silkworms have soft bodies that make its swallowing easier. They contain high protein and calcium level needed for growth and development.
Bearded dragon (of any age) can be fed using silkworm as basic diet. Actually, you can use silkworms as main meal since they contain low-fat levels and are highly nutritious.
Silkworms also contain minerals such as magnesium, iron, sodium as well as vitamin B1, B2 and B3 that help boost immunity.</p>
<h4 id="d-mealworm"><strong>d. Mealworm</strong></h4>
<p>The tasty mealworms are known to be the most favorite of bearded dragons meals. They contain high fat level and thus should be used occasionally with other feeds such as fruits and vegetables.
Mealworms should be fed, mostly, to beardies aged 5-6 years.�Though Mealworms contains proteins and calcium, the quantity is quite low as compared to silkworms and earthworms.
<strong>e. Waxworm</strong>
Just like mealworms and silkworms, waxworms are fatty meals that should be fed to your bearded dragon occasionally in order to avoid abnormal weight accumulation, which may make it inactive.
Supplement 2-12 waxworms with vegetables and fruits per week. Waxworms are best diet for fattening young beardies.
<strong>f. Dubia roaches</strong>
Dubia roaches are the best insect meal for your bearded dragons as they contain 50% proteins (necessary for growth) and 61% moisture content. They have fairly soft bodies, which make your breaded dragons chew and digest them easily.
Unlike crickets, Dubia roaches have high calcium: phosphorous ration and thus enhance prevention of metabolic bone disease.�The top benefits of Dubia roaches is that they are quiet, never jump a lot, dont smell, live longer and are easier to breed.
What Can&rsquo;t Bearded Dragons eat? Which Foods Do You Avoid From Feeding Your Bearded Dragon?�Breaded dragons are very sensitive to some meals. You need therefore need to be very cautious of every diet you feed them. Avoid feeding your bearded dragon with some of the following meals:
<strong>g. Oranges</strong>
Oranges have high quantity of citric acid that causes throat discomfort and hurt burn. In addition, too much accumulation of acid content will inactivate digestive enzymes reaction leading to indigestion problems.
Oranges also have excess sugars that may cause tooth decay and excess diarrhea to your bearded dragon.
<strong>f. Avocados</strong>
Though avocados have good fiber content, they shouldnt be fed to bearded dragons since they contain excess oxalate that binds calcium and prevent its absorption in digestive track. This may lead to metabolic bone disease at long run.
**g. Rhubarb **
Rhubarbs have high content of oxalic acid and nephrotoxin that damages the kidneys of your bearded dragons when eaten. They also cause watery diarrhea and muscular weakness of beardie.
In case of consumption, seek immediate assistance from a veterinary.
<strong>h. Spinach and beet tops</strong>
These vegetables have chemical that binds calcium in the digestive system thus inhibiting it from absorption into the bloodstream. This, with time, may lead to calcium deficiency that cause metabolic bone disease.
<strong>i. Lighting insects</strong>
All insect that glow (produces light) such as fireflies should be avoided as they contain toxic chemical, which may poison/kill your bearded dragon when eaten.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-to-feed-on-bearded-dragons">What Not to Feed on Bearded Dragons</h2>
<h3 id="1-oranges">1. Oranges</h3>
<p><a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-oranges/">Oranges</a></p>
<h3 id="2-onions">2. Onions</h3>

<h2 id="what-do-baby-bearded-dragons-eat">What do Baby Bearded Dragons eat?</h2>
<p>Baby Bearded Dragon will need a special care through proper feeding habit and health attention (use vet for regular medical check-up).
It is important to feed your baby beardie with more insect (especial Dubia roaches) than vegetables. Insects contains high protein level, fat and minerals that is needed at the young stage for growth and development.
Fruits such as grapes, peeled bananas and berries should be supplemented with mealworms or silkworms to boost the breadies feeding habit.
Though baby bearded dragon do eat vegetables, normally they climb on them when left in the cage. You will need to mix vegetables with some insects and monitor the feeding for 10-15 minutes.
Feed your baby beardie 1-2 times more that you feed adult ones. A baby bearded dragon aged 4-16 years should eat 40-60 insects per day. At juvenile stage, supplement their main diet with calcium and multi-vitamins powder to boost their growth and immunity.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-feed-a-bearded-dragon">How to Feed a Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>When feeding breaded dragon, it is necessary to follow the following steps and instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never feed your bearded dragon with dead insects. Always introduced live insect in the cage and allow the beardie to hunt  this create an exercise chance and boost its psychology.</li>
<li>All vegetable feeds should be washed thoroughly; freshly chopped and fed while wet water ease swallowing and reduces dehydration.</li>
<li>When feeding your bearded dragon, ensure that the chopped pieces are lesser than the space between its eyes.</li>
<li>Feed your bearded dragon for a given period (10-20minutes) and then carry the leftovers. Most of these beardies never stop eating - they may end up being docile because of excess feeding.</li>
<li>Peel and chop all fruit meals that you feed your bearded dragon.</li>
<li>It is necessary to mix vegetable/fruits with insects when feeding your bearded dragon to improve the nutrition level.
Never feed your bearded dragon directly into its mouth (this may cause health complication or impaction). You should, therefore, place all the meals in a dish to allow self-feeding unless the beardie is sick and needs medical attention.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bearded dragon can eat either fruits (apple, grapes, berries), vegetables (cabbages, green beans, corianders) or animals such as crickets, roaches, silkworms and locust.
Avoid feeding your beardies with avocados, rhubarbs, spinach, onions or fireflies as they negatively affect their health. Mix plant diet with animal feed to improve the nutritional value.
You will also need to supplement meals with calcium and multi-vitamin powder to boost growth and immunity of your bearded dragon further. Importantly, do not overfeed your dragon as they end up being docile.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chameleons are famous for changing colors. A�coat of many colors is a story about a little girl who had a coat that was not just one <a href="/posts/paint-colors-to-brighten-a-dark-room/">color</a>. She takes it to church with her and everyone admires the colors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a chameleon!�Just like peacocks, a chameleon will change color depending on its mood changes, temperature, or body language.</p>
<p>This is thanks to its three pigments; brown, black, and red.�So, really, what do chameleon colors mean?�Well, the following reasons are the most likely.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Chameleon will change to darker colors such as black when stressed or to neutral colors such as beige or light brown when in a relaxed state. But, if they are happy, they will turn to brighter colors such as green. **</li>
<li>**On the other hand, to show aggression or excitement, chameleons will turn to brighter colors such as orange, red, bright blue, or green. **</li>
<li>**In addition, a chameleon will change color depending on temperature. For example, when it gets cold outside, the chameleon changes their skin pigment to black - this helps them absorb more heat. **
In this article, we will talk (in detail) about the colors of a chameleon. You&rsquo;ll learn what they mean.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="in-a-hurry-check-these-chameleon-cages"><strong>In a Hurry? Check these Chameleon Cages</strong></h1>
<p>[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Chameleon Cages&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-normal-chameleon-coloration">What&rsquo;s the Normal Chameleon Coloration?</h2>
<p>Chameleons of different species are either brown or green when they&rsquo;re in their normal (neutral or resting) state, but the hue will depend on the natural habitat of the animal.
*For instance; *</p>
<ul>
<li>Panther chameleons are the only species that&rsquo;ll turn bright red and so others like my favorite chameleon; the Veiled chameleon cannot.</li>
<li>Further, other small brown to black chameleon species will only affect color change on their skin between the ranges of brown to black.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-show-aggression-bright-colors-like-bright-green-or-red">1. Show Aggression: Bright Colors like bright green or red</h3>
<p>Male chameleons quickly change the skin to bright colors to display their aggression as they defend their territory.
They&rsquo;ll display quick and explosive skim-color changes - white, yellow, blue, bright green, or red (all bright colors). It&rsquo;ll also show dark green spots, brown spots &amp; stripes, and yellow stripes.</p>
<p>Chameleons will use these color changes to frighten and warn the opponents attacking their territory while also making them visible in their surroundings such as when among green trees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, the chameleon may show bright colors to assert itself.
However;</li>
<li>When a male chameleon believes that it&rsquo;s weaker than its opponent, it&rsquo;ll mute or dim its colors as a sign of submission or defeat.
During the mating season, male chameleons will be more aggressive to attract mates (females) by showing bright colors.</li>
<li>The chameleon will flatten its body sideways to displays the colors; these are yellow with green stripes and a black lining or red and pale blue stripes with black outline or blotches.
For example, as your veiled chameleon&rsquo;s ages, they&rsquo;ll become highly dominant and aggressive and hence reacting with the aggressive colors - bright colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, you&rsquo;ll find it easy to pick or touch that young veiled chameleon compared to the older one.</p>
<p>Also, like other reptiles, veiled chameleons express themselves through posture and body language.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, when startled or threatened the veiled chameleons may hiss (opening their jaws), raise one foot in the air, swell out their chest, and puff up their throat.

</ul>
<h3 id="2-relaxed-mood-neutral-colors-like-pale-brown-or-light-green">2. Relaxed Mood: Neutral Colors like Pale brown or Light green</h3>
<p>When chameleons are resting, they change colors to reflect their current natural habitat such as pale brown or light green as applicable.</p>
<p>The chameleon will also move to a place that matches their color of relaxation (neutral or muted colors such as beige and light brown) to attain more camouflage, and also hide easily if attacked.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the Veiled chameleon will show they&rsquo;re in their relaxed state by changing to mute brown.
Veiled chameleons are terrestrial chameleons and are larger than the other species in this family.</li>
<li>Being ambush predators, they use their color-changing abilities to catch prey by waiting for them to come close.</li>
<li>They can sit still for hours without moving or making a sound so that when something approaches, it will not be aware of what happened until too late.</li>
<li>The colors of the Veiled chameleon are a mixture of various shades of brown and grey, with some patches in deeper reds or yellows.</li>
<li>These beautiful colors show that they&rsquo;re able to adjust their coloration according to what kind of habitat they live in as well as the time during the year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-attract-mates-vibrant-colors">3. Attract Mates: Vibrant colors</h3>
<p>Male chameleons will display brighter or more vibrant colors during specific times of the year when mating season starts up again, which is a great way to catch the eye of a mate.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is their way of showing off to females what a great mate they would make, and also how well-adapted for living in their environment they are.
Some of the bright colors chameleons show during the mating season include red with yellow, white, blue, or black stripes. Others include red hues around the animal&rsquo;s sides and head.
*On the other hand; *</li>
<li>A female chameleon will reject the courting or mating advances from the male chameleon by displaying a warning color such as a white or brown stripe along the animal&rsquo;s body.
*But; *</li>
<li>The female chameleon show willingness to have sex by displaying golden stripes with green and light blue backgrounds
The intensity of the color may vary according to the species of chameleon. The male panther chameleon shows red and yellow color with light green stripes when the mating season approaches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-display-fear">4. Display Fear:</h3>
<p>When in shock or under attack, chameleons will show what is called fear colors which are usually darker colors like black.</p>
<p>For example, your Veiled chameleons will change to
<a href="https://animals.mom.me/identifying-veiled-chameleons-color-mood-5721.html">dark colors</a>
when it is under attack, or it&rsquo;s shocking or in defense.</p>
<p>The color gets darker when the fear level intensifies. This is to help them blend better into their environment when under attack.</p>
<p>The veiled chameleon may even roll into a small ball-shaped body to offer further protection. The chameleon will not change back to its original color until it ensures that its life is fully secured/safe.</p>
<h3 id="5-during-humidity-or-temperature-change">5. During Humidity or Temperature Change</h3>
<p>Environmental changes like humidity or temperature change can cause the chameleon to change color. This is because of how their cells react in these conditions.</p>
<p>Chameleons are ectothermic reptiles, which means they rely on external heat sources for body temperature regulation and cannot do so themselves by generating metabolic heat from aerobic respiration like mammals would with a respiratory system.</p>
<p>Any fall in temperature will force them to change their skin color into dark/black color which enables them to absorb more heat from the surface (this change assumes the camouflaging advantage  the background color may differ with the skin color).</p>
<p>Chameleons will change to brighter colors such as light blue, bright red, light green or white to help them reflect sun rays from their skin surface. Moreover, the skin becomes lighter on a hotter day.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/SQggDnScsvI">https://youtu.be/SQggDnScsvI</a></p>
<h3 id="6-chameleon-to-chameleon-communication">6. Chameleon to Chameleon Communication:</h3>
<p>Just like humans, Chameleons have ways of social communication. Scientists believe that mostly, chameleons change their color to communicate with other counterparts in the colony.</p>
<p>Research shows that female chameleons will change to light or pale green when in courtship/mating season to signal (keep off signal) other male chameleons that may need to relate with them.</p>
<p>In addition, an expectant chameleon changes to black or dark to alert other chameleons to keep off. Jacksons chameleon and Madagascar chameleon are able to send threat communication to other chameleons by changing suddenly to black, dark, or reddish-brown color.</p>
<h3 id="7-show-excitement-and-stimulation">7. Show Excitement and Stimulation**.**</h3>
<p>Chameleon, just like other animals and human beings gets excited. They express such stimulation and excitement by changing their colors.</p>
<p>When the veiled chameleon is excited (maybe when mating or hunting), it changes to dark green, yellow or brown color.</p>
<p>The stimulation due to attack makes the panther chameleon change its skin to dark red, or dull brown, or black color.</p>
<h3 id="8-prevailing-environmental-conditionweather">8. Prevailing environmental condition/weather</h3>
<p>During rainy seasons, chameleons change their skin into dull or dark colors. You will find a Bright colored chameleon in fair weather (not rainy or sunny).</p>
<p>During sunny weather, chameleons such as panthers and Jacksons change their color to bright yellow, bright green, or white. Cold weather makes the chameleon skin change to dull, dark, or black color.</p>
<p>This enables chameleon to absorb more heat from the surrounding which helps in maintaining their internal temperature at optimum.</p>
<ul>
<li>This change of colors in the various environmental conditions is a special form of adaptation for chameleons (temperature regulation).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-scientific-principles-behind-changing-colors-in-chameleons">What are the Scientific Principles Behind Changing colors in Chameleons?</h2>
<p>Chameleons change their colors due to the function of &ldquo;specialized cells&rdquo; called chromatophores or nanocrystals (small crystals).</p>
<ul>
<li>These are pigment-containing and light-sensitive cells, which expand or contract in response to temperature or mood changes for example.</li>
<li>When these specialized cells in chameleon skin undergo contraction (thanks to the iridophores - the spacing between the nanocrystals), they produce patterns on the surface of animal skin that either reflects or absorbs the surrounding light.
But how&rsquo;s this possible?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, reflecting light is the pivotal aspect that determines the color. An object can be either a red or yellow type of color because it reflects longer wavelengths or shorter wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>To understand a chameleons myriad colors, think of the nanocrystals in the iridophores of its skin as mirrors.</p>
<p>The nanocrystals are spaced far apart (the mirrors are longer) when the chameleon is stressed allowing it to reflect brighter colors with longer wavelengths such as yellow and red.</p>
<ol>
<li>The nanocrystals in a chameleon&rsquo;s skin are spaced out far apart when they&rsquo;re stressed. This makes the light reflecting from those cells brighter and is of longer wavelengths like red or yellow.</li>
<li>When relaxed, the nanocrystals are closer together (shorter mirrors) which causes colors with shorter wavelengths to be reflected. These reflective colors include green and blue.</li>
<li>The color change to black in a chameleons skin is attributed to the upper layering of melanin that it disperses in its tail - no nanocrystals are used here. The dark pigment, when cold and chilling out, means its not facing any threat, but rather wants to display its submissive mood.
This is what enables chameleon to blend with their surroundings and it also helps them in temperature regulation as they change their colors according to the ambient temperatures.</li>

<h2 id="do-all-chameleons-change-colors">Do all chameleons change colors?</h2>
<p>Chameleons change colors though not all species have the same speed and ability to change colors that we have discussed above.
Chameleon such as veiled, panther, and Madagascar are able to change into multiple colors such as green, yellow, light blue, and red in less than 20seconds.
However, many chameleon species are only able to change from light to dark colors and vice-versa.
The tree-dwelling chameleons are more vulnerable to predators due to their less capability in changing their colors (they also have minimum color-changing options  they can change to green, blue, or dark/black). These chameleons, then, tend to stay in the canopy as their hideouts.
Chameleons found in arid and semi-arid areas have a weak ability to change to various colors due to temperature variations (high temperature affects the color variations in chameleons).
The panther chameleon rarely camouflages with the background even when in danger. The Jacksons Chameleons skin color is highly controlled by a change in temperature and moods than fear of predation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since most chameleons have dominant green color in their skin melanin, the color tends to darken when they are in a green background due to the cell color reflection (a concept that is highly confused with camouflaging).</li>
<li>The Madagascar lizards are well known to match the green background, which makes it difficult for the predator to sport them.
Though camouflaging plays a role in the protection of chameleon against its predator, it accounts for less than 5 percent as to why chameleons skin change color.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chameleons skin colors reflect its moods, comfort/relaxation, environment or weather conditions as well as stress. Though the camouflage concept of the chameleon plays a role in its predator protection, the effect is less significant.
The ability of chameleons to change their colors varies according to the particular species. The color change in the chameleons skin is coordinated by a shift in iridophores orientations.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What Does a Garden <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">Lizard</a> Eat? A <a href="/posts/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/">garden</a> lizard is a great reptile pet for homeowners. These reptiles� (Calotes Veriscolor ) also known as oriental garden lizards reside in warm areas like Asia.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find these lizards in grass, trees, and bushes. They are always behind the scenes observing their environment quietly.
<em>But the question is, what does a garden lizard feast on?�</em></p>
<ul>
<li>**In summary, garden lizards eat snails, caterpillars, insects, small crickets, and some greens and fruits. They also dont consume much. **<strong>Garden lizards work with small portions at a time</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The oriental garden lizard feeds on insects such as ants, cockroaches, ants, and grasshoppers. They also eat small vertebrates such as rats and also eat other lizards.�</strong>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-a-garden-lizard-eat">What Does a Garden Lizard Eat?</h2>
<p>The garden lizard has teeth and they are used for gripping the prey. They do not tear the prey when eating, they swallow it whole. The young and inexperienced garden lizards normally choke if the prey is too large for them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Baby Snakes- Surprising but true. The garden lizard can eat newly hatched nonpoisonous snakes and there are those that even consume the snake eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Butterflies  Lizards love to eat these colorful creatures and therefore if your garden has plenty of butterflies you can be assured that the lizards will make them an endangered species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cockroaches Garden lizards eat roaches as though they were light snacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their own eggs- At times when the hunger is too much, the lizard will opt to eat its own eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slugs  They will use their teeth to have a grip then swallow the slug effortlessly since a slug is covered in a mucus-like membrane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small lizards- When they are roaming looking for females, the males will eat up other tiny lizards and do so to assert domination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fruits  Garden lizards love fruits and especially berries. Succulent fruits also provide them with water. They also love bananas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-do-small-garden-lizards-eat"><strong>What Do Small Garden Lizards Eat</strong></h3>
<p>The bigger the lizard, the bigger its prey. Small lizards go for small prey such as flies and crickets and if they want more flesh they will go for spiders, snails, and caterpillars.
<strong>Do Garden Lizards Need Water</strong>
Yes, these lizards need water in order to survive and also maintain a healthy amount of moisture on their skin. Garden lizards cannot live without water but at the same time, you should understand that they cannot thrive in places where there is excessive water. They will drown and die. So water levels or amounts should be moderate.
<strong>Do They Have Teeth</strong>
Garden lizards possess teeth and these teeth are used for gripping their food not tearing it apart. The prey is then swallowed whole once its captured.</p>
<h2 id="do-garden-lizards-eat-vegetables-and-plants"><strong>Do Garden Lizards Eat Vegetables And Plants</strong></h2>
<p>You might be led to think that garden lizards eat only meat but in some instances, they eat greens.
<strong>Do Garden Lizards Eat Flying Termites</strong>
Yes, garden lizards eat flying termites. When the termite flies near the lizard, the lizard simply opens its mouth and swallows the termite. Flying termites love to get a glimpse of light and normally fall down on the ground afterward. This makes it easier for the lizard to just gulp them up.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-lizards-live-naturally">Where do Lizards live naturally?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, garden lizards love warm weather hence the reason for their abundance in such climate areas. Secondly, they dwell in grass and trees. Water is essential for their wellbeing and so they live in places where they can have access to water and not become dehydrated. When the weather becomes cold, they will go missing in action and hide under rocks.
<strong>Are They Poisonous, Do They Bite</strong>
Garden lizards are harmless reptiles. Yes, they are related to other poisonous reptiles but they are venom-free. These lizards do bite but as I said before, there is no poison. In fact, when these little fellows bite you, it looks like a small scratch, and a simple dressing will do. They never attack unless they feel they have to.
<strong>How Do I Make My Garden, Lizard Friendly</strong>
The best thing about having the lizards in your garden is that they will eat up all the insects and larvae plus any mosquitoes that could be irritating you. For the lizards to come or stay, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant native grasses</li>
<li>Do some mulching or leave behind some leaf cover</li>
<li>Plant some berries</li>
<li>Have a shallow bowl of water in the garden</li>
<li>If you have a cat, try as much as possible to keep it indoors lest it scares away the lizards</li>
<li>If you can then make a pond that will also attract insects and frogs. Throw in a ramp or stick so that the lizards can get out in case they jump in.
<strong>What to avoid</strong></li>
<li>Avoid using pesticides or any other chemical solution</li>
<li>Do not rake the leaves</li>
<li>Do not capture lizards from the park. Garden lizards find their own habitat</li>
<li>Do not feed the lizards because they have to learn how to fend for themselves
<strong>Some Things To Note</strong>
A lizard cannot control its body temperature so it will be good if you can turn on the sprinklers during the hot summer holidays. When you notice that their tails are down then something is wrong. The lizard could be stressed or hurt by another animal. Again, keep your cat away from the lizard because the cat will make a snack out of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Garden lizards are creatures that simply love a low profile. They will eat all the bugs and cockroaches and be your constant companion in the garden. And as it is said, you are what you eat, and knowing what a lizard eats is the first step in truly knowing the garden lizard so that you can co-exist with them in a mutual manner.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does <a href="/posts/are-lizards-poisonous/">lizard</a> <a href="/posts/what-does-raccoon-poop-look-like/">poop</a> look like?�Reptiles such as salamanders lizards and geckos love to hang around the house. You will find their poop on any surface including your bed, sofa set, and wardrobe among other places.
Certainly, these fecal droppings can create a disgusting mess in the house - particularly after a
heavy meal
. Sometimes, it difficult to differentiate lizard poop from that of rodents and birds.
<em>So, how does lizard poop look like? Lizard poop appears as black droppings with a white substance on one end. The white matter shows the presence of uric acid and its excreted together with the solid waste.�</em>
<em>This is because lizards use one opening (cloaca) to excrete solid waste and urine. The size of the droppings vary according to the size and species of the lizard. Related: What Does Leopard Gecko Eat?</em>
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Food for Lizards&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</p>
<h2 id="what-does-lizard-poop-look-like">What Does Lizard Poop Look Like??</h2>
<h3 id="1-size">1. Size</h3>
<p>If you suspect you have lizards in the house check for black pellet-like droppings about  inch long and 1/8 inch wide. Attached on one end of the poop is the urine crystal which is usually white in color. Thats because lizards poop and pee from the same opening (cloaca).</p>
<h3 id="2-shape">2. Shape</h3>
<p>The droppings might be tapered or rounded at the ends and their size varies with the species and size of lizards. Normally, wild lizards have bigger droppings compared to urban lizards.</p>
<h3 id="3-color">3. Color</h3>
<p>Lizard poop can be easily be confused with poop from snakes, birds or rodents. Similar to lizards these pests, poop and pee through the same opening. Thus, their droppings contain solid matter and solid uric acid. However, the white cap in birds and snake poop covers a larger portion and tend to be more liquid.

<h3 id="where-do-lizards-poop"><strong>Where Do Lizards Poop?</strong></h3>
<p>According to a
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/08/lizards-poop-biggest-rocks-around">research</a>
done at the university of Antwerp, lizards exhibit some similarity in their choice of toilet. In the controlled experiment, 90 lizards were each placed in an enclosure with different sizes of rocks. Surprisingly, 80% of the lizards pooped on the largest rock.
It has been previously indicated that wall lizards communicate with their fecal droppings. Male lizards mark their territories with feces so that other males can keep off. So, defecating on the biggest rock suggested an attempt to make their signals as conspicuous as possible.
Another explanation for this is that lizards spend most of their time on large rocks, to have a good view of possible predators. The research doesnt however conclude on the possible motivation for the observed behavior. But it suggests that lizards leave their poop in conspicuous areas as a sign of communication.</p>
<h3 id="is-lizard-poop-toxic"><strong>Is Lizard Poop Toxic?</strong></h3>
<p>Lizard feces are toxic because they spread zoonotic diseases such as salmonella. They contain certain disease-causing bacteria which can get into your body through ingestion, inhaling or open skin.
With proper hygiene its possible to reduce the risk and prevent infections from lizard droppings. If you have pet lizards, wash your hands with water and soap any time you handle them. Their cages should also be kept clean and free from fecal droppings. Use gloves every time youre cleaning your pets cage.
If you have kids in your home, its not advisable to keep lizards or other reptiles as pets. Thats because you cannot completely restrain kids interaction with the pets.
Other diseases that can be transmitted from lizards to humans include Leptospirosis, botulism and Campylobacteriosis.</p>
<h3 id="lizard-poop-versus-snake-poop"><strong>Lizard Poop versus Snake Poop</strong></h3>
<p><em>Lizard Poop:</em>
The diet of lizards is composed of small insects and arachnid. A few species include plants in their diet. They excrete small pellet-like feces the size of rodent feces.
The size of the droppings depend on the species and size of the lizard. The droppings have a small white portion which is fairly dry compared to those of snake poop.
<em>Snake poop:</em>
Unlike lizard poop, snake poop is quite lose and has no defined shape. The white portion on the end of the poop is more liquid and relatively larger than that in lizard poop.
A snake feeds by swallowing their prey whole. So their poop contains the indigestible remains such as bones, teeth, hooves, hair and scales.

<p>When handling any animal poop always wear gloves to avoid direct contact with disease-causing bacteria.
Scoop out the droppings with a scrapper or pick the droppings with a piece of cloth and dispose them in the trash bin or compost.
Stains left on fabrics and bedding by lizard poop can be cleaned using the following procedure.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a precaution, handle poop stains with a pair of protective gloves.</li>
<li>Soak the garments for at least five hours with a stain remover of your choice. There good stain removers in the market which can also help remove the poop odor.</li>
<li>Using the recommended water temperature for the fabric and an appropriate detergent, wash the garment until the stain disappears.</li>
<li>Use a bleaching agent where necessary.</li>

<ul>
<li>Drape the stained area with paper towels to absorb the stain completely.</li>
<li>Now cover the stain with baking soda and allow to settle until morning. This will remove excess moisture and eradicate the stench in the stain.</li>
<li>Clean the area with a wet cloth or vacuum cleaner.</li>
<li>If the stain doesnt disappear completely, clean the area with a cloth that has been soaked in white vinegar.</li>
<li>Stains from old poop require a more effective cleaning agent such as hydrogen peroxide.</li>
<li>Saturate the stain with undiluted hydrogen peroxide. For better results, soak a clean towel with hydrogen peroxide and place it on the stain. Leave it until morning.</li>
<li>Clean the surface with a wet towel until it is dry.</li>
<li>Some stains may discolor you wooden surfaces completely. In this case wood sanding may be necessary. Alternatively you can apply a stain similar to the color of your wooden surface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion**�**</h2>
<p>Lizards can cause discomfort especially when they are in large numbers. Their fecal droppings are potential avenues for diseases such as salmonella.
The situation gets worse if you have other pests like rodents, birds among others. However, its possible to differentiate the types of pests in your house using their fecal droppings.
This makes it easier to trace them and use the correct pest eradication remedy. If youre having trouble identifying the type of pest in your house, its the right time you contacted your local pest exterminator.</p>

<em>So, feed the bearded dragons with fruits (tomatoes, mangoes, bananas or grapes, etc.), vegetables (cabbages, broccoli, greens, pepper, sweet potato, or cucumber, etc.), insects (king-worms, meal-worms, crickets, etc.), or substrates for bearded dragons.�</em>
Thus, its evident

<li>Dubai roaches</li>
<li>Silkworms
However, only adult Bearded Dragons because of their exterior skin that&rsquo;s hard. Therefore, don&rsquo;t give the baby bearded dragons such as insect meat.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-include-extra-supplements-and-proteins">2. Include Extra Supplements and Proteins</h3>
<p>Besides the fruits and vegetables, I suggest you get some extra supplements (substrates) plus some proteins to spice up the bearded dragon&rsquo;s diet.
The diet can include feeding them a dragon with 2-3 meals daily plus some additional supplements and an extra meal or insect - these provide the critical proteins. Avoid lowing insects, including Lightning bugs, since they&rsquo;re toxic to your dragons.
I recommend you feed your dragon with just the gut-loaded insects, which points out that they&rsquo;ll provide a high level of nutrients.
Further, offer some Dubai
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//">baby roaches</a>
, earthworms, crickets besides spraying some calcium powder on the pet&rsquo;s food. You may add some meal-worms, wax-worms, and butter-worms for extra fat.

<h3 id="1-strawberries">1. Strawberries?</h3>
<p>Strawberries are a favorite food for bearded dragons, but you must wash and cut them into small pieces before giving them to your beadier.
But, can bearded dragons eat strawberry seeds? Well, bearded dragons will eat the strawberry seeds since they&rsquo;re located outside the fruit - particularly on the achenes ovaries.
Strawberry seeds will provide the beardies with great nutrients but don&rsquo;t feed them excessively to your pet as it&rsquo;ll lead to stomach problems.

<h3 id="2-bananas">2. Bananas?</h3>
<p>Bearded dragons will eat bananas (phosphorus)- however - only be 1-2 times every 30 days. Excessive feeding with bananas may lead to sicknesses like Metabolic Bone disease due to calcium deficiency.
Bananas will contain the following nutrients Calcium (5 mg), Phosphorus (22 mg), Magnesium (27 mg), and Iron (0.3 mg) that&rsquo;ll be helpful to your Bearded dragons if fed in moderation.</p>

<li>Mango</li>
<li>Papaya</li>
<li>Grapes</li>
<li>Raisins</li>
<li>Kiwi</li>
<li>Apricots
However, you must be careful as you feed your bearded dragon with some of this soft fruit such as kiwi because they&rsquo;ll ferment due to their sugary nature� - which eventually causes teeth issues.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-vegetables-can-bearded-dragons-eat">What Vegetables Can Bearded Dragons Eat?</h2>
<p>The baby of bearded dragons won&rsquo;t feed on most of the vegetables out there. Mainly, baby beardies eat 20% vegetables + fruits and 80% insects.
Please don&rsquo;t feed the pet with pale vegetables such as celery or iceberg lettuce because they have limited nutrients.
Adult bearded dragons eat 80% vegetables + fruits and 20% insects - a total reverse of what the baby beardies eat. Bearded dragons eat many vegetables, including turnip greens, mustard, and collards.</p>
<ol>
<li>Parsnip</li>
<li>Ocra</li>
<li>Bok choi</li>
<li>Yellow squash</li>
<li>Acorn squash</li>
<li>Butternut squash</li>
<li>Bell pepper</li>
<li>Okra</li>
<li>Cabbage</li>
<li>Green beans</li>
<li>Sweet potato</li>
<li>Asparagus</li>
<li>Brocolli (small bits weekly)</li>
<li>Peas</li>
<li>Courgette</li>
<li>Kohlrabi</li>
<li>Celery
Don&rsquo;t feed the Bearded dragons with spinach - simply because these leafy vegetables will significantly bind their calcium, and thus the pet won&rsquo;t absorb them easily.
Bearded dragons will also eat leafy vegetables like kale, bell peppers, carrots, pumpkin, squash, cabbage, and cucumbers without their peel.</li>
<li>Rocket</li>
<li>Coriander</li>
<li>Mustard greens</li>
<li>Endive</li>
<li>Collards</li>
<li>Turnip greens</li>
<li>Clover</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
<li>Dandelion greens</li>
<li>Kale</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This food should include vegetables (cucumber, grapes, banana, grated carrots) and fruits (pears, blueberries, tomatoes), substrates, plus insects.</p>
