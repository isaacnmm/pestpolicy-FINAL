      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s no brainier that retro gamers have always desired to create their &ldquo;general game console,&rdquo; which would enable them to play games from various systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>The critical considerations for this seemingly &ldquo;idea build&rdquo; have been excellent connectivity to the Television set, comfortable for gaming using aRetropie Controller, and average price.
However, with the
<a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a>
software and Raspberry Pi 3, the &ldquo;idea build&rdquo; is now achievable. You can now play many retro games in PlayStation, Game Boy, and the Super NES all at a low cost of building the emulation system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-build-a-raspberry-pi-retro-game-console">How to Build a Raspberry Pi Retro Game Console</h2>
<h3 id="1-install-the-raspberry-pi-to-the-raspberry-case">1. Install the Raspberry Pi to the Raspberry case</h3>
<p>Your Raspberry Pi will not come with a case unless you go for the bundled offer. However, to protect your Raspberry Pi, it is vital that you install a case for your Raspberry Pi.
Factors to consider while selecting the Raspberry Pi case are design, easy access for your board, port access, and durability.
Please choose a case that Raspberry Pi that has a heat sink. Notably, I will select the Raspberry Pi case that will not require screws and screwdriver to safeguard.</p>
<h3 id="2-install-sd-card-image-for-retropie">2. Install SD-card image for RetroPie</h3>
<p>RetroPie is a Raspberry Pi software bundle, combining projects such as
<a href="http://www.emulationstation.org/">EmulationStation</a>
and
<a href="http://www.libretro.com/">RetroArch</a>
, which is Raspbian created by Linux.
Notably, you&rsquo;ll find it easy to start with RetroPie through an installation of the SD image that is a suitable system created over the Raspbian OS.
RetroPie combines suite utilities and tools to make it easy to run ROMs for different old-fashioned gaming stages.ï¿½However, your Raspberry Pi will not have its internal hard drive, and thus you&rsquo;ll need to employ a microSD card to store the RetroPie files and operating system.
Therefore, you&rsquo;ll require to
<a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">download</a>
the appropriate version of the SD-Card Image. However, note that you&rsquo;ll find two kinds of SD-Card Image:</p>
<ul>
<li>SD-Card Image for the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3</li>
<li>SD-Card Image for your Raspberry Zero W, Pi Zero, B+, B, A, &amp; A+.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-format-the-microsd-for-raspberry-pi-operations">3. Format the MicroSD for Raspberry Pi Operations</h3>
<p>If your

is above 32 GB, you&rsquo;ll need to
format toï¿½FAT32
so that it can work with the retro games you&rsquo;ll install.ï¿½As I had outlined
earlier
, all SD cards bigger than 32GB will have the SDXC card, which is not compatible with NOOBS.
Therefore, to use such as 64GB and above SD card in <a href="/posts/best-os-for-raspberry-pi-3/">Raspberry</a> Pi, you&rsquo;ll need to format the card to the exFAT filesystem.
Notably, the default SD Formatter tool format the SD cards 64GB or bigger to exFAT. However, the bootloader that is inside the GPU is only compatible with the FAT system.
For Windows, use the
FAT32 Format
that you can download and run on your PC to format your SD card to FAT32 ready for Raspberry Pi operations. For Mac OS and Linux, use the
<a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/">SD Formatter</a>
plus the FAT32 Formatï¿½tools.</p>
<h3 id="4-mac--installing-operating-system-images">4. Macï¿½- Installing operating system images</h3>
<p>For Mac, you&rsquo;ll install the RetroPie image using the
<a href="http://www.pibakery.org/download.html">ApplePi-Baker</a>
tool.
However, after downloading and installing the utility, you&rsquo;ll need SUDO access for writing and reading the
Raspberry Pi SD card
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install and launch the SD card, after which you enter the Mac access.
Once you found the
<a href="http://www.pibakery.org/download.html">ApplePi-Baker</a>
utility, you&rsquo;ll need to click, on the left side, your Raspberry Pi SD card. After this, hit the &ldquo;Restore Backup&rdquo; and then the Image (RetroPie SD-Card).</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, Ill teach you how to overclock your Raspberry pi 3  with the goal of improving its performance.</p>
<p>Despite that overclocking mainly happen on the software level, the changes will significantly affect the physical level too.
First, increasing the power of the Raspberry Pi 3 processor  through overclocking  may cause hazardous overheating of the Raspberry Pi and all the hardware components near it.ï¿½Notably, the temperatures reach highs of 100  C! Read Also:

.</p>
<h2 id="why-overclock-raspberry-pi-3">Why Overclock Raspberry Pi 3?</h2>
<p>Despite Raspberry Pi 3 has an improved processor power, its still limited in some functions. For example, playing videos and games such as Minecraft require improved fluidity.
You can achieve the extra fluidity by overclocking the Raspberry Pi 3. Overclocking the Raspberry Pi 3 can help you boost its processor performance from the basic 1.2 GHz to about 1.5 GHz.

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Next, an increase in the processor power creates a demand on the power consumption for the system. This might be dangerous when the power supply of your Raspberry Pi is not adequately upgraded.
Therefore, for the above challenges, youll require to arm, yourself with the vital accessories to overclock safely:</p>
<ol>
<li>A quality cooling system  this will help reduce the temperature rise that comes due to overclocking. Therefore, youll require a cooling system that included active cooling (fan) and passive cooling (heatsink).</li>
<li>A great microSD Card for your Raspberry Pi 3. Most definitely, 32GB of micro-SD storage will be adequate but you can check the
SD Card for Raspberry Pi 3
.</li>
<li>A great power supply  for this I advise that you take a 5v 3A power supply.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="modify-the-raspberry-pi-3-configuration-files"><strong>Modify the Raspberry Pi 3 configuration files.</strong></h2>
<p>Lets dive right into the overclocking details.ï¿½For previous Raspberry Pi models, you only required to use the sudo raspi-config command. But now, youll have to modify the Raspberry Pi 3 configuration files.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, well require modifying the /boot/config.txt files that hold different settings that are loading during Raspberry Pi startup. The settings mainly affect the processor use and Raspberry Pi behavior.
Therefore, begin a terminal window in the Raspberry Pi and input the command below:
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
The above command will launch the file named /boot/config.txt. Further, the commandï¿½sudo and the text editorï¿½nano will request the system to undertake the function using the administrator account (ï¿½/boot/config.txt because this is a critical action.</li>
<li>With the file being open, ready for modification, now edit it so that you input the below-outlined lines:
<em>core_freq=500 # GPU Frequency</em>
<em>arm_freq=1300 # CPU Frequency</em>
<em>over_voltage=4 #Electric power sent to CPU / GPU (4 = 1.3V)</em>
<em>disable_splash=1 # Disables the display of the electric alert screen</em>
However, note that the above lines might already be available in different lines. In such a case, youll only need to ensure that the lines are not commented on (this means that the lines of code must not begin with oneï¿½#)</li>
<li>Next, save all the changes through this shortcutï¿½Ctrl+o and finally exit from the file using this shortcutï¿½Ctrl+x.</li>
<li>Finally, use the reboot command to restart your Raspberry Pi

</ol>
<h2 id="test-whether-the-overclock-is-enabled">Test whether the overclock is enabled</h2>
<p>To check, just run this command lscpu, and itll show the processor details. Therefore, if the CPU max MHz values are 1500, then youre on point  youve overclocked the Raspberry Pi 3!</p>
<h2 id="overclocking-raspberry-pi-2-or-older-models">Overclocking Raspberry Pi 2 or older models</h2>
<p>Like I had noted above, overclocking the Raspberry Pi 2 and easier models is much easier. Therefore, the modification will be a lot easier as youll utilize the GUIï¿½raspi-config.
So, on the Raspberry Pi terminal, give the command below:
sudo raspi
<em>-config</em>
Then, select the Overclock option. Click ok on the pop up that will be outlining the dangers of such overclocking actions.
Next, select the overclock option that you like, such as the 1000MHz. Finally, click the ok option for a list of the changes youve made.
Finally, hit Finish and when prompted whether to restart your Raspberry Pi, click ok. And..thats all, you Raspberry Pi is now overclocked.

<h2 id="removing-the-overclocking">Removing the overclocking?</h2>
<p>So, to remove the Raspberry Pi overclocking, youll only require removing the changes you put above from the Raspberry Pi configuration file - /boot/config.txt.
However, if youd created a backup file, simply copy it to the /boot directory to fully overwrite your config.txt file.
Further, on the
<em>/etc/rc.local</em>
file  remember to remove the line named
<em>/usr/bin/zram.sh &amp;</em>
.
Finally, reboot the Raspberry Pi to fully disable all the overclocking configurations.

      <description>There is so much fun in DIY Raspberry Pi projects, such as security cameras and digital weather stations.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is so much fun in DIY Raspberry Pi projects, such as security cameras and digital weather stations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/%5Braspberry-pi-3%5D(/posts/best-heatsink-for-raspberry-pi-3/)-model-b-plus/">Raspberry Pi model 3 B+</a>is the newest upgrade, being more flexible and powerful, but still low priced. I recently run a test for the[micro-SD card for <a href="/posts/best-os-for-raspberry-pi-3/">Raspberry</a> Pi 3](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-sd-card-for-raspberry-pi-3/)">https://pestpolicy.com/best-sd-card-for-raspberry-pi-3/)</a>.
The upgrade brings superior WiFi performance, wired LAN performance, CPU frequency (200MHz faster), and other significant modifications but still maintained the 1GB memory.
Below are the first impressions and benchmarks after a brief but thorough experience with the new Raspberry Pi model 3 B+. Read Also:
Raspberry Pi 3 vs. two vs. Zero
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="raspberry-pi-3-b-review--performance">Raspberry Pi 3 B Review + Performance</h2>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Pi 3 Model 3 B+ has two key features that stand out compared to earlier Pi models: a metal shield that covers the Bluetooth and WiFi circuitry (assist in RF emissions containment) and the SoC&rsquo;s metal cover (for dissipating heat).
<em>But, what are the favorable hardware modifications?ï¿½</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Model 3 B+ï¿½comes with a push or pull MicroSD card slot as opposed to the earlier push-to-eject.</li>
<li>It comes with a premium-looking Pi logo that is engaged on its wireless cover. Previous models had the symbol being etched on their circuit board, which looked low-class. Further, the Broadcom SoC has a beautiful metal cover.</li>
<li>Model 3 B+ has a metal enclosure CPU build that dissipates heat well than the plastic covering on the earlier models: without additional active cooling or heatsink.</li>
<li>Further, it has a highly standardized board layout and forms factor
The critical hardware improvements that could do in the future include:</li>
<li>Improve the I/O, such as incorporating USB 3.0. ports in place of the current USB 2.0.
Read Also:
Power Supply for Raspberry Pi 3</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>On-board LAN was a critical aspect of the Raspberry Pi Model 3 that required a significant overhaul.
The model 3 B+ now has the 10/100/1000 Gigabit LAN controller as opposed to just the 10/100 controller. Therefore, the in-build port will not be capped at 100 Mbps (practically ~93 Mbps). Model 3 B+ will thus give you more bandwidth, and you won&rsquo;t need gigabyte networking like before.
Due to the improved Raspbian OS and the Pi 3 B+&rsquo;s better power, the initial impression with the B+ is excellent.
The test results showed an improvement in the processing power, such as fast USB data transfer and better benchmarks performance.
Its CPU has a heat spreader at its top, and thus the processor won&rsquo;t throttle its performance. However, the wireless and wired benchmark test showed no significant difference from the previous Pi 3 that has inferior features.</p>
<h3 id="exposed-circuits-design"><strong>Exposed Circuits design</strong></h3>
<p>My first impression of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ is an excellent-looking circuit board that measures 0.63<em>3.5</em>2.2 in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notably, all the components are visible: 40-pin GPIO input/output connector and the 1.4GHz ARM processor.
Also, the board includes a micro-SD slot, 3.5mm audio output, HDMI, Ethernet, four USB 2.0, and a micro-USB connector.

<strong>Amazing Speed Boost</strong>
Just like Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, the all-new Model B+ has a 64-bit processor and in-built wireless connectivity.</li>
<li>Despite not having not many additional features, the Model B+ has some unique tasks that will be completed much more comfortably.</li>
<li>For example, with the processor upgrade that allows faster speeds, it&rsquo;ll be easier to complete tasks that require enormous computing power, such as creating a home-theatre PC.
Further, despite having the same 1GB memory, the Model B+ comes with a 200MHz faster CPU.
On the negative side, however, Pi 3 Model B+ could not effectively play the YouTube 1080p video. However, you may install VLC through different apps or command lines to play SDcard-loaded HD video.
PROS</li>
<li>Superior networking and faster processor</li>
<li>Highly customizable and easy to install
CONS</li>
<li>Ethernet port won&rsquo;t attain the 1Gbps top speed described.
I used benchmarks from the browser to assess the significance of the 200MHz CPU speed increase.</li>
<li>First, I used the JavaScript Sunspider 1.0.2, and it took 1.92 seconds. Notably, the above is double the speed of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B that takes 2.77 secs.

<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-heatsink-for-raspberry-pi-3/">for Raspberry Pi 3</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="requires-some-add-ons"><strong>Requires some Add-Ons</strong></h3>
<p>If you are utilizing the Raspberry Pi in complex projects, you must add components such as a Pi case, fans, and heat sinks.</p>
<ul>
<li>To create an excellent first computer, you&rsquo;ll need a case that has top ports&rsquo; cut-outs, and that will be easy to dismantle whenever required.</li>
<li>Also, you can include a PoE hat adapter to power up the Raspberry Pi through the Ethernet cable-supplied power, mainly when used with motion detectors.
Model B+&rsquo;s Ethernet port will allow the gigabit transfer speeds with speeds going up to 315Mbps. Your WiFi radio will do superior in Model B+&rsquo;s 5GHz band.</li>
