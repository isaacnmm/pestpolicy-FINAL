      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/dust-mites/">Dust</a> Mites are
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/">tiny insects</a>
that have eight legs and a small head and they feed off flakes of dead skin shed by humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>NB: an adult human will shed about 500 million flakes of their dead skin daily.
Dust mites measure about 1/100 inch in length and so it&rsquo;s only visible through a microscope.
The symptoms of dust mites for humans include itching and sneezing - but these can be related to chiggers, ticks, and spiders.
<strong>But do dust mites bite humans? No, the mouthparts of dust mites are quite rudimentary and so they can&rsquo;t sting or bite humans.ï¿½</strong></li>
<li><strong>On the contrary, dust mites will eat their own cast of skins and poop or fungi, pollen, pet skin, and flakes of dead human skin.</strong>
We&rsquo;ve seen that dust mites will not bite or sting humans (
[this is unlike other <a href="/posts/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/">mite</a> species](<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-fungicide-powdery-mildew/">https://pestpolicy.com/best-fungicide-powdery-mildew/</a>)
). But do we, like most homeowners, worry so much about these bugs?
Lets find out!

<h2 id="details-do-dust-mites-bite">Details: Do Dust Mites Bite?</h2>
<p>In summary, we&rsquo;ve seen that dust mites will not bite humans but we still have reason to be concerned about these bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most concerning issue with having dust mites in the house is their allergens since they trigger allergic reactions in humans.</li>
<li>There are about 20 + dust mite-related allergens that arise from the pests&rsquo; bodily secretions including poop and cast skins.
So despite that, the dust mites want to bite humans or inject venomous chemicals into their bodies, they can trigger grave medical issues.
Dust mites will hide in locations where dust tends to settle; these places include curtains, blinds, furniture, bedding, and soft fabrics.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://asthmaandallergies.org/">Allergy and Asthma Foundation</a>reports that Americans totaling roughly 20 million are insensitive to allergens resulting from dust mites.
It&rsquo;s almost impossible to completely remove all the dust mites from your spaces but you can control their numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges-health-risks-posed-by-dust-mites">Challenges/ Health Risks Posed by Dust Mites</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nfOXIWWzR8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nfOXIWWzR8</a>
Health experts have documented dust mites as a key indoor trigger for humans that have asthma and allergies.</p>
<ul>
<li>So a continued and chronic dust mites&rsquo; explosion can lead to adverse health effects for humans with allergies and those that are sensitive or allergic to mites.
Exposure to dust mite allergies may result in mild asthma with symptoms being sneezing, watery eyes, or runny nose.
Severe cases of asthma can result from extensive and chronic explosion dust mites that could lead to facial pressure, congestion, coughing, and sneezing.</li>
<li>So humans who are asthmatic and also sensitive to dust mites will have a higher risk of severe asthma attacks and flare-ups.
The Minuscule and tiny fecal pellets from dust mites will irritate the human throat and nose membranes if inhaled and cause sneezing.</li>
<li>The dust mite allergens may also trigger hives on the skin, allergic reactions, and asthma attacks.
The signs of having dust mites in the house will include running nose, headaches, and sneezing.

<h2 id="effective-protection-from-dust-mites-techniques">Effective protection from dust mites: Techniques</h2>
<p>Homeowners can effectively protect themselves from dust mites through techniques that will help eliminate or reduce the pests. Let&rsquo;s check them out</p>
<h3 id="1-reducing-the-humidity">1. Reducing the Humidity</h3>
<p>Recent scientific research shows that reducing the relative humidity of space will control dust mites plus the allergens they reproduce.
Experts advise that you should maintain relative humidity (RH) of under 50% in your home to reduce the dust mites and the allergens they produce.</p>
<ul>
<li>The research was done by altering indoor RH in the humid temperate climate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-remove-hiding-areas-for-dust-mites">2. Remove Hiding Areas For Dust Mites</h3>
<p>I also advise that you clear those areas where the dust mites could live.
Some of the areas include pillows that have allergen
encasements
, mattress covers, curtains and drapes, and furniture that has smooth surfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing most of these objects from your spaces will help reduce the hiding or breeding grounds for the dust mites.
It is also advisable that you wash the bedding once weekly with hot water that is 130 + degrees Fahrenheit.
Also check places that the dust mites can live in, including stuffed animals and various clutter.
Otherwise, you may opt to wash search objects using hot water that is 130 + degrees per Fahrenheit as these will kill dust mites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-remove-and-replace-the-carpets">3. Remove And Replace The Carpets</h3>
<p>Dust mites will find an excellent hiding and living place in your carpeting.
So to control these bugs, I advise that you remove the carpeting from your house, particularly if the family members have allergens that are related to dust mite allergens.</p>
<ul>
<li>But you can still vacuum the carpets thoroughly with aquality vacuum cleaner.
Avoid wet mopping but just focus on removing dust and dirt on the floors through damp cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-dust-the-floors-regularly">4. Dust The Floors Regularly</h3>
<p>Combining regular cleaning and dusting off the floors will help minimize dust quantities that accumulate in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will help improve the air quality in the house and that&rsquo;s better health for you and your pets.
Avoid stirring the dust while cleaning by using some wet microfiber cloth for the washcloth.</li>
<li>In comparison homes in lower-income areas and those that are old and located in humid climates tend to have more dust mites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dust mites will not bite humans and they are also not visible to the human eye.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, these pests will cause health effects such as allergic reactions, hives, and asthma.
Finally, it&rsquo;s impossible to completely remove the pests from your house but you can minimize them.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your home has dust (which is practically in every home) there will be dust mites. These pests will eat dead skin flakes that have been shared by pets and humans.
The microscopic organisms (invisible)
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-dust-mites-bite/">won&rsquo;t bite humans</a>
like is the case with
bed bugs or head lice
.
If you have an indoor allergy, then dust mites can worsen your symptoms and so it is important to control them in your house.
Unfortunately, dust mites are microscopic pests. This makes it difficult to control the bugs when you can&rsquo;t even see them.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will find dust mites in the areas of your house that trap dust or where you stay for long such as carpeting, fabrics, and mattresses that aren&rsquo;t washed regularly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="description-of-dust-mites">Description of Dust Mites</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/allergens/dustmites/index.cfm">NIEHS</a>
define dust mites as tiny (microscopic)
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/">pests that look like insects</a>
and reside in house dust.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dust mites feed on dander - which are peelings of dead skin that are shed by pets and humans.
Immunologists and allergists note that dust mites are major irritants that will worsen asthmatic symptoms and spark allergic attacks.</li>
<li>However, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about dust mites if they do not cause allergic reactions to you.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hF8y41KXDM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hF8y41KXDM</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-dust-mites-make-humans-sick">How Dust Mites Make Humans Sick</h2>
<p>From the onset, I have to say that dust mites do not bite humans.
However, humans get sick when they get exposed to dust <a href="/posts/what-do-dust-mites-look-like/">mite</a> proof or faces, especially for people who have dust mite allergies.
The dust mite poop contains proteins that are perfectly sized and they will trigger allergy symptoms for anyone who is allergic to dust mites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, these foreign allergens (dust mites) are very common in the environment and so they will reach many people.
The symptoms of allergic reactions caused by dust mites will include difficulty breathing, wheezing, runny nose, and sneezing - these are the common signs of hay fever allergy and asthma.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-will-the-dust-mites-live">Where Will the Dust Mites live?</h2>
<p>In your house, dust mites will hide in areas that have dust such as curtains, carpeting, mattress, upholstered furniture, and bedding.
So, it is possible to control dust mite allergy (for the people its effects) by reducing the number of dust mites roaming in the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, doctors may prescribe medications to manage asthma and leave the dust mite allergy symptoms.
<a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(02)91278-9/fulltext">Clinical Immunology</a>
reports that over 80% of US homes have dust mites on one of their beds.
So if you notice that you are sneezing when it is not allergy season yet, there could be dust mites in your spaces.
Pets will shed dead skin cells that will feed the dust mites and transport them around or into the house.
Because dust mites eat dead skin, you find them in high numbers in areas such as couches, mattresses, pillows, and rugs.
Dust mites will not remain in the air for a long time as they will settle quickly after they are disturbed.
However, the presence of dust mites in your house does not imply that you are unclean.</li>
<li>This is because every home (except in high attributes, and arid or dry climates) has some amount of dust mites settled somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symptoms-of-allergies-resulting-from-dust-mite">Symptoms of Allergies Resulting from Dust Mite</h2>
<p>The symptoms and signs of having a dust mite allergy in humans will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worsening eczema</li>
<li>Skin itching</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Ear canal itching</li>
<li>Coughing</li>
<li>Postnasal drip</li>
<li>Drippy nose</li>
<li>Sneezing</li>
<li>Watery and itchy eyes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-control-dust-mites">How to control dust mites</h2>
<h3 id="1-clean-the-bedding-regularly">1. Clean the Bedding Regularly</h3>
<p>Dust mites will thrive and reproduce better in a moist and warm environment where there are dead skin cells - this is the full description of most of our beds.
You should, therefore, change the bed linen regularly and also clean the bedding well if you need to control the dust mites.</p>
<ul>
<li>I advised to wash the bedding well using hot water (130 + degrees Fahrenheit) - this will kill the dust mites and remove various allergens.
The non-washable items on your bed must be closed into the dryer and the highest heat setting for about 20 minutes every week.
Also, you can freeze the non-washable items (inside some plastic bags) for about 24 hours to kill the dust mites.</li>
<li>This method (freezing) however won&rsquo;t remove the various allergens from the negotiable items.
For the kid&rsquo;s bedroom, wash the stuffed toys and animals using hot water.</li>
<li>Also, reduce the stuffed toys and animals that are in the kids bedroom.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2use-a-mattress-encasement">2.Use a mattress encasement</h3>
<p>Using a protective covering for the mattress will also help control the dust mites in your house.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also use similar coverings on the pillows and box springs
Ensure the coverings or the replacement are dust mite proof - some of the recommended ones are the zippered covers.</li>
<li>The dust mites therefore will be starved to death as they cannot access the dead skin cells.
However, experts recommend that you must steam clean the mattress twice yearly even after using the protective covering to kill the dust mites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-remove-the-wall-to-wall-house-carpeting">3. Remove the Wall-to-Wall House Carpeting</h3>
<p>Dust mites will love the carpeting that is in your house covering wall to wall since it allows dust to settle and also holds the dead skin cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such carpets, due to their size and material, are challenging to clean regularly.
So, if any member of the house has an allergy triggered by dust mites, you are required to remove the wall-to-wall carpeting.
Suitable materials that can replace the wall-to-wall carpeting include vinyl, tile, laminate, and wood - these will be easy to clean and mop daily.</li>
<li>However you can improve the comfort of your underfoot by using some area rugs that are easily washable.
Vacuuming the carpet (
with HEPA filter
) is the next advisable method when the wall-to-wall carpeting cannot be removed.
Also, you should still clean the carpeting occasionally but ensure the temperature of the steamer is 200 + degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-lower-the-house-temperatures">4. Lower The House Temperatures</h3>
<p>Dust mites will experience challenges reproducing when the temperatures are low.</p>
<ul>
<li>So it is advisable to lower the temperatures of the various rooms in your house to control the dust mites.
Dust mites will breed and multiply optimally at temperatures that are between 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit.
It is advisable therefore 2 have the room temperatures in your house be anywhere outside this range.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-lower-the-rooms-relative-humidity">5. Lower the Rooms&rsquo; Relative Humidity</h3>
<p>As noted above, dust mites will thrive in humid and moist conditions.
First, I know that most homeowners will clear steam in spaces such as the bathroom using some venting fan.
Other conditions will increase the humidity in the house: these will include improper ductwork, damp crawl spaces, and leaky windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can measure and control the humidity in the rooms using a hygrometer.</li>
<li>Maintain the relative humidity at under 50% to control dust mites.
Steps that you can take to lower the humidity levels in the rooms include using venting systems and fans, installing a dehumidifier, installing various moisture barriers, and treating the damp basements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-reduce-clutter-and-improve-the-hvac-air-filters">7. Reduce Clutter and improve the HVAC Air Filters</h3>
<p>Homeowners love keeping more and more items in the house even when the use of such items is limited.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reduced usage of such items will allow them to pick up dust.
So, if you&rsquo;re not using some items and you still need them around, I advise that you keep them in enclosed cabinets or covered boxes to prevent them from picking dust.
The heat pump system in your house will affect the amount of airflow available and also how much dust will gather on various items.
So, it will be good to install some air purifiers that will capture the dust mites before they get into the house.</li>
<li>How to also advise that you replace the air filters in the HVAC system
Regular and effective cleaning of the filters will reduce the dust mites in the house.</li>
<li>The filters to be cleaned regularly include those in the vacuums,clothes dryers, dehumidifiers, humidifiers, air purifiers and air conditioners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dust mites are closely related to spiders and ticks but they are microscopic in size.
On diet, as noted earlier, dust mites will eat the skin cells that are shed by humans and pets.</p>

. If you suspect you are having mites infestation and cant tell what exactly they are, well, this is the right place for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>So, what do dust mites look like? - Dust mites are microscopic creatures and very hard to see with our bare eyes. They commonly feed on dead human and animal skin cells.</strong></li>
<li><strong>From a microscopic view, they are tiny oval-shaped insects. They have 8 legs and they do not have wings. They are greyish-black in color with some stripes and they move from one place to another through crawling.ï¿½</strong>
Dust mites cannot be categorized as parasites because they dont sting, or bite and neither do they burrow into the human body.

</ul>
<h2 id="details-what-do-dust-mites-look-like">Details: What Do Dust Mites Look Like?</h2>
<p>Though they are generally harmless to most people, to others they cause allergic reactions like asthma among others.</p>
<ul>
<li>They like hiding under pillows, mattresses, furniture, and carpeted areas.</li>
<li>How do I know I have dust mites? Because of their invisible nature, the best way to tell the infestation of the dust mites is through the symptoms seen.
Such symptoms may include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Running nose</li>
<li>Asthma-in extreme cases</li>
<li>Breathing problems</li>
<li>Stuffy ears</li>
<li>Sneezing</li>
<li>Eczema</li>
<li>Bug bites</li>
<li>Nasal stiffness</li>
<li>Watery and itching eyes
If you have such symptoms, it is already an alarm that something needs to be done.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-are-dust-mites-in-my-room">Why Are Dust Mites In My Room?</h2>
<p>As earlier stated dust mites mostly feed on dead skin. In your room, that is where you are more likely to spend a lot of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you rub your body against the bed and pillow, you leave a lot of dead skin on it which is good food for the mites.
It is in our bedroom and living room that is there is a lot of dead skin and that is why most mites will hang around.

</ul>
<h2 id="do-dust-mites-stay-in-me">Do Dust Mites Stay In Me?</h2>
<p>Most probably not. There is absolutely nothing to scare you about dust mites attaching to you. Dust mites dont have wings and barely move a lot.
Another thing is that they also dont burrow into humans so it will also be hard for them to hang around you all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you leave the dead skin is just where they want to be.
Next time you experience some bites when in your bed, chances are that this is not a dust <a href="/posts/dust-mites/">mite</a> but either a bed bug or a mosquito.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-dust-mites-eating">What Are Dust Mites Eating?</h2>
<p>Dust mites have no interest in living things. Their main source of food is dead skin, dandruff, dead hair, and other dead micro stuff from the human body.
Human beings shed about 10 grams of dead skin a week creating a rightful environment for these mites.</p>
<ul>
<li>But it is the animal pets like dogs and cats that are good carriers of these mites.
Dust mites have a life span of about two months and therefore, these dead body parts serve as enough food for these mites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dust-mites-or-bed-bugs">Dust Mites Or Bed Bugs?</h2>
<p>If you have been having itchy bites from your bed, what is the first thing that comes into your mind?
Whereas the bed bugs and the dust mites like to hide in the same place under your bed and beddings, it is bed bugs that bite.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike mites, the bugs are big and visible. The bugs are also parasitic and also suck blood from your body.</li>
<li>The bed bugs will also stay with you wherever you are hiding in clothes as well as the bedding and other dark places within your home.
These signs and symptoms will give you a proper guide on whether you are controlling dust mites or bed bugs in your home.

<h2 id="getting-rid-of-dust-mites">Getting Rid Of Dust Mites</h2>
<p>Now that you know you are treating dust mites, here is are some steps to achieve maximum results.
The first and the most important step to take is to do a thorough cleaning of the bedding and the house at large.</p>
<ul>
<li>These only come after establishing through the symptoms that indeed there is a dust mites infestation.</li>
<li>Like earlier noted it is hard to see them and will only work with the probability of their hideouts.
Secondly, as you wash the bedding, pillowcases let the water be heated to temperatures of not less than 60 F. This temperature will go a long way in killing and eliminating both the mites and their eggs.</li>
<li>Another alternative is replacing the sheets, pillowcases, and mattresses with new ones. This way you can help reduce their population and also infestation.</li>
<li>Thirdly, flipping your mattress regularly helps keep the mites population low and also avoids too much accumulation of the mites in one location.</li>
<li>Dust mites thrive in humid and warm areas, and keeping the room well ventilated minimizes their chances of survival in your room.
Once in a while, you can also do some vacuum cleaning of your room to remove all manner of the dead skin and anything that allows this pest to thrive,</li>
<li>In another scenario, using an electric blanket could also be a good way to minimizing their infestation. Electric blanket creates an atmosphere where this mite cannot thrive.</li>
<li>Lastly, clean your pets and toys. Pests are good carriers of dust mites and keeping them clean at all times keeps off the mites.
As for the toys, keeping them in the freezer temporarily could help kill any mites that could be hiding in that warm fur.

<h2 id="other-dust-mite-home-remedies">Other Dust Mite Home Remedies</h2>
<p>If you are able to establish that indeed you have the dust mites, you can employ the tactics illustrated above.
However, it is almost impossible to tell the extent of their infestation in your home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dust mites have a very short life span and it is possible that they have multiplied into millions before you can start seeing the signs.</li>
<li>There are various pesticides that a formulated to kill them either by contact or through the systemic mode of action.
I recommend the use of this pesticide to help reduce their population.ï¿½ These pest control products are available in most stores.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>What do dust mites look like? Well, it is hard to see these mites with your eyes but can also tell about their existence through the symptoms caused on your bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>They dont bite, or sting but can cause allergic reactions like asthma and others.
That said and done, itï¿½ is good to regularly clean your room and apply all the necessary measures to keep off this dust mites.</li>
