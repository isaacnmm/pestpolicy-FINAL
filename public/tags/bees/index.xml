<h2 id="bees-vs-wasps-vs-hornets---7-key-differences">Bees vs. Wasps vs. Hornets - 7 Key Differences?</h2>
<p>Well, wasps (non-furry insects) are carnivores, while bees are furry and will east flower pollen to produce honey. Check these
sprays for yellow jackets.</p>
<h3 id="1-color">**1. **<strong>Color�</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
The color of bees can range between yellow and black, depending on the species. But
<a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/honey-bee-anatomy">honey bees share different traits</a>
with various bugs.
For instance, honey bees have a golden-yellow color with a characteristic brown band. Bumblebees are tan in color with yellow or orange coloration. Bees have 3 pairs of legs - and thus may be considered like
<a href="http://www.reachoutmichigan.org/funexperiments/agesubject/lessons/insect.html">insects</a>
.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps come in a myriad of colors. There are over
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/group/wasps/">30,000 different wasps</a>
. Stinging wasps have bright colors that serve as a warning to intruders. For example, the yellow and black color on yellow jackets indicates they have the ability to sting.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Usually, hornets will appear to be black and white. However, the European hornet is brown with either orange or yellow markings. The yellow hornet is yellow and black in color.</p>
<h3 id="2-body-appearance">**2. **<strong>Body Appearance</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Bees have three body parts, just like other insects  Head, thorax, and abdomen. The part connecting the abdomen and thorax is thicker in bees than in both wasps and hornets. Bees come in different sizes depending on the species. Bumblebees are wider and hairy, while honeybees are small in girth and less hairy.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
A wasps body is segmented into three parts with a characteristic thin waistline, distinguishing them from either bees or hornets. They have a slim body, which is less hairy compared to bees.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are close relatives of wasps, although they emerge from different species. They have a larger body and a thicker waist when compared to wasps.
<a href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/housing/pubs/pests/bees.pdf">Hornets look very similar to wasps</a></p>
<ul>
<li>notice their elongated and thin body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-nesting-habits">**3. **<strong>Nesting Habits</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Although all bees live in colonies, their nesting habits vary from one species to another. Honeybees make their nests in voids found on walls or tree hollows. A typical honeybee colony can hold up to 10,000 bees.
On the other hand, bumblebees live in underground burrows, especially those abandoned by burrowing animals. They live in colonies of hundreds of bees.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps build nests using a paper-like substance, which they give out after chewing wood fiber. These nests appear as open-end hexagonal cells similar to honeycombs.
Wasp nests can be found under sheltered building eaves, tree branches, open pipes, and in places like garage and attics. The location of nests depends on the wasp species. While mud daubers prefer building nests in higher areas,
<a href="http://naturemappingfoundation.org/natmap/facts/yellow_jacket_712.html">yellow jackets</a>
will build nests on the ground.
Wasp nest can be as small as a golf ball and grow to as large as football or even bigger. Enormous nests of up to 15000 wasps have been found in Alabama.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/hornet-nest-removal/">Hornet removal</a>
appear as paper-like substances with a grayish color. However, unlike the bee and wasp nests, they are oval-shaped. They construct their nests overhanging from higher places like trees, chimneys, outside buildings, poles, etc.
A hornet nest starts as a small piece but can grow to the size of a basketball.

<h3 id="4-diet-and-feeding">**4. **<strong>Diet and Feeding</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
A bees diet mainly entails pollen and nectar. Since they crave sweet food, they also feed on sweet juices such as those found in fruits and soft drinks. Thats why you might see bees hovering around during your outdoor parties or treats.
The worker bees do the work of collecting nectar and pollen and bringing it to the nests for the rest of the colony.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps forage for their food among invertebrates such as flies, spiders, ants, caterpillars, and other small insects. Some are omnivorous and will feed on honeydew, nectar, and fallen fruits.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are omnivorous  they feed on sugary plant foods such as tree sap and rotting fruits. Theyre also predators of small insects such as flies, among others.</p>
<h3 id="5-aggressiveness">**5. **<strong>Aggressiveness</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
Bees are less aggressive than both wasps and hornets - but
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353869">can sting</a>
. Bees will not sting you unless they feel threatened or when defending their nests. But unlike wasps and hornets, they have barbed stingers which bite only once.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Wasps are more aggressive than bees but not as aggressive as hornets. Like others in the Vespidae family, they can sting several times, each time withdrawing their stinger from the victim.
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/wasp-sting">Wasps may also sting</a>
-�they usually sting when provoked or defending their nests.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
Hornets are very quick at stinging. They will sting at the slightest provocation. They belong to the Vespidae family, whose stingers are not barbed. That means they can sting several times because of the ability to withdraw their stinger.
A hornet sting inflicts a lot of pain and can sometimes lead to fatal allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>
<h3 id="6-nest-behavior">**6. **<strong>Nest Behavior</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Bee:</strong>
A bee nest consists of the queen, female workers, and the male drones. The queen lays eggs while the drones do the work of mating with the queen. Female workers are responsible for housekeeping, gathering food, protection, and feeding larvae.
<strong>Wasp:</strong>
Most of the wasp species live a solitary life. In this case, mature females dig or construct nests near food sources to live and lay eggs. A few species exhibit a social behavior where they live as a community. These include yellow jackets and paper wasps.
A colony of social wasps mainly entails the queen and the female workers. Males leave the hive immediately after mating and die due to dehydration. Mating occurs in summer, where the females hibernate only to start new colonies in spring. New males for the next mating season emerge from the unfertilized eggs.
Female workers are tasked with all communal work, including gathering food, housekeeping, feeding the larvae, and protecting the colony.
<strong>Hornet:</strong>
At the center of a hornet hive is the queen, whose sole function is to lay eggs for reproduction. The seemingly few males in the nest only do mating and will die soon after mating.
Female hornets perform daily communal jobs such as getting food, building the nest, protection, and feeding the larvae.

<h2></h2>
<h2 id="identification">Identification</h2>
<h3 id="carpenter-bees">Carpenter bees</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees are black and large bees and come during the end of spring and start of summer. The name carpenter bees, also known as wood bees, was created due to the bees practice of wood-boring to create nests for their young ones.
There exist many species of carpenter bees. However, Xylocopa Virginia (L.) is the most common species, yellow and black in color and an inch long. Further, carpenter bees are described as solitary bees. Every female tunnel into the wood to create its nest.
**Male carpenter bees: Do not sting **
The male carpenter bees hover around the house, searching for mates and good paces to create their nests. Also, they are very aggressive and hover around people moving near their nests.
However, since they have no stingers, male carpenter bees are harmless. Notably, females have black face while males have yellow faces.
<strong>Female carpenter bees: have stingers.</strong>
On the other hand, female carpenter bees have stingers and are quite harmful. However, the females are less aggressive and will only attack in self-defense when molested. Also, the females have dense black hairs blush in the hind legs.</p>
<h3 id="bumblebees">Bumblebees</h3>
<p>The whole body of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee">bumblebees</a>
is covered with hairs. It is also critical to note that the female bumblebees&rsquo; body has yellow hair patches on their upper abdomen. Further, bumblebees socially live in underground nests.
Female bumblebees cannot sting continuously. Further, they will only attack you or your animal&rsquo;s attack when disturbed. Despite that, the stings can be painful; it is not dangerous unless it is around the neck or head or for people who have an allergic reaction to bee venom.
The bumblebee is in the genus Bombus. There are more than 250 species and mainly live in higher altitudes. It has a round body covered in a pile
<em>�</em>
(long branched setae) of soft hair.</p>
<h2 id="indications">Indications</h2>
<h3 id="carpenter-bees-1">Carpenter Bees</h3>
<p>The following conditions will indicate the possible presence of carpenter bees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sawdust piles under perfectly drilled and circular holes in the house.</li>
<li>Large, yellow, black, and shiny bees that hover over your head in the home.</li>
<li>Moldy, yellow, or fan-shaped stains on the sides of a structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bumblebees-1">Bumblebees</h3>
<p>Bumblebees
mainly nest below the ground
(in or under refuse dumps, debris, or soil). Mi9anly, the bees acquire their food from flowers. Despite that, they also create honey; they store it in a minimal amount and thus not commercially viable.
Bumblebees are helpful pollinators to some plant species but not as effective as the honey bees for commercial plant pollination.</p>
<h2 id="nesting-habits">Nesting habits</h2>
<p>Although carpenter bee vs. bumblebee has similar appearances, they have different nesting habits.
For example, bumblebees prefer nesting in the ground while the carpenter bees tend to tunnel in wood to lay eggs there. They prefer weathered, bare of unpainted softwoods, particularly cypress and redwood.
Except for the new queens in the colony, all the other bumblebee colonies perish at the end of fall. The remaining queens thus ensure continuity of the species by laying eggs in spring.</p>
<h2 id="control-carpenter-bee-and-bumblebee">Control carpenter bee and bumblebee</h2>
<h2 id="carpenter-bee">Carpenter Bee</h2>
<p>Do you have wood, particularly softwood, that is not painted or without stains? If yes, carpenter bees could be well attracted to your premises.
To prevent carpenter bees from attacking your structures, ensure to stain, paint or treat the wood. Since the bees love softwoods, always use hardwood to build your structures to prevent them from creating their nests.
Further, examine if any wood had been attacked previously attacked by the carpenter bees as they are highly likely to be struck.
Even though wood preservatives and stains are considered less effective in preventing carpenter bees, they offer some repellency levels. Also, close the garages to prevent the carpenter bees from creating nests.
You can use liquid sprays having synthetic pyrethroid, chlorpyrifos (Dursban), and carbaryl (Sevin) on wood to prevent an
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-carpenter-bees-bite/">attack from the carpenter bees</a>
. Ensure to repeat the treatment process after two weeks.
Also, you can use insecticidal dust to treat wood tunnel openings. After treatment, approximately one week later, close the entrance hole using a wooden piece of wood.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-bumblebees">How to get rid of bumblebees</h2>
<p>Bumble Bee can be described as beneficial insects. However, they can be dangerous, depending on where their nests are located. To control bumblebees, you should use both
chemical and non-chemical control methods
.</p>
<h3 id="chemical-treatment">Chemical treatment</h3>
<p>Since timing is important for the control of bumblebees, note the bumblebee nest&rsquo;s location when it is still day time. At night or early evening, or early morning before dawn, treat the nest with the appropriate insecticides to maximize effectiveness.
Treating the nests during day time can reach very few bees as most are active and busy outside the nest. Remember to wear protective clothing such as a bee veil. �You can use D-Force HPX or D-Force HPX to kill the bees. Also, you can apply D Fence Dust around or inside the nest.
Use insecticides containing resmethrin or pyrethrins to knock- down the bumblebees. Also, you can use the dust of sprays that contain carbaryl (Sevin). After treatment, close the bumblebee hole with soil.

<h3 id="bee-nests">Bee Nests:</h3>
<p>Bees, including honeybees and bumblebees, construct their nests using different materials and methods. Their nests serve as the central location for their colonies, providing a place for honey storage, egg-laying, and raising their young.</p>
<h4 id="construction-and-material">Construction and Material:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honeybees</strong>:Honeybees produce wax from specialized glands on their abdomens. They use this wax to build the intricate hexagonal cells of their nests, known as honeycombs.These hexagonal cells are used for storing honey and pollen as well as for housing the brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae).Honeybee nests are highly structured and efficient, reflecting the complex social organization of the colony.</li>

outdoor working space wondering how do I get rid of sweat <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-carpenter-bees-without-killing-them/">bees</a>? A common method to kills sweat bees is a killing spray.
But are there situations where it would not be appropriate?
I conducted a quick research.
<strong>To get <a href="/posts/how-to-get-rid-of-ground-bees/">rid</a> of sweat bees, you may repel, trap or kill the bugs.�Sweat Bees are�attracted to salts present in human sweat. Obviously, a similar threat faces street athletes,� gardeners, and construction workers.�</strong>

<h2 id="which-do-you-go-for---repelling-killing-or-catching-the-sweat-bees">Get rid of sweat bees if:
<strong>(1)</strong>
When you&rsquo;re allergic to stings from bees.
<strong>(2)</strong>
When the bees are nested in your house and have launched frequent attacks
<strong>(3)</strong>
If the sweat bees are distracting your outdoor work and space.
<strong>(4)</strong>
If you&rsquo;re camping in the�hot humid areas.
<strong>Which do you go for - repelling, killing, or catching the sweat bees?�</strong></h2>

<h3 id="1-how-to-kill-sweat-bees-using-your-best-insecticide">1. How to Kill Sweat Bees using your Best Insecticide</h3>
<p>This is not a very efficient method as it constitutes eliminating isolated bees as and when they make contact through the use of household insecticides.</p>
<p>It is a short-term solution that also has the disadvantage of exposing you to the same pesticides you use to kill the bees. Most pesticides can be extremely dangerous if used for extended periods.</p>
<h3 id="2how-to-repel-sweat-bees-using-your-best-sweat-bee-repellent">2.�How to Repel Sweat Bees using your Best Sweat Bee Repellent</h3>
<p>A humane way to eliminate sweat bees is to repel them. However, not all repellents are made equal, which is why you need to go for a product whose ingredients have been registered with the EPA.</p>
<p>Talk to a doctor if any member of your household is negatively affected by the type of repellant you are using. Exterminators can also recommend a host of superior quality options for the same purpose.</p>
<p>You can also keep sweat bees away from you by rubbing some mint soap on your skin.</p>
<h3 id="3how-to-trap-sweat-bees-using-your-best-sweat-bee-catcher">3.�How to Trap Sweat Bees using your Best Sweat Bee Catcher</h3>
<p>Another humane and effective method to eradicate of sweat bees is to trap them. There are many resources online that tell you how to build your sweat bee trap; it is advisable to go for commercial options.</p>
<p>This is because traditional and some DIY sweat bee traps will not work with these tiny insects. Search online for options and dont forget to look at customer reviews before settling for any particular product.</p>
<h3 id="4-preparing-the-ground">4. Preparing the ground</h3>
<p>A sure way to keep sweat bees away from your home and property is to locate the areas in which they like to build their nests. Once you find the potential nesting ground, you need to make it unconducive for sweat bee habitation.</p>
<p>Sweat bees like to colonize dry and thin soil and will mostly show up in humid weather. As they love to burrow under the ground, adding layers of mulch is sure to dissuade them from colonizing the area any further. It makes the soil much harder to penetrate.</p>
<h3 id="5-hire-a-professional-exterminator">5. Hire a professional exterminator</h3>
<p>In most instances, it is wise to leave the job to exterminators as they have the training and experience to deal with dangerous insects and pesticides.</p>
<p>Exterminators will take all precautionary measures, including wearing protective clothing. Make a shortlist of reputable exterminators who know how to wipe out sweat bees in your pool, yard, or garden.</p>
<p>Do your groundwork before hiring an exterminator and ask if you need to do anything to prepare for the extermination.

<p>The bees take over such areas that are left unchecked. Sweat bees exits in
<em>Hymenoptera Insect family</em>
and commonly found in North America, Australia, and Asia. They have a

      <description>This is a Hornet Nest Removal guide. It is a kind of unpleasant situation for you if you are having a hornet or wasps nest around in or near your place.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a <a href="/posts/hornet-bees-and-wasp-removal-tacoma/">Hornet</a> <a href="/posts/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/">Nest</a> Removal guide. It is a kind of unpleasant situation for you if you are having a hornet or wasps nest around in or near your place.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can get nastier, especially if there are kids or anyone with an allergic issue to their stings (insect venom). I will discuss the ultimate<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/">guide for the Hornet Nest</a>Removal.</li>
<li>Any movement or activity near the nest might lead the hornets to launch an aggressive mob and chase down and eventually stifle the offender.
This launch of aggression can be for both humans and pets. The existence of this hornet nest is indeed a nuisance and deserves to be dealt with full throttle. If you are careful and concern for your family, you can rid of them yourself and that too very easily.
[amazon bestseller=&ldquo;Best Hornet Killer&rdquo; items=&ldquo;2&rdquo; template=&ldquo;table&rdquo;]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-take-safety-measures">#1: Take Safety Measures</h2>
<p>There are countless ways of
<a href="https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef620">keeping the hornets away</a>
. It is not easy to get rid of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are careful, you can eliminate their existence without even the services of a professional exterminator.</li>
<li>Hornets can sting hard and can do it several times and will do so aggressively.
One thing should be kept in mind before attempting to remove it; this can be a risky project to undertake irrespective of whether you are allergic to it or not; caution should be taken care of.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-bag-the-hornets">#2: Bag the Hornets</h2>
<p>This technique of removing hornet nest works nicely if two people do it at a time and at the same time if the nest is developing downwards like a tree branch.
The ideal time to perform this act is during sunshine when supposedly hornets are
inert
.</p>
<h2 id="3-outfit">#3: Outfit</h2>
<p>Before launching a kind of assault on hornets, a correct and safe outfit should be worn.</p>
<ul>
<li>The simple definition of this outfit is that it should be covering you from head to your toe.
This is vital as it protects you from stings. The fabric of the outfit should be thick, to go with this, goggles and gloves are also highly advisable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-carry-a-strong-and-big-bag-of-plastic">#4: Carry a Strong and Big Bag of Plastic</h2>
<p>Since this method is about bagging the hornets and their nest, the primary element here is the bag.
The bag&rsquo;s quality should be good enough to tolerate some stings of hornets on their way into the bag. It must be strong enough to oppose light rips.</p>
<h2 id="5-placement-of-the-bag">#5: Placement of the Bag</h2>
<p><em>Test your judgmental call.</em>
In this phase, you need to make a good judgmental call. It would help if you located the bag below the tree branch by estimating the trajectory of the fall of your nest.</p>
<h2 id="6-hedge-trimmers">#6: Hedge Trimmers</h2>
<p>This is the most delicate phase of the method. In this part, you need to use long-handles hedge trimmers to cut the branch down.
Once you cut the branch down, then you need to hope that it falls exactly where you have placed the plastic bag.</p>
<h2 id="7-fill-your-bag--dispose">#7: FILL Your BAG &amp; DISPOSE</h2>
<p>If you have been successful until now, then this past is the last part of the method. Once the nest falls in the bag, you need to tie it hard.
The ending part is your choice, whether you want to dispose of it or burn it away. Anyway, it will do the job just fine.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-hornet-nests-located">Where Are Hornet Nests Located?</h2>
<p><em>�</em>
<em>The most important thing to know to dispose of these nests is to find about their location and existence.</em>
A hornet nest generally looks like a paper or mud-like construction, mostly in the shape of a pine cone, mass lump, or like an upside-down apiary.
Hornets usually search for a sheltered location to make their nest - G
<a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/getting_rid_of_wasps_nests">etting rid of wasps&rsquo; nests</a>
.
Found in branches of a tree, under joists, on the slide of windows, in attics, inside the usable portion of abandoned buildings or vehicles, etc.
To cut the story short, any place shielded from weather and in peace can attract these hornets to build their nest.
Typically, hornets prefer to build a nest in relatively high areas. These normally include, but are not at all limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hollow tree trunks</li>
<li>Decking</li>
<li>Sheds</li>
<li>Treetops</li>
<li>Attics</li>
<li>Top roof corners</li>
<li>Garages
Some nests are free-hanging and normally have a stalk called petiole. Petiole attaches the nest to an object such as a tree branch.
On the other hand, some nests are built in an enclosed space that provides solid support for the nest, making it very stable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hornet-nest-vs-wasp-nest">Hornet Nest Vs Wasp Nest</h2>
<p><em>Do you think Hornet and Wasp Nest are the same? Think again.</em>
The name of two species, i.e.,
hornet and wasp
can be at times very puzzling. Wasp and hornets have numerous things in common and, at the same time, a lot of dissimilarities as well.
Scientist normally classifies the insects into different species, and in actuality, the sole real species of true hornet is the Brown Hornet or European Hornet.
If we look at a wasp and its related categories, there is a collection of wasps commonly referred to as the lone wasp in a laymans tone. This wasp group is small in number, kind of an introvert, and prefers to make their nest underground.</p>
<h3 id="key-difference-between-hornets-and-wasps">Key Difference Between Hornets And Wasps</h3>
<p>The length of hornets is normally considered to be around 1.5. This small in size animal can form a mostly aerial nest in the shape of a sheltered box, can be big in size, and apparently looks exactly like paper.
Hornets prefer other small infections to fill up their little belly. The chances of them stinging to you increase drastically once they feel endangered.
On the other side, the wasps length is less than 1, which is smaller than hornets. They do differently from hornets because their nest is restricted to being aerial; they can also form nests on the ground level.
They are a lot less aggressive than hornets. Consequently, the frequency and sharpness of the sting are less than hornets.</p>
<h2 id="hornets-nest-in-ground">Hornets Nest in Ground</h2>
<p>If considering size, ground hornets are extremely imposing, measuring the length of about 0.5 inches, and at times even more than that. Hornets are also called Yellow Jackets.
Ground hornets can build a nest in trees that are rotted. The next favorite destination for ground hornets to make nest are spaces in walls or ceilings.
These nests are normally inaccessible and very difficult to remove. There is a school of thought which believes that these hornets should be left alone until and unless they become capable enough to threaten you.
On the other hand, the other school of thought is totally anti of this approach; they believe these ground hornets should be dealt with severely in any case.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike bumble/honey bees, carpenter <a href="/posts/compare-carpenter-bee-vs-bumblebee/">bees</a> do more than just carry out pollination - they bore woods and create nests. Also,
female carpenter bees may sting humans
if provokes.
<strong>So, on how to get rid of carpenter bees without killing them; you can install a sacrificial piece of wood, install carpenter bee traps, use a Sweep net, adopt preventive measures like WD-40, or make some noise to scare bees away.�</strong>
<strong>Alternatively, hanging wind chime works incredibly, while painting wooden surface prevents carpenter bees from boring.�</strong>
<strong>Further, you can opt to wait for the bees to leave on their own, vacuum them, or use almond/citrus oil as well.�</strong>

<h3 id="1-using-a-sweep-net">1. Using a Sweep net</h3>
<p>This a device which is weaved or manufactured using a tough loose network that forms a tiny mesh, though which insects such as bees can&rsquo;t pass.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sweep net comes with a handle or extender, depending on the place you intend to use it.</li>
<li>Hang/pin the sweep net with an opening facing the carpenter bees&rsquo; nest/holes and create a disturbance from beneath.</li>
<li>As the bees leave to escape, they get trapped in the sweep net. Later, empty the sweep net in open fields - far away from your home or office.
In case you spot flying carpenter bees, use a sweep net with a long handle - swing/sweep the net in the air in order to capture the flying carpenter bees and dispose of them as advised previously.
NB: Sweep nets are common in the local market and relatively cheap as compared to options such as vacuuming.

<h3 id="2-installing-sacrificial-piece-of-wood">2.� Installing Sacrificial Piece of Wood</h3>
<p>A sacrificial wood is a standard lumber piece, which is highly visible and attracts carpenter bees preferentially.
The wooden size may change (varying lengths and widths) depending on the bee colony at your place� - small sizes are meant for medium colonies, while large sizes should be used to trap large bee colonies.</p>
<ul>
<li>The piece of wood should be built using softwood trees such as redwood, pine, or cedar.</li>
<li>Moreover, the selected piece should also be untreated with any chemical or unvarnished/unpainted (paint /varnish prevents carpenter bees from chewing the softwood).</li>
<li>Upon preparation, hang the piece of wood in an open place/exposed (Hunker suggests so) such that the carpenter bees can locate it easily.
The idea is that the carpenter bees will chew softwood and boreholes in it as many as the population is.
Once the entire piece of wood is fully nested, remove and relocate/dispose of it far away from your house. Re-install another piece of wood until the decoy gets rid of the entire carpenter bee infestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-use-preventive-measure-like-applying-wd-40">3. Use Preventive Measure Like Applying WD-40</h3>
<p>The use of preventive measures such as vinyl siding keeps off carpenter bees from your house.</p>

<li>By avoiding the use of wooden interior lining and instead substituting it with a composite or metallic counterpart; then, you will be a notch high in carpenter bees prevention.
Furthermore, keep carpenter bee repellant plants in your house/office or plant similar species in the compound.
In whatever situation, you must incorporate a defensive approach instead of killing the entire bee colony - have hardwood furniture that can&rsquo;t be chewed by carpenter bees.

<h3 id="4-making-noise---create-sound-vibrations">4. Making Noise - Create Sound Vibrations</h3>
<p>Loud noise scares carpenter bees away - they don&rsquo;t like the disturbances and sharp pitches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a piece of metal or wood, bang near the bees&rsquo; nest continuously - the sound vibrations will drive the bees away, one after the other.
You can opt to use an electric siren (within legal sound limit) connected and aimed at the carpenter bees&rsquo; nest/ hole - leave the device on for some time and inspect the nest later for effectiveness.
Repeat this after some time until the colony is removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-hang-wind-chime">5. Hang Wind Chime</h3>
<p>Windchime produces a sound that scares and drives carpenter bees away. All you need is to hang a wind chime freely near bees&rsquo; nests and leave the decoy to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the wind blows over the chime, it will cause it to vibrate, thus causing a sound that scares bees - this act makes them leave the nest completely.
In case your room has not enough wind flow, you can connect a fan near the chime to boost the air needed to cause sound vibrations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-use-almond-or-citrus-oil">6. Use Almond or Citrus oil</h3>
<p>The scent generated by almond or citrus oil repels carpenter bees away upon inhaling. Dilute either almond or citrus oil in a beaker.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle the liquid on the bees&rsquo; nest or pour it into holes bore on the wood. Leave the bees to escape at their own pace.
Later, inspect the nest and seal the holes with caulk or vinyl in order to attain initial aesthetic beauty.
You can mix the two solvents (almond and citrus oil) in order to boost scent concentration as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-painting-wood">7. Painting Wood</h3>
<p>Painting wooded structures is a sure way of getting rid of carpenter bees since paint forms a thin layer, which is cumbersome for bees to chew through.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, the scent generated by paint repels carpenter bees too.</li>
<li>When undertaking your paint works, it&rsquo;s advisable to coat your wooden surface with at least two paint layers.
Alternatively, you can apply varnish, which acts equivalently like paint too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-vacuum-the-bees">8. Vacuum the Bees</h3>
<p>A vacuum machine can suck carpenter bees from their nest without killing them, especially when the right suction velocity is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>All you need is to connect your vacuum machine to a power source and aim the suction pipe at the bee nest.</li>
<li>Press the switch button on and start vacuuming - the vacuum machine will suck the bees into the tray. Empty the live bees in the tray far from your compound.
NB: Avoid using too much suction pressure as it may kill live bees, especially baby bees.

</ul>
<h2 id="are-carpenter-bees-dangerous">Are Carpenter Bees Dangerous?</h2>
<p>Carpenter bees, just like other bees, are dangerous due to some of the following reasons:</p>
<h3 id="a-they-destroy-properties">a. They Destroy Properties</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees bore and chew wooden structures as they create their nest - this act weakens the entire structure, which eventually caves in.
Materials that are chewed by carpenter bees are usually challenging to repair and hence end up being disposed of.</p>
<h3 id="b-sting-and-harm-peopleanimals">b. Sting and Harm People/Animals</h3>
<p>When disturbed, carpenter bees sting and instill pain in both animals and human beings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, bees would attract the assailant as a group and sting severally - the stings cause swellings that may lead to death if not attended to immediately.</li>
<li>Unlike male carpenter bees, female carpenter bees are more violent when they sense danger lurking.
You should therefore be careful when getting rid of the carpenter bee colony in your place - wear protective gear.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-psychological-problems">c. Psychological Problems</h3>
<p>The mention or presence of carpenter bees infestation causes fears to many people as they generate a certain degree of phobia (melissophobia/apiphobia - fear of bees).</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, the situation is worse for those individuals that have ever been attacked by carpenter bees in the past.</li>
<li>Animal pets such as dogs and cats fear carpenter bees (apiphobia) in the vicinity - this could affect their normal psychological life.
Pets that have ever been attacked by carpenter bees bark loudly when they spot any carpenter bee in the vicinity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-attracts-carpenter-bees-into-your-place">What Attracts Carpenter Bees into Your Place?</h2>
<p>Unlike bumblebees, carpenter bees are attracted into your place by either of the following things:</p>
<h3 id="a-untreated-wood">a. Untreated wood</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees fly around searching for wood/location to create their nest - untreated wood is a possible item bees would stop infesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carpenter bees would chew woods to create channels (their hideouts) or bore sizable holes.</li>
<li>In addition, carpenter bees love an untreated stack of firewood, old fences, sheds, and decks among other structures.
Treating your wooden structures will go a long way in eliminating carpenter bees.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-old-carpenter-bees-nests">b. Old carpenter bees nests</h3>
<p>If your place has an old carpenter bee&rsquo;s nest, chances are that a new bee colony may come and settle there.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scent left in the old bee nest attracts passing bees, which end up colonizing and expanding the new nest.
It&rsquo;s always recommended that you destroy old carpenter bees&rsquo; nests as soon as they leave - you can throw the log/wood far away or seal holes with caulk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-flowers">c. Flowers</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees eat nectar and pollen (just like bumblebees) - they are therefore attracted by nectar-producing flowers in your place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flowers such as hibiscus, morning glory, sunflower, lavender, and banana flowers often attract carpenter bees in large numbers.
Since bees are a critical part of plant pollination, you need to uptake measures that will prevent them from creating a nest in the vicinity - you can grow repellant plants amongst flowers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-untreated-plank-ends">c. Untreated plank ends</h3>
<p>Often, carpenter bees boreholes at the end of the untreated plank and create a nest or tunnel inside.
For plank ends, it&rsquo;s advisable to treat them and terminate with metal flashing such as aluminum.</p>
<h3 id="d-unpainted-wood">d. Unpainted wood</h3>
<p>Paint or varnish prevents carpenter bees from chewing or boring through woods - the scent and tough coat layer keep them off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpainted wood is highly attacked by carpenter bees, especially those woods that are left in the open fields.
It&rsquo;s recommended that you coat wooden structures (which are made using softwood) with varnish or paint since they are more prone to carpenter bees infestation.

<h2 id="what-is-the-importance-of-carpenter-bee">What is the Importance of Carpenter Bee?</h2>
<p>Carpenter bees play a great role in every day to day life which includes:</p>
<h3 id="a-pollination">a. Pollination</h3>
<p>Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, carpenter bees step on pollen grains as they search for nectar in flowers. On the other hand, wings also rub against pollen grains and act as carriers.
Later, the pollen grains are rubbed against stigma as the bees get into the nectary gland to sip nectar.
Through this action, the flowers get pollinated. Carpenter bees help in both self-pollination and cross-pollination.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-source-of-food---honey">b. Source of food - Honey</h3>
<p>Carpenter bees produce honey as they excrete - this is food to both human beings and other animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>If well taken care of, carpenter bees could produce more honey, which can be of commercial value.</li>
<li>In this regard, you can cut softwood logs and lay them off in open fields (far away from human habitation) in order to attract carpenter bees there.
Alternatively, you can build carpenter beehives and hang them in strategic points.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-animal-feeds">c. Animal Feeds</h3>
<p>Animals such as birds like woodpeckers feed on carpenter bees - these are their main source of food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, badgers kill and eat carpenter bees just like mantises do.
As a direct source of food to other animals in the ecosystem, carpenter bees provide continuity in the food chain - support life longevity.

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, on how to get rid of carpenter bees without killing them, you can use a sweep net, install a sacrificial piece of wood, adopt preventive measures, or wait for bees to leave on their own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Making noise and hanging chime will scare carpenter bees completely while painting wooden surfaces prevents them from boring through.</li>
<li>More so, you can spray almond/citrus oil, knock off the bees from their nest, or vacuum the nest and release bees into open fields (far away from your home).
Proper protection gear should be worn when getting rid of bees - for personal safety. Furthermore, if you are new to the task, it&rsquo;s recommended that you contract a bee professional to help you out.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="details-how-to-get-rid-of-ground-bees">Details: How to Get Rid of Ground Bees</h2>
<p>The easiest method to eliminate ground bees is through chemical sprays labeled for ground bees, such as Spectracide.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-ground-bees-and-what-do-they-look-like">What are ground bees, and what do they look like?</h3>
<p>Unlike other wild bees that nest above the ground, ground bees have their residence inside holes conspicuous with the pile of dirt. Colletes inaequalis is one of the most common ground bees. All ground bees belong to the order Hymenoptera.
<strong>Quick Facts:</strong>
About 70% of the 20,000 bees species have their nests in the ground. However, apart from the honeybees, other types of honey bees leave their nests during fall.
Pollen bees are different from other honey bees that pack waxy combs. All the known pollen bees dig ground brood chambers and feed their subterranean young on bee bread, made up of pollen cakes combined with honey and other substances.
Ground bees, unlike other bees species, lead a simple life. They have no worker slavery, overstuffed queens, and no losing individuality.
To have a clear idea of how they look, check the Ground bees pictures below:
Many bees dig underground burrows. Therefore, it is essential to know the unique identifying factors for ground bees.
For example, Bumblebees also use an underground nest, but ones that are left by rodents.
Different from the operation of ground bees
, bumblebees exist as social colonies.
You can quickly identify if they operate as social colonies from a distance. Keenly check if the bees approach the ground nest in multiples or singles. However, be
safe when coming the nest
as the bumblebees as dangerous while defending their colonies.
Further, like Bumblebees,
yellow jackets
live in ground nests but also unoccupied rodent holes. However, ensure to know the difference between
wasps and bees
since some wasps also settle in ground nests. Therefore, approach the nest with caution without assuming that it contains harmless wasps.
**Caution: **
Do not attempt to kill the ground bees by pouring chemicals and gasoline in the ground nest. Such actions will kill both flora and fauna settled in that area.
The female ground bees dig a chamber in dry soil and would loose soil around it. Also, she provides nectar and pollen to the nest. Further, male ground bees fly over the conical dirt piles to check for potential mates.
<strong>Beneficial insects:</strong>
Ground bees fall under the beneficial insects class that play the pollination role. Although many ground bees species are not harmful, they are considered defensive and can harm humans or pets.
There are many wild and characteristically solitary bees. The wild bees are considered very important to the pollination of both domestic and wild plants. Ground bees are one of the wild bees that act as pollinators.</p>
<h3 id="size-and-color-of-ground-bees">Size and color of ground bees</h3>
<p>Ground bees have colors ranging from purple, red, blue, yellow, and black. They are about one inch long.
Ground bees have their mating season between March and May. Female bees in the colony of ground bees function as worker bees. The females dig burrows in the mating season, ready to fill them with eggs and bee bread.

<h2 id="are-ground-bees-dangerous">Are Ground Bees Dangerous?</h2>
<p>Male ground bees like
Carpenter Bees
do not have a sting! Mainly, the male ground bees are the ones that fly over the bee nest. However, male ground bees are very aggressive but will not sting.
On the contrary, female ground bees are not aggressive but can sting. Therefore, ensure that you will irritate them to cause them to initiate self-defense.
Therefore, ground bees will only sting if they are aiming to defend themselves and their colony. However, ground bee nests are as dangerous due to the chemicals that come with the bee sting.</p>

<h3 id="1-aphids"><strong>1. Aphids</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong>
Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects, usually green but sometimes yellow, brown, red, or black. They cluster on new growth, stems, and the undersides of leaves, sucking sap and weakening plants.
<strong>Damage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leaves curl, yellow, or stunt in growth.</li>
<li>Sticky honeydew secretion promotes sooty mold.</li>
<li>Can transmit plant viruses.
<strong>Control Methods:</strong></li>
<li>**Natural Predators:**Introduce ladybugs, lacewings, or parasitic wasps.</li>
<li>**Spray Treatment:**Use insecticidal soap or a mixture of water and a few drops of dish soap.</li>
<li>**Water Blast:**A strong spray of water dislodges aphids from plants.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-slugs-and-snails"><strong>2. Slugs and Snails</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong>
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/do-lizards-eat-snails/">Slugs</a>
are soft-bodied, while snails have a hard shell. Both leave slimy trails and chew irregular holes in leaves, often targeting young seedlings.
<strong>Damage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Devour tender leaves, stems, and fruits overnight.</li>
<li>Prefer moist, shady environments.
<strong>Control Methods:</strong></li>
<li>**Beer Traps:**Bury a shallow container of beer to attract and drown them.</li>
<li>**Copper Barriers:**Copper tape repels them with a mild electric charge.</li>
<li>**Handpicking:**Remove them in the evening when theyre most active.</li>
<li>**Diatomaceous Earth:**Sprinkle around plants to dehydrate and kill them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-caterpillars"><strong>3. Caterpillars</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong>
These are the larvae of butterflies and moths, usually green or brown, varying in size.
<strong>Damage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chew large holes or skeletonize leaves.</li>
<li>Some species bore into fruits (e.g., tomato hornworms).
<strong>Control Methods:</strong></li>
<li>**Hand Removal:**Pick off caterpillars and drop them in soapy water.</li>
<li>**Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt):**A natural bacteria that targets caterpillars without harming beneficial insects.</li>
<li>**Bird Attraction:**Encourage birds that feed on caterpillars.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-spider-mites"><strong>4. Spider Mites</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong>
Tiny, red, or yellow pests that create fine webbing on plants. They thrive in hot, dry conditions.
<strong>Damage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suck plant juices, causing stippling and yellowing leaves.</li>
<li>Severe infestations lead to leaf drop and plant death.
<strong>Control Methods:</strong></li>
<li>**Water Spray:**Blast plants with water to dislodge mites.</li>
<li>**Neem Oil:**Acts as a natural miticide.</li>
<li>**Predatory Mites:**Introduce Phytoseiulus persimilis to eat spider mites.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-whiteflies"><strong>5. Whiteflies</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong>
Small, white, moth-like insects that swarm when disturbed.
<strong>Damage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suck sap, weakening plants and spreading diseases.</li>
<li>Honeydew secretion leads to sooty mold.
<strong>Control Methods:</strong></li>
<li>**Yellow Sticky Traps:**Attract and trap adult whiteflies.</li>
<li>**Insecticidal Soap:**Effective against nymphs and adults.</li>
<li>**Natural Predators:**Ladybugs and lacewings feed on whiteflies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prevention-strategies-for-a-pest-free-garden"><strong>Prevention Strategies for a Pest-Free Garden</strong></h2>
<p>While controlling pests is important, prevention is the best long-term strategy. A healthy garden ecosystem naturally resists infestations.
