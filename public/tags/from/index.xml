dried <a href="https://pestpolicy.com/what-kind-of-paint-can-be-used-on-concrete/">paint from concrete</a>
surfaces can be cumbersome, especially when the wrong procedure is followed. Perhaps you need to restore your concrete with new paint and wonder how you can remove old paint. Can washing with soap clean all paint?</p>
<p><em>Summary: Here&rsquo;s how to remove paint from concrete - using a paint stripper, absorbent stripper method, trisodium phosphate, or soda blasting method such as on the driveway. In each of the following methods, you need to adhere to the correct steps and precautions to attain the best quality finish.</em>
<em>The decision of which paint removal method to use should be determined by the type of paint under a removal (is it acrylic or latex paint?). Besides, surface cleaning should be done sufficiently before any paint removal process begins to eliminate dust and debris.</em>
<em>Notably, the extent of surface area under paint removal is a factor that you shouldnt overlook as critical to cost implication. To acquire a more in-depth insight, let us get into the details.�</em></p>

<h2 id="what-are-homemade-methods-of-paint-removal-from-concrete">What are Homemade Methods of Paint Removal from Concrete</h2>
<p>Apart from the commercial method of paint removal from concrete, you can prepare your homemade paint cleaning strategy. Some of these include:</p>
<h3 id="1-using-ammonia">1. Using Ammonia</h3>
<p>Ammonia solution mainly removes latex paint (water-based sufficiently) without affecting the primary concrete material. Though the ammonium solution still works for oil-based paints, the paint removal effectiveness is a bit low.
To begin with, dilute the ammonia solution appropriately before applying it over the painted surface. Then, carry out a drop experiment to ascertain the effectiveness of paint removal over a given surface before the actual application.
Leave ammonium coated concrete surface for 10 to 15 minutes before scrubbing gently with a steel brush (to remove paint).
Then, wash the concrete surface with soap and water before rinsing with clean water to remove ammonia traces and paint debris.
Ammonium solution emits poisonous fumes, which irritates the respiratory system when inhaled  you should use a respirator during paint removal.</p>

<h3 id="2-using-soapy-detergent-and-brush">2. Using Soapy Detergent and Brush</h3>
<p>Soap detergents have a chemical formulation that breaks latex paint (water-based paint) instantly upon contact. Dilute soapy detergent sufficiently and apply over the painted concrete surface.
Leave the surface to cure for about 20 minutes before scrubbing with a brush to remove paint debris. Further, wash the surface with a cloth soaked in soap to achieve an excellent finish before rinsing with clean water.
Soapy detergent is the best method to remove wet paint over the concrete surface in painting error. However, dried acrylic paint cant be removed by soapy detergent.
Wear hand gloves during paint removal since soap irritates skin upon contact.</p>
<h3 id="3-use-of-alcohol">3. Use of Alcohol</h3>
<p>Alcohol is suitable for the removal of latex paint over the concrete surface. Apply alcohol over painted concrete and leave it for 10 minutes to cure. Using a scraper, remove that quenched paint gently.
You can also scrub the paint/stain using a steel brush  this is more suitable since it penetrates the concrete grain nicely without damaging the structure.
Wash the concrete surface with soap and water (remove alcohol traces) and rinse with clean water to wash out paint debris. Leave the surface to dry naturally.
Though alcohol is not poisonous to human health, inhaling may irritate non-user nasal cavity (wear a respirator during application).
NB: Highly concentrated alcohol may damage concrete during paint removal.</p>
<h3 id="4-heat-gun">4. Heat Gun</h3>
<p>The heat gun method is the best method for removing small paint section from concrete. Connect the
heat gun
to the power source and gently pass the heated air over the painted surface.
The heat breaks down the chemical bonds into a simple liquid state that can be scraped more comfortably. Scrub the paint off and wash the surface with water and soap before rinsing to dry.
Though heat gun works for latex paint, it should be used best for removing acrylic paint (oil-based paint) from concrete.
Heat gun requires a power supply; thus, it is an unsuitable method for remote areas. More so, this method is slightly expensive and requires a specialized heat gun user.</p>
<h2 id="precautions-to-take-when-removing-paint-from-concrete">Precautions to take When Removing Paint from Concrete</h2>
<p>To attain excellent paint removal from concrete, you will have to follow the precautions highlighted below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always clean the painted concrete surface before starting the paint removal process  it improves and eases paint removal.</li>
