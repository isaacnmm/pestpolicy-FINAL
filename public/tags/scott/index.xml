      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to <a href="/posts/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/">lawn</a> care, the name Scotts is almost synonymous with a beautiful yard. For decades, Scotts has been a household name, providing generations of homeowners with the products and knowledge to cultivate lush, green spaces. However, the company&rsquo;s journey has evolved, particularly in its approach to professional lawn care services.</p>
<p>This article delves into Scotts&rsquo; legacy of innovation, clarifies its past involvement in professional services, highlights its popular DIY product lines, and helps you decide between tackling lawn care yourself or hiring a pro, ultimately offering a recommendation for professional assistance.</p>
<h2 id="scotts-history-of-innovation">Scotts� History of Innovation</h2>
<p>The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company boasts a rich history spanning over 150 years, founded in 1868 by Orlando McLean Scott in Marysville, Ohio. Initially focusing on selling quality weed-free seed to farmers, Scotts soon recognized the burgeoning consumer market and began selling grass seed to homeowners in the early 1900s � a groundbreaking move at the time.</p>
<p>Scotts&rsquo; history is marked by several key innovations that have shaped the lawn care industry:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Retail Grass Seed:</strong> Scotts was the pioneer in making grass seed directly available to consumers through retail outlets, moving beyond mail-order.</li>
<li><strong>Turf Builder� (1928):</strong> This revolutionary product marked Scotts&rsquo; entry into lawn fertilizer, acknowledging that grass had unique nutritional needs.</li>
<li><strong>The Scotts Spreader (1930):</strong> Recognizing the need for even application, Scotts developed its own spreader, essential for consistent lawn care results.</li>
<li><strong>Research Division (1946):</strong> Scotts established the first commercial organization dedicated exclusively to turfgrass research, cementing its commitment to scientific advancement.</li>
<li><strong>Weed &amp; Feed (1947):</strong> A true game-changer, Scotts introduced the first selective weed control and fertilizer combination in a convenient, dry-applied form, simplifying lawn maintenance for homeowners.</li>
<li><strong>Controlled-Release Nitrogen (1956):</strong> Scotts developed a lightweight fertilizer designed specifically for grass, utilizing urea-formaldehyde technology for the first controlled release of nitrogen, minimizing burn risk and providing sustained feeding.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition of Miracle-Gro� (1995):</strong> This merger brought together two titans of the lawn and garden world, expanding Scotts&rsquo; influence beyond lawns into gardening.</li>
<li><strong>Roundup� Marketing Rights (1999):</strong> Scotts secured exclusive marketing rights for consumer Roundup herbicide products, further solidifying its presence in the chemical pest control market.</li>
</ul>
<p>These innovations highlight Scotts&rsquo; long-standing commitment to making effective lawn and garden care accessible to the average homeowner.</p>

<h2 id="scotts-lawnservice">Scotts LawnService</h2>
<p>For a period, Scotts extended its brand into the professional lawn care service arena through <strong>Scotts LawnService</strong>. This division was established in 1998, following Scotts&rsquo; acquisition of Emerald Green Lawn Service in 1997. Scotts LawnService operated as a &ldquo;do-it-for-me&rdquo; solution, offering professional fertilization, weed control, insect control, and tree and shrub care to homeowners who preferred to outsource their lawn maintenance.</p>
<p>However, the landscape of professional lawn care shifted significantly in <strong>April 2016</strong> when <strong>Scotts LawnService merged with TruGreen</strong>. This strategic move created the largest professional lawn care company in America. As part of the merger, all products and services previously offered under the Scotts LawnService brand were transitioned to the TruGreen brand. While The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company initially retained a minority ownership stake (30%) in the joint venture, they later sold this stake in <strong>2019</strong>, fully separating the consumer product brand (Scotts) from the professional service brand (TruGreen).</p>
<p>Therefore, while the Scotts name is still prominent in retail stores for DIY products, if you&rsquo;re looking for professional lawn care services that were once provided by Scotts LawnService, you are now looking for <strong>TruGreen</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="scotts-lawn-care-products">Scotts Lawn Care Products</h2>
<p>Despite the separation from its service arm, the Scotts brand remains a dominant force in the DIY lawn care product market. Their extensive range covers virtually every aspect of lawn maintenance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lawn Fertilizers:</strong> Scotts is best known for its <strong>Turf Builder</strong> line, offering various formulations for different grass types, seasons, and specific needs (e.g., Weed &amp; Feed, WinterGuard, Starter Fertilizer). They also offer natural and organic options.</li>
<li><strong>Grass Seed:</strong> Scotts offers a wide variety of grass seed blends tailored for different climates, sun exposure (Sun &amp; Shade, Dense Shade), and purposes (PatchMaster, High Traffic). Many seeds feature coatings to improve water absorption and germination.</li>
<li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> From <strong>Turf Builder Triple Action</strong> (fertilizer, weed killer, and weed preventer) to dedicated granular and liquid weed killers for broadleaf weeds or crabgrass (e.g., <strong>Halts Crabgrass Preventer</strong>), Scotts provides numerous solutions for weed management.</li>
<li><strong>Pest and Disease Control:</strong> Products designed to combat common lawn pests like grubs, ants, and chinch bugs, as well as fungicides for various lawn diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Soil Conditioners and Amendments:</strong> Offerings like gypsum and other soil improvers to enhance soil structure and nutrient availability.</li>
<li><strong>Spreaders:</strong> Scotts manufactures a range of granular spreaders (broadcast and drop spreaders) designed to work seamlessly with their bagged products, ensuring even application.</li>
</ul>
<p>These products are widely available at major retailers, home improvement stores, and garden centers, making them accessible for DIY enthusiasts.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="other-popular-scotts-products">Other Popular Scotts Products</h2>
<p>Beyond core lawn care, The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has diversified its portfolio to include a vast array of gardening and outdoor living products, largely through strategic acquisitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Miracle-Gro�:</strong> The iconic brand for plant food, potting mixes, and garden soils, known for its instant-feeding solutions for flowers, vegetables, and houseplants.</li>
<li><strong>Ortho�:</strong> A leading brand for pest control solutions around the home and garden, including insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides (e.g., Ortho Home Defense Max, Ortho WeedClear).</li>
<li><strong>Roundup�:</strong> Scotts holds the exclusive marketing rights for consumer Roundup herbicide products in many regions, providing non-selective weed control solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Bonnie Plants� (minority stake):</strong> One of the largest growers of vegetable and herb plants for home gardens.</li>
<li><strong>Hydroponics &amp; Indoor Growing:</strong> Scotts has expanded into the rapidly growing hydroponic and indoor gardening market with brands like Hawthorne Gardening Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>This broader portfolio establishes Scotts Miracle-Gro as a comprehensive leader in consumer lawn and garden solutions.</p>

<h2 id="lawn-care-diy-or-hire">Lawn Care: DIY or hire?</h2>
<p>The decision between doing your lawn care yourself or hiring a professional service is a common dilemma for homeowners, each with distinct pros and cons:</p>
<p><strong>DIY Lawn Care:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Cost-effective (you save on labor), complete control over products and timing, rewarding personal satisfaction. Modern DIY kits (like Sunday) simplify the process.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Time-consuming (requires regular effort), requires knowledge to diagnose issues and apply products correctly, upfront cost for equipment (mower, spreader, sprayer), potential for mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Professional Lawn Care (e.g., TruGreen):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Time-saving and convenient, expert knowledge and precise diagnosis of lawn issues, access to commercial-grade products and equipment, consistent results, often comes with guarantees (e.g., re-treatment if needed), handles complex issues like severe infestations or diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> More expensive than DIY, less direct control over product choices or application timing, service quality can vary by branch/technician.</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice ultimately boils down to your budget, time availability, comfort level with chemicals (if applicable), and how important a perfectly manicured lawn is to you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="our-recommendation-trugreen">Our Recommendation: TruGreen</h2>
<p>While Scotts provides excellent DIY products, for homeowners seeking professional, hassle-free lawn care, <strong>TruGreen</strong> stands out as our top recommendation. This is particularly relevant given its history as the former Scotts LawnService.</p>
<p><strong>Why TruGreen is Recommended:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expertise and Training:</strong> TruGreen specialists are highly trained (often PhD-certified) in turf science. They conduct a &ldquo;Healthy Lawn Analysis&rdquo; to diagnose specific issues unique to your lawn, soil type, and regional climate. This level of expertise surpasses what most DIYers can achieve.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Programs:</strong> TruGreen offers multiple tiered plans (e.g., TruHealth, TruComplete, TruSignature) that cover a full spectrum of needs, including fertilization, weed control (pre- and post-emergent), insect control, grub prevention, and aeration/seeding. They also offer a TruNatural plan for those preferring an organic-based approach.</li>
<li><strong>Professional-Grade Products and Equipment:</strong> TruGreen utilizes commercial-grade products and specialized equipment for precise and effective application, which are generally more potent and provide better results than retail products.</li>
<li><strong>Convenience and Time-Saving:</strong> They handle all applications on a scheduled basis, freeing up your time and eliminating the need to store chemicals or equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Healthy Lawn Guarantee�:</strong> TruGreen stands behind its service. If you&rsquo;re not satisfied, they promise to re-treat your lawn as often as needed between scheduled visits, at no additional cost.</li>
<li><strong>Nationwide Availability:</strong> With widespread operations across the U.S., TruGreen is accessible to a vast majority of homeowners.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="methodology-how-we-rank-lawn-care-companies">Methodology: How We Rank Lawn Care Companies</h2>
<p>Our recommendations for lawn care companies, including the selection of TruGreen, are based on a rigorous methodology that considers several key factors crucial to consumer satisfaction and effective lawn management:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Service Offerings and Plan Variety:</strong> We assess the breadth and depth of services, looking for comprehensive annual plans that address fertilization, weed control, pest management, and optional enhancements like aeration and disease control.</li>
<li><strong>Expertise and Training:</strong> We evaluate the company&rsquo;s commitment to scientific backing and technician training (e.g., certifications, agronomic support), recognizing that knowledgeable professionals lead to better outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Reviews and Reputation:</strong> We synthesize feedback from a wide range of independent review platforms (e.g., BBB, Google Reviews, consumer forums) to gauge overall customer satisfaction, common pain points, and service consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing and Value:</strong> We consider the average cost of services in relation to the inclusions, effectiveness, and the company&rsquo;s guarantees, aiming to identify providers that offer a good balance of cost and performance.</li>
<li><strong>Availability and Geographic Reach:</strong> National coverage is important for accessibility, but we also consider the impact of local branch management on service quality.</li>
<li><strong>Guarantees and Customer Support:</strong> Strong guarantees (like re-treatment policies) and accessible, responsive customer service channels are critical for consumer confidence and problem resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Practices:</strong> We also consider any stated commitments to environmentally friendly practices or organic options where available.</li>
</ol>
<p>By applying this comprehensive evaluation framework, we aim to provide unbiased and practical recommendations to help homeowners make informed decisions about their lawn care needs.</p>
