      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is important to go for a primer that will be compatible with your paint and the surface if you want a professional look - and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve reviewed the <a href="/posts/rustoleum-rust-reformer-review/">Rustoleum</a> Galvanized Metal Primer below.
If you are a pro, you will clearly understand the challenges of painting non-primed galvanized metal.�After drying, the paint easily peels off when subjected to adverse weather and direct sunlight.
<em>In brief: Rust-Oleum (e.g. Rust-Oleum 3202) removes rust easily by creating great�adhesion on galvanized surfaces and aluminum - it&rsquo;s also simple to clean using water + soap. But the surface must be prepared, cleaned - including spot-welded and unpainted sheet metal.�</em></p>
<h2 id="details-rustoleum-galvanized-metal-primer">Details: Rustoleum Galvanized Metal Primer</h2>
<h3 id="1-rust-oleum-flat-aluminum-primer-8781502---corrosion-resistant"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000C018C2/?tag=p-policy-20">1. Rust-Oleum Flat Aluminum Primer-8781502 - Corrosion-Resistant</a></h3>
<p>For the best Galvanized Metal Primer, the flat aluminum primer will be a great deal for you. W
hats fascinating about this primer is its resistant to corrosion and tough weather. This is to means that you can use it on both interior and exterior surfaces. It also works best on all galvanized steel and aluminum metals.</p>
<p>Being a water-based primer, it leaves behind both a protective and long-lasting coat that keeps your surface rust-free.
This is only achievable through the excellent adhesion that makes it hold strong for longer no matter the condition it is exposed to.
The gray color and flat finish will give your surface an incredible look. From its formulation, this primer has a low odor but that does not limit you from using protective gears when doing your spray.
This primer will take approximately 1-2 hours for it to dry and ready to touch. And one quart can cover a range of 55-90 square ft. but that depends on the
surface texture
.
Being a latex-based paint, it means you can use this primer on most surfaces that are incompatible with latex paints. Did I mention that this primer also helps make your surface withstand flaking and blistering and even prevents the paint from peeling off?
In case of spillage, you can easily clean-up the primer with water and soap without necessarily rubbing off the paint. You can use a brush, a roller, or a sprayer to apply this primer but you may need to do thinning if you want to achieve a professional finish.
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast drying</li>
<li>Has low odor</li>
<li>Suitable on aluminum and galvanized metals</li>
<li>Easy clean-up</li>
<li>Easy application</li>
<li>Compatible with both water and oil-based paints
Cons:</li>
<li>There are chances of the spray gun clogging if proper thinning of the paint is not done.

<h3 id="2-why-do-priming-on-the-galvanized-surface-before-painting">2. Why do priming on the galvanized surface before painting?</h3>
<p>As a painter, you can carry out the painting with or without priming and it will still hold, but how durable is it?
If indeed you want the paint to adhere to the galvanized surface well, then priming the surface will be very necessary.
Additionally, you may also need to clean-up the surface thoroughly from dust, rust, and any other dirt just for the primer to adhere well.</p>
<h3 id="3-prime--paint-aluminum-and-galvanized-metals-with-rust-oleum">3. Prime &amp; paint aluminum and galvanized metals with Rust-Oleum</h3>
<p>You can apply this primer by either
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-deck-stain-for-pressure-treated-wood/">spraying</a>
, brushing, or rolling. However, spraying remains the most appropriate method of application.
You can also find this primer in two forms either a spray can and in liquid form.
Before application, you may need to do thinning if you really need to achieve a professional finish. How do you do thinning? Well, a recommended ratio of 2:1 for primer and thinner respectively is advised.
In case you are using the spray gun, a 1.4 nozzle tip is the most appropriate if you target to achieve a professional finish.
You can use any thinning material but I can recommend you use acetone for much better results.</p>
<h4 id="i-cleaning-the-surface">i. Cleaning the surface</h4>
<p>Cleaning the surface is not necessary but driven by need.
For a surface with rust, old paints, dust, and other dirt cleaning are necessary for proper surface adhesion.
You can use sandpaper or any other cleaning agent and clean the surface before priming.</p>
<h4 id="ii-priming-the-surface">ii. Priming the surface</h4>
<p>As earlier discussed, a sprayer is the most appropriate for use in priming aluminum and galvanized metal surfaces.
To avoid clogging use a 1.4mm spraying nozzle tip and ensure the primer is well thinned before application.
Get a good sprayer that should be able to spray all patterns to minimize wastage of paints and primer.</p>
<h4 id="iii-painting-the-primed-dry-surface">iii. Painting the primed dry surface</h4>
<p>Getting the right paint for the primed surface is very important. This is because some paints might be incompatible with the primer and therefore rendering the whole process futile.
However, top of our recommendation is Rust-Oleum Flat Aluminum Primer-8781502 primer that is incredibly compatible with most paint whether water or oil-based.</p>
<h4 id="iv-painting-the-galvanized-and-primed-surface">iv. Painting the galvanized and primed surface</h4>
<p>When you have done proper priming,
<a href="https://pestpolicy.com/best-deck-sealer-for-pressure-treated-wood/">painting</a>
becomes an easy task for you, and you are only left with deciding the choice of color to go for.
A well-primed surface will pave way for easy painting with either a roller, brush or even a sprayer depending on the surface and your objective too.</p>
<h2 id="can-this-primer-work-on-any-metal">Can this primer work on any metal?</h2>
<p>This primer is specially designed for aluminum and galvanized metals.
To qualify the metals for application of this primer, you may need to galvanize the first for later priming.
Galvanizing the metals is done to make them rust-proof which makes all metals qualify for this primer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It has been a pleasure going through Rust-Oleum galvanized metal primer review together. I hope it was informative enough and has given you the courage to buy it.
With nearly 69% of metals recycled each year in the US and Rust-Oleum Flat Aluminum Primer-8781502 becomes a very great product to this effect.
You are guaranteed both durability and quality that gives you the confidence to use this primer.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ve reviewed the <a href="/posts/rustoleum-galvanized-metal-primer/">Rustoleum</a> Rust Reformer on its suitability for
rust repair</p>
<ul>
<li>so that you can now maintain your metallic tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the right product, you can prevent or duce surface or metal corrosion. So, Rustoleum Rust Reformer is mainly made of water and tannic acid - treating rusting through chelation.
The chelation process will make possible bonding (molecular level) of the tannic acid with your
rusted metals
. The process (tannin-metal bonding) results in a paintable and durable metallic surface.</p>

<h2 id="details-rustoleum-rust-reformer">Details: Rustoleum Rust Reformer</h2>
<h3 id="1-reduces-maintenance-time-and-cost">1. Reduces Maintenance Time and Cost</h3>
<p>Rustoleum Rust Reformer will reduce the effort, time, and cost - and you also won&rsquo;t have to purchase other metallic tools soon (lower replacement cost) as the one you&rsquo;re reforming will last longer.
Rustoleum will extend your tool&rsquo;s lifespan - including that of different machinery and equipment - and thus you&rsquo;ll get a better economic value.</p>
<h3 id="2-offers-better-metal-surface-protection">2. Offers Better Metal surface Protection</h3>
<p>Rustoleum won&rsquo;t damage the metal surfaces - but will on the contrary make your tools better. You&rsquo;ll touch-up or
even <a href="https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-paint-over-rust/">paint the metal surfaces</a>
easily - it&rsquo;ll be intact and safe.
The product will give a great primer layer on your metal tools, machinery, and equipment - and this will help reduce corrosion while also enhancing durability. of your metal.</p>

<h3 id="3-metal-surface-restoration">3. Metal Surface Restoration</h3>
<p>Rust development tends to create imperfections on the metal surface. Thus, using the Rustoleum rust reformer, you can hide the surface flaws and remove the rust.
Thus, for your metallic tools and DIY metal projects, you can use this reformer to restore the smoothness and integrity of the metallic surfaces.</p>
<h2 id="whats-thisrustoleum-rust-reformer">What&rsquo;s this�Rustoleum Rust Reformer</h2>
<p>Rustoleum Reformer is a coating (flat-black) that&rsquo;ll bond with the metallic surfaces that are rusty and hence reduces rusting - by simply spraying the surfaces - with no
sanding
.
Created in 1921 by a famous sea captain (Robert Ferguson), Rustoleum Reformer derived the inspiration from noticing that fish oil tended to perfectly repair deck rust.
So, Rustoleum keeps the metallic surfaces intact and safe - and you can readily touch-up or paint on the tools, machinery, or equipment - the primer layer increases durability and eases corrosion.
On Rust Reformer usage, just pour some Rust Reformer onto a container (non-metallic), then spray or brush the solution onto the rusted surfaces - creating a black coating in 15 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="suitable-features-of-rustoleum-rust-reformer">Suitable Features of Rustoleum Rust Reformer</h2>
<h3 id="1-easily-paintable"><strong>1. Easily Paintable�</strong></h3>
<p>Despite that it is not required,�Rustoleum Rust Reformer will leave a very paintable metal surface using your various
oil-based primers
or using other water- / oil-based paints.
On the quality of the resulting metal surface, you&rsquo;ll love that it&rsquo;ll be even and smooth. But this is highly dependent on the prevailing rust situations, and the spraying skills employed.
Therefore, Rust Reformer will reduce the chances of future rusting while also allowing different paint types to stick easily and leave a fine finish.</p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="2-fast-drying-time">2. Fast Drying Time</h3>
<p>Outright, the product manufacturer outlined that Rust Reformer has a very fast drying time - it&rsquo;ll dry into a black film within just 15 minutes of application subject to 50% relative humidity and 70F.
NB: Don&rsquo;t return the unused Rustoleum as this will contaminate the other material and hence reduce its effectiveness in repairing rust.
Compared to different available rust converters, Rust-Oleum offers drying time that relatively competitive - complete surface drying will require roughly 2 hours.
But you should give the surfaces a minimum of 24 hours to rest prior to painting - but this rises to about 48 hours when you have 2+ coats of rust reformer.</p>
<h3 id="2-highly-durable">2. Highly Durable</h3>
<p>You won&rsquo;t require to sand down the metallic surfaces - just spray down the Rust Reformer on the rust - it is corrosion-resistant, durable, and great for outdoor or indoor.
On durability, Rust Reformer is excellent and with just 2-3 coatings, you&rsquo;ll get great results - it is thus loved by many enthusiasts like the Ulti-mate Handiman and the Chaes Garage.
The repaired surfaces will have an amazing seal that&rsquo;ll allow the metal to remain pristine for roughly 3 months. But I would recommend that you paint a top-coat over this rust reformer.</p>
<h3 id="3-value-for-money">3. Value for Money</h3>
<p>Rust Reformer is a budget-friendly rust repair product that&rsquo;s loved by middle-class DIYers. Considering its great price-to-performance rating, Rust Reformer is a suitable deal.
The budget-friendly product comes out as a quality brand with long performance history. So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a classic, efficient, and popular Rust killer, get this Rust-Oleum.
I recommend using Rust Reformer for your small-to-medium rust repair projects but not suitable for commercial or larger projects as it may provide not cost-effective.
Luckily, with your acrylic or solvent-based paints, Rust Reformer will offer great durability on the excellent finish that&rsquo;s created from the created bond.</p>
<h3 id="4-lightweight-and-safe-design">4. Lightweight and Safe Design</h3>
<p>The compact and lightweight design allow one to spray evenly on their different metal surfaces. The container measures 2.5 by 2.5 by 8 inches while weighing 10.25 ounces.
The black-color finish may be used both in your
outdoor or indoor projects
covering about 15 feet square - considering coat numbers used - large surfaces may need 2+ Rust-Oleum containers.
On safety, Rust Reformer is safe to use on your various surfaces provided it&rsquo;s away from possible fire sources like naked flame or cigarettes.</p>
<h3 id="5-lesstoxic">5. Less�Toxic</h3>
<p>Rust Reformer uses tannic acid - which is less volatile and less toxic. This is unlike other rust reformers that utilize phosphoric acid for their chelation process - and thus are more harmful.
Despite that, you might not require to wear a gauze mask, get yourself
safety glasses
and rubber gloves while spraying the rust reformer - and keep some safe distance.</p>
